    "Had no storage in my main bathroom. This piece of furniture was perfect. It was easy to assemble, and it is a quality piece of furniture. I just love it. It stores more items than I even have! It would be perfect in a bedroom, too. Looks good and is solid. The glass doors are charming. I love this piece!", 
    "Purchased this as an extra storage space for the bathroom. Well made and easy to assemble", 
    "I loved this linen cabinet so much I bought a second one to match in another room. Well- constructed, lovely, fashionable. Pleasantly surprising.", 
    "I don't like put-together do-it-yourself furniture because it's often rickety. But this was really nicely built. It was easy to assemble. It's very sturdy. And it looks elegant in the bathroom...", 
    "Easy to put together and just the right size for our bathroom", 
    "This is so much nicer in person than the picture and is decent quality. This is a small cabinet, just over 2 ft wide, but the size fit really well in my small space. The glass is real rain glass and the finish is very nice. It was easy to assemble and I especially liked that the back is screwed on and has a center support instead of being cardboard that's put on with nails. The shelves are almost 14\" and perfect for my bigger bath towels. All in all I couldn't be happier with my purchase.", 
    "Very happy with this purchase- the cabinet was just as pictured and easy to assemble.", 
    "the glass doors are beautiful!! I put this on our master bathroom counter and it fits perfectly!! this piece is really nice.", 
    "This looks very nice, and pretty sturdy. However, mine came with only one interior shelf, which runs right across the glass in the middle, so you see it from the outside. I would have liked 2, like in the description.", 
    "Exactly what we thought it would be like works well in the bathroom", 
    "Its a cute cabinet, but I thought it was much bigger. I had to get rid of lots of stuff just to use it in my bathroom..kinda regret getting a see through glass. Can't see the item much but just seeing the stuff sitting on other side makes it not attractive. Would be great for towels or something like that.", 
    "great little cabinet, wish it had the options of a second shelf.", 
    "I was very happy to find this cabinet to be very sturdy and well made. The finish is very smooth and solid. This purchase was my first furniture from Overstock, but this inspired me to buy again!", 
    "The screws did not fit to install the two handles. Other than that, this cabinet is just ok!", 
    "This cabinet appeared much more desirable online than in person. It's cheaply made and I wish I hadn't purshased it. For the price it's not worth 1/2 the cost. Wouldn't buy!", 
    "This cabinet seemed to be a very high quality. It was easy to put together and everything lined up perfectly!!!!", 
    "Perfect cabinet for my bath. It is stylish and was easy to assemble.", 
    "The size and style fit perfectly into our bathroom and gave us the extra shelf space we needed.", 
    "This is very sturdy, goes together well, and looks great! The doors line up perfectly. It has a great amount of storage space and looks much more expensive than it is. I love it!", 
    "This cabinet is perfect for a kitchen or bath. It's solid, the glass doors look terrific, and it's easy to put together if you have some know-how. Just one thing...the hinges are not adjustable, and one of the doors on the cabinet I received rubs along the edge when it's opened or closed. A minor annoyance, but an annoyance just the same. I'd still recommend this cabinet.", 
    "We love this cabinet in our bathroom. It's a bit of an effort to put together, but actually easier than **** furniture because the pieces are labeled with stickers. We have a small bathroom, but this fits perfectly. The glass windows are lovely and hide the cabinet contents well.", 
    "The cabinet was easily constructed but the doors would not align no matter how many things I tried. There is a gap over one of the doors. Other than that the cabinet looks good and held all the things required but it's very annoying to look at the lopsided door.", 
    "Bought this for extra bathroom storage and its great. Not too terrible to put together and definitely is sturdy. Looks great and provides alot of extra storage. Love it!", 
    "This was easy to assemble except the glue part got a bit messy but easily cleaned up with a towel. I actually had fun assembling it as long as I had throughly read the instructions beforehand. Each part is labeled and the diagram, although of few words, is easy to follow. I did need help in attaching the doors for they are rather heavy."
