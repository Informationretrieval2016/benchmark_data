    "Ordered this bookshelf unit in spite of reviews that mentioned problems with notched shelves. Unfortunately, unit arrived with bottom shelf notch broken off. In addition, this same shelf was split from outer edge approximately 8\" toward the center of the shelf - a manufacturing flaw, since shelves are comprised of rough-hewn planks that are glued together. In the case of the bottom shelf, the planks were so bowed and misshapen that the glue could not/did not hold them together. E-mail sent to info@overstock.com produced a \"we've forwarded your inquiry to our parts department\" reply several days later. Waited a week with no response from the elusive parts folks before sending a second request to the \"info\" folks. Received the exact same response several days later from \"info\". \"Parts\" folks remain silent. In the meantime, I have a product that cannot be assembled or used. Because the bottom shelf serves as a significant structural component of the unit, I wouldn't even consider an attempt to repair myself to render bookshelf usable. I've been an enthusiastic and frequent Overstock customer for multiple years and this is the first order that has been problematic. I'm underwhelmed with customer service.", 
    "I bought these two 5-shelf bookshelves and the matching TV stand. I wanted an entire wall of rustic looking shelves for my newly remodeled living room but since rustic is the trend these days, rustic shelves have very expensive price tags ($1000 each isn't uncommon). At one point, I thought I would have to construct some shelves myself using reclaimed wood and iron plumbing pipe but luckily I came across these on Overstock. I had purchased the coffee table that is in this same collection and was very happy with it so decided to give these a go. The shelves are heavy wood and look like reclaimed barn wood (I don't think they really are but they certainly look like it). The top and bottom shelves are fixed with screws and the middle three have notches that allow them to just sit on the shelf rungs. The shelves are heavy so I don't see them going anywhere. The shelves are not adjustable. The placement you see in the picture is the only configuration possible. Also, one of the shelves was not completely straight so it rocks on the unit (like your dinner table does when one of the legs is longer than the others). I fixed it by putting a small shim under the shelf in one corner. Only one shelf out of ten did this and I don't think it's the norm. I also recommend that you attach this to the wall to prevent tipping. The shelf is heavy when it is put together and if it tipped over on a climbing child, it could really hurt him or her. The hardware to attach it to the wall t is included with the shelf. The wood is darker than is shown in the picture. It's actually a very dark brown. I have the feeling that the light the photographer used makes the wood look lighter than it is. The wood is also rough and not smooth (which is the rustic look I was after). One of the things I'm not that keen on is the metal support legs. They're not really heavy metal - they feel like aluminum with a powder-coated black matte finish. However, they do look good and are strong enough to support the shelves so I'll go with it. The other problem area were the X supports on the back of the shelf. You absolutely do need these because the shelves are ultra wobbly without them. However, the two supports cross each other in the back and you are supposed to screw the two together in the middle of the \"X\". The problem is that the manufacturer only gives you a screw to do this and no nut to put on the screw so the two supports don't stay together even with the screw. I had to dig a nut out of my own collection and use that on the screw. Otherwise, the two supports come apart. It doesn't effect the support of the shelf at all; it just looks untidy. The middle part where you screw them together is hidden behind the middle shelf so you won't see it.", 
    "Such a great sturdy piece of furniture. Super easy to put together. Only complaint was 2 pieces had chipped/broken off around the iron support rods. I just glued them back with gorilla glue and you can't even tell. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "Happy with the appearance, installation was easy on the first, complicated on the second unit. The top of the boards have a distressed look to them, the bottom of each board does not. Not a big deal but worth mention for those who care. I found the finish on bottom of the boards to look fine for the purpose. Should you receive the right pieces: When assembling, you will need to use a little pressure when screwing in the last leg of the the cross bars. Nothing to worry about as it flexes out a little, but not to bad. Nothing to it and the instructions are a step above ikea. (The wood finish is miles ahead of Ikea!) Our second unit did not come with a board marked \"D\". This is the bottom board, and is no different then the middle boards with the exception of some very important pilot holes. One board was unmarked (the \"D\" board by process of elimination). Because the boards do not fit snug to the frame (this is by design/not a bad thing) the installer is reliant on the pilot holes to ensure the board sits properly centered / flush with the frame. I believe I lined everything up, but find that when putting the units side by side, the bottom and top boards do not line up with the adjacent unit. Be aware of this if you are planning on putting multiple units side by side.", 
    "Love the rustic look of these shelves. Everything arrived in perfect condition, shelves are thick and solid. No breakage at the corners as several other reviews stated. My husband was very happy at how quickly and easily he was able to put them together (he usually gets very frustrated with things I buy that have to be assembled). I love the space between shelves. I have our granddaughters toys in bins on the bottom 2 shelves which keeps them out of site between their visits. My projects are in bins on the upper shelves and there is still plenty of room for decorative items as well.", 
    "This is one great looking piece. I wasn't prepared for how great it would be. I felt like we got a big bang for our buck! O comes through AGAIN", 
    "Love the look and quality of these bookcases. Works beautifully in our home office.", 
    "Not too bad to assemble, didn't realize there was some distressing along the front of the shelves, it's along some of the edges, and at first I thought they had been damaged. Overall a nice clean look, shelves are a nice gray and they are big enough to display quite a bit, put one on each side of our fireplace and they look very nice!", 
    "This is a study and attractive bookcase. I have no fears of it toppling and it looks brand new a year later.", 
    "The finish on the wood is too contrived. It doesn't look like real wood. The gray finish isn't the best. I would go for a difference finish.", 
    "It took me a while to get these shelves up due to a renovation I was doing. In the process, I misplaced the hardware. I contacted Overstock and was so impressed by the willingness of the company to rectify my problem. I LOVE the shelves. They are beautiful and have a classy look. I also continue to love Overstock for the best customer service I've ever experienced from a company!", 
    "Very pleased! Easy to assemble.", 
    "This was easy to assemble, looks great and holds lots of books. A great addition to our living room", 
    "Very easy to assemble and looks fantastic to display all of my glass bowls and cut china and other glass things that don't quite fit in cabinets.", 
    "Easy to put together and awesome reclaimed look!!!", 
    "Its easy to assemble, the shelves are sturdy and wide. The height of the bookcase makes the shelving unit a bit tippy, but not dangerous. I have not anchored it to the wall yet, Im hoping I dont have to anchor it. If there were children in the house it would have to be anchored to the wall. It looks great--I grouped 2 of these tall units with the media stand and it really looks great along a long wall in the study.", 
    "Very sturdy. We have the tv stand too, classy. Just Love", 
    "Excellent fit for my home office!", 
    "The package was very heavy and hard to move alone, but I was able to put this together by myself in about an hour with no problem. It looks great and is sturdy and stable.", 
    "I normally don't write reviews, but this bookcase is just beautiful. It's rustic, industrial and classic. It fits well in my modern/traditional home. It was easy to put together and looks great in my living space. I would highly recommend it.", 
    "High quality. Beautiful wood.", 
    "Solidly made, good materials, looks great, serves it's purpose.", 
    "I have two of these side x side to fill a kitchen alcove and they are awesome. Strong odor when first open box, but it dissipates after a few hours. I'm really happy with them.", 
    "I have never ordered furniture online before, but was very satisfied with shipment. It was packed very well. One small problem was that there were no drill holes in top shelf, but my husband took care of that.", 
    "Gorgeous... very quick and easy to put together.", 
    "This book shelf is wonderful. The shelves are very wide and sturdy. The assembly was easy!", 
    "Made in China, so do not expect rigid quality control (maybe in electronics, but not furniture), but overall a great looking product for the price. Shelving has great capacity (shelf depth), is NOT particle board. and steel frame is stable. Assembly was quick and simple, but I found it more practical to deviate from the assembly instructions.", 
    "I bought this shelf for my kitchen of all places and it looks simply chic as a contrast to my antique white cabinets. I filled it with some bright colored bowls, platters and picture frames. It was so easy to put together and is sturdy. I love it!", 
    "Looks good and is ver sturdyu", 
    "Very easy to assemble. I put it together without help except to get the boxes moved into the hallway. It looks awesome in our open floor plan home. Our office is positioned near the entrance to our home and is one of the first rooms you see. The furniture is sturdy and lovely to look at as well. We get compliments every time someone new visits! The only inconvenience is the packing material.....our waste management company does not like styrofoam...", 
    "As others have noted, the framework and wood is much darker, but I actually like it more. The instructions were minimal in the extreme. Assembly is a two-person job and easy so long as you remember to align both frames with the strap screw holes to the same side. Also, screw the straps with the flat side to the metal frame. We couldn't figure out how to anchor the support cross straps. It doesn't have a tap screw, and the screw provided is too long to just be for the straps themselves. They are super sturdy, but they need to be anchored to the wall (anchor provided).", 
    "The top piece of wood is crooked.1.5 inches thick on one end and a half inch thick on the other. Extremely noticeable. I just moved and ordered this awhile ago and just now unpacked it. Now to have to deal with getting one piece replaced- a total pain for what I paid for it. I don't have any boxes to repack and ship back", 
    "love this piece! Super easy construction & it looks amazing! Perfect!", 
    "As someone else mentioned, the style is nice but be forewarned that the piece is rickety. The shelves just rest on the side bars with nothing much holding them in place. One of our shelves arrived broken but I glued it instead of dealing w sending it back. That said, it's a great price for the style but you'll definitely want to anchor the piece to the wall if you have kids or pets around.On the downside, pieces are SO smelly. I am guessing it was the stain? The directions to assemble are ridiculous and backwards. The rear X's are step 4 but really you need to check before you build the unit that your rear vertical pieces face the correct way in order to get the X's in. Also, several of the pieces didn't have predrilled holes. First of two took us about 90 minutes to put together but the second took about 30 min. Before you actually assemble it, walk through all of the steps.", 
    "I have previously purchased other matching pieces and this is a wonderful addition. Price is great. Assembly is easy. Finished product is solid and physically appealing. Highly recommend", 
    "This is a great bargain piece of furniture that gives a great overall impression, meaning it looks more expensive than it is. However it definitely is rustic in quality as well as appearance. Certain aspects of quality aren't so great. For example the wood screws don't stay in the bottom shelves very well, in fact two fell out already, and we had problems with the metal supports in the back (they were too long for the holes they were supposed to line up with). One board was cracked. Overstock took care of us on both issues, sending a replacement shelf and supports. With these fixes we're very happy with our purchase!", 
    "I had looked at similar shelves which were much more expensive. This is is perfect for my space and my pocketbook! Love it!", 
    "Other than being a little more wobbly than I would like, this bookcase is beautiful!", 
    "Color me shocked! Looks high-end! Good value - hubby used a drill to assemble and it took hardly any time.", 
    "I like this bookcase very much. It looks great in my space and the shelves are very deep. I had trouble with the X bar in the back but it stands pretty steady.", 
    "The product was very easy to assemble. The dark rustic wood shelves look great against our brick walls. We were hoping the metal was more solid.", 
    "I was hesitant to buy such a large item online but was assured by the other reviews. This is a beautiful bookcase. The shelves are solid wood and have a lovely distressed look (but not overly so). It is sturdy and very easy to put together. One shelf is a bit warped due to the style but my husband just put a little bumper under it so it didn't wiggle. Very beautiful and I am very happy with my purchase!", 
    "bought this on sale and i am so happy i did. the only thing is it is not as sturdy as i thought it would be (shifts if you apply pressure to it on one side with nothing on it), however it sturdy enough and serves it's purpose once it's filled with decor and such.", 
    "Love the look of it and it is actually very sturdy!", 
    "This just arrived today and every single shelf was broken. There needs to be better quality control and packaging. It's amazing that every single shelf has a broken piece, it takes effort to be that terrible.", 
    "I ordered this bookcase to display my scrapbook albums on. The height in between each shelf is more than ample to store our large albums. It's a very versatile look, as it combines rustic with a touch of modern. It fits in perfectly with our desk and decor. It's very sturdy and is holding a lot of weight, which tells me it's definitely a quality product. I highly recommend if you are considering purchasing it.", 
    "I ordered these shelves after spending lots of time online looking. I decided on these because of the style and price. The boxes they arrived in are huge, and it actually took me more time to unpack the boxes than assemble the actual shelves. I assembled the shelves in about 15 minutes each all by myself. I have small children so I attached the anti tip brackets and ties, but actually hid them along the top shelf and you can't see them at all. Overall, I am extremely happy with the shelves and the style looks great. I think they look more contemporary than industrial modern. For the price you can't beat the quality and look. I think the quality and assembly are better than other big box retailers I have tried. This was the first time buying furniture from Overstock and the process was very easy and the shelves are perfect.", 
    "I shopped for shelves on what seemed like hundreds of sites for weeks. I wanted to stay under the $$$ budget and attempt to get somewhat decent quality (fully aware it would not be *********** *********). I am pleasantly surprised with these shelves. They are nice looking, sturdier than expected and were easy to assemble. They were together in less than 1 hour. overstock shipping is obviously reasonable and so fast there a no complaints in that department. Overall I am very pleased. I wish there was a matching desk in this grouping.", 
    "Very happy, sturdy...nice quality", 
    "Love the industrial look, along with additional pieces desk, etc. with a feminine touch of gold desk assessories as well as decor pieces. awesome look!!! Great quality for the price.", 
    "an unbelievable piece of furniture for the price! shelves are deep and perfect for a number of books/decorations.very happy with the purchase and it came in 3 days!!", 
    "Great bookcase! Beautiful and sturdy! I just bought a second one!", 
    "We have these for quite a while and they look great. A bit tough to dust as they have a rustic finish on the wood but really are easiest cleaned while using your vacuum. They were twice the price we paid at our local store.", 
    "Brings character to the room and fits so much! I get compliments on it all the time. Easy assembly", 
    "My wife and I bought this for use as a bookcase and it holds the weight very well. Nice look and well built. 2 of the shelves were broken at the corners (looked like shipping damage due to the condition of the box) but Overstock worked with Tribecca and got use replacements at no additional cost. Overall very satisfied.", 
    "This is a very nice looking bookcase but had some real quality issues. There were no pre-drilled holes for assembly -- not that holes were hard to drill because the wood of the shelves is incredibly soft. However, not having the holes pre-drilled put a bit of guess work into assembly that did not need to be there and it took several tries to get it lined up right. The wood of the shelves is so soft that when I slid one of the shelves into place, the small tab that results from the cut-out for the shelf side pole snapped off. Like I said the wood is incredibly soft -- I am using this in a rustic laundry room for storage and it had exactly the look I wanted --so I just glued the broken piece back on. But for the price paid, the quality was disappointing and it will be interesting to see how the shelves hold up under weight.", 
    "The bookshelf looks great albeit the legs are clearly not rustic or industrial. The wood shelves fit perfectly and it was a breeze to put together on my own in about twenty minutes - ten minutes of that time was dedicated to removing it from the enormous box and separating it from the packing material. It was missing one screw but I improvised from what I had in my tool chest.", 
    "Great rustic bookshelves. The only problem I had was that two of the shelves came damaged and overstock send us new ones. Great service!", 
    "I am using this bookcase to hold approximately 800 albums. The shelves do not sag, it is very attractive, and super easy to assemble. Have bought two other products in the same line of furniture and they are the same. Really good quality and great price.", 
    "When the massive box arrived I was terrified. But no fear- it was mostly protective packaging & was in perfect condition. All the hardware, instructions & pieces were intact & I knocked this baby together in under 10 minutes. If you are looking for an attractive, affordable bookcase - you have found it!", 
    "We ordered this to store various items in our kids \"play\" room. It arrived damaged and was unusable. Looking at the construction, I can't believe that more than about half of these arrived undamaged. On top of that, it really is quite ugly (IMHO), with sort of fake weathered looked wood finish.", 
    "I love the industrial look of this bookshelf, but I am not using it as a bookshelf. I wanted to used it in my dining room for display of Pots and Pans and Small appliances such as Silver Bread Machine, Vitamix, Dishes, Plants, Cookbooks, etc. Looks sensational. Highly recommend to all. It really holds a lot and did exactly what I wanted by extending my kitchen into my dining room. Wish I could add a picture!", 
    "I was concerned about purchasing this particular one because of all the comments about how \"rustic\" it is, and we have a modern home. I went for it anyway, and it fits in beautifully with everything modern as well because of the very simple lines and open shelving. Love the heft of this too -- great quality. Took us maybe 15 minutes to put together. Great purchase!", 
    "I am a decorator and put this in the home of a client. The client loved it!", 
    "Ordered this piece for my city apartment. It looks great, easy to put together. Looks more expensive than it is!", 
    "This unit looks awesome, and I was especially happy when I was able to put it together after receiving two broken shelves. I called overstock and they took my concern quickly, however manufacture took almost two weeks to send new pieces. It was easy to assemble and I love it.", 
    "After receiving my first book shelf I fell in love with these and ordered three more for my home. They are beautiful and great quality for the price.", 
    "Just got two of these shelves and LOVE THEM. They were incredibly easy to assemble, the wood is solid and heavy. The metal is NOT as heavy as it looks, which actually is a good thing in my opinion or else the unit would be too heavy. They could get bent if you were very rough with the piece. Great rustic finish to the wood as well. One thing to note when you are assembling the metal pieces is that the X wires attach into small holes drilled into the black metal pieces... make sure you have those holes facing out the back of the piece so that you can attach the X wires to them. Didn't do that on the first one and had to backtrack and reassemble. Can easily assemble these right out of the box in 20 mins or maybe even less. The biggest thing I did not like about this piece is that there was a VERY strong smell of varnish or lacquer to the wood when it came out of the box, and it took a good 4-5 days before that smell dissipated. It did go away, but it REALLY was strong initially. FYI. However, now the smell is gone and it was totally worth it! I would purchase these again.", 
    "We really like the bookcase, but we had to glue a few pieces back on it before we assembled it. I'm not sure whether it was the packaging or the handling, but the little pieces on the corners of the shelves broke off. Once we glued them back they looked great.", 
    "We were pleasantly surprised with these shelves. Sturdy and attractive. So pleased that we purchased the 3 piece desk set and the side table to match. Gives our library a nice casual industrial feel and proved ample space for books and decorative items. Great purchase!", 
    "I looked for months for just the right bookshelves for my small office. I even ordered another bookcase from Overstock that unfortunately didn't match the online description. Finally, my patience paid off and this beautiful piece showed up. It was very easy for 2 people to assemble and is really sturdy. The wood is finished but has a nice natural look to it. My books and other decor look great. I highly recommend this item.", 
    "Nice bookcase you would love it get the coffee table too", 
    "Nice look, very convenient for large books (pretty deep shelves) and decorative objects. A contemporary \"countryside\" look that fits our city apartment. The strange smell does disappear in a few days. No bad surprise, we recommend and are considering buying a second one.", 
    "I was quite pleased with the overall look of these shelves--they were an affordable option in my hunt for industrial chic pieces for our family room. They were easy to put together and look even better in person than on the site! However, as bookshelves, I quickly realized they are quite inefficient. With no back or sides, books fall over and slide around without bookends or creative vertical and horizontal arrangement. Each shelf is also too deep and too high for even large books, wasting quite a lot of space. Notches are cut in each shelf allowing the metal posts to fit snuggly and unfortunately they arrived with many of the notched ends broken off or cracked. I realize the joints of those tiny bits of wood are unavoidably weak but extra care should have been taken to protect them in shipment. If I had purchased the shelves from a retail store in my area, I would have exchanged them for new pieces. But the hassle was too great for this order, so we opted to clamp and glue. Overall, I do not regret this purchase and love the look! After quickly realizing how difficult it is to get books to stand upright alone and how much space is wasted, I plan to use them for both books and other decorative supporting pieces. If you are looking to furnish a library, I would not recommend these, but for a great affordable industrial chic look, they're a great buy.", 
    "I ordered 2 units, both arrived with broken wood shelves and had to be returned.", 
    "This was the first time in our history ordering from over stocks. The top shelf was dented and the bottom shelves the notches fell off in our hands while putting it together. I called overstock and the were exceptional in replacing the broken shelves. Now the book shelf looks as good as the picture and we are very pleased."
