  "reviews": [
    "This bookcase was just what I was looking for to complete my home office. It is not overwhelming in size and fit my wall perfectly. The quality was amazing and the price was reasonable. One of the best features was the little notched out area on the back of the bookcase so it could fit up tight on the wall and the notch fit around the floor molding.", 
    "It came, I assembled it, I put books in it...life is good.", 
    "Odd way of putting it together made it a bit unstable. OK once it was moved into place", 
    "Great for the price. Arrived very quickly after ordering. A bit heavy to lift (though made of composite/pressed wood, cardboard backing) and requires a bit of patience to assemble. We ordered three, and they fit the space and our needs perfectly--lots of shelf space while still narrow and streamlined. Very happy with the purchase!", 
    "This is very nice. I use it in my bedroom because I have so many books that need a home. It's sturdy and took only a few minutes to put up. I am a novice.", 
    "this shelve is very useful, excellent", 
    "This worked out to be the perfect size. Love it!", 
    "good quality, easy to assemble... very happy with the bookcase", 
    "I use this for my daughters vhs tapes and it's still not big enough but it works", 
    "Love this bookcase. Fits snug to the wall, very sturdy, nice quality. Deep shelves", 
    "Exactly as described - I would recommend this", 
    "Exactly what I expected. Good value for price", 
    "The materials that make up is bookcase are the cheapest possible. The round things that join the wood is plastic and difficult to turn, they should be metal. The wood is made of saw dust glued together to make what you present as a wooden board. I pulled the round thing out of the side when I turned it over or I would have returned it."
