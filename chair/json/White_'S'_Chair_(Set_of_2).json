    "My daughter fell in love with the Panton \"S\" chair, but I didn't want to spend that much on a chair for her desk - found these on \"O\" and got 2 for less than the price of 1 Panton chair. It is very comfortable, and actually rocks a little. Looks great with her barnwood and metal desk - the old with the very funky, love that look. I would not buy these for my dining chairs - they are better looking from the front and side - the back is not as attractive, it has some supports that are not as sleek looking, it is not ugly, just not as sleek. Overall I am very happy with the purchase, quality, and price - and she absolutely loves it. They were shipped quickly in good packaging, no damage and no assembly. Great for a teenagers room, or anywhere you want a modern splash - would work great in a bedroom to relax in since it does have some rocking motion.", 
    "I absolute love these chairs. I hesitate to order furniture online...I am so happy I ordered them. I felt they were well priced...the quality is better then I expected. I would highly recommend them to anyone. I get so many compliments on them. Def. the center piece of my dining table.", 
    "I found this product and several very similar chairs from other manufacturers all at much higher prices than you find on Overstock. I purchased two sets of two chairs, and one of the four came in less than perfect condition. It was a bit dirty, had a small stain that looked like a dirt smudge, and had a small scratch or two. Overstock customer service did a great job at addressing it. Buy and enjoy!", 
    "I absolutely love these chairs! I bought two for my studio and they are just what I wanted.", 
    "Great quality, easy to clean, look great with my round table, lightweight easy to move around, very comfortable.", 
    "I would love to have a set of genuine Panton Vitra S chairs but its not in my budget so I opted for these. They are really quite comfortable and look killer with my small parsons dining table. My girlfriend initially hated them but changed her mind after a few dinners sitting in them. Yes they are sexy. Drawback- the finish quality leaves a lot to be desired. Yes, that are painted, but it looks like a cheap spray can job with lots of bumps and surface imperfections. I could probably improve on the job by resanding and shooting them after they get a bit of mileage on them. Overall, they will hold me until the funds are there for the real deal. As for overstock? Great service all the way!", 
    "Bought these for designing a real estate office in a young, hip neighborhood. Great looking. More comfortable than you would think. My 220 pound husband even thought they were comfortable. Should be low maintenance as they can be wiped clean. Bought one set then immediately got a second set. Love 'em."
