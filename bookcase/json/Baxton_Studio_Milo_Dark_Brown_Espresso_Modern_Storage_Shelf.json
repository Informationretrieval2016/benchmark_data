    "I love this bookshelf it fits great in my bedroom", 
    "Very Elegant and good in any kind of living room as stand alone peace!", 
    "I looked everywhere for what I considered to be the perfect wall unit or shelving unit for our living room. I almost decided to have one made to my specs, but then I found this unit. It's the perfect size and has such a contemporary look to it. It's perfect! We've had it for quite a while now and it's still just as perfect! Very easy to put together. I did it one night in about 20-30 minutes by myself.", 
    "This is a bery noce and modern piece of furniture. I am happy with my purchase!", 
    "It looks exactly like the photo, sturdy and it was easy to put together.", 
    "Although the shelf was a bit smaller than what I had anticipated (the picture made it look grander than expected, but I should have looked at the dimensions more closely), it is a wonderfully designed shelf that uniquely displays my natural history collection. The set up took awhile with its many parts, but the instructions are good. The only flaw I see is the quality; one of the edges started chipping away even though the shelf is placed in a low foot traffic area. Despite this, the shelf is great with its complex yet clean design.", 
    "Perfect addition to our room. Super stylish. A great place for displaying your collections."
