    "First, it took 3 shipments of sets of two (6 racks) to get two that were not broken upon delivery. The shelves are too small for my sneakers/tennis shoes. Probably good for kids' shoes in the front closset n some flip flops of mine", 
    "What an exceptional cabinet. Great quality for a low price that I couldn\u2019t find anywhere else. Highly recommend for quality and value.", 
    "This is a very nice looking cabinet. It stores our shoes perfectly and was easy to assemble. Good quality construction, especially for the price. Would recommend."
