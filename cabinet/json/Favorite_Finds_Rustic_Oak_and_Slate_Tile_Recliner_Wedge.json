    "After we bought mission-style recliners we needed tables and since we have the chairs angled toward each other slightly, a wedge shape was what we sought. After our order came and I assembled it, we liked it so much we ordered another! The height is just right, the wedge is perfect, the style can pass as mission-style, the slate insets (which are not real obvious) look great with our slate-like tile floor. They are sturdy and well-built. Thanks, Overstock!", 
    "I love this different looking table. It wasn't hard to put together (or so he said :), it's quite heavy and totally sturdy. No wobble on a wood floor like some other furniture. We use it by the recliners usually, but needed a small table to go by a guest bed and it's been serving well in that bedroom for a couple of days. I later saw it online at a large dept store for **** more! Great buy and I highly recommend it.", 
    "Well made. Unique one of a kind look. Well made. Real wood, Easy to put together. Fits perfectly in the corner of the room Second piece I bought from this collection. Loved the table so much looked around for a place to add another piece.", 
    "Nice wedge shape between chairs. Slate inserts add a touch of interest and subtle change of color and texture. Assembly was not hard and the components fit together well. I'm glad I bought the pair.", 
    "Color and shape was exactly what I was looking for. Shipped fast. Thanks!", 
    "This was easy to put together, heavy duty and very nice looking.", 
    "Between a recliner and loveseat. Not too much table--just right!", 
    "This table is good looking, sturdy & fits in tight spaces. We love it. It has help well for us and looks great.", 
    "I bought this table because it was advertised as pre-assembled but when it arrived, assembly was required. I am not adept at furniture assembly so I never buy online if assembly is required. Nevertheless, I will try my hand at putting it together because it seems to be good quality and fits the space I bought it for. Just a cautionary word to other little old ladies who don't want to take up carpentry or break their nails.", 
    "Had been looking for a table to go between sofa & lounge chair, so when I found this I was very excited. We are very pleased with the table, good looking, sturdy and blends in with our other furniture. So glad I found it on Overstock.com.", 
    "Very well built and beautiful end table that fits in a corner or for the perfect angle between a couch and chair. The color and tile is a definite plus.",

    "This table is sturdy, beautiful, and easy to put together. I would buy other tables in the set.", 
    "I looked a long time for a small table to fit into a reading area we have.This is perfect. I like the wedge shape and also the tiles to make it look more expensive then it was.",

    "Arrived fast, well packed, very sturdy, easy to assemble, and mostly made out of wood. Nice item.", 
    "This table is a great addition to our living room. It is well made and absolutely beautiful. The slate insets are so pretty and blend in well with the rest of our furniture. The wedge shape works great between our couch and recliner. We are pleased with both the quality and the beauty!", 
    "Very versatile small table that fits almost anywhere that you want it to go. Nice style and attractive wood finish. Great buy", 
    "looks great very easy to assemble quality product would definitely recommend it", 
    "I was looking for a table to go between the end of my couch and my lounge chair. As my couch is parallel to the wall it is against and my lounge chair is angled in the corner, I thought this wedge table would be perfect. Unfortunately, I had in mind an asymmetrical wedge where the back and the left side of the table are at right angles and the right side is angled. I was disappointed to find that the table is a symmetrical wedge, therefore if I line the left side of my table to the couch, the back of the table is angled away from the wall. My fault, I should have known better. Other than that, the table is attractive and the photos of it are true. It came packaged perfectly and in good condition and was very easy to put together with the allen wrench that was provided along with the hardware.", 
    "Much more than I expected. A beautiful piece of furniture and fits perfect next to my husbands recliner", 
    "Is very nice looking. I used as end tables as my couch is on a cove type wall.", 
    "We bought 2 of these to use beside each of our easy chairs in the living room. They are very nice, very sturdy and very good quality. They are also very easy to put together -- less than 30 minutes for both!!!!", 
    "Fits well with recliner. True to color", 
    "A perfect thin table for a second floor hallway. So easy to put together!", 
    "great little table, very sturdy and easy to put together", 
    "One of the tile at the back of the table did not fill the space it was meant for. Overall a nice table except for that flaw. Seems sturdy and not hard to assemble.", 
    "Just as it appears. Fits perfectly in the space between two chairs. Easy to assemble.", 
    "This table is just beautiful and strong. It matches all my other furniture perfectly.",

    "This is well made and perfect between recliners. A wedge table is just what I have been looking for. Beautiful wood.", 
    "Great item . Fits perfectly between two lounge chairs. It is very sturdy and came in excellent condition", 
    "Needed something to set next to my hubbie's rocker/recliner and this was the perfect solution. Very sturdy..", 
    "Looked for a table to sit between two lounge chairs. This one fits the bill. Very easy to put together and a great looking table. Just the right size for TV remotes and some magazines on the lower shelf", 
    "Was very satisfied with this table. Fits perfectly between my two recliners.", 
    "As reported by others this is great beside my recliner. My skills for screws and bolts are not the greatest but I was able to assemble without too much time and trouble. Really like the style - slate shows well.",

    "Good quality for the price, looks great with the Christopher Knight club chairs I got", 
    "The table is made well with a rustic finish that the picture accurately portrays. Easy to put together...they include the small allen wrench needed (that was the only tool required). The table is heavier than I thought it might be and is very sturdy. It fits well between two recliners. In fact, I liked it so much I bought a second one to go on the other side of one of the chairs but turned it around so that the wide end was in the front. That made it sit parallel to the wall as well as accommodating the angle at which the recliner sits. I was amazed at the speed of delivery...ordered it late in the day on a Tuesday and received the chair by mid-day on Thursday.", 
    "Bought two of these to sit on either side of the couch. Nicely made. Easy to assemble. I love them.", 
    "Love this table. Perfect between our recliners. Looks beautiful.", 
    "Love it! Beautiful piece of furniture. Only wish there was a matching coffee table.", 
    "Love this table. I bought it to put between two swivel chairs and it works great because of the design of the table, narrow in the front and gradually widens out. Perfect height and allows turning of the chairs towards each other. The slate inserts under the top really give it a great look. My end tables have the slate on top, so they go together perfectly.", 
    "Perfect fit for recliner near wall", 
    "Nice lines, high quality oak finish, wonderful piece.", 
    "Shipped promptly, well packaged. Just had to attach the four legs and set it in place. All screws and the allen wrench are included.Table is exactly as described, good quality.", 
    "Bought these for our odd shaped room a ND they are perfect for in between the recliners.", 
    "High quality, sturdy and matches my other tables perfectly!", 
    "Love everything about this table and the fit next to the recliner and sofa is perfect.", 
    "These tables are high quality. I would recommend them, love the design.they were shipped quickly and in good condition.", 
    "This line is great! I truly love the look of these pieces. It is my 4th purchase from this group. I noticed this particular table didn't appear to be made quite as well as the other 3 but still a great piece. I would have given it a 4.5 rather than 4, that's how minor the difference is. It still was simple to assemble and just a great piece. I ordered it to fit between a recliner and sofa. Really a great look and well made. (for the most part). Love the speedy delivery too.", 
    "Beautiful table. Just what I wanted. People comment on it and want to know where I got it. Strong and Sturdy.", 
    "Great looking and interesting piece of furniture. I use it between two mission style chairs that are angled. It looks amazing and gets tons of compliments.Easy to assemble and just darn good to look at. A handsome addition to my living room for sure.", 
    "The product overall is just what I expected. The shipping was smooth and on time. The only issue I have with the product is that there are what looks to be nail gun indentations on the top. They are not readily obvious but at the same time I intend to fill these holes with a furniture wax repair. One hold in particular is prominent. I wouldn't go through the hassle of return but those are my only concerns.", 
    "Table is just what I needed in my small living room, easy to assemble and sturdy.Very attractive and I plan to buy some of the matching pieces very soon.", 
    "This table looks nice and is a perfect fit between the couch and recliner. Great deal.", 
    "This table is very well made and easy to put together. Shape fits very nicely between a sofa and recliner so the recliner can be angled.", 
    "The color was a little lighter than pictured but the quality is good and it's well worth the price!", 
    "Well-designed, heavy, sturdy, attractive. Instructions could have been better. The only disappointment was how easily the top got scratched. If it hadn't been for that, this would have been five stars.", 
    "The table is attractive, sturdy and easy to put together.", 
    "We had just purchased a recliner for our living room and were looking for an end table. We have a bookcase (oak) with the same colored accent pieces as this table. Easy to assemble and way less expensive than any that we looked at in local furniture stores.", 
    "It's easy to assemble, looks great and is perfect between two easy chairs. It appears to be of very good quality.", 
    "Bought this with the coffee table of the same style. A bit of color, and very well made. This one tied in with the other one, but it is small, useful, (who doesn't need a place to set the coffee by the chair?) and is just as well made as the big table. I love the bit of NOT obnoxious color it adds. VERY NICE.", 
    "The finish of this piece is nice; better than I'd expected. So is the build; glued seams seem tight, and the materials seem of decent quality. It must be assembled, but it's a quick & easy task. The only minor quibbles I have with this is that I was missing one flat washer (easily replaced with what I had on hand) and one hole in a cross-brace for the provided bolts (to fasten legs to table) was not drilled all the way through (easily fixed). It's hardly an heirloom piece, but for $139 it seems like a true bargain. Highly recommended.", 
    "This table is perfect for us. We bought two new recliners and wanted a table to put between them that could hold drinks, the remote control, snacks, etc. It's perfect and so easy to assemble.", 
    "Fit perfectly between our recliner and 2 person snuggler chair. Just enough space to have lamp and small pix and 2 drink coasters, but not so much space that 'clutter' is left to lay on the way :) Ordering another!", 
    "Fits the space by my recliner perfectly. The bottom shelf is very handy.", 
    "These are very nice pieces of furniture. The only complaint is that they strongly smelled of varnish when I opened the box and while putting them together. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "This table is even nicer than I had anticipated. The wood is a dark walnut color, very rich looking, and the slate sides are a lovely feature. It was extremely easy to put together and it looks like it was made to go next to the curved arm of my couch, as it narrows where the couch curves out. Looks very elegant with an antique lamp perched on top and magazines on the bottom shelf. Very sturdy. I couldn't be happier and am thinking of buying another product made by Favorite Finds.", 
    "We ordered this on 4/28 and it arrived on 4/30. That is what we call great service from Overstock. The table is lovely, looks great in the area I planned it to be placed. It was easy to assemble, the wood grain is beautiful, we are delighted with this piece.", 
    "Easy to assemble and solid! I love them!! Dont hesitate to buy these!", 
    "It is sturdy, no wobble, no fall down. Nice finish, pleased with purchase.", 
    "I purchased these rustic oak recliner wedge endtables for a large over stuffed chair. They work great. They are large enough to hold more than just your drink and remote contorls especially with the lower shelf providing extra storage. They do not take up as much room as even a small endtable leaving plenty of walk thru area. Quality of wood is outstanding and due to the weight of the package I was glad not to have paid shipping for them.", 
    "Very impressed. Ordered 2 of these tables. Love the size and shape. Most of all, love the look and solid structure! Nice quality materials. And I love that the slate on the tables I received is all gray and blueish tone. Different from the multi-color picture online. I love love love the slate accents! Beautiful. Super easy to put together. Matched the details online. Very happy with the purchase!!", 
    "The table was very easy to assemble and is of very good quality.", 
    "my husband and I had been searching high and low for a table that would fit in between our sofa and recliner that was within our budget. This table seemed a little too good to be true price wise and thankfully I was wrong! The quality is great. It's not feather weight like all of the pressboard/laminate covered junk they sell at Target or Ikea. Another plus, this table was EXTREMELY easy to put together. We managed it in less than 15 minutes.", 
    "This item was easy to assemble and is good quality. The slate inlaid decorations were attractive.", 
    "I ordered this piece to go next to my husband's recliner which is dark brown leather with oak arms and trim. This table fits perfectly ebtween his chair and the wall, and the color of the wood matches exactly! We absolutely love it!", 
    "Very sturdy, easy to put together. Nice even staining. good height for tall recliner.", 
    "We have a sofa and mission-style chair sitting near each other and at a slight angle but not a complete 90 degree right angle. After looking in stores, we thought we might have to get a round table to fit the spot. One day I decided to check out Overstock.com and I discovered a wedge-shaped table that not only fit the spot we had but would match the other furniture beautifully. It's just the same height of the arms on the chair and blends well with the other wood tones we have in the room. Since we purchased this table we've seen a couple of other wedge tables but they were really short, too wide, and the wrong color. We couldn't be happier!", 
    "I love the table, it is just what I was looking (and looking, and looking) for. However, it arrived without the hardware for assembly. After about two weeks I received some of the hardware, but the brackets were still missing, so I am still waiting, and have not yet been able to assemble the beautiful table.", 
    "Easy assembly, sturdy really fit perfectly in the space between the 2 chairs that are angled I am ordering the console table next", 
    "I actually had a space between a wall and my recliner that is at an angle to the wall. So, after checking that all four sides have that facing part I purchased. The wood is quality and I have the table reversed to fit in my space and it is perfect and I love it", 
    "The Mission style fits in perfectly with the other family room furniture. It is not too big, but the shape allows for setting a lot more on the table than one would think. It is perfect.", 
    "Bought this to sit between two recliners, it's the perfect size and shape! The quality is great, very very sturdy. It was super easy to put together and looks fabulous!", 
    "I bought this and the chairside Rustic Oak table and I'm very happy with both."
