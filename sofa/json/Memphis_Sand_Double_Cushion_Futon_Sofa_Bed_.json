    "Great piece for the price. Easy to turn into a bed but the material is delicate. Tears easily if not handle extremely delicately. Luckily I tore it in the back.", 
    "I don't recommend this sofa. First of all the color is darker than the photo. It's definitely tanish. They were very careful to not show in the photo the excess material that gathers at the fold which is very unattractive and after only one day of having this the whole thing doesn't really sit nicely. The cushions aren't even across the front. It looks frumpy, not like the photo. There is no way this sofa is worth the money.", 
    "Pros: The futon is stylish. The color is true to the pics. The futon is easy to assemble (15 min), and easy to adjust from bed to sofa. When flattened, it accommodates an average height person with reasonable comfort for sleeping. Cons: As mentioned in another review, you take the risk of damage during delivery. Mine arrived with a small hole on the visible seat back which can be camouflaged with a throw if needed. For some reason, when arranged as a sofa, the material tends to gather at the 90 degree fold. Final Word: The value for the look was still worth it.", 
    "Great quality for a futon bed", 
    "This futon looks very good and is easy to assemble. However, it is very uncomfortable for sleeping and for sitting for long periods of time. Just not worth it, unless all you really want it for is to look good and not be used. The color is a bit darker that in the photo.", 
    "very easy to assembly and have good quality and look nice !!!", 
    "I placed big square cushions to make sitting straight up more comfortable. Would buy again!", 
    "Its exactly what I wanted.", 
    "Where the back meets the seat, the leather wrinkles and does not look smooth like the photo. The back of the sofa is not finished, so it will only look good up against a wall where people will not see the back of it.", 
    "easy to put together and very pretty"
