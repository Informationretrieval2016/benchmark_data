    "This ottoman looks like much more expensive ottomans. Grant it, it isn't leather but it looks like leather and most people aren't going to get down close to it to check if it is or isn't. It arrived on time, in good condition, functions well and cost a lot less than its leather counterpart. I would highly recommend this ottoman to anyone.", 
    "We bought this item to hide all my 2 year old sons toys. It is a great product because it is easy for my son to open and the lid stays open. It will not shut on my son and he can open and close it without the fear of him getting hurt. It has a lot of storage room and all his toys fit in the unit. Also it is easy to assembly, you just screw on the legs. It looks great in the room and is worth the money especially if you are trying to find somewhere to hide all those toys that are always laying around the family room.", 
    "This is a nice Ottoman and would work perfectly either in a living room or bedroom. Storage area is sufficient and overall quality seems fine, although I noticed that the hinges on the lid are already starting to squeak a bit. The color is definitely dark-brown, but don't buy this expecting espresso. The color is close enough but you will notice that it's slightly lighter which may or may not be an issue if you're a stickler for getting everything to match perfectly. My only complaint is that I wish this was a little heavier - as it is now, it's very easy to knock out of place.", 
    "I love this bench because of its large storage space and it looks very nice. The screws that attach the hinges to the lid and body of the bench were much too short which seems to be a common cost cutting practice these days with less expensive products. They pulled out almost immediately. I'm sure it's easily fixable but can't do it myself so I'm very willing to pay someone to repair it. Otherwise I would have given the bench 5 stars. I'm storing 3 standard size pillows, 3 smaller blankets and 2 sets of sheets in the storage space quite comfortably. That is a huge plus since I live in a small condo. Every inch of usable space in the body of the bench is open for storage. Just for information, the lid needs 3 plus inches of space between the bench and the wall to open. It has a great hinge though which makes it easy to open part way and have it stay put which allows the bench to be almost flush with the wall.", 
    "first shipment of the ottoman had the equivalent of a nail piercing the edge, so contacted overstock to return/exchange. I was sent a new one, the new one arrived with a hole on the edge the size of a nail or screw. Overstock was very accomodating, and is now sending me out another ottoman that is a little more expensive (since this product is now out of stock), but product was/is questionable.", 
    "Quite liked the look of the item and then a week later, the hinge is broken. We opened the thing maybe 10 times max. This item is very poor quality.", 
    "Love it fits perfect, color was great, and the price was good. It was delivered as promised on time.", 
    "Product is fair for the price, but not at all as nice as the reviews led me to believe. It will do for a while, but overall not what I was looking for.", 
    "Maybe a bit more secure on the hinges, other than that is very good!", 
    "Good looking. Screw on four legs and all done. Nice locking hinge.", 
    "Beautiful piece of furniture for the money. I was impressed with the quality, weight and material. It opens easy and has a lot more storage than I expected. I would buy this piece again and would highly recommend it to a friend.", 
    "I was really impressed by the look, comfort and feel of this storage bench. A bonus that the lid also stays up when opened. I'd been searching for storage benches for awhile, so this was definitely a good buy--comfortable & attractive bench, low price and fast delivery.", 
    "This piece arrived in a used U Haul cardboard with tape all around it, once I removed the package the cover came off completely, the screws where the hinges were attached were stripped and almost looked like old screws were holding it in place, very disappointed in this piece, will look elsewhere for a storage ottoman.", 
    "We've had this for about a month now. I can say the quality is good, it is sturdy and the storage space inside is great. It is easy to keep clean and looks higher-end than what it cost. Only downfall is I wish it was just a little taller to make it a bit more comfortable for sitting on. We bought it for extra storage space in the living room and extra seating when we have guests, and it serves both these purposes.", 
    "This is nice for the price but not big like the other reviews said. I have one in my room and its roomy, I can fit a lot of stuff in there. But what I like about it is that it's light and of course you can get 6 sheet set in there. \"Queen size\" I would think.", 
    "The product did take a few weeks to arrive but arrived with no visible damages. The only issues I see is the leather top eventually moving out of place after so much use and the hinges possibly coming off after so much opening and closing. I haven't had it for too long but no issues thus far.", 
    "Multipurpose as a decorative and functional storage bench. I placed two hanging file frames inside the ottoman to hold my paper supplies and a few letter files so now they are all neatly organized and stored out of the way.", 
    "This bench is perfect for the end of my queen size bed. The black leather is beautiful and matches my reading nook black leather chair perfectly. I fit 4 decor throw pillows, 2 large bulky blankets, 2 sheet sets, pillow cases, and still have almost the other half empty. Very spacious. Comes with removable feet so you can choose height. Shipped and arrived on time.", 
    "It took way too long to get it delivered, way over 10 days", 
    "This bench is solid and well made. My only complaint is that it's very low to the ground. (I should have paid closer attention to the dimensions.)", 
    "Bought as a present and the person LOVED IT!!! GREAT ITEM!!", 
    "This was the perfect size, just what we wanted.", 
    "Exactly as described, nice addition to my bedroom.Fast shipping, no downside.", 
    "Good size and arrived quickly. Serves its purpose.", 
    "Great looking, functional ottoman and a real bargain! We replaced two wicker chairs in our beach house master bedroom and what a difference it made...the room looks larger and less cluttered. Plus, we can stash some of the former clutter in the ottoman. :-)", 
    "This ottoman was a real steal and I was very surprised at how nice it was when it arrived!", 
    "i love this bench it has great storage. looks great and is a great step for my dog", 
    "It works O.K. for the purpose.", 
    "I like the design. It's a tough little ottoman and has a lot of storage.", 
    "Love this storage bench. I use it at the foot of my bed to store sheets in and it works out perfectly.", 
    "Omg Iove it I brought it to use for all my pocketbooks and wallets this is a must havv", 
    "Very good quality and perfect for the guest room!", 
    "Very nice looking bench. Only thing to put together is the legs on the bottom. Soft cushion on top and plenty of storage room inside.", 
    "with limited closets in my home it drove me crazy trying to find a place for my canister vacuum cleaner. Works perfectly! Thanks O for coming through yet again!!!!!!!", 
    "Excellent for coffee table, storage or extra seating, very pleased", 
    "Nice quality and look for storage", 
    "I ordered cream color. Color is actually tan. Now what do I do? I've never returned something this size. It looks smaller than advertised so I will take my own measurements. Not happy with this.", 
    "Fits well with sofa and great place to store products and soft enough to stretch", 
    "Slowly closes with the hinges attached. No real setup necessary besides screwing on the feet. Even that is nice. They include spacers so you don't overtighten and crack the wood. Nice weight too.", 
    "It's a storage bench, folks. That said, it does not have a toxic smell that new furniture can have so I happily kept it!", 
    "This really was a good deal. Looks great in my room love the space for storage", 
    "Very nice as a coffee table or a foot stool.", 
    "i thought it was bigger from the picture", 
    "I couldn't be more pleased with this ottoman; the deep red color is more like \"wine\" and matches my leather couch set perfectly! It's beautifully constructed and the storage area is very deep. A perfect place for storing my winter throws when not needed. I like it so much I'm considering purchasing another one to place in front of my leather love seat! I would definitely recommend this ottoman!", 
    "I put the bench right inside my living room so that the kids could throw their shoes in it instead of on the floor. It works perfectly. I like how it's low enough so it sits just under the window .", 
    "great item! lots of storage!", 
    "I shopped around for several months before deciding to purchase this ottoman. After owning it for about 12 months, the seat, on the right hand side, gave out. I now have a recessed/sunk in portion of the seat/lid. I would only use this ottoman a few times per week. I weigh about 130 lbs. The ottoman has never had anything stacked on it. The ottoman is now unattractive and unusable on that side. I'm unable to repair the broken lid as the damage is inside the lid.", 
    "I really liked this ottoman, but the legs are very short and I couldn't use it at the foot of my bed. I had to do some creative readjustments. I had another ottoman with taller legs so I had to switch it with the legs of this one, but then with the longer legs, the ottoman becomes less stable and wobbles a bit when you sit on it. But otherwise, I would give it a 5. Oh, and the smell inside is bad, yes. I've put cedar balls in there. Fingers crossed that the smell will be gone in a few months?", 
    "It's the perfect size, it comes assembled, all we had to do was to screw in the 4 legs which took about 2 minutes total. We use the storage for blankets and toys.", 
    "Looks great and looks as pictured. I put it at the end of our bed and it holds all my sheets.", 
    "perfect piece for small dressing room.", 
    "This and all benches should be about six inches taller to make it more comfortable to sit on, which is one of the reasons for buying a bench", 
    "I purchased this for extra seating in my bedroom. I now have a place to sit to put on my shoes as well as plenty of extra hidden storage space.no regrets here.", 
    "We use this for toys for our daughters in the living room. It hides most of the toys, aside from the big ones, perfectly. We actually have about 30 minutes each evening where our house doesn't look like a toys r us exploded after they've gone to bed! Love it!", 
    "Great piece for the price, nice workmanship.", 
    "This is a great looking product. Perfect for storage.", 
    "Excellent storage and good accent for a bedroom or leavingroom", 
    "At the foot of my bed, holds anything I want and is a pop of color in my mainly white and black room.", 
    "It sits quite low to the floor even with the legs on it. It's nice and I was able to store a lot in it but I was a little disappointed with the height. It is pretty comfortable to sit on and seems very sturdy. It goes well with the rest of my living room.", 
    "Very nice quality for the price! Better than any I could find at local furniture stores.", 
    "Great quality, has a nice and tight hinge on the lid. The leather is very soft.", 
    "It a nice piece. The leather looks rich. However, the interior has a strong chemical smell. It takes a very long time for that smell to dissipate. I used fabric softener sheet to speed the process. I recommend if you have place were you can let it air out for a few weeks", 
    "This was the perfect solution for my smallish living room!", 
    "Item came in 2 days. Just unbox and use. Color a little off from the site descriptions ans pictures, but okay. perfect size for my use", 
    "Very stylish and goes well with my bedroom set.", 
    "She loves it so much..so roomy and excellent craftsmanship.. I will be purchasing another for myself", 
    "Like material like it because it is would could have been a little deeper however it came assembled except for the legs which was cool will purchase again", 
    "Attractive storage bench. Love it!", 
    "Great quality,matches my leather furniture perfectly!", 
    "The ottoman is well made and works well as a foot rest, a bench, and a place to store my grandkids' toys. I ordered the \"slate grey\" but the color is really more a slate blue and does not match my room at all, which is done is shades of light to dark gray and plum. Since it does serve its purpose, I'll keep it, but I'm very disappointed in the color.", 
    "Works great for what it is. I bought buy another.", 
    "Really like this bench. The color is so neutral that it goes with everything and it holds my extra blanket and pillows. Good purchase.", 
    "Perfect for your dinning room table + keep your table cloth & kitchen courtans in it", 
    "Nice, I purchased the grey cloth covered one, its really is great, its like a dark grey hounds-tooth jacket cover a pretty good size storage chest , its solid, built well", 
    "Love the look and just what I was hoping for. Extra seating when needed and extra storage.", 
    "Love it - would have liked it 6 inches taller", 
    "I was looking for a bench for the foot of the bed to store pillows - this works great. Easy assembly- just screw in the 4 corner legs. Easy.", 
    "I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. She hides all the kids blankets they use while watching TV.", 
    "This ottoman looks great in the picture but arrived all lumpy on top, my daughter was told to put a small hole somewhere and just work the air out it would be fine they marked the account in case it had to be returned. That never should happen it should arrive looking exactly like what you ordered. Also it was left on the stoop they didn't even ring the bell", 
    "This ottoman bench was exactly what we were looking for, We need it for storage, comfort and good looks: it has them all. Nicely made, spacious.", 
    "Very nice ottoman looks a lot nicer in person very well made", 
    "The bench arrived safe and sound...the \"leather\" is beautiful and soft...very well made. ..lots of storage space...great buy", 
    "Great addition to my family room", 
    "Holds a lot and is comfortable to sit on.", 
    "I bought this as a catch all in our living room for toys, blankets, kids' items, etc., whatever I needed to get out of view. The kids have sat on it, stood on it, jumped from it, and it has held up extremely well. The hinged lid is light so kids can get their things. It does not hold open. It does come with extra legs (feet) to put onto the bench, but we skipped that step. It has been a great bench. I wish it was a little taller, but it suffices and looks great.", 
    "Looks sharp in living room and can store blankets and quilts.", 
    "Just what we needed for the kids' room.", 
    "This is just perfect for us. I got it to store the grandkids toys in. Very sturdy & durable.", 
    "Just as good as it looks in the picture. Easy to assemble and well made. Great quality for the price. Love it!!", 
    "Excellent choice for bedroom storage! Nice piece to place at foot of bed.", 
    "looks good in front of our foot board", 
    "Nice quality for price it is a little shorter than I thought it would be", 
    "Very nice looking... getting a lot of compliments", 
    "It's the perfect storage bench for me, just what I was looking for. It fits right in front at the foot of my bed. And the price was unbeatable.", 
    "Ordered this online a few months back. Premium materials and looks great.", 
    "Really works great for storage and seating", 
    "We ordered this ottoman over a year ago when we were redoing an extra bedroom from being my son's toy room to being a combination toy/extra guest room. This ottoman has great capacity to hold all of his big/long toys and we have them tucked away to leave space on the floor and in the closet. He is an 8-year old and has friends over to play and this has held up like a trooper! Soft closing lid, nice finish on the materials. It has looked and held up well for us.", 
    "Just got this ottoman yesterday and so far I am very pleased with it. The color was perfect and it fit into the area that I wanted to place it perfectly. Not only is it a good place to store things but it provides a couple of extra seats in my living room.", 
    "I have serveral pillows with my comforter and this holds them perfect at night. Solved my problem.", 
    "VERY PLEASED WITH PURCHASE.", 
    "Its perfect for my king size bed. The quality is good Im pleased", 
    "Really liked this piece - good quality, good look, good price and fits my space and needs perfectly. I ordered a second one.", 
    "This a great item for storage and double as a ottoman. I love it.", 
    "Instead of the living room, we ended up putting this at the end of our bed. It looks too short and out of place for a living room.", 
    "Very pleased. Roomy and well-built.", 
    "It's a good size for what I want to put in", 
    "This storage bench provides plenty of space for storing items. The quality of the leather and the construction is very good.", 
    "well constructed, easy to assemble- just screw in legs, lots of storage for living room throws!", 
    "It is everything we hoped it would be.....also fast delivery", 
    "lots of storage in this ottoman, love it!", 
    "I bought this specifically to store my blankets in the coldest room of my house. Unfortunately, the smelly inside of this made the blankets smell so bad, I had to wash them. Maybe it is the red ones that have this problem. In addition, the color looks cheap, too, because it isn't a solid red, but has a black wash. I am purchasing another one and replacing it.", 
    "The top left hinge ripped apart when opening the lid. Fits alot of photos. But I could have gotten better locally and for less. I will not be shopping here anymore. I would rather rent a uhaul van and pick my stuff up and deliver it myself. A real disappointment. Not worth the money.", 
    "I love everything about this product, the color, the storage how it fits perfect in my room, and the best thing the quality.", 
    "Very nice for the price although, not a lot of space inside.", 
    "Lots of storage and door stays open on its own", 
    "better than others I've seen", 
    "The look, feel and function of this ottoman was better than I expected - and I thank Customer Service for helping me pick it out. It also arrived quickly and in perfect condition.", 
    "A great storage space for pillows and blankets that is large, but decorative and goes well with many different types of furniture. We love it and it was priced very reasonably.", 
    "Bought this to go with my boyfriend's new section & it works well. Just as pictured. Nice storage bench & ottoman. Thanks Overstock for a good deal.", 
    "looks great, comfortable to sit on and holds a lot", 
    "Exactly what we were looking for and at a great price. Great storage and a very useful replacement for a coffee table that just sat there doing nothing.", 
    "The first one was not put together very well. But overstock send me a replacement with no problem, and in one piece", 
    "perfect size and great for storage", 
    "Love this storage ottoman! Works perfectly with a leather sofa and love seat. Great bargain!", 
    "This ottoman was perfect in my entertainment room. Matched my brown leather sofas perfectly. Very sturdy, well made and looks very expensive and it wasn't. I use it for extra storage of blankets and pillows. Easily accessible for my daughter and all her friends when they have a sleepover. Thanks overstock", 
    "This wa perfect for my sons room!", 
    "I bought this storage bench to put at the end of our bed for extra storage. I love it! It holds extra sheets and blankets. Perfect!",

    "Very spacey and durable I love it", 
    "This is th perfect size. The storage feature is a real plus!", 
    "Ottoman has a funny smell to it but other than that; it serves its purpose. You may need to pull the item forward some to account for the space that is needed to lift the top.", 
    "This looks good and a great price!!", 
    "This storage ottoman sits right at the foot of our bed and houses our linens and towels so we don't have to go to the closet. We love it", 
    "This just got delivered. I'll use this great to store towels, bed sheets and blankets. It just the right size and length for the foot of my bed. My only complaint is, 2 of the legs, the screws are not long enough to screw in so I called customer care. They said they will send a couple of these legs. I hope it comes soon so I can use this to sit on when I get ready for work during workdays.", 
    "I got a red one, the color is vibrant and its very useful for storing blankets and pillows.", 
    "The rectangular storage space was perfect for my kids to keep their things inside, my living room look neater and we use it as a foot stool, and seats when we have guests over.", 
    "It doesn't take more space to fit in room. I love it.", 
    "The Ottoman is great. Good way to keep your kids toys off the floor.", 
    "What can I say, I have ordered one more of this item after receiving it. That should say it all.", 
    "We love this ottoman! We use it as a toy box for our toddlers toys in the living room and it works great. A lot of space inside and looks very high quality.", 
    "I looked at many so-called storage benches before selecting this one for my bedroom. It is large enough to hold my extra blankets and provides me a great spot to sit and put on my shoes. Exactly what I wanted!", 
    "The bench is nice and roomy, just what we needed for extra storage. I did not give it 5 stars because the material it is covered in has not proven to be very durable.", 
    "The color was lighter than I expected but still beautiful and I use it for storage of DVDs, pillows, and throws.", 
    "There wasn't enough attention to detail in assembling the piece, and some unattractive staples are showing. Other than that, it's a nice-looking piece of furniture. We are using it for storage in my seven-year-old daughter's bedroom, so it's fine enough for there. The blue is really pretty.",

    "Love it !!! Use it as a toy box/ coffee table . Very beautiful and durable :)", 
    "Great product for the price! Love it!", 
    "Good bench. The blue is an aqua shade rather than sky or baby blue. I wanted it to store bed pillows during the day and it can handle 3 standard size easily. Watch the price - I got it for less than today's price.", 
    "I was hoping for a little more storage inside, but it does hold 2 blankets.", 
    "Well built and very nice looking!",

    "Its an awesome addition to my bedroom. Very comfortable cushioned seat.",

    "Beautiful looking in red. Excellent quality for the money and good-sized.", 
    "I needed a storage bench for the foot of our king bed. It had 3 purposes - hold our sheets, look great and offer our aging dogs a step up onto the bed. I chose to use it without attaching the feet to make it slightly lower. It has good storage capacity, is very sturdy for sitting on while putting on my socks and would look nice with a variety of decorating styles. Arrived as scheduled and was in perfect condition.", 
    "I am very happy with this product. Saw it first on ****** website under a different name. Then decided to check out Overstock and there it was a and cost about $$ dollars less :-) It's a nice piece, good quality and I like that I can put a tray for food or drinks on it if I'm entertaining. It has storage inside which is good for blankets but its not wide enough for pillows. All in all this was a great buy from Overstock.", 
    "I received what was expected. It is really nice and came in one piece (only needed to add the feet).", 
    "The red color is a real red, but more muted, not candle apple red or anything. A muted red is what I wanted. It matched my other red furniture. I use this as a coffee table subsitute. I put the blankets and extra pillows inside, and a serving tray on top. I paid $, which I thought was a steal. It is now on sale, which is AWESOME!",

    "I am extremely pleased with the quality of the ottoman. I bought it to replace my coffee table, so that we would have a place to store blankets. It looks wonderful in my den!", 
    "We're happy with this purchase! The lid stays open and isn't too heavy. Lots of storage space. Faux leather looks as nice as can be expected. The stitching is well done. Doesn't detract from the quality look.",

    "This was just the size I needed for the foot of my king size bed. Plenty of storage and looks very nice. I really love it.", 
    "We were looking for an ottoman that would be comfortable as a footrest as well as extra seating that would be sturdy enough to sit on and this one definitely has fit the bill. It is attractive as well as being well built. We did not purchase it as a coffee table but it has also served that purpose. The price didn't break the bank either. Good value.", 
    "We are very pleased with this product. It came as advertised in terms of color, materials and size. It appears to be well built and it is well suited for our purposes. The hinged top utilizes appropriately sized hinges and the support arms hold the top in place when opened. It was delivered on time and with no damage. We purchased two of these storage benches and look forward to their use in both our living room and the master bedroom.", 
    "It's great. Looks high quality. Stands up to children's abuse and recklessness. Lots of storage. Just as described. Thanks, so pleased!",

    "This is such a nice piece of furniture. We have it in our entryway. It is just perfect. Be careful when putting the short wooden legs. We over tightened one and cracked it.", 
    "The only flaw I found is that the faux leather stretches if you sit on it. But it can be smoothed out. I don't use is as a seat but at the end of my bed for storage of bedding. It goes perfectly with my decor and I'm thrilled with it.", 
    "These are great! We got two blue ones for our living room. It's the perfect place for our toddlers to keep toys and books. The tops stay open, so they don't slam on little fingers. They are nice to sit on and easy to move. They are very light and slide around on our wood floor. But if we put heavier items inside or use rubber pads, then we won't have to worry about sliding.", 
    "This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my parents to put in there home in Fresno, Texas. They love it and it serves as a lot of things for them.", 
    "This is a great ottoman for the foot of our king bed. The storage space is ample enough for two large blankets and some throw pillows. I love have the extra storage and area to sit in the mornings. Its large enough for two to sit on and tie shoes, etc. The only downside to this ottoman is the height feels a little low but for the price I think it is great. And the quality seems pretty good for the price. Doesn't feel like the faux leather will be cracking too quickly.", 
    "I wish the storage unit was taller and deeper so that I can get all my pillows in but that's might fault since the item DID come with dimensions. The product is nice looking and good quality.", 
    "I love this ottoman bench! I looked at countless others but this was the one I chose and I am very pleased with my choice. It's the perfect size and also soft to sit on. The only reason I gave it \"good\" over \"excellent\" in the quality category is because the top material is a little loose in some areas and a place to take caution in how much and often it is sat on. Besides that it is well made, nice and deep with a good length, and beautiful to look at. I also got it on sale so the price made it all that much better. All in all I give it a 4.5 and would recommend this product to another.", 
    "This product was a gift. The recipient was thrilled and as a matter of fact had pre-selected it. I had done considerable price checking and found this to be the best price for style, storage and quality. All three were key factors in this gift purchase.", 
    "The Ottoman is a nice size. The lid stays open easily and holds quite a bit. It is long and low and fits nicely with many different decors. I'm using it to store clothes in the bedroom. The color is accurately represented.", 
    "It's a nice large storage ottoman, however the color is not \"brown\" I expected, it's dark brown or espresso.", 
    "First bench ordered came damaged. Replacement is fine", 
    "I wanted to place this bench in front of my large window in my living room and I was happy it was the perfect fit. I had a large gathering recently and it was nice to have extra seating and everyone who has seen it comments what a good choice it was to have the bench in this spot. It is very sturdy and matches my chocolate brown leather furniture perfectly. I am disappointed that the price went down by **** less than a month after purchasing! Oh well, it was still worth it.", 
    "I'm very pleased with my purchase. It is as described.", 
    "I was impressed with the amount of storage it had. Good value for the money spent.", 
    "I wanted something for the foot of my bed to put the pillow shams and extra decorator pillows in. Everything fits in this! I even have room for free weights. It looks great also, I was afraid it might look cheap but I was thrilled at the appearance. I may actually purchase another one. Countless ideas for its usefulness.", 
    "This ottoman is great to hide those items that you want to have nearby. It is a comfortable to sit and easy to move to another location. A great piece of furniture that matches almost everything. The shipping was quick and easy. I had other ottomans from ottoman, so I am quite happy with this addition", 
    "Item is beautiful and perfect for my need. Overstock nails it again!", 
    "Has lots of room inside, made very sturdy, and color is vibrant.", 
    "I read all of the reviews before buying - don't quite know what the complaints were. This is a nicely cushioned chest that has both hinges on the back as well as lifting hinges - might need to put in some more substantial screws at some point, but for the money it is perfect. Was looking at others elsewhere for $300. I sprayed it really well with my Febreze and smells fine. My 9 mo old grandson will be able to walk around without worry of hitting his head.", 
    "We purchased this as a toy chest for our daughter's toys in our living room. It is exactly as pictured and good quality for the price. The lid opens and stays open, so it is safe for little ones. Overall, a wonderful purchase.", 
    "This bench was not as big as I would have liked but that is my fault. Nonetheless, the product matched the style I was looking for and it was easy enough to put together. Color is good and with 6 grandkids and teenage boys in the house this product has held up! Definitely recommend if you are looking for an affordable storage bench.", 
    "You would never know that the material is faux leather. Great storage space inside with hinged lid. Love it!", 
    "Good Storage 14 x 44 x 10. Can hold pillows and other things. The only issue is the hardware holding the lid is a little cheap 4 - 1/2 screws and two hinges can lead to the lid pulling off. easy fix is to replace the hinges and use better screws.", 
    "its bench is large and sturdy - but very low to the ground. Other than that, its very nice", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for the living room; NOT as good of quality as real leather, but for a leather alternative It's GREAT! I am looking forward to filling up the storage aspect of this piece.", 
    "This is a very nice bench and was super easy to put together.", 
    "The perfect storage ottoman! It arrived quickly and in great condition. All five of our throw blankets fit inside an there is room for about three more throws. It looks great in our family room and does not take up much space along the wall. Great purchase and very happy with quality and price!!", 
    "Excellent product for the money you pay. It looks more expensive than what you paid for. The assembly was so quick, just had to attach the 4 legs and the product came undamaged and on time! The material looks so much like leather, sturdy and lots of space inside. Love this product for my large mud room, now, I am thinking whether to to buy one more for my family:)", 
    "Love this oversize storage ottoman, it matches the color of our couch exactly & is slightly longer than most, almost as long as our couch. Fits the Guitar hero guitars, game controllers, & a couple throw blankets on top with room to spare. Love it.", 
    "Lots of bang for your buck. These look great and serve a purpose. Bought expensive leather couch, chair and these match the coffee brown leather exactly. Multiple uses. The hinge holds the top up GREAT so you can store your blankets, etc. right in there with no problem. LOTS of room inside the storage container. You'll be surprised and amazed! Super easy to put together. I did it myself. You just put the 3\" leg screws (which are inserted already into the legs) right in holes.....and twist! Walla! No problem! Easiest assembly I ever had to do. Now I have extra seats for company, if needed, plus the livingroom stays picked up!:)", 
    "This storage bench is nice enough to sit in my formal living room, although I'm using it in the family/playroom. It is a comfortable seat and the storage space is a perfect fit for the kids' games and puzzles. My only complaint...it arrived slightly damaged. There is a tear in the fabric on the back corner near the bottom. As it happened, I planned on placing the bench up against a wall, so I didn't bother sending it back and waiting for a replacement. Had I been using it as an ottoman, I would have needed to have it replaced. There was no damage to the box in that area, so I am assuming it was shipped out in that condition. Overall, good product for the price.", 
    "I'm so lucky to have choosen another item in which I'm so satisfied with. I'm so happy with the ottoman I just perchase from os.com, it's simply beautiful. I will continue to shop. Thank u os.com.", 
    "I was very pleased with this ottoman. Looks great and appears very sturdy!", 
    "This was perfect for what I needed. We are using it in the foyer for my son to keep his schoolbag, gloves etc in. It makes the perfect spot for him to put his shoes on in the morning. There is more space inside than I thought there would be. The item was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. I couldn't be more pleased. I feel it was quite the bargain!.", 
    "Ottoman is pretty good shape overall, except one of the hinges fell apart during the delivery. Tried to re-screw the screws in but had a hard time getting the hinge to fit properly. Wish the hinges were stronger where they would not be susceptible to falling apart during delivery from Fed-Ex. Probably could be undamaged if the ottoman was packaged better.", 
    "I was looking for a ottoman to place at the end of my bed and then I saw this one. I ended up purchasing two, one for me, and the other for my daughter. I put my blankets, pillows, etc, while getting ready for bed, and in the morning sit to put on my shoes/boots for work. Color is just like the picture, and it feels just like leather. I would definitely recommend for purchase, and the price is just right!", 
    "I use these to store my grandchildren's toys. I ordered two, they were shipped really quick, I ordered them Tuesday, recevied them Friday. Nicely packed. Very happy with appearance.", 
    "The bench serves the purpose of the time being.....", 
    "Ordered this for a bedroom for storage and seating. Looks great and is well made", 
    "Its perfect for my bedroom, great color , great size", 
    "I needed somewhere to store blankets and sheets. This is the perfect solution. It is roomy and fits well at the foot of my full size bed. It is a convenient place to sit, while putting on shoes and socks and is extremely attractive and expensive-looking.", 
    "Wanted something to store things in for our bedroom. It is the perfect size to go ast the end of our bed. Great quality. Very easy to put up. It stores lot's of sheets and pillowcases. We love the look and quality.", 
    "I looked all over for a coffee table with storage and lo and behold this one showed up on Overstock.com. The price was great so I read all the reviews and decided to order the piece. When it arrived I checked it over and it was in excellent condition and also exactly as described. This if perfect for my needs and I would definitely recommend it to any one who needs a good looking piece that has great storage.", 
    "Even though the fabric seems thin, the overall appearance looks like fine leather. The storage comes in handy. We use this as a table, foot rest in a small den.", 
    "The ottoman was really easy to put together (just had to screw the legs on). Like another review said, it did have a slight smell to it when you opened the lid, but it has weakened and appears to be going away. We are using this to replace our coffee table since we have a 9 month old pulling up on it. It seems very safe for her. The lid won't just slam on her little hands. Love the storage piece of it too! It fits a lot. All in all, very happy with the purchase for the price.", 
    "pleased with product, would like it to be a little taller", 
    "This is a great addition to any room. It is very useful for storage and looks great.i would personal recommend this product. You can really use it any were in your home. It great even to have in your children room to hide toys and cd and whatever you want. It look very nice under a window or in your living room to put your feet up.", 
    "This ottoman looks very nice but from the second I opened the box, there was a horrible smell coming from it. This item is made in China so I don't know what that smell could be. I thought letting the peice air out would make the smell go away....but no! It hasn't! It's been over a week since I unpacked it and there's still a stench (which has given me multiple headaches). I would NOT buy this again and or tell others to!", 
    "Love the product. Fits perfectly with our living room layout and is the contemporary style I wanted.", 
    "My boyfriend and I needed a small addition to our bedroom that would also provide us with a little extra storage space and this was perfect! It is not a statement piece, but would definitely recommend it!", 
    "The delivery was prompt and the product is excellent. We especially like the safety spring that prevents our litlte ones from slamming their fingers in the storage compartment.", 
    "Love the size love the color but what I don't love is the fact that the seems are coming apart in the corners. I literally had to sew two corners of the bench already. I almost feel like I should get a new one at no cost...I am not sure if this one is defective or not. What I do know is that it won't last very long. I don't think I could recommend this to somebody else buy", 
    "I love this ottoman. I put it in front of a large sofa, but it could just as easily go at the foot of my bed. No assembly -- I put the feet on it, and that was all. I keep extra throws and pillows in it right now and put a tray on top for snacks or drinks.", 
    "I love the ottoman. Extra storage and looks nice in my living room. Good price and product.", 
    "I was disappointed that the measurments were not accurite. The bench itself is nice, just doent work for what I had planned.", 
    "Did not measure up to what I was expecting when it was ordered. Very cheap quality.", 
    "The seller is awful. They don't communicate about when the item will be delivered. It's been a week in \"processing\"."
