    "The table looks as pictured. The wood and finish are nice and there's almost no assembly. But it has s serious design flaw: It comes with three short legs about 2\" high that screw in to the base. The screw-in supports for these are not even spaced around the base equally at 120 degrees. The result is that when these legs are screwed in, this table will tip over with even a small imbalance of weight on (or inside) it. It is somewhat dangerous, and certainly not something you'd ever want to place anything valuable or breakable on. You have two choices -- other than sending it back: 1) Toss the legs and just put the circular base directly on the floor (my solution). This actually worked well for the height of my recliner next to it. Or 2) Try moving one of the screw blocks on the base to better space it around. I don't know if that would work very well: this thing really needs a 4th leg. I'd just avoid it.", 
    "I found it to be easy-to-assemble, and it's just the right size if you need a smaller table. Great storage too. There indeed is a lacquer odor when you first open the box. I screwed the legs on and left the door open to air out in the garage overnight. The smell was gone the next day and the table looks great!", 
    "The drum table arrived quickly. It was packed very well. All I needed to do was to add the feet to the base with a few screws...very easy. The price was a little high, but my wife loves the workmanship and the color. There were a couple of places on the underside where the stain was not done very well, but for the price , this was an excellent buy. I would recommend this buy for anyone looking for a not too large drum table to fit into a tight spot. This table easily would cost up to $500.00 in a good furniture store.", 
    "So tickled I took a chance on this table. I've been looking for the right table to go between my pair of Metropolitan arm charis (also Overstock) that wouldn't be TOO big or TOO tall for the space, and would look great from all sides, but most importantly would not be easily tipped over by my toddler--THIS IS IT! All you have to do is screw on the 3 feet, but I opted to leave them off for now for extra stability (the kids), and it actually looks great without the feet, too, and is an even better height with the chair arm rests this way. It's very attractive!", 
    "If I'd written this review as soon as I received the table i\"d have given it 5 stars. I love the table. The only problem is with the finish. It scratches very easily. My cat jumped onto the table and left little white scratch marks. If the finish were deeper into the wood, scratches would barely show but there's a white layer right under a thin layer of finish, very weird, so every scratch seems like a big deal.", 
    "I am very satisfied with this product and I ordered another one upon receiving my first. It is a very good price for a table of such quality. My friend also wants to by one after I introduced the table to her. Highly recommend this product.", 
    "This table is well worth the price paid! Have looked at other drum tables online that were a bit larger for three to four times the price. If you are expecting \"fine\" furniture, it is not... but neither is it cheap looking nor cheaply constructed. The finish is quite nice and the table is quite solid. I would totally recommend to others.", 
    "I had very high expectations for this end-table based on other comments. Those high expectations were met. I bought this to coordinate with an older English style side table (squarish, drop-down leaves). It coordinates perfectly - that is how accurate the picture and description were - but there is one small hitch: It makes my older table look shabby. I will say to parents with kids that with three legs, this table is not as stable as it might be. I am not complaining, because the legs add to the esthetic - but as one reviewer pointed out, if you use it without the legs, it still looks just great and it is virtually untippable.", 
    "Table is made of very inferior furniture materials witht eh exception of the faceof the door and the main talble top, The rim of the table top is made from fine particle board!. The stain is very inferior and the color is designed to hide all the flaws in the table. It was easily removed with a decent paint remover.I stripped the door face and table top to espose the very nice birch veneer . I stripped the legs to expose the wood and spray painted the rest of the table to make it decent.(I threw the original packing material away so I could not retrun the table).Needless to say I would not go through this again and was very disappointed in the overall purchase.", 
    "Nice table except for a big scratch on the side. Luckily I can position table where it is less noticable.", 
    "I have bought this perfect looking drum table but my disappointment was great because one of side of this drum table was broken like a wound! It was due to *** packer didn't check inside shelf that wasn't screw on! When I unpacked box I was wondered why some screws drop out from the table... and... there is dangling shelf inside. When the drum table had been transporting the shelf kicking table inside out many times and did the wound from inside out. Summary: My drum table has very bad control under assembly inside and... bad looking outside now yet. There is poor paper with instructions and contacts of product's maker inside the box. They write: 'GIVE US A CHANCE TO MAKE IT RIGHT!' The phones on this paper are wrong and no other contacts like an e-mail! So, make your conclusions yourself...", 
    "Amazing quality for such a low price. Looks as if it is an Ethan Allen piece! I would highly recommend purchasing this table. Overstock is awesome!", 
    "My main disappointment, was it was not the color it shows in the picture. I was not going to send it back, as it would have been too much trouble to try to repack it, but probably would not have bought it, had I seen it prior. The size was what I had wanted, and I like the door on the front.", 
    "Nice table for the price. Easy to put the feet on. I can see where it might have stability problems with the feet, but I am using it next to the a chair in the living room, so it will not have any weight on it.", 
    "Great decoration to my living room. Good storage space inside", 
    "With all the positive reviews I was not hesitant to order this. And of course I was NOT disappointed. Solid wood and beautiful color. New wood smell too! Great purchase.", 
    "I purchased 2 of these table and use them as night stands on either side of my bed. I love them. The quality was better than I expected as the tables are all wood in construction. The only problem is that the color of the tables is not an exact match. I wouldn't call it a \"problem\" because you can't really notice any color difference unless the tables are placed side-by-side. I did purchase them at different times and maybe its just a difference in the stain batch. As I said before-I love these tables!", 
    "The table is lovely and the inlay is beautiful, but the damage on the table is awful. The edge of the table--the wood is smashed in. The door is hanging because the wood holding the hinge is cracked. I am so disappointed because this is a lovely table and it came very quickly. It was packed well so the damage must have been there when it came from the manufacturer.", 
    "This looks great and arrived quickly. The lacquer odor is overwhelming as the well-packed box is unwrapped, and lingers for weeks. I hope it goes away eventually. I did not notice the problem referenced in the 1-star review with the tipping problem. This is sturdy and not wobbly at all. With young large dogs in the house I feel confident this will stand the test of their tearing around. The storage is nice (but really smelly inside). I recommend airing it out in the garage for a while. The other item I would note is that it's indicated to have a Walnut finish but it matches my Cherry furniture more closely - it definitely has a red hue so if you need dark Walnut, this wouldn't be a good choice.", 
    "We like this for storage inside (it is roomier than it appears inside) and for a lamp on top.", 
    "I would reccomend this table to anyone that is trying to enhance the look of a room. It's well made and has a perfect finish, not a scratch or blemish. I like the way the curved door opens and has two shelfs for storage. I couldn't be more satisfied, don't hesitate to purches it if you're contenplating it. This may sound too go to be coming from a customer but I am the real deal, a satisfied customer. Kind Regards Gene B", 
    "Very nice occasional table -- well designed for a traditionally furnished room. Wood quality and craftmanship is excellent for the price, and the door fits well, with attractive hardware. The three short legs are easy to assemble, but do require that weight on top be evenly distributed. Because we wanted to use this between two chairs, we opted to remove the legs to make it more securely stable, and it looks just as good!", 
    "Really love this little table. It is solid wood, well made, and a unique, interesting design. Perfect side table! Wish I had two!", 
    "This is my first purchase from Overstock and I couldn't be more pleased. The piece is beautiful and the price was very right. I will be back to look at other pieces as I need them.", 
    "The table was shipped without any damage, just put the feet on and it's done!", 
    "I am so pleased with the table that I ordered another one. thank you Overstock for such a fine product.", 
    "Good product for the price and this is REAL WOOD and nice veneers, this is not a \"Composite Wood\" piece of furniture. Before using, rub well with a clear paste wax or polish for years of long lasting protection.", 
    "Love the table. Had a problem with blemishes on/in the door. Called the number on the flyer included with the table. Great comfort in dealing with manufacturer. They sent out a new door which I installed after removing the original (4 screws on hinges). Problem solved. Didn't have to return and began enjoying it right away.", 
    "This is an exceptional little table. I was surprised and very pleased.Just what I wanted. Good quality for the money. Well packaged.", 
    "This is the perfect table to fill a space in an unconventional way. It's a little smaller than I anticipated, but it looks gorgeous! The detailing is exceptional, and it comes assembled (except for the feet).", 
    "Great for what we needed it for.", 
    "Well made and delightful to look at. The inside shelves are usefulsize. This was a great purchase!", 
    "I Love this table and you will also!! Nice size and it's not bulky at all.", 
    "I purchased two of these beauties a couple of years ago, and they are still performing well. The Top and Door Inlay's by far beat my expectations with the wood grain detail. If you use a good wood polish as I do, the Grain will pop, and you should be very pleased with this Table.", 
    "Loved quality of table. Would like to purchase another one are they still in stock", 
    "Has good storage and looks good in the living room.", 
    "Nice storage space. Looks great.", 
    "Good little end table. Happy with purchase.", 
    "I love the drum style of the table. It is a solid piece and was easy just to add the legs. The storage inside them is great. A great value for the price.", 
    "nice strong table and fast delivery", 
    "Worth every penny and readonably priced, too.", 
    "Love them!Just the right size for my room.Price was great.", 
    "Beautiful wood design. The door opens to reveal storage compartment plus a shelf. The door snaps closed with a magnetic catch. I use a set of two as end tables in our den. It's a handy place to store daily use items within easy reach.", 
    "I love this table but it arrived with a broken latch. I chose to have it fixed rather than return it. It's still a beautiful piece of furniture and I will probably order another.", 
    "these tables came extremely well packed, only had to screw the ball feet. It is MDF but the finish design was done to perfection. At that price, you cannot expect the $3000 type table, but they will do. I can nor pack my various books I had piled underneath a glass table. At that price, yes they are perfect.", 
    "The reviews that are here already are relatively comprehensive and correct. These are lightweight tables, but for the most part quite beautiful. They are a little unstable, but fine for households without young children tipping things over. The color does vary a bit between the sides and the door, but not significantly. They are nice if you have small spaces and would like the storage. I had no difficulty with the legs or the shelf.", 
    "It's very nice. arrived in great shape.", 
    "Perfect size made great for the price and no assembly required!!", 
    "The color is very nice. There was a strong order when you opened it. But, it went away once you left it opened for a day or two. Great purchase!", 
    "I love my Birth Drum Tables !", 
    "Minimal handy skills are required to assemble. It had a strong chemical odor which is contained within the cabinetry which lasted about a month or so. It is sturdy and is attractive as it looks online. It's important that you use a coaster to prevent table damage.", 
    "After readings previous reviews, I purchased two of these birch drum tables. Fortunately, because one reviewer commented on the fact that the table SHOULD have not just three legs, but four, I was not surprised when I discovered for myself just how \"tippable\" they are. But in all other respects, I like them; they are just what I was looking for, so I'm happy with them.", 
    "NOT VERY PLEASED WITH THIS TABLE OK BUT LOOKED LIKE BETTER QUALITY IN PIC", 
    "Love this table. It is perfect for what I needed. Surprisingly it has quiet a bit of storage in side of it. Very well made and was delivered very well packed. All I had to do was screw he legs on.", 
    "Let's begin with with the packaging, which is one of the best I've ever seen, professional and easy to handle. The table is beautiful, solid and elegant. Great value!", 
    "This is the first piece of furniture that I have ever purchased online. It is beautifully detailed and sturdy. For the price, you can not go wrong.", 
    "Could use a much better finish coat, because it looks as though it is thin and will not hold up well, but the over all appearance and design of the table is nice and make it work for my use.", 
    "I am very pleased with this table. The only problem I have is that it arrived with one of the shelves inside out of place. In time I will attempt to fix it. The table is too nice to make the shelf an issue.", 
    "Beautiful -even prettier in my home than in the picture", 
    "I definitely would buy again. Did not have to put it together", 
    "perfect for my living room - well made - sturdy without the feet", 
    "Good quality for the price, wished they were larger in diameter, but Great for the price.", 
    "The color is exactly how it shows in the photo. It was delivered on the day it specified. the legs were easy to assemble. I would recommend Overstock to my friends.", 
    "Even Better when I received them. Packed great no damage. Order you won't be sorry.", 
    "Really pretty and solidly made.", 
    "SURPRISINGLY GOOD LOOKING & WELL MADE", 
    "I really like this accent table. It has nice storage in it. I was pleased with it for the cost. Looks nice with or without the feet.", 
    "The easiest to assemble, just screw on three legs and your done. I'm loving the relish brown tone of the table. Will be ordering another one. Delivery was quick. Very pleased with the quality of the wood and price. Caught it on sale.", 
    "Easy assembly(screw in legs), solid wood, good craftsmanship,perfect size end table. I had ordered 2 tables and one of the legs was broken. Good customer service had new leg to me in less than a week. After 3 years, they look as good as new.", 
    "I purchased 2, 1 for me & 1 for my hubby. They are beautiful & well made. Love that it has a door with 2 shelves to hide stuff in when company comes! We chose to use the tables without the feet, & looks really good!", 
    "It's sturdy, comes packed very securely and you just screw the feet on! The finish is rich, and has great detail and durability.", 
    "Nothing to put together and it's lovely with lots of storage", 
    "Came in ready to use and is gorgeous!", 
    "I got these over 3 years ago and they are still beautiful. Very sturdy and well made.", 
    "chips easy other wise we really like the looks", 
    "I already own 1 and bought a second one to have on both sides of my bed as nightstands, they are very nice looking and the perfect size for a small bedside table. Very rich looking.", 
    "This table shipped quickly and is simply beautiful. Another plus is that there was no assembly required other than screwing on the legs. It is an excellent value! Would definitely buy it again.", 
    "Had this product for a while and just now getting around to rating it. It has survived 3 moves and still looks fantastic. Solid product!", 
    "This is a great table at a great price! It fits perfectly in the spot we intended it to be.", 
    "I've had this for quite a while, use it next to my bed. very nice finish and color.", 
    "Beautiful piece, Worth the price in my opinion!", 
    "Had one small piece broken off. Otherwise, has a nice finish and looks nice in any room.", 
    "Love this table. Perfect for fitting in between those awkward places in the living room", 
    "For our area, it arrived on time, well packed and easy to assemble. I looks great; the finish is good and the circular door is beautifully finished.", 
    "I originally bought one of these for my living room. I loved everything except that the door did not have anything to keep it closed (no latch or magnet). When I bought a second table for my house I was excited to see there was a magnet closure to keep the door secure. I don't know if my first table was simply missing that piece or the added it later on.", 
    "This table looks so much nicer in real life! Great quality, gorgeous color, very stylish. It is used as a nightstand in the bedroom, because only one out of two that came with the bedroom furniture fits there. This little table works great, and the storage in it is an added bonus!", 
    "We love these little tables. They go well with my light cherry and they are perfect for a cup of tea.", 
    "Love the table. Great look and quality", 
    "These look great in my small living area. Big enough for a lamp and small items. everything else tucks away neatly inside", 
    "SECOND ONE, MATCHING PAIR.", 
    "I bought a second one. Well made. Great looking.", 
    "This is perfect for my needs. I love the color and built of this table and it looks very nice in the space.", 
    "It is an O.K end table which is very small and not very attractive as shown in the picture.", 
    "Love the finish. Very nice", 
    "The drum end table is beautiful and goes well with antique or traditional style furnishings. The wood grain patterns are especially nice, and craftsmanship excellent. However, in my case I was mixing antique with modern in our living room, and these tables definitely made the room much more traditional. I should have selected more modern end tables. Unfortunately we didn't keep packaging materials so I couldn't return them. The lesson was to hold on to all packaging materials for a few days at least, and give yourself some time to see if the piece really works for you or not. Overstock return policy is very easy to follow and reasonable.", 
    "constantly get admired, they are solid, beautiful wood, perfect size. i started with four and now have nine in different rooms and in a condo we own. excellent value", 
    "Great color, good storage!", 
    "Table is really nice. I don't see any issues with being tippy at all. Slightly smaller scale which was perfect for my combo dining/living room area.", 
    "I saw this in a hotel that we stayed in, and I had to have it. On the website they ordered from, this was crazy expensive. I am sooo glad I found it on Overstock! I paid 1/2 the price of the other website, and it looks every bit as perfect! Love it!", 
    "Great service. Received the product within a few days of ordering. The product received was quite good.", 
    "This arrived quickly, well packed & easy to unpack, fully assembled, and very nice quality for the price. The cherry finish is lighter than the picture, a little more orange than my computer showed it, but it still looks nice. I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "Nice-looking, stores magazines-whatever inside but not bulky. Graceful. Not the greatest quality, but very good for the price.", 
    "Perfect to keep clutter hidden. And have everytphing handy, also they have one with a drawer if needed", 
    "Great quality and storage space. It looks more expensive than it costs.", 
    "We bought this to use as a nightstand and think it is great. Hardly any assembly, just screw in feet and you are done. Very custom look to boot. With a shelf inside the door there is a ton of storage capacity for a piece of this size.", 
    "Product looks like fine furniture on the picture. In reality, its appearance is terrible, with very visible large parts looking like brown plastic and dull veneer, not the nice glow you see on the picture. On the sides, the empire-style columns that barely appear on the picture are, in reality, protruding out like sore thumbs and completely ruining the remainder of this piece's esthetics. If you have fine furniture in your home, you will not be able to incorporate this piece with the rest of your furniture. I tried and all I got is the need to return it. I should have known from the price: I had to pay $$$ for the piece that I replaced it with (also a drum table) instead of $$$ for this one, and now I know why.", 
    "So very easy to assemble.....mine is sturdy and looks perfect next to the small chair in my living room. The color and texture of the veneer are really good-looking and are exactly like the picture. I've already gotten many compliments.", 
    "Given the reviews, this is the one piece of furniture I thought I would love from Overstock. It arrived well packaged (as per usual from Overstock) but the color is totally off and there is some stain missing underneath some of the decorative pieces on the outside of the piece. The color of the item online looks like shades of brown. My table strikes as being stained just orange with no real differentiation of shading. Speaking to Overstock I am presented with a few remedies, one of which I have yet to decide. I have to say Overstock customer service excels and is the reason I would never be deterred from purchasing through them. Whilst the color and lack of stain is very disappointing, the style of the table in all other ways is wonderful. So if you are considering this table I would say go for it, I think my table was an exception to the norm of great quality.", 
    "Arrived extremely well packed with no damage. They are very nice looking tables for the money and pretty solid too.", 
    "Good quality, looks very rich. High quality shipping packing had it arrive without a scratch. Great quality product and shipping handling. Wood had more red color than I was expecting, but still very nice. Only shortfall was when the 3 legs are screwed in, the table tips when you lean against it. 4 legs would have been more stable. While we have grandchildren around, we just removed the legs and the table is still very elegant and a beautiful accent piece. We will reattach the legs when the children are older and less accident prone.", 
    "This drum table is very attractive. Good design and good color. Not totally pleased with the bun feet on the table but I adjusted the location of the feet and it looks fine now. For the price; it is a good value.", 
    "This table sits perfectly between my two recliners! I also like the shape...with little ones playing near there are no corners for them to get hurt on.", 
    "Beautiful finish and fine quality wood and construction. Excellent rating reserved because of small imperfections in bottom foot mounts. Works great nent to my reclining chair.", 
    "This little table is just right, nice color, perfect size. Great price and fast delivery, what more could you ask for?", 
    "This is a well built table and nice size and of good quality and good color also", 
    "We ordered one of these, and the quality and beauty were such that we ordered a second one and put them on each end of our sofa! There is very little assembly required, and the warm glowing finish on the wood is indeed lovely!", 
    "We needed a unique side table for two leather chairs in the piano room and did not have a lot of space. We found this table on Overstock and ordered it. It arrived early and looks great. Came in perfect condition and was easy to unpack, just had to screw on the feet and turn over. It looks great, and we could not have found anything like this in local stores. Price was excellent, why waste gas driving around and getting hassled by sales people. This is a great service.", 
    "As good as pictured. Very easy to assemble. Only the base legs needed to be screwed on to the rest of the piece.", 
    "Nice quality and workmanship. Only negative is that is has 3 legs instead of 4. You have to be careful when moving it.", 
    "This is a wonderful end table. They are beautiful and look much more expensive than they are. They really dressed up my living room. Love the parquet on top. I was a little concerned about stability because of prior reviews. But I have not found that to be a problem, even though I have heavy Tiffany-style lamps on top.", 
    "Received these tables yesterday. They were packed very well. When I unwrapped the first table and opened the door, the shelf fell out. I didn't think anything of it, until I saw the loose screws, which had been holding the shelf in. I was able to install the shelf again, (although I think I vacuumed up one of the screws), and the table is fine. I also had to tighten the screws on the door. The second table was near perfect. The legs screw in easily and the tables look great. My only concern is that the screws on the hinges are not tight enough and that they will loosen easily.", 
    "I read the reviews and hesitated at first due to some of the negative reviews. But when I saw how many reviews there were and an overall nearly 5 stars, I decided to take a gamble for the price. I was not disappointed! The tables were an excellent price, plus coupon discount and free delivery which made the deal even sweeter. The quality for the price is quite good. The packaging was very well done and they arrived without a scratch, ding or problem on them. I would have liked for them to be just a little darker in color (they are what I would describe as a more \"slight orangey brown fruitwood\" color) yet some reviews said they were much darker than depicted in the photos...While, I would have liked for them to be just a slight bit darker brown, they actually match my other room furniture well and I am very pleased. The different \"wood grain\" tones make them unigue and interesting. After having shopped many furniture stores and looking at better quality for about 4-5 times the price of these (average table this size ranged in the **** price range)...I am pleased that I settled on these tables for the price/quality.", 
    "This is a great little table. It's small enough to rest in a corner when you don't need it, and it's great to put at the end of the sofa for a place for drinks, a lamp, etc. It even has a shelf and storage! One of the most favorite items from Overstock.", 
    "We love, love, love this table. It's stylish, expensive-looking -- and has a handy little cabinet in it! Very easy to put together too. We would highly recommend it!", 
    "We have three of these drum tables. 2 years ago, I bought our first to store reams of unlovely paper resources. It has been so useful and has held up so well that this month we bought two more for the same purpose.", 
    "Arrived quickly. Very well packed. Actually, they look much more expensive than their cost. Would buy these again.", 
    "I wanted something nice with rounded edges, plus storage. This item looks great. Couldn't be more happy.", 
    "Love this table. It is perfect for where we needed to place it. It arrived in excellent shape and in a timely manner. It is nicer than the photo showed. We did not place the feet on the table because it was the perfect height without them.", 
    "We bought 2 and returned both. Poor quality and a different color/design as showing in the picture.", 
    "This is a nice little table. The front opens to reveal a storage area with one shelf so you can push all the junk inside when you spot guests coming to your front door.", 
    "bought two. One for each end of my couch. Love them. Storage in them to keep mess off table top! A+", 
    "Very beautiful piece of furniture. Looks like a much more expensive stool/table.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised that the only assembly was to add the feet. The table was packed very nicely and is perfect for what I wanted. It looks much more expensive than the price paid. I love this table!", 
    "Bought this as a table for my husband to hid his snacks, magazines, etc. the storage compartments are perfect. It sits between his and her recliners.", 
    "I have been living with ugly old tables for years then finally saw this reasonably priced one, bought it and love it. smells a little like it was just painted but I'm keeping the doors open to air it out and all will be great!", 
    "I was looking for a small table that would fit in with the other furniture in the room. I am not disappointed at all! It is beautiful and perfect for what I needed. I was a bit skeptical after some reviews were saying it came scratched or \"beat up\" because it was not packaged well. It was not dented or scratched at all. It was so well packaged to prevent any damage! I am very pleased with the table and the service.", 
    "This table is absolutely gorgeous and well worth the price to say the least. I have mine in my library without the legs just because I like the height better...saving the legs for future use if need be. Also, spacious inside...holds about 25 books.", 
    "received table today - was disappointed with the color; has more of a reddish color than what screen shows. one panel not completely finished on entire edge; had to use a furniture touch-up marker to cover exposed area from top to bottom, about 1/4\"wide. size is goodfor a livingroom end table. will use lemon oil furniture polish to highlite the finish. for the price, acceptable.", 
    "The color is exactly as pictured. Although a bit smaller looking than I expected, it fits my corner fine. I would highly recommend this item for any living area.", 
    "We needed end tables for a tight area. These tables open to provide extra storage and have enough surface space for a lamp and there still space for other items. I was surprised at how good they looked.", 
    "This is a great end table that could fit into a living room or bedroom. It is clean, sharp and has a beautiful, rich finish. Assembly was putting the feet on...took 2 minutes. We are considering purchasing a second one! Cute and classic!", 
    "Very well made drum table, very sturdy and the color is beautiful.", 
    "beautiful,,,i love it,,,have gotten alot of comments on the table....will i buy another one,,,,yeah,,i love the color and the style ....", 
    "This table is not fit for purpose with the three lfeet fitted. It is so unstable it would be asking for an accident to attempt to use this with the feet. So if you need the feet do not buy", 
    "Beautiful table. I love the two shelves inside the table. Great way to hide magazines, etc. when you want less clutter sitting out. Comes already assembled and the quality is excellent!", 
    "I needed something this size and searched everywhere for it. Overstock always has what I want. It was perfect. It arrived five days after the order. It was packed beautifully. It took no longer than 3 minutes to assemble it. (It took more time to un-wrap the packing that protected it.) And it is gorgeous. It does not look like something that you would have to assemble. Thank you, Overstock, for continuing with the quality you always have.", 
    "I wanted something a little different than the normal bedside table so I went with these. They are very pretty, but a little lighter in color than I thought they'd be, but still complimentary to my bedroom furniture. They came very heavily packaged, which is good and were easy to put together. I like them!", 
    "I used it for a night stand. Looks great, very good quality. Easy to put together, u just screw the legs in, everything else is done for you.", 
    "Except for screwing on the legs, the table came assembled and in great shape. We have had no issues with it, it looks great and matches descriptions, color, etc. as advertised.", 
    "After searching forever for a piece that met all my requirements, i finally stopped when I found this table. I needed quality, size, shape, height, color, storage and price. What a find! It met all my expectations. It looks beautiful in my husband's study because: the wood is real, the round shape is the perfect height and diameter for his recliner, the parquet design is stained a beautiful warm color, its round door opens to two-shelves for storage and the price is unbelievable. Thank you, all other people who did not buy this before it got to Overstock.com. Now it is happily mine!", 
    "The table was even better than the picture. I only had to screw in the legs, the rest was intact. Beautiful wood, smooth, no scratches , wonderful warm color. It goes well with my traditional furniture. I really love it.", 
    "We needed a small table to complete our living room. Looked several places till I found this one on Overstock. Took a chance and ordered it. The table came in two days as promised. It was packaged very securely and was in very good condition. When I put the feet on the bottom it did make it too tall for where I wanted to place it. As another reviewer stated, they removed the feet and it works great. So happy I purchased this table. It was exactly what I wanted and looked better in person than it did in the pictures.", 
    "The quality of the table is excellent. It goes good with the other tings on my table. I put a lamp on the table that I had. It looks good together. I would recommend overstock to anyone wantsing quality pieces at a good price", 
    "So I was a bit appreciative about purchasing a a peice of furniture that I had never layed eyes on but this is well made, heavy and quite lovely.", 
    "Really packed well. Arrived in fine shape. Looks good and,what's more important, my wife is happy!", 
    "This is a beautiful end table. The color of the wood is warm and looks great in my living room. I am using the table without the legs. I felt it was a little tall with the legs when placed next to my recliner.", 
    "Beautiful piece of furniture. Well built and finish was perfect. Packaged very well for safe delivery. Took 5 minutes to screw the feet on. I have had a difficult time finding an end table with a light finish. This is a rich light walnut. Most furniture I looked at was either a dark brown or espresso color so when I saw this I hoped it would work with my cream and walnut finished coffee table. It's perfect. Great value for the price.", 
    "I am amazed at the quality of this little side table. Lots of storage for a small piece and it fits well with my traditional/old world styling in my home. I really like this and would definitely recommend it.", 
    "excellent products, good value for the money.Showed these off to friends and they wereflaBERGASTED AT THE PRICE", 
    "A wonderful find. The price was right, shipping free and fast. The table itself is really great. I particularly enjoy the quality of the wood and how rich it looks. A great find and a great shopping experience. Thank you Overstock.", 
    "I'm thinking about ordering a 2nd drum table, my husband loves it.", 
    "Quite small and not super high quality, but for this price I didn't expect it to be. We've had some trouble keeping the panels in place as the very ends aren't stained completely, but I solved that problem with a furniture pen. Overall a nice little table that looks more expensive than it is. The top is very sturdy. I liked that I didn't have to do a lot of assembly! My daughter did knock it over and damaged a panel and bent one door hinge, so keep away from klutzy children!", 
    "This table is beautiful. The wood grain is lovely and the shelves inside are solid. It was exactly as advertised and packaged securely. I am very pleased.", 
    "This little beauty was the perfect fit for our need of a side table for one of our family room chairs. It was well made, stylish and was set up in 5 minutes.", 
    "This birch drum table is quite beautiful! Good workmanship, nicely finished, and a great addition to any home!", 
    "The tables arrived, tightly secured and safely packed, in an upright box. The tables are already assembled! The only thing you have to assemble are the feet, and that takes less than 5 minutes. The tables are the height of a normal size couch arm rest. Also, keep in mind, that the tables are not equipped to hold oversized lamps. The tables are a nice addition to our family room! I am very pleased with our purchase and will continue to purchase from overstock!!", 
    "I wanted extra storage for baby's story books in my living room. This end table is a perfect fit. It has a unique style and sleek design plus plenty of storage. It makes a great addition to any space. I have had if for about a year now. My now two year old helps himself to the treasures (books) inside. It still looks brand new. Great deal!", 
    "I have always been hesitant to purchase items such as the Drum Table as I am a hands on kinda guy. After looking at the pix and other reviews I decided to take the leap. When I opened the carton I was so surprised as it was exactly what I was looking for and wanted. Grand Slam! I tried both options of installing or not installing the legs and opted for keeping the legs on. I could not be happier with my new purchase!", 
    "Perfect fit for our nightstand needs. Read reviews, decided to install sans legs, worked great. Son loves in his newly decorated room. Timely delivery, undamaged, well packaged.", 
    "I was so pleasantly surprised that this table was such great quality. I get nervous when purchasing online and not being able to actually see and touch a product. I highly recommend buying this table, it iw wonderful!", 
    "The prices are on the high side for Canadians - the product, when it finally arrived was almost $100.00 more than the listed price. I ordered the cherry wood colour which is warm. I had real problems with the DHLl people, I was back and forth with phone calls to find out when I could expect delivery. I took a day off work to ensure I would receive delivery.", 
    "I bought two tables for my living room. Only had to screw in the bun feet and they were ready to go. For the price, these tables are just beautiful. The top of one had a little ding on the edge, but i just turned the table around to hide it. Not worth the hassle of returning it.", 
    "After 4 years it's one of my best buys, you won't be sorry. It's hard to find this quality & price in furniture stores, which seem to be phasing out. I just bought another Birch-colored table from OS & it's a match, different style but same quality & value. Buy it before it's gone, all I had to do was screw on the legs. The storage & quality are awesome!", 
    "This table looks perfect in our lobby! The legs were super easy to put on!", 
    "These Birch drum tables are really nice and well made. Unfortunately they are too short for what I need, so I'm returning them. Too bad.", 
    "I love the style of this piece. The inlay and design are beautiful and it's not your same old square or rectangle end table. I have received compliments from almost everyone who has seen it! I will probably be buy another so I have a matched set!", 
    "We ordered 2 of these online and in less than a week they were delivered to our door. Beautiful finish.. just amazing how good these tables look. The only assembly was to screw on the four nob-type feet on each one. Very pleased at our purchace.", 
    "The table was well packed and easy to assemble by adding the 3 legs. No scratches were found and I love the look of the wood, though I doubt it is oak. It appeared sturdy and would look nice in a living room or as a bedside table. For the price, it was well worth it. I only ordered one, so cannot talk about the matching abiity. Very pleased.", 
    "These tables were exactly what I had been looking for. Color was good and height was perfect.", 
    "This was just the size we needed for our downstairs family room. That we have added storage is a bonus. Came all in one piece and we like that. Well packed and in perfect shape.", 
    "Uh oh! Just got a call that company's coming in 15 minutes; living room is a mess with magazines, newspapers, crafts. These elegant side tables are the perfect solution for a quick clean up without having to lift the lamp off the table to store busy work. Nice as side tables for sofa and chairs and lamps.", 
    "These tables are really nice and the round shape makes them perfect to fit in a room with limited space. I bought two, and have no regrets. The only issue I've found, which is not really a problem for me, is that they have three legs instead of four. This makes them a little unstable, so you have to be careful about not using them for support if, for instance, you use the edge of one to balance to pick something up off the floor. I've tilted one.", 
    "It's a good table to have. You can use it as an Accent table or a Coffee table.", 
    "right size....right color...shelf inside, extra space...price was right on....very happy with purchase.", 
    "Arrived well packed and in good time. Only needed to screw on the knob feet. The workmanship of the cabinet appeared to be high quality; the finish was nicely done. Color was as described and pictured in the product listing.", 
    "This table was exactly what we have been looking for to complete our living room., Color, quality and size are perfect. I was a little skeptical when the ad said some assembly required, but quite msurprized that all I hadm tom do was put on three legs.", 
    "Very nice end table that really fits into my decor and matches well with other pieces", 
    "Beautiful table exactly the color I was looking for.", 
    "We had previously purchased two \"barrell\" end tables and needed one more to complete our room. It had been two years since we bought the other two, but this one matched perfectly!", 
    "I bought this table as a bedside table for my guest bedroom, and could not be happier with it. The table is beautiful! I had priced comparable tables at local furniture stores, and didn't want to pay what they were asking. I came to Overstock to see if I could find something more affordable, and I'm so glad I did. When I told my husband I ordered the table and what I spent for it, he was convinced it was going to be piece of junk, so I was really happy when he was delighted with the quality. It comes fully assembled, except for screwing in the 3 feet. It is light enough that I can move it easily by myself, but is still sturdy. The door swings easily, and it closes firmly. The top is a gorgeous inlaid design that shows off the grain of the wood. Thank you, Overstock, for a terrific deal!!", 
    "I wanted a wood end table that would incorporate the other wood colors in my family room/den. This piece was perfect. Looks and feels more expensive than actual cost. I won't let anyone set anything on it LOL . It was packaged well , all I had to do was slide it out and screw the bun feet onto the bottom. But mind you it doesn't appear to be an assembled piece of furniture. Very please with this purchase. This item would also serve well as a nightstand. Great item - great price - I very seriously doubt you would be disappointed with this purchase. One review had a problem with 3 legs - mine is on carpet I hadn't noticed any stability issues. You cannot buy a product of this quality for this price even if they were having a good sale. It's just a great piece for the price:)", 
    "I have looked at this piece for over a year online. Always hesitated because of the super low price. Finally ordered after reading the reviews once again. The table arrived fast and in perfect condition. The Birch Drum Table is awesome, I love it! My husband could not believe the price when I told him. The quality of this table is excellent and color is as pictured.", 
    "I love this little table which arrive substantially put together. It is perfect for next to my chair and storage is a very nice feature.", 
    "i am really enjoying this piece. Looks great. construction seems to be okay. not a really expensive but for the price it is really nice.", 
    "This is a stylish, good-looking & functional table. Was very pleased with the quality & the finish. The only negative thing I have to report is that upon delivery, I found that the table packed in a box within a box. I opened the first carton to discover another box that had loose tape barely holding it closed. I went to pull the table out of the box & saw that it looked like the table had either fallen or had been dropped on its side at some point. There were cracks & splits in the molding around the circle top, along with peeling finish from the damage of being dropped. Because of the box's size & the cost of shipping it back, I kept it. I think the table looks great & would recommend it to others, Hopefully yours will arrive undamaged. Luckily the damage was on the circumference's rear side, so the damage isn't as evident to those looking from the forward direction. I used touch-up furniture markers to darken the cracks & splits. Its a nice table, provided it arrives in good condition!", 
    "I am very happy with these tables. They match perfectly with my other furniture. I would definately recommend them to anyone who is looking for a side table for a smaller space. We are using them as nightstands and they are a perfect fit. The shipping was also extremely fast.", 
    "We bought the table to go between a couple of couches we bought from overstock. The round shape gave us the flexibility to put the couches at an angle to each other. We like the covered storage and the fine finish. To protect the top from wear, we bought a glass top from a local glass shop (17.25\" in diameter, 0.25\" thick clear glass)", 
    "I received this table a little more slowly than typical with Overstock. The shipper said it was due to bad weather although none existed where it was being shipped or between here and there. I could not get an adequate answer from UPS or Overstock. Neither knew anything when I called. However, the table itself finally arrived in good shape. It has a few dings and nicks, but for $*** it looks great. My family was impressed. The legs which are screwed on after delivery render the table unstable which is what other reviews said. I use it without the legs and it looks as if it were designed that way and works very well.", 
    "I am very happy with this product. From the color to the detail on the table. I just had my bathroom remodeled with nice cabinets put it and I wanted to put something by the bathtub to put a candle or a book on. When I saw this in your catalog I had to order it. It looks perfect with the cabinets I had installed. The detail on the table matches the detail on my cabinets. The round feet also match. I am so very happy with my purchase- thank you!", 
    "Simply gorgeous, elegant, well-made piece of furniture! I use it beside a chair in my family room and it is perfect. Went above my expectations for the price!", 
    "A beautiul additiion to the family room, and a good place to store items I perfer not havie on display. It is the perfect size for next to the sectional sofa. I purchased a round placemat for the top so as to protect it from being marred by drink containers. Have already received compliments on the table. A very good value for the price.", 
    "Really happy with this. I wanted an accent table for a corner in the hallway and this was perfect with a lamp on it. Bottom legs on table are even and do not cause the table to tip \"wobble\", like some other reviewers mentioned. Looks very nice and the storage area is plus. Great value!", 
    "Beautiful table with swing out door and storage inside. Very easy to order from Overstock. Came when they said it would be here. Would recommend.", 
    "a very nice side table-lots of storage and good quality", 
    "We ordered two of the end tables. They were packaged very well, lots of bubblewrap and cardboard. They took alot of care when packing. The color of the tables match the photo perfectly. We purchased glass tops to protect the finish of the table tops. We did alot of research shopping for end tables before purchasing these tables. End tables of this quality cost at least twice as much at our local furniture stores. We are completely satisfied with these tables and would recomend to anyone. They have lots of storage space, perfect fpr magazines, remotes, etc.", 
    "Perfect to hide all my \"stuff\"!!! Remotes, magazines, books, crocheting projects. It blends well with almost any decor.", 
    "I have purchased 2,..... LOVE them! Very happy...could not find anything like this at any store around here....and the price was great!", 
    "Love my new tables..I brought two..I did not put the feet on the tables..I think they look better w/o them.", 
    "I decided to order this against the reviews that it was unstable and questionable. It looked like a nice piece and I was willing to take a chance on it. It is a very nice piece and I'm happy overall, but I do see what people mean by the \"flimsy\" stability factor. It really SHOULD have had four feet on it. You'd think three would create the perfect tripod balance, but it doesn't, and I, too, considered removing the feet and allowing it to sit on its base. However, the footed look was one of the reasons I bought it in the first place. Overall, it's stable enough to display what I have on it. If you have large animals or rowdy kids nearby, you might wish for an alternative (or certainly remove the feet), but then again, why would you want a piece like this around large animals or rowdy kids to begin with? For the flimsy factor alone, I give it 4 stars. Otherwise, very nice accent piece, nicely priced, convenient storage, and aesthetically enhancing to your decor.", 
    "We are very pleased with our purchase but there were a few very small Knicks in the wood. Friends visiting this weekend are going to purchase one as well", 
    "Came well packaged. Very pleased with table. Perfect for small end table.", 
    "I love this table. The door opens and closes perfectly, and hides keys, magazines, mail, etc that normally clutter a room. It is well-made and looks like very expensive furniture.", 
    "I love this table. It's large enough to serve as a chair side table and small enough not to be intrusive. I thought I was replacing a large end table for my couch but when it arrived and we put it in the room it fit perfectly by my leather chair and ottoman. The color is beautiful and its neutral enough to go with my eclectic mix.", 
    "This is a perfect side table. Good height, weight and top area. The storage is an added bonus. Very attractive piece.", 
    "Great value, comes assembled except for feet, fast delivery", 
    "It's a pleasure to receive a product that's virtually ready to go when you remove it from the box! The round legs were easy to screw in, and the table was stable and solid. I was a bit put off by the strong new-varnish smell inside the table, but I'm hoping a good airing-out will fix that--and it isn't detectable when the door is closed, anyway. There are imperfections--varnish drips and a few scrapes--inside as well, but the outside is fine--and the finish is very warm and attractive. All in all, a good value. I wouldn't hesitate to order another one, if I needed it.", 
    "The only, very minor, complaint is that this table only has three feet on it. I only tipped it once, when I was supporting my weight while bending over to pick up my glasses the cats had knocked off. I got it to replace a lamp with a little glass table around the base of the lamp, which was very tippy. This one works well with the cats jumping on it all the time. They don't tip it over, so it really is exactly what I wanted and I love the enclosed storage it has.", 
    "This accent table worked out just as I hoped. It is the right height next to my sofa - and a good space for a remote, magazine or drink. The curved door opens and closes easily - and it has magnetic closures which work well. The storage space is ample and keeps clutter hidden away. My only complaint is that the storage area had a strong smell when it arrived (probably from the stain and varnish). I left it open in the garage for a week to air out and sprayed a little lysol inside. That took care of the odor. I did not install the 3 round feet because I didn't want to add extra height.", 
    "I bought this table for my son's new house and he loved it! I told him what I paid and he was shocked as he has been furniture shopping for a month. I love shopping from Overstock, you never disappoint!", 
    "Very pleased with this drum table. It is quality and just perfect for us.", 
    "I had seen this on Overstock and wondered about it, then I saw it in a local furniture store on \"SALE' for almost $300. I ordered and am amazed at the low cost, speed of delivery, great packaging and lovely appearance. This is a nice little accent table, it looks like much more than $$$. I am pleased and my never purchase anything again until I have checked Overstock.", 
    "Product exceeded expectations!!! looks exactly as is advertised", 
    "The product is as described. Shipping was a concern as noted above but Overstock was very helpful. They referred it to the shipper promptly and gave us a full refund.", 
    "These tables are absolutely beautiful. The wood and finish is very high quality. I was surprised at the quality vs the price of the tables. Lots of complments from friends. They were the perfect size and height for my sofas.", 
    "This is a very nice piece of furniture that goes great with our new couches. The round design along with the storage compartment makes for a nice place to store magazines etc.", 
    "This table is beautiful and looks great in our living room. It's just as I pictured. Daughter loves it just as much and may want one for her house.", 
    "Very nice end table and look great with our leather couch and hard wood floors. Complement the room nicely. The storage area is roomy and a very nice bonus. Others have mentioned the tables as tippy. We placed felt pads under the bun feet and the tables are quite steady. Just needed to screw on the feet when they arrived. My teenagers put them together for us. I would recommend to others and we are pleased.", 
    "Love the table. It is not real big which is great for my small room. I also like that it opens for storage.", 
    "This piece of furniture added class to my living room. And, the assembly was a breeze!", 
    "I bought this product because of my brother's purchase- this is a beautiful addition to any room; it is well made and with a minimum of upkeep required for any good furniture item, you should have a table that will serve you well for a long time.", 
    "This table is sturdy and well-made, with a very nice finish. I left the legs off because I liked the height of it without legs. It's the perfect chairside table and the extra storage inside is a bonus.", 
    "Lovely quality piece we use as an end table. The storage inside is larger than expected.", 
    "Purchased to replace a wobbly TV-table next to a recliner. A very nice upgrade :) Added a thick round glass topper, which protects the surface and adds weight and stability. Considering purchasing a second table in the other color (Espresso). Thank you, Overstock.com!", 
    "Pleasantly surprised how well it Looks. Looks great in my bedroom with the cable box on it.", 
    "This table is georgous. I purchased two of these mainly because of the color and then the roundness. They are a good match to my entertainment center. However, beware of the cherry finish coffee table that is shown in the grouping as being purchased with this end table because the color is totally different. The color is just what its name reads--Cherry. The end tables are the true color shown in the online photo.", 
    "This is used in an office - for when the inflatable bed is needed for a guest. We put the lamp there for bedtime reading, and the look is good for price.", 
    "Craftsmanship is very good for the price. We have received complements since we put it in the livingroom. Happy with purchase", 
    "Love the tables. The color is perfect for our den. The inside storage is nice to place items you don't want to be out to clutter the room.", 
    "The birch drum table was delivered quickly via UPS and really has a nice look. Quality was good, overall a great value for the money.", 
    "Such a lovely birch drum table....so affordable and looks very expensive....love the fine workmanship and so easy to assemble for only needed to put feet on!!!!!", 
    "The quality of the table is as good as any high end furniture store.", 
    "Great side table for my basement bedroom, it looks great and expensive.", 
    "the table was a bit smaller than I thought it would be. Also has a built in shelf in the middle. Would have preferred larger table with adjustable shelf, but for the money was a good purchase.", 
    "We needed a table for a spot with no real space at the end of the couch. This is perfect a little in front and to the side of the couch..", 
    "I would like highly recommend this table!!! It is more beautiful than I had imagined and the size and quality are perfect!!!! Beautiful addition to our seating area.", 
    "Just the right size for a small side table or even a small bedside table. I chose not to use the legs provided with the table, but they look nice; I just didn't need the extra height. Very pleased with purchase.", 
    "Easy to assemble and beautifully made. Wood grain is excellent and rich.", 
    "Love this table. Roomy and a great end table. Color is great! If you are looking for a great table for storage this I would recommend and the price is -worth it all!", 
    "This is not fine furniture, but for my use it is perfect. I just need a reasonably sized end table to go next to my sofa and not take up too much room. This absolutely fits the bill and looks very nice doing so. While the finish on the wood is not quality like Ethan Allen for instance, it is pretty good and actually looks better than it is. I can't explain the other reviewer's problem with the feet becuase mine is perfectly stable with the feet on. I did decide to put a glass round (from Pier 1) on top to keep it looking nice because my experience is that less expensive pieces like this are not terribly durable. That said, I'm very happy with the purchase and think it is an excellent value.", 
    "I like the table a lot. It is pretty and doesn't look like every other end table in the world. I loved that it came fully assembled except for the feet. The feet cannot be used anyway because they are spaced wrong and make the table unstable. I think I would like the height of the table better with the legs but it's not worth the effort it would take to stabilize. But I knew about this problem before I bought the table, thanks to reviews that I had read and I like the table well enough that I would purchase it again.", 
    "I was looking for a small end table that was different and this fit the bill perfectly. When we unpacked the table and set it up (had to put the \"feet\" on, we found the door would not stay closed. the magnets were not installed on the door itself. We called the manufacturer and in less than a week the little magnets arrived. Problem solved and it looks great in our living room", 
    "Arrived quickly and packed very well. Only had to screw the feet on. Holds more than I thought it would. I can store extra pillows in them for guests. Perfect height by the bed. I plan to get some glass cut for the tops to protect them since they are so beautiful.", 
    "This is a beautiful table. It gives me more storage for my books and a blanket I always keep close at hand for a quick nap. The storage is bigger than I thought it was going to be. So, yes, I am quite pleased with my purchase.", 
    "I ALWAYS study the customer reviews and decided to take a chance. I'm so glad I did. The delivery was on schedule, and the packaging assured safe transit - no scrapes, dings, etc. The table fits beautifully in the right angle between two recliners; the round shape gives the traditional decor a nice difference without drawing attention. The storage is just what's needed. A wonderful purchase.", 
    "LOVE LOVE LOVE! Great purchase for my living room. Love that it opens and you can fit books or coasters inside.", 
    "I have been looking for quites awhile for some side tables in my living room that had some storage yet were stylish and not too bulky or cheap looking to offset the large leather couches. These fit in perfectly both in size and functionality. But the major selling point was the rounded construction and classy look.", 
    "I cannot think of anything negative about these tables, the shipping was very fast, the items came in in great condition, the 3 legs assembled in seconds, one of the tables had a lacquer smell but that dissipated overnight. I am extremely please with them", 
    "Overall I am quite pleased with the table and I was very impressed with the packing. There was no damage. I tried to look for a similar table in Australia, but couldn't find one of that shape or quality. I was also impressed with the fast delivery.", 
    "Bought these for our living room a couple of years ago; wanted small tables as the living room is small. They fit the bill exactly! When daughter moved into a new house she was looking for something with rounded edges as she now has a little one who just started walking. When I told her these were on sale again, she asked me to order them for her. She loves them, too! They work perfectly with her new furniture and she turned the doors around to face the wall so the little one can't get into them but she can still keep stuff in there. Great buy!", 
    "I got this to go between two recliners in a den type room and it fits perfectly. There is not a ton of room for a lamp and much else on the top, but I don't use a lamp in this room. I almost always look for tables that have storage and this one has tons for its size. I also love the shape since everything else in the room is so angular.", 
    "Just the right size to fit in my small home library. Great for a reading lamp with some room left for glasses, note pads, etc. Like the pattern on top.", 
    "I bought the drum table to replace a water damaged end table... I am not disappointed at all!", 
    "This is a small piece. I am using it as a night stand in a bedroom, rather than in a living room, although would look fine in living room too. My other furniture in living is larger in size. This is not a large piece, so make certain that you are tuned-in to the measurements.", 
    "This table is nicer than those in furniture store at half the price. I really like it.", 
    "this table is replacing an oblong magazine rack. it is a real looker plus it has storage inside. everyone that has seen it is impressed. the quality is wonderful. my husband is liking it very well. it sits next to his recliner abd is big enough to hold his things.", 
    "Table was packaged very well, really well protected, arives on time", 
    "There is a bit of a chemical smell inside, so I left the door open to air it out. I put a tall lamp on the birch table and it really looks great. I find it to be a nice accent piece and am glad I purchased it.", 
    "Beautiful table! Well made, heavy and rich color. Would highly recommend.", 
    "I read many of the reviews about this table and I have to say the ones pointing out the \"problems\" are very accurate. The table comes with three bun feet that are spaced in such a way that the table can tip under some circumstances. It won't fall over on its own, but if my cat jumped on it or someone leaned on it, it would tip and I personally didn't want it banging up my wood floor or breaking my lamp. A table really should be stable so this is a design flaw. We fixed the problem like many others by removing the bun feet. We feel the height is actually better this way as the table with the legs is a little tall. The wood is nice and design is nice. It does not look like a cheap piece of furniture so for the price it is a nice accent for my family room. How it will hold up remains to be seen. I like the storage and that was mainly why I purchased this table. The color has a bit of red in it, but it's a nice rich combination of colors that is attractive. It did smell a bit right out of the box, but any new product that has been packaged right after manufacturing typically will. They spray chemicals on it and that will go away after a day or so, but if you are sensitive to odor you may want to air it out in the garage. Overall, I am happy with the table. The tipping is a bit ridiculous just because you want furniture to be safe and sturdy, but removing the feet is a quick fix and the aesthetics are still there. Definitely measure out the size of the table in your space so you can figure out if it will work for you.", 
    "We had purchased these tables in the darker color thinking the birch drum was too light to go with other items in our living room. Moved those to the den because they were almost black and they worked great with our TV stand. These are now in our living room and match other end tables and the fireplace in a nice deep cherry. Very rich looking and a great value.", 
    "I WAS A LITTLE UPSET THAT IT ARRIVED DAMAGE. ALTHOUGH MINOR. IT IS FOR A RENTAL PROPERTY, SO IT WILL BE OK. IF IT WAS FOR MY HOUSE, I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT. I WAS SURPRISED IT WAS DAMAGED THE WAY IT WAS PACKED.", 
    "This table not only is flawless it looked just like the picture. Looking at the picture I thought it may match a desk that I had purchased It looks like I bought them together at the furniture store I have many compliments on it", 
    "This table fits perfectly into a space created when we purchased 2 new chairs. The size, height and shape are all very pleasing. We don't find accuracy in the the comments on the table being unsteady because of its three legs. Ours is very steady on its 3 legs.", 
    "I needed a small but sturdy bedside table and this fit the bill perfectly! It is made well and passes for a much more expensive item.", 
    "The table is beatifull and great cuality, good buy for the mooney, very happy with the table.", 
    "I love these tables....they add nicely to my decor and I like the storage inside!", 
    "This is a perfect end table for our sofa. I found the feet a cinch to install, and I haven't experienced the lack of stability that other reviewers have mentioned. I did a lot of research before ordering this table, and I'm 100% satisfied.", 
    "At first glance the drum tables were beautiful, then on closer inspection I noticed a gouge mark on the table lid just over the table door. Not amused. I put wood putty in it to find out that the composition felt like cardboard paper. I didnt want to have cardboard for an endtable. I prefer wood.. For the price it was a little too much. I have ordered other furniture items from Overstock.com. I wish there could be more description. Try to get more wood item made in the United States..I thought I was getting domestic items..", 
    "Great looking piece of furniture. We actually purchased two; one for each side of our couch. Very pleased with limited assembly requirement. Assembly limited to screwing on three legs. Did not find the same problem with leg location that I read in earlier reviews. The legs on both of my side tables were space appropriately and add a great look to them. The storage area includes two shelves with ample room for a variety of storage item. Very, very pleased with our purchase.", 
    "Unlike other reviews I did not have any issues upon receiving this side table. Coloration was accurate to the description & picture. Picture was a little deceiving because it made the table look shorter & fatter, but I read the dimensions & realized the acual size was just what I needed for my living room side table. I've been very happy with all my Overstock purchases.", 
    "I like classic pieces that don't rush out of style in a few years, but I also don't like spending a lot of money for heirloom quality furniture. This table reminds me of many pieces I've seen in homes for many years. I would fit in with almost any classic American design scheme, like colonial, craftsman, mid-century, etc. I thought the use of the different woods is quite nice. It's in my living room right now with a lamp on it as an end table, but can go into another life as a bedside table or chairside table in another room. I expect to get my money's worth out of it. As for the \"tipping\" problem, if you put weight only on the front part it is a little tippy. Put any weight like a lamp in the middle and never use the table as a support for your own weight (never a good idea!) and it should be fine. Also, actually keeping stuff inside the little cabinet like games or magazines, etc. will help with the weight issue. I like this piece and am glad I bought it.", 
    "Great table for the price. Arrived in perfect shape. Love the storage!", 
    "Deliverd without any problems. Well packed. Arrived in excellent condition.", 
    "I had to reorder the first table because of damage to rim of table. The second table showed stain running down in several areas and indentation in one area on bottom of table.", 
    "Great little side table. Lots of storage for the size.", 
    "2 purchased~ 1 perfect and 1 is not~ not a matching pair. Very similar in stain color but not design. The stain is darker than it appears online and has more brown undertones, which was perfect for me. Both were packaged very well. The one that arrived damaged had splintered wood along one edge, which may have happened in production because the stain covered it but you can easily see it, if the table is turn. It just so happens, it is on the side or near back side and can hide it somewhat. Returns are such an inconvenience. These would be perfect 5* if they were a little taller; however, I got what i expected from the dimensions and reading other reviews. I also aired them out in the garage overnight as mentioned in the othe reviews and the smell disappeared.", 
    "This is my second order of this table. I loved the first one so much that when I needed a table in a new place, I did not hesitate to order this style again. It is sturdy, well made, and contains some much needed storage. I love that it comes assembled. Only the legs need to be screwed on. Arrives well packaged too. No damage would dare happen to this table in transit.", 
    "First I would like to say I had kept an eye on these for nearly a year and when I felt the price was right and I could afford them I bought two. Then when they arrived each one had a defect front and center. I was so disappointed but had waited so long to get them and didn't want to go through the hassle or returning them. So I just try not to look too close at them and deal with it.", 
    "thiis is a great table! Easy to assemble. Very elegant. I love this table", 
    "I was overly pleased with the drum end table. The finish has embedded design. Wide door opening makes it easy to put things in and out. The two shelves are spacious. Wonderful overall.", 
    "Just slap on the legs and you are good to go. Was satisfied--it was a little larger than I expected.", 
    "I have a number of cherry wood accent pieces in my living room-dining room area. This drum table is perfect in shape (rounded edges) and high enough to be used aside a chair with lots of storage space inside. Quality craftsmanship.", 
    "I ordered two of these end tables. I was drawn to it because of the color and design, and because it is made of solid wood and not veneer. I am really glad I made this purchase! The tables are beautiful from any direction from which it is viewed. As one reviewer noted, with the 3 pedestals in place it can be knocked over. I don't have any toddlers in my house so I don't foresee that being a problem. It really isn't \"easy\" to knock it over; you'd really have to put some weight on it to bring it down. The only reservation I have is that I am sure a hot or cold drink placed on top of it will ruin the finish so I am going to buy some 18\" glass rounds to place on top of them. Otherwise, they are a beautiful addition to our living room.", 
    "Small drum, excellent quality. Perfect for an end table where round works better than angled.", 
    "The table was placed between two arm chairs and compliments the room nicely. Great value for the price; love the interior storage.", 
    "I love the table it is absolutely gorgeous. I made a good choice. The wood is beautifully stained, the legs are round.", 
    "We ordered two to use as nightstands. They arrived very timely and packed EXTREMELY well. The color is exactly as pictured. We chose not to install the feet per the previous reviews that stated the 3 feet make it unstable and we didn't want them that tall anyway as our bed is kinda low. So they were ready to use as soon as we unpacked them.", 
    "This item is a beautiful final addition to my living room. It was wonderfully packaged so it arrived without a scratch. Just had to take it out of the box and add the feet! I love this and would highly recommend to anyone who needs an accent piece.", 
    "Beautiful table. It is a little more red than in the picture, but I think it will work just fine in my family room next to a small recliner. If you're looking for a large side table, this one isn't the one for you, but if you're looking for something a little smaller, it's perfect. Bonus is that it has a shelf inside AND you don't have to put it together. Just screw the feet in place.", 
    "This table is perfect between two chairs in my living room. The feet attached easily and I didn't have any trouble with the balance of the table like some of the reviews stated. It is very expensive-looking, is sturdy and has lots of storage inside. Just check the dimensions to make sure it is the size you want.", 
    "Very nice looking accent tables that look like the should cost a lot more. The quality looks decent but the stain is not applied that cleanly in the hidden areas of the table. It's just a wood veneer over particle/or mdf. The screw in legs will not easily cause the table to tip over as other reviewers noted. I was concerned about this so i tested it myself and tried to nudge it over using my palm and elbows. It doesn't tip over unless you hit it pretty hard.", 
    "We purchased two of these tables as end tables for our living room. They arrived packaged beautifully, and in perfect condition. The wood color is pretty - cherry-colored, which matched other items in the room. We were concerned about stability after reading other reviews. The three round legs seemed like plenty of support, however, so we have been using them with no problem. The table is pretty and functional. (Love the storage space!) I recommend that you measure your space before buying these - they seem like short little tables, and if you are expecting something bigger you may be disappointed. We were very happy with them; the quality seems very good for this low price.", 
    "This table is exactly what I had been looking for. It was the perfect size for my needs. I expected to pay more for a table like this, and was delighted at the excellent quality. It was packed very nicely and all I had to do was screw in the 3 feet. It also has ample storage!", 
    "I love this table! The color is gorgeous, it's exactly as pictured, the height is perfect. The detailing is beautiful, and it looks expensive. It was packed VERY well, with fitted cardboard inside the box, wrapping, and styrofoam. It arrived quickly with absolutely NO damage or scratches. Assembly is very easy--find the feet in the box inside the table, screw them on. It isn't wobbly at all. There is a strong lacquer smell, but I am sure that it will dissipate quickly.", 
    "I am quite pleased with the table but would have been happier if it was a little larger.", 
    "legs do not wobble - a concern of mine from a previous buyers comment - the color compliments my grandmothers antique funiture and blends well with my burlwood armoir", 
    "Lots of storage for a little piece! It's got beautiful graining in the wood. My only complaint is that the fit and finish of the piece where the barrel fits into the bottom is a little sloppy. I'm pretty sure this is visible only to me and no one else upon a casual glance. I have gotten many compliments on the piece.", 
    "Very pleased with this table. It is very nice and attactive.", 
    "We love the end table as it an attractive piece and it looks just like the picture. I would only suggest that the manufacturer make it with four feet instead of three for greater stability.", 
    "Awesome piece of furniture, was exactly as described, great quality, it does not tip as some reviews have given and does not smell as some other reviews have been given. perfect size as side table for chair... The inlay is beautiful.....very expensive looking accent table for the price. I priced them in local furniture stors and never could find anything under 280.00", 
    "This is a lovely table and sits perfectly beside my wing backed chair. Even holds a small lamp. This was an excellent purchase for the money and looks great.", 
    "We were pleasantly surprised with the appearance and quality of the table. The size is perfect and we are very happy that we were able to find this product.", 
    "I was so happily surprised by the detail and beauty. We are using it as a small coffee table between two love seats.", 
    "I love this table and I am considering ordering another. The price was a bargain, yet it looks like a very expensive piece of furniture.", 
    "The birch drum table is very nice. The only issue is the door is hard to open and close.", 
    "The table is well made and well packaged. It arrived within the specified time. The top and side vaneer is very well made and the side walls are substantial.", 
    "This is a nice table. The finish is a pretty \"cherry\" red. It looks more expensive than it is. Pay attention to the dimensions, because we can't fit much more than our lamp on the table, but for us, it was the perfect size.", 
    "I ordered two of these tables, they were delivered in great condition. They look beautiful in my great room. Perfect size for my room (on the smaller size) Great quality. I have ordered many things on O.co Have been happy with all my items. You will not be disappointed with these tables", 
    "This is a great end table with plenty of storage space. Well worth the money!!! Just wish they made it 4 legged instead of 3 legged. would have been much sturdier that way.", 
    "We use this in the bedroom as a night stand to hold one beautiful lamp. The storage is nice and easy to access.", 
    "I really do like these table for my formal livingroom. The quality is good but not great I think that if these tables got a lot of use they would not hold up as well. For a room that is not used all that often these tables are perfect.", 
    "I would purchase another one if I had room for it. Would recommend this to a friend. Have purchased several items from Overstock and all have been as described.", 
    "This is a nice table. I purchased a chocolate love seat, paisley chair, pocket watch clock and this table from O for my small den area. It has been transformed. The table added such a nice touch. It arrived well packaged and assembled except for the feet - two minutes to screw them on. There are nice details to the table -- looks much more expensive than price I paid -- have received so many compliments on the table (and the whole new look of the room). Overstock had everything I needed to transform my room into a comfortable den area. Don't know what I would do without O!", 
    "Description of product was very accurate. No problem with delivery. Packing was more than expected. Very pleased with the tables.", 
    "Good value, easy assembly, fine appearance, prompt delivery! Thank you, O.com", 
    "This perfect little take with hidden shelves fits very well in my little apartment. The size, quality and price were wonderful.", 
    "I am very impressed with this table. Very high quality, excellent finish, very nice addition to our living room. The finish did off-gas for about a week, so airing it in a garage or basement for a week before taking it to the final resting place might be a good idea.", 
    "I needed smaller end tables for my small living room. These are a nice size & look more expensive than they were. I opted to leave the \"bun\" feet off, so i would not have to worry about moving them to vac. underneath. I also like that there is some storage in them, important for small spaces!", 
    "I've been looking for a table to match a bedroom set I bought a few years ago - and finally I found one! Very lovely and well made.", 
    "Easy to put together. It looks more expensive then the price", 
    "great large space inside and much \"richer\" looking in person. Love it!!!", 
    "We needed a table for a certain spot in our family room and this table fills the spot beautifully. The wood is beautiful and the color is very rich. The barrel shape is unique to any furniture that we have and the storage space inside is a bonus. It was delivered exactly when we were told it would, and you can't beat the shipping cost! Thanks, Overstock.", 
    "This is the second one of these I have bought. It is just as well made as the first one I bought two years ago. We were happy to see it was still availble and ordered a second one to match the first and it does. Very well made and should last for a very long time.", 
    "Love it. Beautiful piece of furniture. Loved the curved door. Having just done a remodel on my kitchen I know how expensive curved wood is. Can't beat the price. Shelf is great for storing all remotes", 
    "These are very nice tables for the price. The size is just perfect for the room I had to put them in. They are just what I wanted. I would recommend them to anyone.", 
    "I actually waited for the price to come down before ordering this piece. It arrived within a week of my order, well packaged and intact. Assembly required screwing in three ball feet (by hand, no tools required). The table was exactly as I pictured it and exactly as described. Although it's made of various materials, and is light-weight, it has a solid feel. The finish is excellent and compliments other pieces in my decor. I especially appreciate the interior shelving, great place to stash and keep books being read. Perfect height to accompany a recliner or sofa.", 
    "This is a perfect accent/storage table for our piano room. We use it to store music books and sheet musit. It blends beautifully with our other furniture and is functional as well. I've never been dissatisfied with a product purchased from Overstock and will purchase again in the future.", 
    "good furniture for the money, we bought the dork wood first and then changed our mind and ordered two of the lighter style...", 
    "I was a little hesitant to order the table after reading of the problem with the legs by some reviewers. Apparently, the manufacturer corrected this and they are perfect! Very detailed and look much more expensive than they were. Can't find anything negative and best of all...they came assembled!!", 
    "This drum table is a beautiful, solid, rich looking, fine finish piece of furniture additional to my home. The extra two-shelf interior storage is definitly welcome in my home! I recommend this table to anyone.", 
    "This is a nice table. I needed a table just that size to fit by my sofa. It looks like it cost more. I'm very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Thanks Overstock, the drum table was exactly what I was looking for. Great color, bun feet and best of all. a shelf inside so I don't have to look at all that clutter!", 
    "This table is much prettier than the picture shows. My husband fixed the wobble problem by drilling new holes and moving the legs so as one would be in the front instead of the back. Even had he left if alone it would have taken a pretty heavy object to cause it to lean over. I like it so well I'm going to order another.", 
    "Beautiful table that looks great in my living room next to my couch. Nie storage underneath as well.", 
    "This table is fantastic. It is as exactly as described and extremely nice for the price. We spent $100 more on an end table from a furniture store and you would never know they weren't from the same place. We are thrilled to have this piece in our family room. Hubby put it together by attaching the legs to the base in very short order. The part that took the longest was breaking down all the packaging to put out for recycling, but it arrived without a scratch, so it was well worth the time.", 
    "This table is absolutely beautiful and a terrific addition to our newly redecorated living room. The surface of the table is even more lovely than the picture and the shape offers an interesting departure from the \"same old, same old\" tables. My friends love it and can't wait to show it off at our annual holiday open house.", 
    "very pretty well built. I bought this for my mother-in-law and she is picky and has expensive tastes. . .she loves it", 
    "This table exceeded my expectations. I had bought one at a local furniture store and when I got it home, the finish had drips so I returned it. That table cost more than twice as much as this one. This table is an excellent value. It was packed so well that the table was perfectly protected. Assembly consisted of screwing on the legs, a three minute job. I highly recommend this product!", 
    "This is a good looking drum table. The price is right too! I am thinking about purchasing the espresso drum table for my upstairs room.", 
    "I was so pleased with the two tables I ordered a third one.", 
    "I love this quality end table. It is perfect for my living room, next to my davenport. I was looking for a end table that had storage. This nice table fit my needs. It was a great price. Thanks, O.co!", 
    "The table is a great accent in my den. I can hide items inside. I like the detail design. I'm glad I purchased it.", 
    "I was very impressed with how carefully this table was packaged. Nice work. The table is nicely built and was easily assembled - only the feet needed to be attached. The design is quite charming with numerous quaint details such as the trim on the table top and the metal door latch. Inside is roomy and there is a shelf. The wood on the table top reveals the grain and is polished so that the entire piece appears to be much more expensive than it actually was. I was looking for an accent table that was unique and would add a touch of character to the room and I am very happy with this piece.", 
    "I love the table! There is one slight detail that is not perfect but not a problem worth mentioning. It adds character. I placed some map books, and a globe on the top with a beautiful magnifying glass next to the display. It is perfect!", 
    "I was very pleased with the table and I must say it looks more expensive than what the cost was.", 
    "The end table looks just great with the chair that I also purchased. My living is now completely finished", 
    "I have never written a review however after receiving these tables, I had to. I am floored at how rich and classy these tables are. The quality of the wood, texture and style is excellent. There were no damages to the tables at all upon delivery. Easy to lift - Easy to un-pack - Easy to set up. Delivery was within a few days of ordering on line through UPS. They fit anywhere in any room. They have added rich color, class and quality to my living room. I absolutely love them. The tables can be used with or without the legs provided. This table can easily be a side table for reading, an end table to a couch or sofa, or a nightstand next to a bed. Very versatile. Thank you Overstock.com!", 
    "I needed a small accent table in the living room. This table is a very good size in all ways. But what I really love is the storage! Now I have a place for catalogs and other things I need that I don't want to show. It's heavy, but even I managed to get it up the five steps to the house. All you have to do is put the feet on, and that could not have been easier. I'm very happy with this purchase!", 
    "I just love the color of this end table and the inlay is beautiful! I purchased mine about two and a half years ago and have never had any problem with it tipping over due to the three table legs (versus four table legs). It could be that at that time the legs were evenly distributed around the perimeter of the bottom. The table did have a bit of a smell at first, but that quickly dissapated and has not reoccurred. This is a perfect fit for a small space where you want add a table, chair and lamp. The added storage inside the table is a real bonus!", 
    "The table came fairly quickly. It was packaged very well. There was however a deep crack on one of the 3 round legs. It was obvious that the company who made the product tried to glue the crack instead of just milling a new one. They must think that the public is stupid and won't notice the crack. You could never miss the crack or the glue!!!!!!! I called the company and spoke with a very nice man. He Fed Ex'd a new replacement leg to me. I got it in 2 days and put the legs on the table. Perfect. How lovely! There is lot's of inside storage. Plenty of table top for a lamp, cup of tea and still room to spare. I've watched this table debating on wether to purchase it or not for 2 years. Glad I puchased it. It completes a reading nook in my bedroom. It matches my bed perfectly.", 
    "Very happy with my purchase. It was delivered quickly and packed well. One foot had a crack so I called customer service and it was replaced in a couple of days.", 
    "This table is exactly what I was looking for. I love it!!! The look of it is beautiful, elegant and it's the perfect size. I also love the storage inside of it. A perfect side table!!!!!", 
    "This table is VERY good for the price. I'm going to order another one. I looked in stores and on line and found nothing to compare with this at that price, not even close.", 
    "nothing else to sayI do not have anything else to say", 
    "This table was perfect to use in my livingroom. The size is compact yet it has good storage. I can store candles and smal knick nacks for other seasons in it. Adding the ball feet was a bree.", 
    "I love the storage inside this end stand. It is made very well for the price. I was surprised at the great quality considering the price. Very please with over stock. com", 
    "I've had very good experiences with Overstocked products, but this was an odd one. The door to the table has pockmarks all around its borders. They're not so visible that I want to go through the hassle of a return, but at eye level they are quite unsightly. Not up to Overstock standard at all.", 
    "Looks great in my living room. Came soon, and was packaged perfect. Love it.", 
    "I have been looking for a drum table for awhile, and all were out of price range. I saw this table on Overstock and decided to order. The price was in my range. I was very excited when it arrived in less then 4 days. The drum table was packed perfect and all you needed to do was screw the legs on the bottom of the table and set it up. I am thrilled with the table and I it looks beautiful in my living room. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a well made product like this drum table not to hesitate in ordering.", 
    "This little table looks even better than I expected", 
    "I purchased this birch drum table to replace an old piece that was no longer of any use to me. I needed a good table for all my electronic pieces and looked in different sites without success until I found this. It is exactly what I needed with a shelf and a large space inside for all my papers and snacks. And the price I paid for it is phenomenal - very uncharacteristic for something that is not particle board.", 
    "Table first received was damaged, but was quickly replaced. Return process was as painless as they could make it, with exception of me having to drive to a UPS store to drop it off. Received replacement table very quickly and love it - I would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "Marvelous table. It's the perfect size and the quality is wonderful. It was an outstanding value for the money.", 
    "I love this table. I only ordered one because I wasn't sure if it would measure up to expectations, but when it came and was unpacked, I was so impressed with the looks and quality, I decided to get another to match.", 
    "Need height of table so I know if I can use it in my livingroom.", 
    "We saw this table as exactly what we needed for a lamp table in our family room. We couldn't be more satisfied", 
    "I love these little tables. I bought two for my morning room, with the intention of painting them black. I wish they had come in black! I also like the extra bits of storage I get from them.", 
    "Great table. I just wish they were taller. I puchased one to use as a vanity with a glass vessel sink for a guest bath. I will have to add a little height to it. If it was taller I would have bought two for the guest room bed side tables. With the higher mattresses it is nice to have a bedside table at least 30 inches tall. This table would be great in a living room or den. It was packaged very well and all you have to do is screw on the three feet. Easiest piece of furniture I have ever put together. Great purchase.", 
    "If you need a small end table for a special place, this is the one. I am using it for my sitting space in master bedroom between 2 small sized chiars. its color matched my bedroom furniture, too.", 
    "This is a fabulous table and perfect size for the new television room we just added. I love the shelves which are very convenient and useful. The table was well protected in packaging and arrived with no damage. It was ordered and delivered within 6 days which was another very great thing.", 
    "Nice table. Was shipped quickly and in good condition.", 
    "Overstock has always provided products that matched or exceeded the description and I will continue to purchase from overstock and recommend them to my friends and family.", 
    "Great little table! I bought this table to go between two club chairs in my bedroom so I didn't want anything too huge. This is perfect. It looks great and doesn't take up too much room--just right for a lamp and to hold a beverage. Good storage also. Table arrived very well-packed, in perfect condition, and less than a week after ordering.", 
    "I cannot give enough wonderful comments about how thrilled I am with my purchase. I ordered one for my family room and when I saw how beautiful it was I immediately ordered another one for my living room.", 
    "Best buy that I've made in a long time. Very happy with quality, price and delivery", 
    "This is a really nice table with good storage. It is solid wood. I am using it without the feet- I like the way it looks and the extra stability. I plan to order another one for use as a night table by my bed. I have a C-Pap machine which will fit nicely in the storage area. I plan to use the feet and drill a hole in the bottom the the table so I can run the power cord for the C Pap. Excellent value for a solid wood table.", 
    "I was not disappointed and the two tables (I'm using them for night stands in a limited space). The arrived in good condition. (I've purchased many things from Overstock, and they have all arrived in good condition.)", 
    "This table works perfect next to our couch. It has nice storage inside.", 
    "I just received this table & I must agree whole-heartedly with the rest of the great reviews here. This table is simple excellent! I ordered it as a nightstand & it looks perfect! Highly, highly recommend it if you're looking for a great table with plenty of storage space. You cannot beat this price for such craftsmanship! Although the photo is a good liking of what to expect, in actual is exceeds it's expectations.", 
    "Wow, what a fabulous little end table. It came beautifully packed - not a scratch on it - and matched my furniture perfectly. The legs were super easy to put on too. I am absolutely thrilled with it.", 
    "This is a beautiful table. High quality and well just beautiful.", 
    "Had bought this table and liked it so much got a second. This quality of this table is much more expensive than what I paid for it at O. Had been very pleased with everything I have purchased here...", 
    "Bought the same drum table some months ago to use as a nightstand. Needed a second one to balance the room. Very pleased. Looks expensive and finishes off the bedroom beautifully.", 
    "Although most of the reviews I read were very good to excellent, I had my doubts that it could be that good. I was fully prepared to return it. To my happy surprise, the reviews were true. The table is well made, looks very good, fits exactly where I wanted it [as a bedside night table], and has decent storage for its size. My only quibble is that it opens only from left to right, and because it is next to the right side of the bed, it would have been more accessible if it opened right to left. I partly solved that by turning the table so that the door handle is positioned next to the bed, and opens toward the back. Yes, it means that the head-on appearance isn't as pretty as if the full door were showing, but it still looks good and now I can reach and open the door from my bed. Excellent value.", 
    "This is the third barrel table I have purchased through Overstock.com. I love them because they work well in limited space and the workmanship is very high quality. I have an espresso one in the guest bedroom with the darker furniture; a lighter painted one in the living room with the formal furniture, and now this one in the family room next to an oversized rocking chair. Highly recommended.", 
    "THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL TABLE! CONSTRUCTED VERY WELL...ELEGANT! MAKES A GREAT SIDE TABLE TO STORE LITTLE THINGS. YOU WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED!", 
    "Beautiful drum table. Great price. Arrived in excellent condition. I am very pleased with this purchase as I wanted a small table to place beside a loveseat in our living room. Also, I like the interior storage area.", 
    "I bought two of these tables to replace some old ones in my living room. The photos don't really do the tables justice. They have a really nice pieced veneer design on the tops, giving it a little more panache. They were packaged very well and arrived with no damage. All we had to do to assemble was put on the bun feet, which just screw on. They are very pretty, have ample storage inside and look really great with my leather sectional. I'm very happy with my purchase!", 
    "Arrived timely and in great condition. Nothing to put together except the feet. It is a good size to provide a perch for a reading lamp and has ample storage for smaller items. Good looking finish and a bit of decorative trim enables this piece to fit in with a variety of furniture styles.", 
    "I bought two tables for my family room. They are a bit smaller that I imagined. They are pretty and the interior storage is nice. There's not much room on top...especially if you have a table lamp with a wide base. Nice, warm color and decent quality.", 
    "Nice table perfect for accent pice with great wood detailing...arrived super quick", 
    "This is a very pretty little table that provides great storage and a convenient place to put a drink. It has a classic, traditional look and looks more expensive than it is. The veneer did chip in one small place, but only after being severly abused by my two small boys. For most people, this would probably not happen. I'd recommend this table as a nice addition to a more traditional-style room.", 
    "This table arrived in perfect condition and was even prettier than it appears on the site. It looks very \"high end\" and the wood pattern (the diamond pattern) is very pretty and classy!! Highly recommend this table and Overstock.com. I have never had any issues with anything purchased from this site!", 
    "I just received this beautiful table. It is well made and it was so easy to set it up. Fast delivery. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The quality is great and it sure looks perfect at the end of the room at the corner where it looks perfect with a gorgeous bamboo plant on top! Love it!", 
    "I received the table today...very prompt shipping and delivery....the table is in perfect condition and just the size I was searching for. The wood is a bit lighter than the pictures, but is still an absolute steal and a great piece of furniture! The assembly is not an issue....my 90 year old mother could attach the legs!", 
    "The tables that arrived were in perfect condition, took about 1 minute to screw in the bun feet, and look much, much more expensive than they were. High quality product for a bargain basement price. Fits in perfectly with a Great Room containing high end furniture.", 
    "These tables are so nice for the price. The drum shape adds a touch of elegance, the color is warm. They make good use of space with the great storage area.", 
    "Very happy with appearance of table. The wood quality and design is real attractive. This table came packaged well with no problems.", 
    "This is a great little table. It is a beautiful color and the diamond design is very classy. It looks worth far more than the O price.", 
    "I just received the birch drum table.I am so satisfied with the look & the quality for the price.It offers great storage space inside a relatively small sized table.The packaging was done to perfection so it arrived in mint condition.I am going to order a second one to put beside another recliner in the living room. OS comes through again & with very speedy delivery as well.", 
    "This is a beautiful table. I bought one for me and liked it so much I bought another for my daughter. The woodwork is so much prettier than the picture.", 
    "Came just as it was pictured. Looked great! Beautiful wood finish, and everything.", 
    "Drum table arrived as expected....packed very well. This table is great for storage and size / quality. It is very good looking !", 
    "This end table is very well built and has a nice finish. It is not too light, nor too dark and matches my other furniture perfectly. The color is just as shown. My home is small and a drum end table is not large. Additionally, I needed storage to keep things out of sight. I keep my netbook on the one shelf and some paperwork on the other. I highly recommend this end table!", 
    "Very happy with my Birch Drum Table. Nice quality, Attractive side table. Liked the first one so well, I ordered a second one. FYI...finish has more of a \"red\" tone to it than I expected. Still, very pleased!", 
    "Received the 2 tables I ordered after work today. After just a few minutes to screw the feet in they are in place and being used. I am very pleased with the veneer design on the top and sides of both, exactly as in the picture. The cherry finish blends well with our other solid cherry furniture. The size is perfect as an end table for both the recliner and the loveseat, and ther storage is more than ample. One is storing all the games and gear, and I'm still scheming on what to stash in the other.", 
    "Great size and color. I used it for an end table. It works as a great accent table. The cute round shape is unique.", 
    "I was delighted when I received this table. It was purchased to complement an oval end table, in a location where I needed something smaller. The quality is very nice, and the finish was amazing for the price. The carton arrived very quickly, and all I had to do was assemble the three ball feet onto the bottom of the table. I could not be happier with this purchase, especially since I saw the same table for $199.99 on many other sites.", 
    "I ordered two of these 2 or 3 years ago and absolutely love them. I wanted some storage space to keep my books and things away from one of our dogs who will eat any paper within sniffing distance. My husband thought the picture on the website looked good but was very skeptical about what they would turn out to be when we got them. He was very, very happy when they came. They are very sturdy and really beautiful. They matched the other cherry furniture perfectly, and everyone that sees them thinks they're great and asks where we got them. I wish there was a coffee table to go with them! I most definitely recommend these.", 
    "We received this table today and found it to be well packed with no damage. The product is just as nice as the picture. The color and finish are very very nice. We could not be happier.", 
    "I bought this table to go beside a chair in our TV room. Super easy assembly. The pod legs are a simple screw in and the table is ready. Beautiful finish. Like the enclosed storage area as well. Bought to replace a table that long needed to be replaced. Don't know why we waited so long. Great purchase and extremely fast delivery. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "This table far exceeded our expectations ... it's just the right size for a table next to our sofa and it fits in well with our other antique cherry and mahogany furniture. It was easy to assemble and, although it only has 3 bun feet, it seems very stable. This is a great value for $$$ and we highly recommend it. THANKS, Overstock.com!", 
    "This is a beautiful table! My husband was surprised at the quality for the price. And like others mentioned, we've seen comparable tables in furniture stores recently that were selling for a lot more. As pictured, the wood does have a reddish tone to it. We have medium oak floors and I don't care for matchy-matchy furniture, so this looks good. There are some older pieces in the room in different woods and this looks just beautiful. For the price it's quite a bargain. The 3 bottom (bun style) feet just screw on. Everything was packaged very, very well. Thanks Overstock! There are 2 shelves inside the door.", 
    "This is a beautiful table for your living room or can be used as a nightstand in the bedroom. It was delivered quickly and in excellent condition. Don't hesitate to order this table, which also provides much needed storage.", 
    "I was very pleased with the birch drum table. It arrived in perfect condition although the packaging was a bit excessive - can't complain too much because it safely protected the contents being shipped. The one drawback is that there should probably be four legs instead of three. My granddaughter leaned on the table and it almost flipped over. Aside from that, a great buy and a great price. It fits nicely between my sofa and recliner, has a nice finish and an excellent storage compartment too!", 
    "the birch drum was the perfect selection to place between two club chairs in my family room. the door with the shelves inside is great to put away remote controls when not in use as well as magazines and miscellaneous papers. it was so easy to assemble...just screw on the feet! great piece of furniture that looks expensive and is functional as well.", 
    "I just received this drum table and it is very pretty, well-made, and a great price. I had checked other sites for a table similar to this, and they were all priced well over $300.00. I am very satisfied with it.", 
    "This is a beautiful, well-made and functional piece of furniture. A very good value. It fits very well in our livingroom/family room where our large screen TV is located. When not in use, coasters, TV remote, papers, comforter and other items are stored in its disguised compartment. If you are a \"wood\" person, you will enjoy this table.", 
    "The table arrived on time and was in excellent condition. I purchase this table to be use as a night stand. And it matches my existing furniture prefectly. I would recommend this table to anyone.", 
    "The table is really nice and matches my existing cherry furniture. I've had them about 1 month now. I first purchased 1 to make sure I liked the colour. Looks great.", 
    "Table arrived in good time - is everything I expected - except it has a couple scratches on the top. It was packaged and handled carefully, so these must have come from the factory before it was packaged. Will go out and buy a colored crayon and hope it fills in the spots. Bought it for use in my family room and sounds like too much of a hassle to send it back, so I will make do. I like the looks of it, and it fits nicely into the space I have for it. Just wish if I was going to get a table with scratches, they were on the bottom instead of the top!!", 
    "I am very happy with this table. It is very well constructed and the joinery is tight and even. The veneers are burled and the finish has a lovely patina that gives it old world charm. It was expertly packed to avoid any marring or other damage.", 
    "This table was exactly what I was looking for.The few I saw in stores were hundreds of dollars more and the quality was the same.The finish is beautiful, the table is solid.No one believes me when I tell them where I found it & how much I paid for it.", 
    "I ordered this birch drum table because I needed an accent table. This table worked out great and has a lot of storage space inside. The only assembly required was screwing on the feet. The table was packaged well and was in mint condition. I would recommend this table to anyone.", 
    "Quality of furniture is excllent and is well made.", 
    "A perfect complement to my family room! This table is as functional as it is beautiful! The polished wooden top is so eye-appealing and the little door in the front of the drum opens to a neat storage area...good for storing the remote control(s) and a couple of magazines. It is the just right size for use as an end table, but is unobtrusive! Buy it and you won't regret it! Five stars and kudos for the Birch Drum Table!!", 
    "The Birch Drum Table is just beautiful. I'm very pleased with the veneers on top and the same style detail on the side panels. The door has nice action and the topper was being able to easily put on the feet. There is more storage than I anticipated. I just love it.", 
    "I really like the design on this table. Assembly was easy. Table arrived well packaged.", 
    "Received this little table within one week. I luv it! It makes my living room look more spacious than before. If my budget allows, can't wait to order another one soon! (Hope it will be on sale again)! Thanks Overstock.com!!!", 
    "I love this little round birch table. I put it in a guest bedroom and it is perfect for storing necessities inside such as tissues, writing material, toiletry items and other such things that a guest might need. Actually you really could put this table in any room and it would look good. It doesn't take up much space and the wood finish is beautiful. I highly recommend it.", 
    "When I ordered this end table I was skeptical about gettin furniture online especially if I had to return it. I am happy to say that my table is beautiful and fits in with my decor beautifully. Delivery was quick and it came in excellent condition. Assembly was easy - did it my myself.", 
    "I needed a round end table for my living room It is not a large living room, so the choices were limited. I saw the drum table and read the reviews. I needed something that had some reddish color in the finish and ordered the table. The table arrived within a week in perfect shape. My husband just had to attach the three legs and we now have a beautiful table. The pattern on the top is beautiful and adds a very classy touch to a very affordable table. The color is perfect with my plain dark brown sofa and over-sized chair. I appreciate the reviews that people give online to help me decide what to buy. I would recommend buying this table to someone who likes a classy looking table that is very affordable.", 
    "These tables are perfect for bedside tables, which is why I purchased them, I didn't want run of the mill bedside tables....these are perfect! Would reccommend them as they are very well made.", 
    "This well made product looks elegant in my home, fulfilling my needs and adding to the overall decor.", 
    "This table is of excellent quality for the price. The finish is flawless and it is the perfect size for placing next to a chair.", 
    "I agree with the last comment. They look more expensive than what OS charges. I love the rich color and the shelf inside giving me more storage. I got 2 for beside my recliner and on the end of my sofa. Very happy with Overstock. I always go here first whenever I'm looking for something. The service is great.", 
    "This table is very pretty and looks far more expensive that what OS is asking for it. The storage inside is quite ample, and the design on top is beautiful. It can also be used without the ball feet. I'm using it between two burnt orange (OS calls it mahogany) leather chairs that I also bought from OS, and it looks GREAT. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The only assembly is screwing on the feet (if you want them on).", 
    "The stain is a triffle darker than the picture, but it came in perfect condition. The packaging was amazing, and it is just as described - just screw on the 3 feet on the table and it is good to go. I'm very, very happy with it.", 
    "Drumtable was well packed and the feet assembled in under 5 minutes. It is a bit more red that I expected and the grains are not as pronounced as I had hoped. Decent storage space. I would have given this table a 5 but the hinges are much more pronounced than the photos show. This does not ruin the piece but your friends with well trained eyes will be able to detect that it is not a designer creation.", 
    "This drum table was advertised just as I was looking for an appropriate table that would be completely exposed where it was to be used. The table was just the right one for using between two upholstered chairs that are seen from the back as you enter the room. Its understated elegance as well as its practical usefulness compliments the room. The door opens to reveal one shelf and plenty of storage. The warm birch wood color blends well into the decor of the room. The table was well packed to prevent damage in shipping. It only took a moment to attach the feet to the table and it was ready to be placed in the room. This was certainly an excellent buy and great value for the dollar. I recommend this table to anyone considering it.", 
    "Once Again, Overstock has scored a touchdown- Table arrives today without a mark thanks to the very good packaging. As I hoped, it fits right in with my other dark cherry/mahogany furniture. I love the geometric veneer on the front and back, nice contrast. This is about the 5th purchase of furniture and lighing that I have bought on Overstock and I love every piece Thanks again, Overstock!", 
    "I bought this as a temporary solution in a new home because I had not yet made my decision what wood tone I want. The table is really nice - pretty and a nice size and weight. This is a keeper", 
    "Excellent Value. I have been looking for a table like this to fit between 2 recliners and it fits perfectly. Price was gook. Delivered before I could even track it. Arrived in excellent condition, Just screw in the feet and it's all set. Color is same as the picture. I would definitely recommend this well made piece of furniture. The shelves behind the door are a plus.", 
    "I love this little table - I had a little space in my living room that just needed a \"little something\" and this is PERFECT. The legs screwed in easily and it was good to go. Even my teenager (who is critical of EVERYTHING) likes it and says \"it's cool\" (a RAVE for a teenager). The color also will blend with many different wood tones.", 
    "very pleased. Great look, beautiful wood and shape.", 
    "One of the best packaging jobs I've seen. The end table is perfect and has great detail and the color is as pictured. Having the option of using the ball feet on it is great. It will be in use for many years.", 
    "Love the color and finish., size and storage area. A nice change from th usual square shape.", 
    "These end tables are very nice, even if they cost more than they do. Very sturdy, heavy, well constructed. My husband is a woodworking expert (he doesn't have time to build me anything so I shop online for stuff and get it before he knows it..) They are just the right height for our bed, although if you have extra high mattresses or a higher bed frame, they may be too short. Beautiful wood grain on top and nice shelf inside -- lots of room. My husband said it looked like the stain/lacquer was sprayed from slightly above so a small area below the rosette at the bottom of the table was mssing some stain. You can't see it well, though. Overall, he said they are well worth the price...and he's one picky person.", 
    "Arrived very well packaged. Great that only had to screw on legs otherwise came completely assembled. Unit is very sturdy, well made, with interesting grains and has plenty of storage. Wood stain is a rich color. Well worth the money.", 
    "What a beautiful table this is. I had bought a recliner that had to be placed in a corner, in order for the chair to be able to recline. This is my \"command central\" when watching TV. Needed tables beside chair on both sides. Because chair in corner, left a strange shape for a table. Found these round tables here at Overstock, and decided that was the solution. Boy was it. Absolutely beautiful. I had guy who dabbles in the antique furniture market in his spare time, in my house, and without touching it or getting close to examine, he asked me if these tables were original antiques. Lovely tables at a great price. Although very affordable, these tables look as expensive as the other pieces of furniture in the same room that actually were expensive. Thanks Overstock.", 
    "From the look of the table in the picture on line the table looks nice. But to me, the picture doesn't do justice to the table. After receiving the tables, I fell in love with them. I like the products I get from Overstock.", 
    "Has luxurious and expensive look. We use 2 of those as a night stands as they match our bed well. Not very comfortable to use as they are pretty deep and you have to bend to reach inside. Assembly takes exactly 3 minutes.", 
    "I love these tables! They look like they cost a fortune...sturdy, well-crafted hardwood, deep, rich finish, perfect size. I bought two and can say without a doubt that they are the best end tables I have ever purchased (and I am one who fears buying ANYTHING without being able to put my hand on it!)", 
    "I received two drum tables, one was perfect; the other had two small clumps of paint/stain on the door. I like the quality of the tables, just the finish was not the greatest on the one. They were well packaged. I'll keep both.", 
    "birch drum table came packaged wonderfully no dents or scratches . the drum table is just perfect and funtional for my needs.finish of item is fine quality.i would recomend this table to family n friends. love the storage area, perfect for magazines and my knitting", 
    "This table is gorgeous. Nice heavy table, super attractive--am ordering another.", 
    "Great piece -- solid -- great finish - great workmanship - definitely worth the price!", 
    "It's what I been waiting for. I purchased this table to go in between my two leather chairs in my bedroom. It fits and looks very nice. One of the great things about it is it's already put together. All you have to do is screw on 3 round legs. Has two nice size shelves that will hold plenty. One door that opens and closes easily. The color is more of a two tone walnut oak. It's a little pricey, but other then that I like it and do recommend to all.", 
    "We are very pleased with this purchase. For the price the quality is great and no assembly required. The color is a little darker than the picture but fit in very nicely with our existing furniture. It is a sturdy piece of furniture with storage....love it!!!", 
    "The table came very quickly and was very carefully packaged. No imperfections in the finish/construction that I could find on mine. It was very easy to assemble - less than 5 minutes to put the legs on. To me, the table does seem slightly darker than the picture online, but that is not to its detriment. I have it in a living room with some walnut furniture and it works. It did have a lacquer/varnish smell initially, but after 3-4 days, that disappeared. I am quite pleased with this purchase and I would definitely recommend.", 
    "This table exceeded my expectations. I wanted a small bedside table that also had storage. It arrived within a week, no damage and the wood and wood veneers matched the picture. No MDF, plenty of storage space and only the legs had to be attached. Good value for the money.", 
    "It is often difficult to find a smaller, nice table to place beside a chair. This table did the job. It was well packed. The feet were not needed so they are stored in the table. It is not quite the quality of a table from a nice furniture store but was right for the price.", 
    "Was pleased with the size of the table and how easy it was to assemble. The woodgrain is very nice. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.", 
    "I must admit I was skeptical what the quality and color of these table would end up being. To my great surpise they are a very nice table. I chose not to use the legs and keep them lower to the floor. The color was almost identical to that shown online. I would definately recommend these tables.", 
    "I have been looking for something just like these tables. They are exactly what I wanted. The quality and color is exactlyas described.", 
    "My new end table adds a touch of class to my decor,with its beautiful rich color,and fine detailing. I received several compliments as to my good taste concerning my purchase matching my existing brown leather couch.", 
    "Very happy with the Birch Drum tables I bought. They look even better than the photo. A great deal. Safely packaged and speedy shipping for a low price.", 
    "I was very impressed with the quality and everything about this table. I have seen one like it in a furniture store for over $500.00 I bought the darkest one and it fits in perfectly with my dark wood furniture. It is the perfect size...I needed a side table that was not very large and had storage...I was not disappointed. I would have paid much more for it.", 
    "Very nice side tables, alittle missing stain in the cracks, fixed with a stain pin, have enjoyed them alot so far, nice compliments from friends on the tables", 
    "These tables are fantastic. Bought two for either end of a leather sofa - they are a nice change from the usual square or rectangle end tables, the wood is heavy and stained perfectly, and the star pattern on the top is a nice touch. The door opens to reveal much deeper storage than we anticipated, and the price was unbelievable. Keep up the good work, Overstock.com!", 
    "Beautiful piece of furniture!!! I highly recommend these tables", 
    "nice table that was great to get for such low shipping.Very roomy inside and very pretty.", 
    "Beautiful piece of furniture fits perfectly in small spaces. It arrived in perfect condition. Assembly took no more than a couple of minutes to screw the round legs. The interior has ample space.", 
    "This table is gorgeous - and for the price - even better than that. I somehow thought it would be smaller than it actually is - so I simply didn't screw on the feet - which come separately for you to attach - and it still looks wonderful - and is now the perfect height for my room.", 
    "fits perfectly in small spaces. A little unstained place on bottom so I moved it to a place where it wouldn't show.", 
    "This is a great piece of furniture. All I had to do was screw feet on. So easy installation. I love it because it is something I don't see everywhere.", 
    "We recently purchased two Birch Drum Tables and are very impressed. They arrived well packaged and undamaged. I'm pretty picky and gave them both a thorough inspection for flaws. One table had some sloppy varnish stains inside, but not enough to be a deal killer. The outside of both tables has excellent finishes. Assembly was simple...screwing on the legs. These tables have a rich look and feel. The only drawback is a moderate lacquer odor, that I suspect will go away in a few days.", 
    "I bought this side table a few years ago and it still looks as get as the picture! I love the detailed wood and it's very sturdy.", 
    "I was very pleased with this little table. It is well constructed and the finish is of good quality for the price.", 
    "Small, functional. A perfect complement in an eclectic setting. Easy to move, easy to unpack. The only thing I had to do was screw on the three feet! No tools needed!", 
    "I received my two Birch drum tables yesterday and I am so pleased. They are beautiful and so elegant. The color and style are perfection, much better than the picture. I'm using them in the master bedroom makeover and even my husband was impressed (that's not easy). Thank you Overstock for the quality product and for shipping my order so quickly. I will definitely continue to shop with you!!", 
    "We read reviews of this table being nice and good size. It had arrived today and we opened up the box. To our understanding of previous reviews of the product and its description, the table was supposed to be put together already. Just the three bun feet needed to be screwed in. Well when we got the table out of the box the door was not attached at all. Where the hinges are on the table the wood was split and holes were there. Like it had once been put together then it was broken off. So I don't know if shipping caused the damage or something else freaky happened. But overall this is a nice piece. Overstock chat helped me with getting a replacement shipped to me in the next 5-10 business days and they are sending out a representative from the carrier to inspect the package. So I know we will be getting a new piece and are being taken care of. Hopefully in a timely manner. We also have a Coffee table being shipped as well when we ordered this piece.", 
    "I had been looking for tables like this in the stores and couldn't find any. I wanted something with storage and ordered two. They were perfect and didn't have a big assembly, only screwing in the knobs at the bottom. They came wrapped well. There was some odor to the tables probably due to the stain and being stored in the boxes. You only noticed it when you smelled the table. The odor went away after a few days.", 
    "The drum table arrived on time and in perfect condition. It is beautiful and I see no flaws in the finish. The hardware is weighty and firmly attached. Assembly took 1 minute. It looks great and has a good amount of storage inside. As another reviewer mentioned, there is a strong varnish smell when you open the cabinet door. I aired it out overnight and it is gone today. I'm very happy with its look and feel.", 
    "This table is beautiful! I have it in my living room between two swivel chairs. I love the color and shape. It is exactly as it is pictured. It comes in a box all put together except for the bottom knobs (which you do not have to use) but I did to add height to the table. Love it!!", 
    "The product looks very nice and was extremely easy to assemble--just screw on the feet. It arrived quickly and in good shape. The only negative is that it had a very strong odor of varnish or some other wood finish; I would expect that to gas off and dissipate over time, but it was very noticeable at the beginning.", 
    "Excellent quality. You can not beat the price. Arrived without damage and on time.", 
    "I just bought a larger sofa and that lead to now needing a smaller end table. I googled '19 inch drum table' and stumbled upon this one. I read the details, measurements and the rave reviews. I clicked \"Purchase\". Soooo glad I did! The table is just beautiful and looks so much more expensive that it is! I did purchase the birch and the color is almost exact as the photo. It's small, but I was still able to fill the storage cabinet with 3 afghans. I am so very pleased with this table and the price was right too!", 
    "My wife and I have existing furniture from a collection by Powell Furniture (Jamestown Landing). We missed an opportunity to purchase a coordinating drum table a few years ago. A few months ago we saw this table and thought it looked like it would coordinate well. We ordered it. It's perfect. The finish it great and the look is what we wanted. It arrived in a well-packed carton with no blemishes on the finish. Thanks for handling this \"rare\" accent piece.", 
    "I am really happy with this drum table.The size is just perfect. It has a roomy area inside allowing to store books and magazines.The workmanship is very nice and I love the deep, intense birch color.The table arrived well packed and required only quick application of 3 feet. It was ready to go in 5 minutes.Would definitively recommend it.", 
    "A beautiful piece that goes well in an eclectic setting. Easy to assemble and a stunning finish..save a smal scratch on the base. I would reccommend this item to anyone.", 
    "I love this piece because it is actually solid wood and not MDF. How rare it is to find a lovely piece of solid wood furniture for such a great price. I gave it to my husband for Christmas.", 
    "I ordered 2 of these tables for my parents for Christmas. I had never ordered from Overstock before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The tables were as nice or nicer than any of the more expensive tables I was able to find in area furniture stores . I will absolutely order from Overstock again.", 
    "this table is perfect for between 2 chairs - has great storage and looks great! Much less expensive than many I reviewed. The assembly was so easy - just putting the feet on the bottom. Color was exactly as pictured.I am very happy with this purchase!", 
    "The table was a gift to my daughter. She loves it! I haven't seen it since we live in different parts of the country, but from what she says, it is beautiful. She is VERY happy with it and says it looks lovely in her living room. She loves the storage space which was what she especially wanted in a lamp table.", 
    "The Birch Drum Table was just what I was looking for in a bedstand table. It was a great value -- It looks more expensive than it was. It goes well with the Wood Veneers of our very expensive Mackey designer Bed. There is practically no assembly needed--just screw the 3 ball legs in place which gives it another 4-5 inches. The door fits and shuts well and the shelves inside are nice to have for bedside magazines. Well made and great priced item--thanks for offering it at such a reasonable price.", 
    "The table is a nice size and the storage underneath is a plus. The birch looks something like cherry wood. The only assembly was to screw the legs onto the bottom.", 
    "It was shipped to me really fast after I ordered it. Once I opened the box and saw the craftmanship, I loved it. There were a little dents from the shipping but I could not wait to put it in my bedroom that I did not both returning it. I'm looking to get other one but it is sold out right now. This is a must buy!", 
    "I purchased two of these tables a couple of weeks ago. They arrived in mint condition and within a couple of days. The only assembly was attaching the legs on the bottom which took only minutes. I bought them for our formal living room, and they look great with our leather and fabric sofa.", 
    "was easy to assemble, looks really expensive, and has smooth finish", 
    "I was impressed by this drum table. It has the appearance of being exceptionally high quality and fit right at home with my Thomasville set.", 
    "Like this table very much. Well worth the money. Think you will be very happy with it. Color, etc. is excellent. Very satisfied.,", 
    "Super buy. Workmanship, quality, design and presentation exceeds the price. Table arrived in two days in excellent condition. Well worth the money. Boxed in one piece; just had to turn four, short wooden leg pegs into bottom of table. No tools needed. Highly recommended.", 
    "I ordered two of these tables on 12/16 and they were in my house 12/18! Beautiful tables and easy to assemble. Just screw on the three small ball legs. It took longer to get them out of the boxes. Very well packaged. Bottom line...if you are thinking about getting one, or two, do it!", 
    "The two drum tables I ordered were delivered promptly and are a perfect size for my living room. I was satisfied with the degree of quality.", 
    "Love the tables. Two are perfect, but third has a defect on top, which may have been in the wood itself. I put doilies on them, so it covers nicely. Would rather have had it perfect, but didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back.", 
    "This table is a wonderful addition to my new house. I was looking for a piece to go between 2 rocking chairs in front of my fireplace and this table fit perfectly. I had never ordered from overstock before and was a little freightened to do so, but I was pleasently surpised. Great value for the money.", 
    "This was a great purchase that I made, thank you Overstock for carrying it! The picture was true to the color. The only assembly was the 3 legs, which just screwed in easily. Really good quality. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase!", 
    "Very nice table.Can be used anywhere,living area/bedroom.Delivery was quick.", 
    "Very nice and sturdy. It's uniqueness catches the eye.", 
    "LOVE THIS TABLE, ITS WELL MADE, JUST WHAT I NEEDED AS A NIGHT STAND,AND THE COLOR IS PERFECT WITH THE REST OF MY FURNITURE, AND ITS EXTRA STORAGE SPACE.", 
    "Originally I hesitated to buy the beautiful tables because they are birch. I assumed the wood would be too light even though the photo shows it darker. I took a chance and ordered 2 tables anyway. The color is accurately represented in the photo.The tables are beautiful and look to be much more expensive than they are. I use them as end tables in my living room and have received compliments on them. In fact my sister likes the style and construction so much she is ordering a set of the the tables in mahogany for her home.The tables are extremely well packed for shipping. The only assembly required is to screw on the three bun feet. Couldn't be easier!", 
    "Beautiful piece. I bought one a couple months ago, and then a second one a few weeks ago.", 
    "We love this table, it is well made and beautiful. The only assembly I had was screwing on the feet!", 
    "This is the 2nd table I've purchased from Overstock.com. The look and quality are as good as the reviews say. The only assembly was to screw the 3 legs in place. The table arrived promply and was in excellent condition. I must say, the other reviews on assembly had a big influence on my purchase. Being a senior, the ease of assembly is extremely important to me. The table looks like it came from a furniture store. Couldn't be more pleased", 
    "We purchased 2 of these and they are beautifulll! They were assembled ,added their feet and we are so pleased. Their weight and workmanship surpassed our expectations. They are rich in color and well balanced and provide storage for blanket throws.", 
    "Very nice looking piece. Looks like a much more expensive brand of furniture. Easy to put together. Have had a lot complements.", 
    "I am very happy with this purchase. The tables have no flaws and look better than the pictures online. If you need a pretty end table, buy this one!", 
    "I had never purchased furniture online before and was a little nervous but the reviews of other customers convinced me to take the chance. That was a great decision as the tables are even more beautiful than I expected. They are absolutely flawless and fit in my room perfectly. I couldn't be more pleased.", 
    "I love this table. It looks great next to a large leather chair. Everyone who has seen it thinks it is great.It is well made and extremely attractive!", 
    "Overstock price for these items was about 50% off other online drum tables-great value!Shipping was fast and shipment tracking online was excellentAssembly was quick and easy--packing was very goodArrived without any shipping damageColor was true to online picture representation--tables are a darker color with just barely a hint of burgundy (NOT cherry red) that contrasts very good with many different light/dark brown hues that we have in our living room.Inside shelves store a ton of stuff--holds throw blankets for cold nights.**ONLY** comment that kept me from giving 5 stars overall--cosmetically the finish could have been a little better (but still a value for the price)--a few minor nicks here & there most likely from assembly line manufacturing-not very noticable and not from shipping.Would definately recommend to others unless you are looking for pristine/high end $500.00 tables.We love them.", 
    "we ordered this table in espresso.Its a beautiful piece. I selected it ad my night stand.Ours arrived broken, but overstock made it right PRONTO......will purchase again from overstock without question!", 
    "I have three of these in my home. Great finish and quality. You can't go wrong with this one.", 
    "I was extremely pleased with this product. It is everything I expected it to be. I was particularly pleased with the fact that I didn't have to put it together. It wasn't cheap \"pressed wood\". The finish is professional and the drawer is solid. I would definitely recommend it. It also came on a timely manner.", 
    "This table came today. The only assembly is putting on the little round legs, very easy. Beautiful table with lots of storage underneath. Much more expensive looking than what you pay for it. Great job overstock for finding another affordable beautiful piece of furniture!", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised by this table! I have never ordered a piece of furniture online before - always afraid of a poor quality, shoddy workmanship piece. The table arrived in one piece, carefully packaged, with little assembly (the feet had to be screwed in). The wood is beautiful - a piece of art. I'd recommend this table to anyone who wants to fill a small space and make a big statement.", 
    "It's bigger than what I need. However, it looks great. I would recommend this one to anyone.", 
    "Would recommend this to anyone who needs a small access table. Sitting next to a $6000 piece and it fit right in. It sits between two chairs in front of a fireplace and is low enough and small enough for the fireplace to be seen and felt. Did not want to spend too much in case the heat drys it out.It was made beautifully and I was really surprized!!!!", 
    "we bought 2 and they look fantastic - even better in person than in the pictures. They are not super high end so if you are hard on your furniture (i.e. have crazy dogs and little kids) then you may consider you'll have to replace it in a few years but at this price, who cares?!great storage area.", 
    "I've been looking for several years for a smaller end table/night stand to go with my expensive BR set, but not to spend lots of money again. This was it. Very nice, good height for today's taller beds and the mahogany color is very nice. I see a few veneer bubbles on the sides but hard to tell if they are veneer fits issues or just the style. All in all I am very happy with them and I bought 2. Assembly was simple, 3 feet to be twisted into pre-drilled threaded holes", 
    "Very impressed! All of the good things said about this in other reviews were correct. It arrived quickly, was in great shape and it looks just as nice as the picture! I love the color and design. It was extremely easy to put on the legs and it looks likes an expensive piece of furniture.", 
    "I bought this end table to go along with a unique coffee table and I absolutely love it! It matches really well with our coffee table and I will be buying a second one. The assembly is very easy, you just have to screw the three legs into the bottom and that is it. This is a beautiful piece and looks great in our living room.", 
    "The shipment arrived within 5 days and was packed securely. Assembly was a breeze. The color is brighter than appears on the web. I would recommend this table to all.", 
    "Having looked for small decorative tables and chests about a year ago in stores I found them to be either very expensive or somewhat shoddy in materials. On the other hand this birch drum table is very good looking, solid, weighty, very good hardware and the door fits very well and closes solidly.For the price it is an excellent value. It may be veneer but has a high quality look. After buying the first one I ordered a second for another room. Someday I may put them together as night stands but I'm using one as a lamp table and one between two chairs where I don't want a large table.I put a little lemon oil furniture polish on them and the finished wood surfaces have a warm textured glow with lots of character. Overall I'm very pleased with the look and functionality. Assembly of the feet is very easy and can be used to level them.", 
    "Table is a little smaller than I expected but it blends in perfectly with the other furniture in my bedroom (I'm using it as a bedside table). It looks great--just like it does in the picture and you can't beat the price.", 
    "I ordered a pair of these for couch end tables and am delighted with them. I wanted something with concealed storage space to reduce table-top clutter and these fill the bill. They arrived quickly and the packing was very careful and protective. I chose not to use the three legs because the height worked better with my couch without them; they look fine sitting directly on the floor. These aren't $500 dollar quality, but they are a terrific value for the money.", 
    "Love this table! It is functional and beautiful. No assembly, just had to put the little feet on.", 
    "This is a great buy. The tables are great for storage and make wonderful nightstands as well as end tables. I bought two and use them for nightstands they fit the decor in my bedroom perfectly and the prices were excellent. The finish is beautiful and the length is just right for bedside convience. They are wide enough for lamps, an alarm clock and your favorite book. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "LOVE the table! Very nice quality... Picture is very accurate. High quality.....", 
    "I am so glad to have ordered the Birch Drum table. It is exactly as described, very sturdy and so easy to add the legs. This was a fantastic deal and so worth the original price. The table looks great in our family room with the nesting tables, also ordered from Overstock.com. This table would also be great for bedoom tables. I am actually thinking about ordering two more for our bedroom.", 
    "I liked the tables and they came close to matching the furniture I already had, which is what I was hoping for. The picture on the website is pretty close to how they actually look. Almost a little too much red in the brown, but still very nice. They were easy to put together. The shipping package was good so no damage or scratches. Unpack them in your garage or you will have styrofoam beads all over your house! They are solidly built. Pretty nice for the money, but I saw they had the expresso ones cheaper two weeks later.", 
    "The table arrived quickly. It was extemely easy to assemble...just screw the feet on. Everything lined up exactly. The reason I gave only 4 stars on workmanship is that the finish has a slight flaw on one corner of the cabinet door. I doubt anyone else would notice. I tend to be a perfectionist. Anything else I have looked at in this price range has been of inferior quality. This table really is a pretty piece of furniture.", 
    "Received within a few days; box had a few dings but was well packed and no damage. Appears exactly as in picture, wonderful color of wood, and is beautiful. It will look very well in my living room.", 
    "I received the table within a week. I am absolutely delighted with it. It was well-packaged and perfect in size. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "This item came packaged very well and was in mint condition. It was even better than described. I love it,", 
    "I love the table, it goes so well with my sofa. It is just perfect. The workmanship is outstanding and the price was right.", 
    "received in prompt order.. good condition..great value for a very nice item", 
    "No assembly except for small screw-in legs. Looks great and much more expensive than actual price paid. Looks perfect next to chair in livingroom. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "Fully satisfied with this table and my purchase - what more can one say?", 
    "I originally ordered one and after receiving it ordered a 2nd... enough said", 
    "Beautiful table for the price. Can't beat the shipping too.", 
    "Love this little table. The finish is great. I am thinking of getting another one.", 
    "Looks great and is really wood. Good storage space inside.", 
    "I already had ordered one of these Drum tables and decided to order a second one. They are well worth the money and I really love the look of the Birch finish. They fit in beautifully without being bulky and overbearing in the room. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone needing an extra storage or end table. What a great find!", 
    "I read the Reviews before purchasing these tables and what everyone has had to say is absolutely true. Very pleased with price, quality, shipping, the whole ball of wax.", 
    "A great piece of furniture. It looks so rich. I absolutely love it!!", 
    "Pleasantly surprised at the excellent packaging and quick shipping of these tables. The Quality is good and the workmanship is also. A good product all around. Thanks!", 
    "i got two of these tables, one for each side of my sofa, love them. Good quality \\, made well, good price. i would recommend these to my friends", 
    "I purchased two beautiful drum end tables. Both tables are an identical match to my entertainment center that I purchased seperately from a different retailer! The finish is flawless and I was impressed by the packaging. The hardware works perfectly. This was a big purchase for me and I'm so happy I put my faith in Overstock.com. I am 100% satisfied and I cant wait to purchase my next item! Thank you!!!", 
    "I am very happy with this item- it is a compact but useful size between my Queen-Anne chairs. Looks elegant and holds a lamp and coasters, perfectly. The finish is not quite as glossy as it seems in the ad, but it polishes up beautifully.", 
    "This is the second birch drum table that I have ordered. When they were offered on sale I should have bought two but wanted to see the product first. I was very pleased with the appearance, workmanship, speed of delivery and price that I paid. I've bought product in a similar category at high end furniture stores and been less pleased with them than I am with these tables.", 
    "This small cabinet is very sturdy and well made for the very reasonable price. It fits the space that I needed it for: my printer just fits on top and I have room to store paper and inks.Best of all, it came well packed and assembled and all I had to do was twist on the feet!", 
    "What a great buy! The description is very accurate in the video and pictures. Workmanship is very fine. I had many compliments from my peers.", 
    "My husband and I had trouble finding round tables the size we needed in the stores so Overstock to the rescue! As always the items were delivered within a few days and in excellent condition. Easy to put together and they look really nice. The ultimate test-my Interior designer daughter walked in the door and said \"I really like those tables, where did you get them.\" Anytime I can't find what I need or want in the stores I check out Overstock!", 
    "I already owned one of these tables, and my Mom needed a table to put by her living room chair so she would have something to set her coffee, tea, etc on when she was in the living room. She loves the table plus it holds her magazines and is just large enough for a picture and still have her beverage on the table. It's a great size and a beautiful table.", 
    "Fast delivery and beautifully packed; arrived in perfect condition.Easily attached legs within 5 minutes!Excellent compliment to my hardwood floors and roomy storage space is perfect for my small townhome. Awesome craftmanship.No disappointments here. Receiving so many compliments, I just may purchase a 2nd Birch Drum Table!", 
    "This table is very beautiful, but there are some flaws to it that I am not very happy with. First, the finish and the base of the table was applied very poorly, and second, the table only has three feet, so it is not very stable. Not good for people with children or pets, because it tips over very easily.", 
    "The reviews that I read regarding these tables were all very accurate. I bought two and they are beautiful - everything I expected and more. I had searched all over town to find tables that had some storage space and these fit the bill absolutely perfect. And they match the other wood items that I have in my home. VERY easy to put together. I would recommend them to everyone.", 
    "Tables are a great value.Workmanship is very good.Easy assemble (screw on 3 legs)Arrived in perfect condtionDelivery was fast.", 
    "Overall the table looks nice but there are finish gaps at the seams (maybe due to shipping) but they are in the back and on the base so it does not bother me. Eventually I will get a cherry finish touchup pen to fix it. Other than that the table looks good and was very easy to assemble.", 
    "I love this table! It is very well made and gorgeous. The top and the sides all have the inlaid wood pattern. I've only had it a short time but have received many compliments on it already. I also like that it has the closed storage. I throw my magazines that I haven't finished reading inside and that helps keep my living room a little neater. I am seriously considering buying another one even though I can't say that I actually need another table.I usually have trouble with any assembly but the only assembly here was to screw on the 3 button feet so even I could do that.", 
    "Even more attractive than on the website. 5 stars for appearance as well as usefulness.", 
    "Just received this table and I am extremely pleased with the quality. It was very well packaged when it arrived. All I had to do was unpack it, attach the bun feet and place it where I wanted it. I would highly recommend this table to anyone who is debating whether or not it is worth the price. It is an exceptional value.", 
    "The table is beautiful. I read the reviews and have to agree that it's not only beautiful but quite a bargain.", 
    "This classy side table deserves an A+. I bought it for my husband's birthday in February, and it arrived safely packed and required nothing more than attaching the buns. The dark, rich color complements our existing furniture, and the built-in shelving provides space for TV controls, magazines, etc. The table also complements the leather \"peanut butter\" ottoman we purchased last year from Overstock. Two great bargains! Go O!Trudenka", 
    "the table arrived in a timely manner, was packaged perfectly, and the only assembly needed was to screw on the legs! took three minutes and is the perfect addition to my bedroom...all of my bedroom furniture belonged to my parents (they were married in 1949) and this table blends great with my existing furniture....i'm sorry i didn't buy two!!", 
    "Just what I was looking for! I bought two. The value-for-cost is great for these drum tables. They are nice and solid. I've had no problems with assembly (you just screw on the bun feet); the workmanship is fine. There are a couple of places on one of them where there are a couple of pits (for lack of better term) in the wood, but they do not appear to be from mishandling and are so minor that they're not even really worth mentioning. I would absolutely recommend these to a friend! As for the color, I feel it's pretty close to what you see on the screen. I'd buy them again!", 
    "This table was actually better than I expected! It has a beautiful finish, and looks more expensive than it was. I thought it was a great value. It also was extremely easy to assemble. It came super quick too!", 
    "We were very happy with our drum tables. They were exactly as pictured and good quality. Very rich looking finish. They were packaged very well. We saw similar tables for almost $200.00 more. Not one complaint. Very satisfied.", 
    "This table exceeded my expectations. It was packaged well, no damage.", 
    "My husband put this table together and he loved it. The table is small, but of excellent quality and very nice design. We love furniture with any kind of storage.", 
    "Absolutely delighted. The quality for the price goes well beyond compare. Assembly was reduced to screwwing in the feet ..... and done. We were pleasantly surprised and quite pleased with this purchase. We would highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone. A truly great accent table (well crafted) for a very small price........", 
    "The table color shown on the site is accurate. Though described as 'birch', this table comes very close in color to my medium cherry tables. Works very well for purpose intended next to my easy chair. Enjoy the hiding spot inside the table for yarns and other projects. Good value for the price!", 
    "This piece is exactly as described. Great craftsmanship, beautiful finish, packaged securely and real easy to assemble. Assembly was just screw in the three ball feet and you're good to go. This table fit in perfectly with my bedroom furniture, which is a slight shade lighter than the birch. I needed end table #2 and I'm so glad I found it here. And you cannot beat the price. Very pleased!", 
    "I am very happy with this table. I ordered it because I needed something compact but with good storage capacity. This is an excellent piece because there is absolutely no wasted space inside. You will be surprised how much interior room there is for whatever you want to keep in it. My only negative comment is that the top edge had several scrapes around the rim. It looks like this happened when it was being handled after assembly. The damage did not happen during shipping because it was fully enclosed in styrofoam. I will contact the company for touch-up stain.", 
    "This was the first time I purchased furniture from the Internet. I was a bit hesitant, but I am extremely pleased with the outcome! The end tables are beautiful and well made. My husband, who is difficult to please, also is very happy with the tables. I would definately recommend the tables and Overstock.com to my friends. I especially liked tracking the delivery. I knew just when to expect the tables.", 
    "We have two. They showed up in a couple of days and the only assembly was attaching the knob to the door. They look great in our living room.", 
    "Lovely. Am very pleased with the finish, color and overall appearance. Arrived in fine condition. Could be used in many rooms throughout the house.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised when I received my table to see that it was beautifully made. The inlay sections are placed in such a way that they give the table great depth. The craftsmanship is wonderful. It is a very sturdy piece of furniture and will be a great addition to my living room. I also like the additional storage it provides to help keep the clutter in check. For the amount of money I paid, I was expecting a more inferior piece. As far as assembly, remove the packing material and you are good to go.", 
    "looks just like the picture and it was wrapped securely. The price was right and the size perfect.Love the colour and it fits beautifully with my leather couch in the living room.", 
    "I purchased two of these for end tables and they are great, very easy assembly, just the feet screw in. They were shipped quick and very well packaged, all in all an awesome purchase that looks great in the living room. Very classic hard wood, and very sturdy.", 
    "Adorable, but smaller in diameter than expected. I should have used measurements to map it out in the room. It is now where I was going to place it, but may move it because it's swallowed up in a large room. It is so nice, I'll find a place for it. If you're thinking about putting this cute table in a small room, don't hesitate to buy it. It is a very nice, well made, but small piece of furniture. It was packed extremely well and shipped without a ding. Kudos to the shipping dept.", 
    "It certainly does not look like the picture. For instance, the diamond shap inlay barely shows at all.Guess it is ok for the money spent, but I was disappointed. This is the first thing I have bought fromOverstock that I didn't particularly like.", 
    "The Birch Drum table came very quickly and it is beautiful. I love it! I am a pretty picky buyer and return things that are not up to par or if it's badly made. This product exceeded my expectation and more!", 
    "Absolutely beautiful table. Workmanship is superb!Highly recommend this table.", 
    "This is a nice little table, convenient storage, easy to assemble, it arrived quickly, and looks nice. It's an inexpensive piece of furniture, of course, I don't expect it to last forever, but for the price it's perfectly fine.", 
    "I have been looking for the perfect table for my newly decorated great room for over a year. We have been using a TV tray next to our over stuffed chair and ottoman. I wanted a small piece that would look good from all sides. Viola - this drum table was perfect. Great quality, no assembly, storage for remotes and matches my existing tables. Looks a lot better that the TV tray.", 
    "I really loved this table when I first saw it and saw all the rave reviews about it. BUT, I was disappointed when it arrived. It didn't look the way it was represented in the picture. Part of what I fell in love with about it online was the design of the wood- the x that it forms on the door and on the top and the way that pops in the picture. But when it arrived, it was so much darker than the picture- you can't really see any of that detail that you see in the picture. It's still a good table, so we kept it, but it definitely is not the look I thought I was getting.", 
    "Bought these to use as nightstands, so I could conceal some clutter without taking up too much space. Love them- just as described- arrived in perfect condition and with very simple assembly. They are a little on the low side for nightstands, now that mattresses are like 10 feet thick, but they work in my bedroom just fine. If I wasn't so anxious to have them in my room, I would have aired them out in a different room with the doors open because the varnish smell is pretty strong at first. I couldn't help myself, I was just so excited to use them :)", 
    "I'm using two of these little drum tables as matched nightstands. They're compact, hold a reasonable amount of \"stuff\" inside, and have a modest capacity on top (think night light and clock radio). They're handsome, a nice rich-swirled mahogany finish and they complement the cherry platform bed sold on this site. All reviews are true - just screw in the legs and you're good to go. Well packed too. I thought them a good value.", 
    "Very nice looking tables for the price. I had read a review stating they mixed well with higher priced furniture-I agree. Have coupled them with leather seating in my study and they look great.", 
    "I had been looking for tables with a smaller footprint to help my limited space seem more open. This drum table not only fits that bill, but it looks good and offers storage space behind a door. There were a couple of small imperfections in one of the two tables I purchased, but I am the only one who knows they're there.", 
    "I really like the table. I needed something small for my apartment and this is actually smaller than I thought it would be after taking the measurements it had on O. The table fits a fairly large lamp and an 8X10 picture but not much else. I like the fact that it has a lot of storage inside, and I didn't have to put it together at all. I have it set up without the legs and love it as it is. If you need something small and functional this is the way to go.", 
    "My only disappointment with the table is that the top does not match the color of the sides. The top is darker and has a definite red hue. The sides are the color I wanted (warm honey pecan). Otherwise, it is a very nice table.", 
    "Exactly as described. Looks far more expensive than the price you pay. I know because I searched everywhere before purchasing here. East to assemble. Really beautiful, deep finish. Easy to assemble- only took about 10 minutes- just screw the legs on the bottom. Bought two tables and had glass tops cut to cover the top of the tables- really protects the finish. Storage underneath is really handy. Arrived quickly and in great shape. Would highly recommend. Goes with many types of furniture and looks especially nice with beige leather couch and chairs. Always get fine products from Overstock. Thanks!", 
    "The table is beautiful in my bedroom. The table arrived with a broken door, my friend fixed, despite what appeared very protected shipping packaging. The color and uniqueness is perfect.", 
    "I was very pleased after receiving the table that I am using as a nightstand. I can put all of my bedside books, magazines,etc. inside and reduce the clutter. On the small side for a nightstand but works for us. Ordered a second one when my husband liked it so much he wanted one too. He is the husband who doesn't like to replace anything if it \"still works,\" so that says alot.", 
    "I bought two tables. They were delivered within a few days for only $2.95 total. They arrived in very secure packaging with no damage.The color was exactly as listed. It matched our entertainment unit purchased somewhere else. It was easy to assemble; just screwed on the three bun feet. The only issue I have is that the finish on the tops of each table is slightly imperfect. It is smooth, but had some minor sanding marks. They are not visible once I put a lamp and coasters on the tops.", 
    "The first table I received was damaged. It was so easy to have it returned. I just called Overstock and they took care of everything. UPS came back the next day and took the large package for return. Overstock then sent me a new table and it arrived 4 dyas later, it was perfect. The table is a ncie size and is a solid piece. I like the color and finish. It looks exactly like it does in the picture.", 
    "I purchased two of these tables to use as night stands.. They are well made and are of a nice quality. I read all the reviews first and had no doubts when I made the decision to purchase them. They are just beautiful!", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this small table. I needed something to compliment a large cherry piece in my living room. This table is quite exquisite in appearance and actually has a nice area for storage. The wood and finish is perfect. Just screw the feet on and it is ready. I am very pleased.", 
    "Very poor quality, The routerwork is very crude. Looks like a lot of paint over rougly finished wood or fiberboard.", 
    "These drum tables are just as you see them on line. The color is the same, the lines are the same, etc. Just terrific. I am very pleased with mine. They are all that they say they are.", 
    "fits the space it should, well put together, nice color wood, elegant looking", 
    "Beautiful table. I wish it were bigger, otherwise you can't go wrong!", 
    "I am moving into a new home and I received two of these BEAUTIFUL, quality, just ravishing drum tables. They arrived in excellent condition (great packaging) and were put in place with little assembly and fuss. What gorgeous additions to my new home.", 
    "I recently purchased two of the Birch drum tables. Shipping was very fast - I received them after only a couple of days, which was a nice surprise. An even better surprise was the very high quality of the wood and finish in these tables. When you also factor in the very reasonable price, it is clear that these tables are a truly fantastic bargain. I recommend this product without hesitation.", 
    "I purchased two of these tables for night stands. They are very nice quality and a great addition to my bedroom. I would definitely recommend buying them. What a wonderful way to shop....they come right to your door within a few days and only had to screw in the legs. Love them!!!", 
    "I absolutely love the birch drum table I purchased from overstock! The workmanship, appearance, and attention to details are excellent. The box was delivered within the timeline they had indicated, it was very securely packaged, and was very easy to assemble. No tools were required. All I had to do was screw on the three ball shaped legs. I placed the table beside the recliner in my family room and it matched the wood on the recliner perfectly. I especially like the ample storage inside the table! It fits in perfectly with the decor in the room and makes a wonderful addition to my family room.", 
    "The table is well designed and well crafted. The assembly required is nominal. The packaging is very thorough. It is somewhat smaller than I anticipated, but its attractiveness makes up for that in my case. I could not have found its equivalent locally without a lot of shopping and the price made it a terrific bargain.", 
    "The table arrived fully assembled except for the legs which were simple to attach. The table is very attractive and a nice addition to any room. Most important is the extra storage space for reducing clutter. It is well constructed and affordable. Good quality. I would consider buying a second one for a bedroom.", 
    "I love my tables. I ordered one at first to make sure I liked it. Came in just a couple of days, the only assembly was putting on the legs which was easy. I immediately order another one. !!", 
    "I was extremely pleased with the quality of this product. There were no flaws and it looks perfect in my living room.", 
    "What a nice little accent piece! It would fit any decor. Easy, easy assembly for those like me, with two left hands, just screw the legs on!! Perfect size for my room!! Thanks.", 
    "I love these tables. I bought them for my living room and I can store little things in there - like coloring books, children's books, whatever kind of little toys get left in the living room and and I need to do a rush clean up job. They are the perfect height and putting them together took about 5 mins. each if that.", 
    "This table looks great. When you turn it over to screw in the bottom legs, you can clearly see the particle board that was used in the manufacturing, as well as the staining used to create the color (these are the only 2 reasons I did not give it all 5 stars). But after you turn it back up on the right side, the appearance and detail win you over. It is functional with the shelf inside and the magnetic closing door. Great to store coasters, napkings, etc. Plus, the packing was incredibly good. I can't imaging anything damaging this table during shipping. I'm keeping it.", 
    "Excellent purchase...fast shipping...great price...very happy!! Looks great as a side table next to a chair in my living room. Highly recommended!", 
    "Nice finish, improves with a little polish to a beautiful finish. Attractive shape and useful size. Easy assembly is to screw on the bun feet. One of the feet required a little muscle from my husband... but everything got assembled. The smell some reviews mentioned was there when I opened the boxes, but it quickly dissipated. I ordered 2 tables. I use them and love them.", 
    "I purchased this to replace a very inexpensive 3 legged table with floor length cloth that sits next to my antique chair. It arrived in excellent condition in a very short period of time., and I love it!! It looks perfect next to my chair, and changes the look of the room. So stylish...the color is perfect with my mahogany woodwork.The finish is a bit uneven under the trim at the bottom, but only I know it, and it is a bit wobbly, but nothing I can't live with. The varnish smell that so many commented about in their reviews was evident with this piece as well, but I let it sit 4 days in an empty room and it is fine.I wish I needed another one because for the price, I would order it in a heartbeat.Thanks Overstock!!", 
    "I purchased two of these tables to use at either end of a leather sectional in our den. They arrived in five days, securely packed and in perfect condition, and were in place in the den within 15 minutes. They are beautiful and sturdy, and perfect to attractively store TV remotes, DVDs, books and magazines. The wood is so attractive that I will have glass tops made to protect the tops from scratches and water marks. I researched similar tables here on Long Island, and haven't found anything of similar quality for less than twice the price. I LOVE Overstock.com!!", 
    "I purchased the first Drum table in June for my living room as an end table. Perfect! Better than the picture online! Very happy! It goes with other wood furniture that I have from Ethan Allen. Well packaged! Quick delivery. Easy assembly!I was so pleased that I recently purchased a second one to use in my bedroom that will replace an old nightstand and go with the fabulous metal bed that I purchased from Overstock.com! The second drum table arrived this Monday, also in perfect condition, and goes with the maple dressers that I have! I'm soooo delighted! These tables are a perfect size for any room, great storage! Definitely great quality for the price, quick delivery, again, great packaging and all I had to do was screw in the 3 bun feet. These are truly beautiful! I would have paid a lot more elsewhere. Highly recommend! Don't think twice, just order!I read all the reviews and everyone was right! These are lovely!", 
    "Perfect. Great style, workmanship & appearance. Our little Cairin Terrier fits right inside and loves it.Charlotte", 
    "We ordered two and are completely satisfied with the purchase. They were easy to unpack and set up, and look great even next to much more expensive furnishings. I'd go so far as to say these are a real bargain.From personal experience the only criticism I can share is that one of the two arrived with a minor edge ding, probably acquired during shipping (a little wood fill fixed it right up). In our estimation the damage wasn't serious enough to contact Overstock and the packing seemed entirely adequate when examined.", 
    "This was my first time buying from Overstock and I was delighted when I received this table. We had been searching a long time for the perfect round table to sit by an easy chair. The quality was great and it looks fantastic! I will order again.", 
    "Looks great and the assembly is only screwing on the 3 legs. Good value!", 
    "I 've been looking for a small table for a year and came across this BEAUTY! I ordered two. This table looks and feels high-end, very well built and easy to assemble -- just put the legs on and its a done deal -- looks better in person. Nice storage too!I ordered several items from you in the past, and I can't tell how pleased I am with every purchase. Thanks Overstock.", 
    "I'd been looking for months for new end tables for my living room. I wanted something with a two-tone pattern to go with my current coffee table, and I really wanted something with storage. When I saw these tables, I just couldn't pass them up... especially at this price! I had seen a few others that were similar to these, but the prices were outrageous ($300-$600 each). They arrived within a few days, well packaged, fully assembled (except the screw-on feet), well constructed, and in excellent condition. I didn't notice the strong odor that others have mentioned... they just smelled like new wood furniture to me. I opted to leave the feet off because I actually think they look better without them. About the only minor criticism I have is that the two-tone pattern is quite a bit more subtle than in the picture, and they are a bit more on the \"reddish\" side than they appear. But all in all, I highly recommend these tables. And like I said... you can't beat the price!!", 
    "This was a great buy. I have been looking for a small round table for our small TV room. I chose this table not only for its good looks and its size, but also because it had storage. Some people have mentioned a bad smell from the lacquer. There was an odor upon opening the box; however, there was no odor after about 30 minutes. It is well made, very pretty and matches the dark woods in my house. Moreover, this is not a light-weight table that will flip over if you put something on it! It took less than five minutes to put on the feet and place it between a love seat and chair; the storage area is great. I have bought several things from Overstock and have never been disappointed. I would definitley recommend this product for others needing a small round table. It is just beautiful!", 
    "We had just recently seen a similar table at a furniture store, and we paid the same price for two of these as one would have cost us. They are very good quality , and we had them unwrapped , out of the cardboard box and had the legs screwed on, in less then twenty minutes. They are on the small side, but our living room is not that big, and now the tables compliment the sectional sofa, and gives us more room on each end. I like the small storage space when you open the door. I feel it was a great choice!!", 
    "These tables are really nice-looking and well-priced. I read the many reviews before making my purchase, so I was completely informed about what I was buying. They do have a slight odor, but it's not noticeable unless you open the cabinet doors; when the doors are closed, there is no scent at all. Assembly was quite simple, although I did have some difficulty screwing one of the ball feet into the screw socket. Otherwise, the tables are perfect for my purpose--small bedside nightstands with space for holding books, etc.", 
    "The table shipped within two days of ordering. It was well packaged and arrived in excellent condition - no marks of any kind. It was very easy to assemble, i.e. put the feet on the bottom. It looks beautiful. As a first time buyer at Overstock.com, I was very pleased. I would recommend this drum table to others.", 
    "I have been shopping for end tables for nearly a year. Finally, I saw this one and loved it. I ordered two and they came in yesterday. I just love them! The table is beautiful and just the perfect size. The minimal required assembly was a piece of cake. The storage is adequate. I read other reviews that mentioned a strong, lingering odor from the finish. It was noticeable when I first unpacked them but today I don't notice it so much. Lastly, the boxes were packed very well.", 
    "Just received my table this week and I love it! Looks just like the picture. Solid wood, sturdy, easy to assemble legs. Arrived in perfect condition/well packaged. Perfect for beside my leather recliner and nice place to hide books or magazines. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Wish I had purchased two of them.", 
    "Very easy to assemble!!! Screw on the legs that is it! Looks better than picture. I have three and love them.", 
    "This table is even more beautiful in person than online. A distictive veneer and beautiful hardware. Easy to assemble, only the feet needed to be added. The packaging kept the table in perfect condition. A great buy.", 
    "This table is lovely. It was easy to assemble -- just screw on the legs. It is very sturdy, which is to say that I did not need to leave the legs off or stack magazines inside for stability. It is stable all by itself, even with the legs attached, and even when the cats jump onto it! It has an expensive appearance, and goes well with my other furniture. My only wish is that it were slightly larger, especially inside. Nothing larger than a magazine will fit inside, and I had hoped to keep our wedding album in it. The album is 14' x 14\" and does not fit. But, smaller items do, and it's nice to have the functionality to store some things inside. Plus, the compact size does mean it nestles well in a small space by a chair.All in all, a very good buy.", 
    "The only thing I had a problem with was the smell of the finishing stain or polish. It took a few weeks for the smell to dissipate. Otherwise it was a perfect size for our location in the room.", 
    "I was surprised to see how well made this table was for the money. It is quite heavy and it couldn't be easier to put together....just put the 4 feet on. It also came extremely well packed.", 
    "This is a great little table. It's small enough to fit about anywhere, yet the surface area is large enough to be practical. The inside stores a surprising amount of magazines, books, or whatever. Most of all, it's so attractive! It looks like it cost twice as much as it did. We're very happy with it.", 
    "Good looking side table. Looks like an expensive piece. Very easy assembly. Highly recommend. I gave it overall 4 stars only because it wasn't something I was looking for but very happy with the purchase.", 
    "LOOKS REALLY NICE IN THE ROOM. PAINT SMELL A LITTLE STRONG BUT WENT AWAY IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS", 
    "The tables look nice and are well made. I was looking for end tables to store things out of sight and these work well for that. The only down side is that the table is inconvenient to get into when sitting in a chair next to it, as you have to reach around to open it.", 
    "These tables are great! They look nice, they are functional and they were simple to put together. All you do is screw on the legs and you are ready to go. One table was damaged when I received it and overstocks promply sent me a return label via e-mail and sent out another table within the week. Both the product and the service were fantastic.", 
    "My husband is always a little dubious of my purchases, but was totally won over with everything about this table. Love having storage right next to chair. Perfect size for my needs. and beautiful piece of furniture.", 
    "The table is as pictured and has nice inlaid wood. Our table was well packaged but the upper trim was a bit dented and there was a small scratch on the back side. We have heard it is easy to return things, but these were barely noticeable so we did not want to bother.", 
    "this a great table for smaller rooms. i had been searching for a year for a round table with storage. this was a great find that i highly recommend.", 
    "This table worked out perfectly for me, just the right size for the space. The color is great and simple to twist on 3 legs.", 
    "This was the first time I have ordered from overstock , I was so happy with the quality and looks of the table. It was exactly what I was looking for at half the price. I will order again.", 
    "This is a well made table. Looks great and has nice hardware etc.Yes it is recommended.", 
    "When you hear Drum Table, you automatically think of your kids with those drums. Not a problem here. The table is well made, sturdy and the only assembly I had was to screw on the feet. The top is so intricately finished that I did end up buying a glass to put on it. I didn't want anything to mess up the beautiful design. This is really a good bargin.", 
    "I love the table, it is very elegant. The assembly was virtuall none - just screw on the ball feet. It looks great in my family room and I like the out of sight storage.", 
    "The only two reasons this table didn't get 5 stars are#1 the three legs do make it wobbly and possibly tipsy unless you use it for what I did - to hide all the magazines I am going to get around to reading this week! If you put them on the bottom shelf, you are stabalized. I would not put an expensive lamp on this however#2 Had to leave the door open for a week to get rid of the varnish smell, this is not a big poblem, I do this often at work were we are making beautiful cabinets and sometimes they come in a little not dried enough. Gone in one week!This is well made, and lovely!", 
    "This is a wonderful little side table. I have it next to my guest bed with a lamp and a clock radio on top. The interior is great to hold a couple of books and a box of kleenex for your guests. Looks wonderful and is much better than expected.", 
    "Excellent condition and without defects. Exactly as is seen in the page. Very well built. I'm very satisfied with this product", 
    "I am very pleased with this piece of furniture. I originally bought it to use as an end table by my sofa, but when I saw how nice it looks, I decided to put it on display in the living room beneath a favorite piece of artwork.", 
    "I bought 2 drum tables to match an existing round coffee table...they were an excellent match, and a good value. The size is ideal for an end table, slightly larger than the picture. Visually appealing...One of my set had a problem of not having the door magnets installed, bought them at hardware store and works great.", 
    "I loved the one I bought september last year. Unfortunately, my 2nd table is like an imitation of the first. The wood is not as well finished and it still has the smell of varnish even though I've tried to air it out on the porch twice. But, I still absolutely love my original! It matches with most decor and can be used in any room. Best of all, there's almost no assembly required, just screw the feet on.", 
    "I am very pleased with this table overall. I rated it a 5 star value in all but one aspect, and the one area I gave it a 4 star value was in workmanship. The reason for this is that I expected a smoother more hand rubbed finish on the table top but instead it had a slightly rough feel to the touch. I am hoping to make the top feel smoother by applying a few coats of a good past wax for wood. The over all workmanship seems to be quite good in the construction, design and looks and I am very pleased in that aspect. I would recommend this table to anyone looking for something like this and feel it is a good value for the price.", 
    "We are very pleased with our new end table. The drum shape allows for a nice amount of storage. The table looks exactly like it does on the web-site. The only assembly was attaching the three legs. The door works well. We do have a bowl of baking soda inside to absorb the odor of the wood - but that is expected and will be removed in a few days.", 
    "I purchased two of these and am extremely happy with them. They came quickly, very well packaged and basically no assembly required. Just screw on the three feet and they were ready to go. They are very sturdy tables and very pleasing to look at. Completely happy with this purchase and the quality of the product.", 
    "Easy assembly - only need to open box and screw in legs. Great looking table...@ great price", 
    "What a beautiful table. When I saw it I just had to have it !! Fits nicely in corner of my dining room. Now I have extra storage for my linens. And displays my wine bottles on top nicely. Thanks again Overstock", 
    "This was my first furniture purchase with overstock.com and I am completely happy with it. It came completely assembled, I only had to screw in the legs, which took whole five seconds. It came very well packaged and looks great. The only thing my husband does not like about it is that it took over the spot where his TV subwoofer used to be.", 
    "I orderd this table on Sunday and It arrived on Thursday It was so easy to put together just screw on the legs. The quality is very good and look lovely with my lamps on them. I would recomend them to anyone wanting a small quality end table", 
    "Table came beautifully packaged. Just had to unwrap and it was ready to go. Very nice for a small bedside table.", 
    "This table is a beautiful addition to our home. It is very easy to assemble. I like how the pattern on the top brings out the details of the grain in the wood, and the hidden storage space is very practical. I would recommend this table, both for its appearance and for its quality.", 
    "Great side table in compact living room or bedroom. Extremely well packed for shipping. I only had to screw on the 3 feet, no tools needed. Sturdy and good value.", 
    "This is a very nice piece of furniture - beautiful grain in the wood, nicely made. It's unsteady when empty; we put some heavy bottles on the interior bottom shelf, which helped. But I wouldn't want children near this table.", 
    "I really like this table. It is just what I was looking for. It comes assemblied, so you just take it out of the box.", 
    "I purchased this table to use as a side table in my living room. It was very easy to assemble (no tools were required) -- just screw in the legs and you're done! The color and finish are beautiful. The style of the table is unique and gets lots of compliments. The wood color is little darker in person than it appears on the website, but nonetheless it goes perfectly with our decor. I would describe the color as a cross between a dark cherry and a warm cherry. This table is just fabulous; I'm glad I found it. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "Entire experience, order, delivery, assebly totally exceeded expectations; could not be more pleased", 
    "Just what I was looking for. Whenever I purchase from O.com, I make sure to read the reviews so I will know up front what the pros and cons are. This table was a little smaller, but thanks to a review, I was aware ahead of time. Great table, lots of storage room for its size, and a small base lamp looks great on it.", 
    "We were looking for a small table to put between two chairs in the living room. A table that was functional as well as attractive. This table really fits the bill. Not only do we love the way the woods look with our antique furniture...but, we recieve so many compliments on its appearance.", 
    "This product arrived very well packaged and protected. It is just as beautiful (or more so) than portrayed. Construction is solid. For us, it is a perfect height to accompany our other furniture. It is practical, as well, with the interior storage space. I am completely pleased with this purchase.", 
    "This product was received in good order and easy to assemble. The quality of the wood was premium and the appearance handsome. I would recommend this item to anyone that needs an occasional table to enhance their livingroom.", 
    "We have been looking for a little table to go between 2 chairs -- that was not too big, not an end table and that had some storage in it -- and this is PERFECT! It was a great value for the quality and workmanship. The color and finish are beautiful.", 
    "The tables are great. They match perfectly with my living room decor. They are great for storage and hide my books and magazines. I also love the birch finish. They were easy to assemble.", 
    "Well made, extremely well packed, easy to assemble, a number to call if there is a problem -- first class all the way! Good price, too.", 
    "I am very pleased with the table. Assemble was simply attaching the legs. Looks very nice in my living room.", 
    "I just unpacked my table and am very impressed. It was securely packed, and needed just the bun feet attached to the base. The finish is beautiful. It is sturdy and well-built. It looks great next to the chair I wanted it for. I am thinking of getting another as it is very versatile and could be used as a bedside table. Even my husband, who teaches art history, likes it, and he's very fussy about design and quality. This is a GREAT DEAL.", 
    "I purchased two Birch Drum Tables; the tables are well constructed; easy to pick together; color just as pictured on the Overstock site; match perfectly to my living room decor ; just the perfect height - we just love them.", 
    "It looks beautiful. It was delivered on time and in perfect condition. It is a great addition to my living room.", 
    "I ordered this to serve either as an end table in my living room or as a night stand. It could have easily served in either role but the color was too light for my living room. So, it is now a night stand and it matches really well with my oak and metal works bed frame. After it sat for 3 weeks, I liked it so much that I ordered another one for my husband's side. For those considering this product, I would say I am somewhat picky and this more than met my expectations. Both were REALLY easy to assemble, everything was structurally fine and I had no issues. I only scored the value as a 4 becuase I love a really great deal and this was a good deal but not super great and in terms of workmanship, I scored it a 4 because I am not sure how long the little handle will stay on (I have had no issues though and my kids tug on it all the time). So, if you are considering it, it's a great buy!"
