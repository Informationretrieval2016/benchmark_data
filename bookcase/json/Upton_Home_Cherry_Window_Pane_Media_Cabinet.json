    "The good:- Nice cherry wood color- Very attractive design- Roomy and serves the purposeThe bad:1) The box arrived with parts hanging out, indicating poor packaging of the product, but no parts were missing.2) Most of the pieces are low quality MDF that may easily chip and break up during assembly. Some pieces on the front appear to be nice solid wood.3) The unit after assembly was still not sturdy and extra reinforcement was necessary. The 2 panel doors are too heavy for the rest of the unit that if you open them with the unit empty, the unit falls forward.4) Given the questionable sturdiness, think twice about buying this if you have small children who would be playing near it.", 
    "time consuming and difficult to assemble. It does not stand up solid. I am afraid it will tip over if I put it on the carpet!", 
    "We received the cabinet assembly pieces. After assembly the wood was broken because the wood is not hard enough to contain the screws. Also the latch it has for joining the screws is not fitting properly which inturn worn out the screws.", 
    "I read other reviews that complained that they needed to bolt it to the wall. I have ordered a lot of furniture type products such as these and they all come with wall brackets. This is a fail safe for the manufacturer against someone pulling something over on themselves of small children and the like. Our stove came with a wall bracket! I don't know of a small child would have the strength to pull over a stove. You decide if you need to bracket it. It was easy to assemble and came out looking nicely with some of our actual antique furniture. Would definitely recommend this product.", 
    "I suppose this is what you would expect for this price. I don't mean for this to be a centerpiece of my living room but the poor craftsmanship really shows, particularly on the door panels when the patterns cannot even align. The cabinet is small and good for filling in a small space, a corner somewhere perhaps, out of sight. What I really dislike is that three of the shelves are not adjustable. (top, middle and bottom boards) This essentially makes the top and bottom compartments narrow and useless when they could have been combined to make a 5 leveled shelf, rather than a 6 leveled-with-two-useless-levels shelf. The assembly is fairly straight forward.", 
    "I was very disappointed in this purchase very small. Put it in my office at work did not care for it in my home", 
    "This is a attractive cabinet to house my DVDs. I like the glass in the doors. The only minor thing for me is that the cabinet doesn't sit flat. It leans back a little which is good that it doesn't make it easy to tip over, but it is noticeable. It's a nice size. I put my movies sideways so that it is easier to read the titles. I wish there were a cabinet that was made that held them that way. I know it's anal, but I keep my movies in alphabetical order... but putting them sideways, it's easy to take them out and put them back.Yes, I would recommend this cabinet if the size meets your needs. It is fine for me.", 
    "to small for how much it cost. overall look is small. wouldn't buy it again. to high for what I got.", 
    "Looks more expensive than price suggests, sturdy and roomy. Nice addition to media room. Would consider buying another when this one is filled.", 
    "This product met my expectations, nice color, good size. i reccommend purchasing this item for housing books or nick-knacks", 
    "Nice cabinet but took a while to but together", 
    "Good quality but a bit hard to put together. The instructions need a little bit of help. Over all very happy with the Cabinet.", 
    "Love it so much I ordered another one. Great bargain. Looks so nice in house .", 
    "This is a beautiful piece of furniture, but I have yet to figure out how to put the hinges on. Maybe it's just me but I can't figure out what position they are supposed to be in. I've put together quite a few pieces of furniture in the past few years but I'm going to need help for hinges.", 
    "I own two of these. One of my fondest memories with my boyfriend was putting the two cabinets together. They are beautiful and look very nice side by side. If you mounted two more to the wall, they would look nice as an entire wall unit. I highly recommend these.", 
    "Wasn't as sturdy as we had hoped for. The handles are bulky and we ended up replacing them.", 
    "This cabinet was not only beautiful but the perfect height and finish for a great price, I bought two!", 
    "Arrived ahead of estimated shipping schedule. The item was well packed and arrived undamaged. I assembled it alone in less than four hours (and, yes, I am a woman). The instructions should be looked through thoroughly to avoid any confusion, but they are fairly straight forward. The unit is a beautiful dark cherry color and is very nice to look at. It is also very sturdy, but since it is tall and narrow, if it is to sit on carpeting I would advise anchoring it to the wall. I am very pleased with the unit and would buy it, or a like unit of different size, again.", 
    "this item isn't completely square and has corners that don't come together right", 
    "Easy to set up and looks great in my home.", 
    "Very good buy. I used these to display my great grandmother's cups and saucers. Perfect.", 
    "holds a lot of videos , DVD's and CD 's", 
    "It's perfect size for my apt. Easy to assemble. Plenty of room and I want another one.", 
    "Pressed wood can only look so good. The bottom shelf is too short to allow DVDs, Blu Ray or CDs to be placed vertically. Note the photo places items on the side instead of vertically stacked like the other shelves.", 
    "Please make furniture easier to assemble. I guess for me I will have to buy it at a store . This one has a lot of assembling.", 
    "Still in good shape I've had it for a while looks good", 
    "Item is good for what I need DVD, the only thing were the instruction too basic.", 
    "This case is absolutely beautiful. It fits perfectly in the small area I placed it in. It must be secured to the wall with the anchors provided, otherwise it is a little wobbly when opened (mine is on carpet in a bedroom). The anchors that came with it make the unit perfectly stable.Not only love the appearance of this case but it holds a lot of books and CD's. Great buy for the money!!!", 
    "Had not noticed that 2 shelves are stationary and not adjustable, other than that we are very pleased with the product.", 
    "Not more to say, all aspects excellent. Fit/finish excellent. Hardware organized.", 
    "It was impossible to asamble the screws very loss.", 
    "Moving from 3 bedroom house to two rooms with no kitchen I had to find storage for my spices, soups, and all the smaller items you find in a pantry. Although this is designated for media it can go for other things as well... case in point the pantry. I bought one taller and three times wider to house my collectibles in in the hallway. This piece obviously is not high end and the fact that it had to be put together-which, btw, i was told was fairly easy, it comes out as a decent piece for the price. It works well for what it is and am sure would be fine for media.", 
    "It looks good in my home. The only problem I had with assembly was getting some the screws to remain in the bookshelf once it stood upright. The doors were difficult to put on. This is a~~~~~~~~~ MEDIA CASE~~~~~~~~~~~~~ you will not be able to place oversized books in this shelf. For smaller books and media.", 
    "This replaced the cheap metal and plastic DVD and CD towers I had in the dining room. What a difference! And it held all of them. I love it.", 
    "We were looking for a cabinet to hold DVDs. This one works quite well. It looks nice in our living room.", 
    "The Cabinet might look well in a small study, where the rest of the furniture is made of dark red cherry, but in a big room with a high ceiling it looks lost.", 
    "Anchored into the wall against which it leans, this case looks quite lovely from across the room except for one glaring problem: the pre-drilled knobs don't come anywhere near matching, one about 2\" higher than the other. So it's a great conversation piece, folks wondering if whoever drilled the holes for the door pulls was drunk at the time! Fortunately I don't use this often, or it would probably have disintegrated by now. As a life-long church professional, I loved the wood detail and design of the glass doors ~ remind me of church arched windows. The whole thing is dreadfully flimsy, as others have detailed. Admire it from afar, but don't look for quality wood or workmanship or durability.", 
    "Assembly was fairly easy (read the instructions carefully!) - I like the way the prepackaged all the mechanical hardware. All the holes lined up. We were displeased with the quality of the wood - several nicks and gashed on the edges and corners that are noticeable in the assembled piece. Other than that, the product is very good. Love the cherry color. You have to play around with the magnetic door-holder to get things to line up correctly, but that's easy.", 
    "This cabinet was pretty easy to put together as all holes matched up easily. The only problem I had is that the color of the wood is much darker than shown in picture, almost black and not cherry as shown.", 
    "i can't believe i paid **** for this cheap book shelf. had i any idea, i would have packed it up and sent it back. i already put it together. i would expect to pay 30.00 maybe.", 
    "The cabinets are what we wanted. I did not expect it to slant toward the wall, but I understand the purpose and it works fine. The structure, appearance and color are great. I would have liked additional shelving options. Overall we are very happy with the cabinets.", 
    "I bought this item several weeks ago and it came broken. Overstock shipped a replacement for the broken piece and it came broken again. Overstock had to ship the piece a second time and finally it came, but the product is very cheap. It doesn't stand steady and while it is functional it is not the best product for the price. I would not recommend this to anyone.", 
    "While this cabinet does look nice, the materials used are of less than wonderful quality. The wood was really low quality. One of the corners broke off on construction and had to be glued before the cabinet could be completed.", 
    "I enjoy using overstock.com but when I put that it was a gift you did not send email saying it was shipped so the one getting the gift seen it befor I could put it away", 
    "These are beautiful pieces. I purchased two. The first one went together without too much trouble,but the second one was more difficult. The pieces weren't properly marked. The holes were off center and some holes weren't there. If it wasn't for having experience with the first one it would have been very difficult to assemble the second. Once finished they look great and are very functional. Be sure to use the attachments and connect to wall. The doors tend to make it want to tip forward.", 
    "The picture does more for this product than anything, it doesn't assemble well and once together isn't that stable.", 
    "Love the cherry wood of this cabinet. The arrival was quick , while the assembly wasnt as easy. The only problem with this cabinet is that it doesnt hold as many DVD's as listed. The shelves are not made to use the cabinet to it's full capacity. Due to this we are thinking about purchasing another one so that when additional movies are purchase there is somewhere to store.", 
    "This product was received quickly. The instructions were clear and it went together relatively easily. My only \"wish\" would be that the shelves were adjustable. They are in fixed positions which makes it a bit less useful since I wanted it for books and 2 of the shelves do not have enough room. They will hold knick-knacks!", 
    "The cabinet is very pretty but not quality construction at all. I had one part that didn't have the correct number of holes and Overstock was great about getting a new piece to me quickly. However once the cabinet was put together the instructions read to anchor it to a wall. This was not mentioned in the product information - if it had been I would not have purchased the cabinet.", 
    "Cabinet was packed extremely well. No damage at all. Instructions are great.!! Easy to put together. Only complaint is that it is smaller than I thought it was going to be. Make sure you measure.", 
    "I notice these are not in stock right now but I hope Overstock continues to carry them in the future.These were no problem to assemble, just time consuming and requiring care especially with the glass, and they look great. They definitely look better than the usual run of the mill self-assembled furniture commonly available. We are really happy with the storage space and look. We got two, one for DVDs and the other for small art supplies and stationary, and they are just right. Everybody is surprised when they find out these were assembled furniture. Materials, fit and finish seem better than usual for this type of product and we noticed no odor. This is not expensive hardwood furniture but for what it is, it is very very good.They are tall and have a narrow profile, which is a nice space saver but as the instructions point out, on a rug surface they will be tippy and would require wall bracing (included\u201a). We have no problems on a wood floor.", 
    "The cherry window pane media cabinet was a great purchase. I reviewed several items before deciding on this cabinet. I wanted a durable cabinet with glass doors and a classic look. This cabinet met all of my requirements and I am very pleased with my purchase. The assembly was easy and the parts were very well organized and packaged. The cabinet fully assembled looks like the picture provided and met all of the measurements. Again, this was a great purchase and I am very happy with the product.", 
    "I was very surprised that none of the reviews mentioned the horrific odor from the particle board used in this piece. I have not even attempted to put it together because I am trying to let it air out first. I have purchased a few pieces that are not solid wood, so I am familiar with the slight odor that always accompanies particle board, but this gave all of us a headache and we had to move the pieces to another room. It has been a week and the odor is still so strong I am not sure if I can keep it or not. Very disappointing!", 
    "I recently purchased two mission style media storage units, which arrived within a couple of days of my order. The beautiful wood finish makes them look great! Relatively easy to assemble, the units are free standing on hard-wood floods. They are a handsome addition to my living room, while keeping it from looking like a video store. My caution to you is some of the wood is real and some is laminated particle board. Be careful where the parts join together as it is easy to tear through the particle board. If you intend to use these on carpeting or where two floor surfaces meet, I suggest using the stabilizing kit that comes with the units. Since the units are tall and slender, they will keep them from tipping backwards or forwards. A good deal for the price - thanks", 
    "The appearance of this book shelf is nice, but the main disappointment is the spacing of the shelves. They should be adjustable, since the spacing holes are not very practical. Too small or too large.", 
    "As others have said the directions are not very good. - put the top on last.The only other complaint I have is that the middle shelf is in the wrong place.I use this cabinet for DVDs. If you aligh the first 2 shelves for DVD height the third shelfand the bottom shelf can only hold CDs.I bought 2 and they look great.", 
    "I was a bit hesitant to order this cabinet after reading some rather negative reviews. I ordered two cabinets. They both arrived in perfect condition. I had my 13 year old niece that was visiting ask to put the lst one together. She didn't have any problems, and I put the other one together. I had no problems. It took about 3 hours to put each together. They look great on each side of my oak mantel in my 1925 bungalow. Even though the description says they are cherry, they still look great with the other stained woodwork in the living room.", 
    "This unit blends nicely with our other furniture in the family room. Easy to assemble. Look at the pictures, do not read the instructions. Takes about 90 minutes to complete (including glue dry time) PS make placing the glass into doors last your last item.", 
    "When I ordered this I had read the reviews and had no grand illusions but when it arrived I was very pleasantly surprised. There were no broken parts at all. My son-in-law put it together in about 2 1/2 hours and had very few problems. We collect pocket dragons and it proved to be the perfect place for them. There were a few nicks here and there that had to be touched up with some dark stain but overall it is very nice. It currently is in my foyer and everyone who visits comments very positively on it. Thank you Overstock!!!!", 
    "I am overall happy with the appearance of this cabinet but not very happy with the workmanship or the assembly. It did not fit together well and we had to make some modifications to make it level. One of the glass panes arrived broken but Overstock immediately sent me a replacement panel, no problem. Now that it is level, it looks great and fits tons of CDs, I just don't want anyone to look to closely at the workmanship", 
    "I'm not new to furniture assembling by a long shot but this project had me ready to pull my hair out about 1/2 way through it. After several hours the first night, I decided to walk away from it and finish it another time. I finished it the 2nd night but I must say it was a challenge and I used some words that weren't too ladylike. The instructions were o.k. until about mid way - and could have used more detail to help eliminate some of the confusion. Also, the color is not anywhere close to cherry wood. I have a beautiful cherry wood entertainment piece for my wide-screen TV and the difference is so drastic that I will not sit them next to each other which kind of defeats my whole reason for ordering it. The good news is that I completed it in 2 evenings; it does look nice once completed, yes it definitely needs to be mounted to a wall or something when completed so that it's stable (something they should say right here in the details of the product so that you know in advance) and yes, it holds a ton of CDs. I would recommend it to a friend but only after explaining the trouble I had when putting it together and also letting them know about the color. Actually, I'd insist that they come over to see mine first. This was my first time ordering from Overstock and I will probably order again when I find something I need or want.", 
    "The instructions for this unit were not clear in certain areas and became confusing, but eventually we got it together. It also was not evident that it needs to be mounted to the wall in order to stand straight. I would have preferred a free standing unit that would not tip forward if I open the doors. However, I do like the way the unit looks when completed.", 
    "I wanted something nice, to hide my crafts in so they could be in the family room. This works perfect. Thanks", 
    "The craftsmanship is very poorly done, and you have to adjust it just right. Therefore, once assembled it looks beautiful.", 
    "(sorry but this piece is very pretty.) however the workmanship is not good.for the price you pay you do not want chips & scratches, pieces broken. that is what i ended up with. i will not buy anything like it again without seeing it first.", 
    "I really love this cabinet. It was a little on the difficult side to put together, but is well worth it.", 
    "Then this is it. Yes, you can read previous reviews about design flaws and less-than-highest-quality material; but the bottom line is this piece really looks quite elegant, stores a heck of a lot, and I am even thinking of getting another! Yes, my husband assembled it - he is good at that - looked at it as a positive challenge and had not a hitch in the process. Yes, the material is NOT pure wood, but you know, I have 200 year old antiques of solid wood near it and it holds its own very well. My humble opinion: this piece is totally worth it. If you like Cherry wood, if you like a vintage feel (Queen Anne?), if you think in a positive way about the assembly process and try to have fun with it, and you want something nice that can fill a 5'x5' spot on that lonely white (or burgundy!) wall -- this cabinet is truly beautiful. Nothing more, nothing less, it is a gem...", 
    "Product when finished is eye appealing. Assembly is a slow process - lots of pieces to assemble - however the windows for one of the doors needed an additional cutting at local store, which was an inconvenience. So quality control of the windows was not up to par. I would recommend this cabinet to others but you do need patience to assemble. Thank you for making this product available for sale, however finished product is a very nice looking piece of furniture.", 
    "I needed an inexpensive, relatively nice looking cabinet to store books... and that's what I got. The materials are not great (one panel splintered when I assembled it) but the finished product looks pretty nice.", 
    "Assembly is never fun. The plan was good but with just a few items ever so \"slightly\" off it lead to frustration, misalignment and redo's. End product looks pretty good.", 
    "Beautiful wood, design, etc. Just what I wanted until my son (an expert in assembling furniture) put it together.The doors do not align properly. Now he will have to chisel out the hinge spots and move the hinges.I think we might have been sent two right or left doors instead of one of each!Anyway, a big disappointment.'", 
    "Although the unit looks nice now that it is put together, be prepared to be frustrated while putting it together. dowels holes in some pieces were double drilled so the dowels didn't sit properly, the circular holes for the locking cams were not clean meaning you had to dig extra debris out before the cam would sit flush. on top of that, almost all pieces were scratched. and be careful to inspect the order of the instruction sheets as they were out of order.", 
    "Iwished to leave no stars because this piece was beyond poor. Warped doors that caused the glass to crack when installed. Stained panels did not match well. Metal connection pieces that snapped in two while tightening. MDP panels that crumbled when installing. I can't comment further because at that point it was repacked and shipped back. I don't expect to get much of a return but overstock will never get my business again if that is the case.", 
    "This product was very hard to put together...instructions given were not very specific and many steps were lumped into one diagram. It took 1/2 a day to put together. In the end, it was very unstable (rickety) and I was forced to screw it into the wall to stablize it so it would not tip over. I do, however, love the style of the cabinet.", 
    "The cabinet once put together which is a little tough is a little less solid and a little bit smaller than I had expected and if you're just storing dvd's and videos the design has one non moveable shelf that if it were in a different place would allow for more storage. If you are going to use it for dvds videos and cds I can see where you could fit a lot more in this.", 
    "I was excited to receive this CD cabinet. We need to have one place to put everything.We are not novices at furniture assembly. My husband and I sat down for 2 hours and attempted to put this thing together. After realizing that it was not going together because of several broken metal cam bolts, we set it aside. It is still sitting in my kitchen halfway put together. I am hoping that a call to the manufacturer will result in some new cam bolts and a great looking cabinet. It has potential, just be sure to inspect (not just count) your hardware before you begin assembly.", 
    "Now that the finished cabinet has been in my den for some time now, memory of the frustration of its assembly has faded, and I can say, yes, I would recommend buying this cabinet. First, though, I would tell the potential buyer about nightmare I went through putting it together. There were several serious problems. My biggest complaint has to do with the cam locks. When I first looked through the instructions, I breathed a sigh of relief ... I've assembled quite a few pieces of furniture that use this method of securely connecting the pieces, and ... ordinarily ... nothing could be easier or guarantee the same perfect results. Whoever chose these particular cam locks, however must have a sadistic streak. The locks wouldn't grab on to the screws, though I reset and readjusted them over and over. When finally, after numerous attempts, the screw was at last set to the height where the lock would catch it, and I managed to get the cam lock to stay in place long enough for the parts to come together and lock, the too-small, poorly-made, ill-fitting cam lock made for an iffy connection, and, often, the two wood panels being attached would come apart, pulling the entire cam screw & cam lock assembly out in one piece, along with whatever glued-in shell had been anchoring that lock assembly. Luckily, I found I had a few larger, stronger cam locks that were extras from previous projects, and with a lot of effort, some Duco cement, and the time waiting for the cement to dry, all the pieces came together .... still not without difficulty, however -- many of the pre-drilled holes were off and needed to be re-drilled.And then there was the matter of the glass panels that didn't match up with the openings provided for them, and so, the corner broke off of one pane, but it's on the inside of the door, and luckily below the opening.My advice is to buy the cabinet, because the finished product is worth it, but get someone else to put it together. Someone with a knowledge of furniture-making, who has all the right tools and replacement parts needed.", 
    "The finished product looks great and I'd like another one, but would not suffer through the assembly nightmare again.. Had to redrill many holes. Glass was too big for it, so had to buy new after breaking first pane trying to get it to fit. I won't buy another, but may send one as a \"gift\" to my ex-husband.", 
    "This is our SECOND of this cabinet. Guess we love it! It does take a while to put together. Instructions are easy, just tedious. I would suggest putting the glass in LAST. Do install the screws and \"whatnots\" to the windowpane piece, just don't put the glass in to keep from breaking it.It is well constructed and looks gorgeous!", 
    "The product itself is poorly manufacured with some modifications it will hopefully stay together for awhile. as far as looks it is nice, but if you want a sturdy piece of furniture this is not it. I will say one of the window panels was broken, I called the company and they sent out a new one within 3 days.", 
    "This is a ery poor quality item. The metal fasteners bent and broke during installation. I had to put it together with my own parts and glue. It looks OK, but is not worth 25% of what we paid. I do not recommend this product.", 
    "Had thrown the box away or would have sent it back. The wood and finish was nice, but the round connector pieces crumbled when turned to lock in place. Forgive me for not remembering the official name of these round pieces that are intended to lock around a screw like piece. Just know that the pieces disintegrated with minimal pressure and so the basic frame could not be stabilized or hold together. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap.", 
    "The piece came quickly, it was in great shape, but it did not go together well at all - as a matter of fact, it's still sitting in pieces on the floor of my den. I'd get one side together and attempt to put the other side together, and the whole thing would fall apart. I even asked a friend of mine to help me and after several attempts, she deemed the project hopeless, the pieces flawed and said I should send it back, but I haven't contacted Overstock yet. I was very disappointed with this piece. I have never had a problem before putting together furniture, but this is one for the books.", 
    "This product was extremely difficult to put together. It took me almost 5 hours to assemble Many of the holes for bolts were the wrong size. Almost all of the cambolts fell out of the piece and would not tighten. The doors once they were put have about an inch of space between them when closed. Also opening the doors when the unit is empty causes the unit to fall forward. Finally several of the shelves were discolored on arrival.", 
    "the cabinet looked great online...cheap when in person..cherry color is too red...holes didnt align very well....too many problems", 
    "I bought this cabinet last year for myself & my growing collection of cd's & dvd's & I absolutely loved it. Craftmenship was great & even my mechanically challenged husband was able to put it together. My daughter came over & she thought it was great so I ordered one for her as well. Her boyfriend put it together for her & it went much faster.It was then we relized that my husband put the handles on upside down. It even looked great that way!!I recommend this as both items purchased had no issues so I beleive the quality is pretty standard. Price is great compared to some others I have seen.I hope you enjoy this if you decide to purchase.", 
    "Ihave purchased alot ofthings from over stock.comand really have neverbeen disappointed.However, I was disappointed once I recvd themediacabinet-that once assembled, it doesn't stand up correctly. You have to actually attached the hinges to your baseboards in order to make it stand up correctly.It leans now as I am notgoing to ruinmybaseboards by nailing it into itas to ensure it's levelness. I wish I would have known thatpriorto buying it. It does have a good quailty of appearenceandit is a worthy price for the product.", 
    "my husband had alot of terrible putting all the parts together. parts missing , directions very bad to follow.but beautiful to look at.", 
    "What a waste of money and time. First of all the glass came broken, and it is soooo cheaply made!The instructions are ridiculous, almost impossible.Please save your money and frusration!"
