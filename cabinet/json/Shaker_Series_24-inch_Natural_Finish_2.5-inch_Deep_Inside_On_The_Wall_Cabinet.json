    "It's great that this can hold so many boxes of Band-Aids and tubes of sunscreen and bottles of Wen oils! We have a very small bathroom and this cabinet has such a low profile that we found a spot for it. We painted it white, and to keep it as shallow as possible, did not nail on the nice wood back provided. I just ordered a longer one to store my husbands ties (leaving the shelves out). We have purchased the recessed cabinets, too, and they are wonderful but don 't work in every situation. This shallow cabinet is just great!"
