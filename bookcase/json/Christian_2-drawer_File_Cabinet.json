    "Needed file/storage that would also be stylish in my dining room. This piece serves the purpose nicely. Well made and relatively easy to assemble.", 
    "This file cabinet looks great in my living room. My only issue is that it tips forward when the drawers are open. I have solved this problem by putting heavy books on the back of the cabinet--now there is no tipping issue.", 
    "I love this file cabinet. It works great with no issues.", 
    "Good quality and craftmanship", 
    "I bought 2 of these and placed them side-by-side. Looks great; like one large lateral unit. HOWEVER, there are a lot of issues with the construction and usage of this cabinet. First of all, they gave us the wrong screws for the drawer handles, so we had to go to the hardware store and try to find the exact size screw that is needed. I don't know if you've ever tried to buy a specific screw before, but there are thousands to choose from. Second of all, if you don't have an electric drill, the assembly would take hours longer.In terms of usage, there are a few flaws: 1) you can't open both drawers at the same time. If you do, the unit falls forward.2) the bars for the file folders constantly slip out because there's nothing holding them in place. I had to krazy glue the bars down.3) the drawers don't pull out far enough to fit your files in without hitting the top of the cabinet. You have to finagle a bit to get your files in.", 
    "I like the look of this file cabinet, but if you are thinking of purchasing it, I recommend using it as a dresser or storage cabinet instead. The drawers only partially open, making it extremely difficult to insert or remove files. In addition, the cabinet is complicated to assemble."
