    "This sofa was incredibly easy to put together and required no tools to do so. It looks 10x better in person than in the photo. It seems quite sturdy and the fabric is beautiful! The only issue I have with the sofa is that it's incredibly firm, so it will likely take some time to break in. I would recommend this piece of furniture for a room that isn't heavily occupied, as it's not super comfortable and is VERY light in colour. Overall this is a great buy.", 
    "Easy to assemble, I didnt gave a 5 stars just because its more an off white color, than white, expected it real white!!But other it look exactly as photo! ...", 
    "Received the sofa about 3 wks ago. It's comforable. It's beige not white which is what I was looking for..Took about 45 mins to put together. No problems. Nice sofa..", 
    "We got this couch for a studio with it not to be intended to sit on much. Every time we do sit on it, the center forms wrinkles until we smooth them out and it returns to a polisheded looking couch. It gets dirty VERY easy... Duh it's a white linen couch. We got shoe scuff on it and tried for a month to get it out (this is after we scotch guarded it) and still not all the way out. It's beautiful but wish we would have gotten a dark brown leather tufted couch jnstead for durability", 
    "I had been searching for a sofa with a firm seat cushion, a specific height and width. This sofa did not disappoint. This is not a sofa for lounging, you will not melt into the seat. If you sit with your back against the side arm, a pillow behind you, it does make for a great place to read. Installation was surprisingly easy. I did it alone, but it might be better with two people. I did grab a friend to help bounce our butts into the cushion to force all the brackets together. The overall quality is good, the fabric and style are great. This sofa is a sleek addition to my downtown artist loft.", 
    "great looking but very firm", 
    "I love the couch and it set up quickly with no issues. Only thing was one of my boxes was damaged, it had a hole in the box that went all the way through to the base of the couch.", 
    "I purchased the chair, sofa and loveseat in the suite. I really like all three pieces. The color is off white and not optic white. It seems well made and is easy to assemble. I am happy with this set.", 
    "I just love this couch. It was super easy to piece together and is very sturdy. Added throw pillows and throw make it really comfy.", 
    "Sit hard and little uncomfortable and color ok", 
    "this sofa was purchased for one of my rental properties but i liked it so much i kept it for my house. the fabric is very durable and easy to keep clean. the frame is very sturdy and comfortable. it has great support. i would highly recommend. the price is excellent.", 
    "The sofa is solid. It is pretty hard as the other reviewers have said, but for our purposes, that was good. We needed a single cushion that could hold up to a lot of sleeping and be supportive (more like a mattress) for an elderly person to use. This sofa was perfect for that and has been comfortable for sleeping with support. The cushion came to use with a crushed side so there was a void in the cushion. I went out and bought a 5\" thick piece of furniture foam and cut it down to fill the void rather than shipping anything back. Finally, the sofa went together very easily and has some weight to it, so it does not feel at all flimsy. We are overall very pleased.", 
    "White Sofas were easy to put together, classy linen, sturdy.", 
    "I really loved the look of this on the website. I ordered what I thought would be a dark charcoal grey. It does not look grey at all to me. It looks more like a washed denim. I'm not liking it. Love the Style, Love the ease of construction, Cushions are very hard...I mean brick hard. I am most disappointed with the color. Would return it, but it would be too much hassle.", 
    "Love the couches, they come in pieces which worried me but they are very sturdy and well made. I put them together with my 7 year old son.I am very happy with them, they look fabulous.", 
    "I absolutely love this sofa, right amount of cushion and was very easy to put together! Everything I buy from overstock.com is great!", 
    "it brakes with time.. just to be comfy very nice charcoal color looks so good", 
    "The color is more cream - a softer white in indoor lighting, however in the sunlight it was vibrant white. The couch is easy to set up and feels sturdy. I dont allow many people to sit on it as it can show dirt very quickly - I let trusted friends enjoy.", 
    "Love the couch, it was exactly what I was looking for. For some reason I thought it would be bigger than it was. I wish it was a tad bigger. Also, its a bit firm, I'm okay with that, but it does need a little breaking in.", 
    "Buy it for the look but not for the comfort. This sofa is extremely stiff. So much so, it feels very cheap, even though it does look like a million bucks. I wish i hadn't made the mistake of buying this. Even with pillows it's not a comfortable couch. Consider yourself warned.", 
    "As a stager, I adore this couch. it is light, it comes apart without screws so I can easily move it through tight doorways. I am not sure it would hold to daily use and wear well but for my purposes...It is awesome.", 
    "This sofa was easy to put together - it came in four (big!) boxes and I was able to assemble it myself (although it probably would have been easier with help). The cushion is very firm, so it's not a sofa you can sink into, but that's just how I like it. The \"white\" one isn't white, it's beige/off-white, which is actually what I prefer - I love light-colored furniture but I think this color will show dirt a lot less than one that was actually bright white. It's a very classic shape and style. It could easily suit many moods and personal tastes.", 
    "I've only had the couch for a month, so it's hard to tell how it will hold up over time, but so far I love it! It is VERY firm, and I am so glad! It's hard to find a European style sofa instead of the overly-cushy American styles that are so bad for your back and posture, but this one fits the bill!! I hope it holds its firmness over time!", 
    "This is the first over sized furniture I have bought from overstock and I'm very happy with my choice. It looks stylish, great color, fabric and the best part it it too me less than 5 mins to put it together. Looks great in our living room. I bought the love seat matching this as well.", 
    "Perfect addition to my living room!", 
    "I loved this purchase. I put ensemble by myself.", 
    "sofa is very nice just when you sit down is very plush", 
    "It's just the way it's shows in the picture. The fabric is perfect. Easy to assembled.", 
    "Couch was ridiculously easy to assemble. Looks clean and modern. A little stiff but we're using it in a \"parlour\"-like space (not in front of the TV) so it's perfect for us. Love the dark material - perfectly disguises my black lab's hair (lol). A really great item, especially for the price.", 
    "I love this sofa. I got the cream colored - it is not white but not \"light beige\" either. I bought the sofa for its clean lines and styling and wanted tufting and a bench seat. Bench seat sofas are hard to find, and this one had everything I wanted, including being the perfect size for my smallish living room, and the price was excellent. I was able to put it together by myself, too. I was worried about that but I did not have any issues or problems putting it together. The bench cushion is very firm, but that does not bother me, I figure it will last for years longer than a softer foam wrapped cushion. I have added some decorative throw pillows to lounge against when watching TV. I have received nothing but complements on this sofa - LOVE it.", 
    "This couch comes in four pieces (one of them being the large seat cushion) and it literally snaps all together. It is very sturdy and appears well made. It is also very comfortable, but I prefer harder couches, so if you prefer very soft, probably not your best bet."
