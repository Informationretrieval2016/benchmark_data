    "We were looking for a larger file cabinet that we could place along a half wall, and this one is perfect! One down side is that the assembly is anything but easy. The instruction manual has no words, only pictures with arrows. It took about an hour to complete the assembly, using two intelligent, mechanically inclined people. Once it was finished, it looks more expensive than it is, and is working beautifully!", 
    "The storage is nice and the quality is okay. It's functional but not very nice looking. The finish is actually kind of ugly. It's a very distressed black. Not real distressing but fake distressing. I guess that is necessary since it's laminate?? If this wasn't hidden in our basement office I would have returned it.", 
    "My only warning would be that there are hundreds of pieces.....and I mean hundreds. I got three of them and had it down....but wow, it was intense.", 
    "I searched for a file cabinet for a long time and finally settled on this one. I was not disappointed. It was easy to put together and is made well. Sturdy cabinet with several option to organize your files either legal or standard size. Great cabinet and great price!", 
    "I gave the file cabinet 4 stars because it is very sturdy and well made. I docked it one star because the finish is just ok. If you the sun is hitting the antique black, you will see marks and haze all over it. Other than that, is a great file cabinet."
