    "Overall, we are very happy with the product. We were planning on fillig it up with books, but it is more of a decorative piece than it is a bookshelf that can be stocked up with books because once you fill it up with books, it starts to lean forward due to the weight. So we ended up just using the bottom 2 shelves for books, and using the rest of the space for decorative items. I also placed small round mirrors in the openings on the left and right side which added a fun element to it. I also think that it can be one or even two shelves taller to have more of a presence, but this works as well.", 
    "It looks great. You definitely get what you paid for. The item looks great but the wood is light and feels hollow so it loses the impact when you touch it.", 
    "The product was well advertiesed, priced and I was surprised and delighted with the quality. So far, I have received a lot of compliments on the divider use. The estimated delivery was on time. I believe the assembly instructions could be improved. Overall, it's a I good product and I am hoping the duriabily will be good as well.", 
    "This is a remarkable bookcase that I use for a divided. I have a studio apartment and this works perferct for me. I like how fast the delivery was, the set up was also nice and easy, and didn't take me long at all. The zig zag look is very unique from all the room dividers that I've seen, and that's what caught my attention. I'm so glad I got it, it's a good investment for studio apartment or even a apartment, it's perfect for it.", 
    "Nice addon to the living room. Packaging was fine. Assembly is relatively easy. They need to provide more glue though. Looks solid.", 
    "The color was great. I love how the finish wasn't a solid color, it had some nice wood grain coloring. it's a beautiful light brown and it makes my wall more complete. I hate bare walls, especially since I have a white neutral wall. I like to add cool eye catching pieces to my home, and this definitely is one. assembly was fine with the help from the family. great buy", 
    "this bookshelf is extremely well built and looks wonderful. very unique", 
    "This bookcase looks terrific in our loft. It's a piece of art in itself. The quality is excellent. It took less than an hour to put it together! It's beautiful, durable, functional and well priced!", 
    "Very easy to assemble and attractive design. MOst of my friends have favorably commented on the look of the bookshelf.", 
    "Its sturdy and putting it together was straightforward. I love it.", 
    "I purchased this for our office and it works perfectly for displaying books, small decorations and a baskets for magazines. It's great for adding visual interest in the room too. I really like it and would recommend it.", 
    "Buyer beware - the package doesn't contain nearly enough wood glue to assemble the shelf. Also, the photos make it look much larger than it is. We had planned to make it part of a room dividing system, but i's neither tall nor wide enough to do that. But standing against a wall, it's a very handsome, sturdy-looking shelving unit. Unlike another piece of furniture from Overstock, this shelf was packed well and arrived without damage. Though the mailman didn't ring my doorbell and just left it in the lobby. At 100lbs, I had to disassemble the box down there and carry the pieces up three flights myself.", 
    "Not difficult to assemble. 15 minutes had it up and looking very midcentury. Adds just the right look to living space while being sturdy and solid.", 
    "I moved into a smaller apartment and exchanged my two big IKEA bookcases for one of these... Good call! Love the sleek look of Karrise, however, be forewarned -- it took roughly an hour to put together as there are A LOT of pieces to assemble. Great price for what you get as well, I think.", 
    "I wasn't expecting the shelves to be solely made of particle board. It is thick and they are sturdy, but I was hoping for slightly better materials. It states this in the product description (which I didn't read until after I got them), but they are worth what I paid and I love the design of them.", 
    "We love our new bookcase. The look of it is so retro that it goes perfectly adding some style to our apartment. It was also very easy to put together when following the directions. We LOVE.", 
    "For the price, it's a sturdy piece that holds up well, but it's clearly laminate and striped to look like it. However better than paying 10x the price for a better product... if price matters. :)", 
    "Looks more expensive than amount paidAlso, received one shipment that was damaged. Overstock handled it immediately and reshipped a newBookshelf. Very happy", 
    "Perfect fit for my space!", 
    "Love the quailty and design of this case", 
    "This looks like a fine piece of Danish modern furniture. Every piece was \"PERFECT\" and it is lovely in my office. WIth that said, it has many pieces and takes a bit to assemble. Two people were needed because of the amount of wood as well as the weight. But it is well worth the effort seeing the final product.", 
    "Bought this as a Birthday/Christmas present for someone. Was easy to assemble & it looks as good as the day we purchased it. Is holding up really well.", 
    "Great looking, however the material are no better than ****. At least **** uses solid particle board. Much of this piece is hollow particle board wrapped in melamine/laminate.", 
    "This is an awesome bookshelf and I have gotten several from Overstock because I love the unique designs they offer. This was really easy to put together, especially compared to the other products Overstock has to offer (some are a nightmare). This was delightfully easy as far as assembly items go, but then I am experienced at assembly products and woodworking in general. The piece is actually really sturdy which I found surprising. Even the stickers to cover holes aren't that tacky...if you line up the \"wood\" grain just right you really can't tell unless you are looking at it up close. Overstock shipped really quick which tends to be their norm. They even shipped it safe, two cardboard boxes, lots of styrofoam padding...not a very \"green\" shipping method but the product was safe and sound upon arrival. It comes in one very heavy box so beware of that. If you are interested in this product I'd say go for it, I didn't find any negatives with it and don't expect to. No concerns so far. The price is good considering the product and the overall uniqueness of what you are getting.", 
    "I like the actual unit, I bought two, they look great. However, one of the units arrived with a HUGE puncture in one of the shelves. The shipping box wasn't punctured so Overstock packaged it that way and sent to me. I'm happy with the product - very disappointed in Overstock's quality control or care for their clients. We needed to get the shelving up quickly so we didn't have time to return it. We ended up building it so the shelf with the big puncture was at the bottom and barely noticeable. Unit is great but consider buying it elsewhere.", 
    "Love the bookcase! It provides a fantastic backdrop for an art glass collection!", 
    "This bookshelf has a great modern look- it really made the room! So glad I purchased it!", 
    "Fast delivery, easy set up, unique style, and the quality is great. Very sturdy and it holds a lot of my decor and books. I highly recommend it, it's a great bookcase for such a low price.", 
    "Have contemporary furniture so love this. Arrived in good condition, was easy to put together and fits in great with other furniture. Love it.", 
    "This is one of the coolest book shelfs i have seen and i had to get it. I bought this item for my sons room. He alwasy gets compliments on it. He has a few items on it but mostly books and it has help up pretty well. For the design of this shelf i was expecting to pay alot more then i did....Very Cool!!!!!", 
    "The bookcase, while veneer, looks really nice in my living room. It isn't super nice, but it's good enough quality for the price. I really liked that I can fit medium sized books and magazines (10.5 inches tall) on it, standing up. I wasn't sure if I would be able to before I bought it because it lacked the height of the shelves. However, I cannot fit binders (they're ugly in the living room anyway). The height was nice as well. I was looking into adding some 6-9inch feet to the bottom, but decided it wasn't necessary (or worth the effort) given how nice the bookcase looks. The best part was the walnut color actually matched our REAL walnut coffee table.", 
    "it looks pretty good, but the color i expected and the color i got is completely different. plus it is so wobbly. i am afraid to put books on it. may be just a light decorations.", 
    "I love the shelve. it is not difficult to assemble. The only thing is that u cant put big books in it. But it is a great shelve", 
    "This bookcase looks great, was easy to assemble, had easy to follow and understand directions. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because all of the pieces are hollow... While I wasn't expecting solid or even real wood -- the description states it's wood/MDF/veneer, I was surprised that every piece with the exception of the piece that runs along the back, is hollow. That being said, it seems very solid and once it's put together it doesn't make a difference. When it comes to moving it one day I'll probably be very glad it's hollow and not solid wood...", 
    "I needed bookcases to fill an 8 foot wall behind my desk in my office. I purchased 2 units and my handyman assembled them easily then located the studs in the wall and drill a long screw directly through the back support panels to anchor them. There were extra adhesive dots to cover the screw heads. He did recommend getting a auto screwdriver with the adaptor head instead of using the Allen wrench tool provided if you want the job to go faster. However, they are solid, sturdy and have a quality look of real walnut veneer. Be sure to measure your space. I would have liked them to be taller (only 62\") from floor to top shelf so I will look for another support piece about 15 - 20 inches high to remount them on. Think my handy man can do it with something I saw at ***. But these shelves provide a nice modern look and provide storage for both book and design items.", 
    "Very unique in style and it has all the room that I need for all my things. It took about 3 1/2 days to arrive, and the assemble was easy and it didn't take very long. I'm very happy with my purhase and it didn't cost vey much, especailly for the quality that I received.", 
    "I can't beleive the design in this bookcase is outrageous! and I love it! It's a classic. The quality is great and I've place some of my books and some picture frames on the open sides and it looks so beautiful. Very well made bookcase. It make look like it's not easy to assemble but trust me, it was easy and it took a reasonable time of 40 minutes which is not bad at all.", 
    "It really helped seperate the living room from the kitchen, and it looks great. The quality of the wood and plus it was very easy to assemble. The instructions was very scripted along with pictures that helped even more. I highly recommend this piece of furniture, it provided all the room I needed and it's a perfect divider if you want a certain room to stand out. I love it, very fair price with good quality.", 
    "When I first saw this shelf I thought it had the funkiest shape. Once I received it, I realized the actual shape is pretty different from what I originally thought--instead of being a kinda zig-zag shape, it looks like a bunch of staggered rectangles. Still cool, but not what I had in mind. It's already put together so here it shall stay."
