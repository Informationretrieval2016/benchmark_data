    "Shelf looks great. The color is as described. I wanted a shelf to match my espresso blinds and this does perfectly. Only negative is that it was a pain to put together and I'm no novice when it comes to putting together a piece of furniture. It's also not all that sturdy. It wobbles a bit. I bought this as an entertainment console to sit below my tv on the wall. The design of this piece hides the cords and power strip perfectly.", 
    "It looks nice but it takes a lot of time to assemble. Also, all of the pieces do not fit perfectly (80% fit perfectly). The bookcase would be very sturdy if the pieces fit better.", 
    "Box came very well packed, but was of course extremely heavy, UPS man asked my husband to help him carry it in. Anyways, all parts were there and directions were easy to follow. It seems like a very study, heavy duty piece of furniture. Looks really nice in our living room.", 
    "I love the uniqueness of the shelf unit. It fits perfect in my home and looks awesome. I love shopping on line and the shipping was super fast. I also got credit right away which was a bonus. I plan on buying much more from Overstock.com. Last Christmas I bought a desk for my grsndson in Portland, OR. It was nicer than I anticipated for the reasonable price. It even had features not noted in the description that were a plus. It was no hassle shipping to a different address than my own.", 
    "Arrived very quickly. Instructions were off a bit but easy enough to figure out. Looks good in my living room. It's pressed particle board with a dark wood grain finish.", 
    "I read the reviews after I had already bought this item and another of the shoppers noted the color is darker than described. Luckily this works fine for my place but just wanted to note that... The only other issue I have with this item is that it wobbles and I have a cat who I'm sure will jump on it at some point..Other than the above, I would buy this again, it looks very stylish and was very easy to put together. I don't consider myself very handy.", 
    "The bookshelf is just as pictured and fits perfectly in our home along with the other products made by the company. Good deal for the price", 
    "This piece looks great in our hallway. Love this shelf.", 
    "Color a bit on the black side. Love the product", 
    "This bookshelf is of great quality and looks stunning in my living room.", 
    "it's cute and fits my little tchotchkes in there. it's pretty light and i'm not going to put anything too big on top cuz i don't want to bump it and have it fall. it suits the purpose. i'd buy it again.", 
    "Customer Service is really good ! very helpful ! Great product, good is quality !", 
    "I was looking for a book/display shelf for my living room and purchased it last month after a lot of deliberation....assembled it in less than 2 hours and love it! I am ordering one more today!", 
    "This is perfect! Great little piece", 
    "it is a nice piece but looks better in picture", 
    "This shelf is easy to assemble, looks exactly as it is on the photo. The only element is fairly narrow base, which requires impeccably flat surface to stand steady. Design of this shelf allows placing different items, and is irreplaceable for a busy business office, and for a busy person. Its appearance reflects taste and being in tune with latest trends. I am glad I purchased this piece.", 
    "It is a very nice piece, sturdy too. I gave it four stars because it took me three days to put it together because some holes were not properly aligned with the bolts.", 
    "Easy to install! Get lots of compliments when guest see it", 
    "Assembly wasn't too bad & it's a really cool looking.", 
    "WAY smaller than what it looks on the picture. Had to return!", 
    "Need to reflect the correct product color. Description states \"Dark Brown\" but the product that arrived was espresso. This clashed with existing furniture. It caused inconvenience and product could not be used."
