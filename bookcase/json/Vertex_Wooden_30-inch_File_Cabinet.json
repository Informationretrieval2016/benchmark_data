    "Love that this hides my files. Very nice looking! I wouldn't recommend for a office, because it falls over if you pull the drawer out too far, but that's ok for me because I'm not in it all the time. Lot's of pieces!!! Had to redo some steps when I got to the drawers. Need to be patient and a lot some time to putting together.", 
    "Pros: It is as pictured. Mine seems to be a bit darker, but I don't mind. It is a unique piece of furniture and the pieces seem to be well made. Once assembled, it seems sturdy.Cons (what kept me from giving it 5 stars): The assembly. Three pieces were mislabeled. The two drawer bottoms and the top had the front sticker on the back. It was only because of prior experience that I caught it before I got too far. Some images are inaccurate (showing extra holes) or leaving out steps (like the dowels needed to attach the big drawer front face). Also, the big drawer's front piece had no predrilled holes to attach to the drawer, making it a challenge to put on.Overall, I don't regret the purchase because I love the style, but issues will make me think twice from purchasing from this manufacturer.", 
    "This item may look acceptable for the inexpensive, but remember you get what you pay for. Assembly not difficult but would have been a lot easier if pre drilled holes were where they were supposed to be.Sliding draw mechanism does not fit properly so back does not fit properly.Overall not pleased"
