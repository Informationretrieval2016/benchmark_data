    "Very nice book case. The color goes great with my daughters room. It's pretty sturdy too. Easy to put together. One of the cam locks arrived broken but the company immediately sent me new ones at no charge.", 
    "I have a very specific space for this bookshelf and looked at several different sites to find just the right shelf for the space. The dimensions listed in the description are perfect, but the bookshelf I received was 5 1/2 inches longer than I expected. It's a nice enough piece and I'll put it somewhere else, but the actual dimensions are 33.7x11x28 inches.", 
    "I placed a heavy storage chest on top and it is supported well. Sturdy and definitely fit my needs. My husband put it together quite quickly.", 
    "Product came quickly and was easy to assemble. Perfect for our nursery, to hold all her books and toys.", 
    "Sturdy, true to color. Nice for a child's room", 
    "We have had this book case for about 6 months now and it does the trick. It is a nice color. It had several flaws in the wood when we got it, but I had already unpacked the box and taken everything out, so the thought of mailing it all back was very unpleasant and we just kept it. It looks great. It stores a lot of books. It's pretty sturdy. It also comes with a nice strap and screw kit to attach it to the wall."
