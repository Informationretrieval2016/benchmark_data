    "Had I seen it in person, I may not have bought it. Although I needed something small - this feels too small - maybe too low.", 
    "I got this for my bedroom and it is perfect. It is small but it's fine to sit on to tie your shoes and great to toss your clothes on-isn't that what bedroom chairs are for???", 
    "This is a very small scale chair. I think you would be hard-pressed to find other furniture to go with it in the same scale especially in the Midwest.", 
    "This chair is not only stylish, but comfortable as well!! You cannot beat the price.", 
    "Perfect for my small reading space in the bedroom. Comfortable too.", 
    "i have 2 of these in the master bedroom. the small size is perfect. very sturdy and good looking", 
    "I needed a chair to fit in a small guest bedroom. The Club Chair fits perfectly and looks great. The chair is small but just the size I needed. Good price and nice looking chair.", 
    "We bought this for a corner in our bedroom. It's the perfect chair for using as an accent piece.", 
    "This may be the most boring chair in history. It is small - compact, and I apparently chose some colour I can't define. On the good side, it feels sturdy enough, and fits into a little reading space - as advertised.", 
    "The backs could be a little higher but overall the piece is solid and very comfortable", 
    "I have a very large bedroom with high ceilings and this chair is a little small for such a large room. However, it is well made and comfortable so I will be keeping it. I've noticed that all Christopher Knight furniture seems on the small side and I will probably not buy anything else from this line.", 
    "Very small chair, but the seat is ok if your slim. It is a very short, small piece of furniture. I measured the space which was a mistake using the measurements in the description.. but it was obviously misleading after I got it set up. Not happy with it, but its not worth the hassle to send it back.", 
    "Bought this as an accent chair for the master bedroom. It's perfect! I have gotten so many compliments! Saw something similar in Restauration Hardware for so much more!", 
    "Very happy with my purchase. Chair look great in my bedroom! Was easy to put together. Great buy!", 
    "I really like this chair and that is fits great in a small corner, but this is not a seat I would spend a lot of time in. Its not that wide (and I consider myself an average size person), but it is deep. It does fit perfectly in a little corner of a bedroom for us so you could sit down and put your shoes on but its not my go to chair when looking to cuddle up with a book and glass of wine.", 
    "The chair is a good compact size and makes a perfect accent chair! The gray is a little darker than I saw in the pictures online but that actually worked in my favor. Assembly is easy & fast too btw.", 
    "We received the initial shipment and found the chair was rocking on a flat surface (like a table in a restaurant). After chatting with Customer Service, they sent a replacement and return shipping label.The replacement chair was also uneven so we added add thick felt pads to two legs to stop the rocking. Apparently these chairs are warped or the legs are not precisely cut.Overstock returns must be brought to UPS unless you want to pay for pick up.", 
    "These chairs are the perfect size and similar style to a loveseat that I already had. Not the most comfortable, but that's not what I was concerned about. \"The look\" is what I wanted and got!", 
    "This chair is TINY. Not at all what I expected.", 
    "My husband attached the legs to the body of the chair with Allen wrench that was included in the delivery. The chair is a neutral color and does not take up much room in our guest bedroom. But, now there is a place to sit! Our previous chair was too big.", 
    "Small but just what I needed", 
    "It's a pretty chair. And, if it was suitable for an adult to sit in, I'd give this chair 5 stars!", 
    "This chair is child size. What a disappointment!!! Great color, and that is about it."
