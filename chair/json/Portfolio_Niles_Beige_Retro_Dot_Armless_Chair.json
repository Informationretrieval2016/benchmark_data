    "Very easy to put together, comfy chairs that I bought for my work office. They are a little lower and the color is a little more muted than I thought they would be, however, they are nice chairs. Great value for the money and look very nice in my office which has more neutral colors (greens, yellows, browns). Just looking at them makes me happy, the polka dots seem to have that effect.", 
    "I bought two of these to serve as accent chairs against a wall where I thought a couch might feel too crowded. They are pretty large and remarkably comfortable for armless chairs -- great to relax with a computer or a book. The colors are not quite as bright as in the photo, at least compared to how it displays on my computer, but there are enough neutral tones that these chairs go with almost everything. Quality and comfort are remarkably good given the low price of these chairs.", 
    "The fabric, colors, and shape of these chairs are all amazing. Colors are very warm, creamy beige background with muted rust, brown and teal dots. Nice wide seat for lounging.", 
    "Nice chair, but should be better finished! Fabric it's not a wonderful quality.", 
    "I looked for 2 years to find an accent chair that was just the right colors. This chair is better than I expected. I did have a problem with the polka dots on one of the chairs but Overstock quickly replaced it with a good one. Can't beat the quality of this chair for the price. It's roomy & very comfy.", 
    "Was pleasantly surprised by this chair! Nice and deep and sturdy too!", 
    "I love everything about this chair! First, it came right on time in one big box. The assembly took me less than 15 minutes - very easy. The frame is a wood frame and the fabric is of a high quality. I can't believe that this chair only cost me $* (got a coupon too)!! The chair is so much better in person also. Retro colors from the 70's are used in an up to date style. The slipper chair style gives you a large area to sit in and the back is very supportive. The seat is soft due to the underneath construction and when you stand up, it's as if it had memory foam in them. It's just the perfect chair. The colors in the chair range from beige to medium brown and rust and some of the circles have designs within them of a different color. It's quite artistic in that sense. You'll love this chair as an accent chair or two together for a conversation area. I cannot believe that I found this chair!", 
    "Bought 6 for use as reception area chairs. Very easy to assemble and seem sturdy. They look great!", 
    "I have a small livingroom and this chair was perfect. Wide enough to put my legs up and relax.", 
    "I like this chair because the seat is big & the back it the perfect height. The colors are bright & fit my decor perfectly, it adds the perfect pop of color in my home office. It was easy to put together and the price fit my budget. The only thing I can say that is \"negative\" is the seat cushion is firm, I would of liked it a little more cushy. Even with that, it's stilla great chair & if I needed a 2nd one, I would purchase again.", 
    "Just had one issue and that was the leg level. One leg was a bit shorter the other. Other wise looks nice and very comfortable.", 
    "This chair far exceeded my expectations. It was easy to assemble, very comfortable and looks amazing in my apartment. Great accent piece.", 
    "A substantial chair and very stylish too. It's not as bright as the photo on the website.", 
    "Nice fabric although there are some lines of off color (like darker or different from the rest of the area). It's busy enough to not really notice. The only difficulty was getting the screws to tighten without ripping out the threaded piece that was supposed to catch and hold the screw. These pieces were supposed to be held in by tiny nails but many of the nails pulled out when tightening the screws, leaving very wobbly legs. We had to take it apart again, attach the pieces with our own nails then re-assemble. We'll see if they stay put. Out of 6 chairs bought, 4 had this problem. The chairs are really nice once their solidly put together.", 
    "I redecorated one of the professional offices in our company and used this as client chairs. The worked out great, although I might warn you that the overall tone is more \"yellow\" than these pictures show. It's tough to figure out, because everyone's monitors have their own \"shading\" that can distort what we are seeing. Overall, they still worked out great. You will also have to order some type of Oblong pillow to go on them, as the seat is too deep and the back is too hard. But, this seems to be the norm for all of these type of chairs.", 
    "I received the chairs a while ago but just finally put them together. They are just as described and seem sturdy.", 
    "Chair is exactly as pictured, just a little shorter then expected. Love them,very versatile", 
    "this style was the best choice for my livingroom", 
    "But quality isn't great. Quite a few pulls in the fabric", 
    "many colors i chose to go with other pieces i had in my home", 
    "I love it.. very easy to put together.", 
    "Would not use this in a room where it would get a lot of use. The seams don't line up, but where I am placing it, it won't matter that much.", 
    "I really like this chair. The colors are a little more muted than the picture shows. I would have loved to have had arms.", 
    "Even that colors are not as vivid as they appear in the picture, the fabric is very pretty and adds a touch of color to our entrance, just looking at it makes me feel happy. You may want to add a couple of pillows because the back of the chair is pretty deep. I am satisfied and will definitely recommend this item.", 
    "Matches my lemon yellow chaise sectional perfectly and the various dot colors make it easier to find a solid rug for the floor. It looks fantastic and I receive compliments on it as well....now looking for a back pillow to add to the chair. Great product and absolutely fantastic price.", 
    "I bought these as a pair. They look nice and are easy to put together. I am a home stager so I wanted something modern that I could sew covers for to use in other designs. They are wider that you will expect but very comfortable for an occasional chair.", 
    "I bought these as a pair. They look nice and are easy to put together. I am a home stager so I wanted something modern that I could sew covers for to use in other designs. They are wider that you will expect but very comfortable for an occasional chair.", 
    "I bought this chair to use in my elementary school library. It had to be armless so two kids or an adult and child could sit on it together to read. I really like it; it adds a homey feel to our picture book area. I don't expect it to last forever at this price point but it helps to sell my vision of a future library remodel. I plan to buy a second identical chair to replace one with arms. The seat is pretty deep; to sit comfortably, I need a pillow behind my back.", 
    "The chair is big and comfortable, not only a decorative accent, and the colorful dots work very well in a child's room. Assembling it was easy, but while you do it you can appreciate the poor quality of the finishing underneath.", 
    "Colorful chair that looks great in our bedroom! The colors are a little more faded than the picture online", 
    "I bought this armless chair because of the fabric colors. The colors were a little bit muted as other reviewers have mentioned, but I knew that before buying and it looks good in my living room. I was pleasantly surprised on the construction and like how sturdy it is. A definite plus. Assembly was very easy too. Love the chair and would recommend it!", 
    "Very nice accent chair. It's just what I was looking for!", 
    "Ordered this for a guest room chair - it is stylish and very attractive. The fabric is a very nice quality and the colors are as pictured. Really brings some style to our guest room!A big Thank You to the \"O\" for another great purchase!!!", 
    "Thank you to previous reviewers for telling me the colors are somewhat muted and not bright primary colors. I was trying to match \"muted\" and the colors are a perfect fit with my existing furniture.As for the instructions shipped with the chair, they are not 100% clear. Thank you, Susan, at the manufacturer for clarifying the instructions. When you attaching the front legs to the bottom seat cushion the screws you are inserting should touch ONLY wood on the legs. If you have the legs positioned so that you are screwing directly into metal on the legs, turn the legs 180 degrees and screw into the other side of the leg - the wood part.Beautiful chair and well built.", 
    "I love this chair. Just what I was looking for and wanted. I love the retro look and it goes perfect in my bedroom. Its a very sturdy chair and easy to put together. I recommend this chair to anyone who likes retro.", 
    "I love these chairs,but there was a slight problem in putting it together. Some of the screws did not work when attaching the legs, but my husband fixed it. Happy with the purchase, especially for the price.", 
    "First, this was delivered in a flash; a couple of days after ordering. We are completely remodeling an old manufactured home, with soft paint colors and a neutral tone throughout, along with furniture, light fixtures, fans, etc. I wanted to keep the living room colors very muted, but needed a little punch. I was a tiny bit disappointed in the color. It appears to be livelier in the pictures, but the background is more a light taupe than a beige. As it turns out, the color is better for my color scheme. My daughter and I opened the box and were so excited to see the quality of the product. It's a firm, and solid. Very well made. We can't set them up yet because the carpet isn't here. But in a few days we'll be able to put it all together. Great product for the price.", 
    "This chair adds just the right touch for additional seating, if needed. Quality is good, but the colors seem a bit faded.I do like the chair and also all the others offered on OverStock.. I would purchase again.Easy to put together.", 
    "The front legs bolt anchor nuts are installed on the wrong side. They need to be moved to the opposite to function as an anchor nut to the bolt. As they are now pre-installed, when tightening the front leg bolts, they just detach themselves from the wood legs, leaving the legs unstable and wobbly. This is a serious safety issue!! Also, the fabric trimming is a bit untidy and not covered by the velcro bottom skirting.", 
    "The chair arrived quickly and was packed in a large box containing two large pieces, instructions, and a box holding two legs and the screws/tool. You bolt the chair back (that has two legs already attached) to the cushioned seat and then bolt on the two front legs. Took me about 30 minutes because it took a while to align and then tighten the screws. The enclosed hex bolt tool is a bit hard on your hands, but works well enough. The chair is surprisingly light and seems fairly sturdy. The chair seat is pretty firm. My only complaint would be that the padding on the chair seat is a bit thin and you can really feel the \"rail\" of the chair frame under your front legs (which might get annoying if you were seated in the chair for a few hours). You could always add a extra cushion to the chair to make the seat more comfortable. The chair's upholstery color is a little different from the images on the web site: the background color of the fabric is a textured light brown (not white) and the colors have a brownish tint to them. The subdued colors still look nice though and and this fabric would look good with most interior decors.", 
    "Great chair for $. Arrived in good condition with all the parts and nothing broken. While color is slightly muted it goes great with my orange wool rug in the great room as an accent chair to a brown italian leather sofa set. I am very pleased with the chairs!", 
    "very nice chair. exactly as described. I'm very happy with it.", 
    "I'd previously received the matching arm chair and ottoman as a gift. I needed an additional chair but didn't won't to purchase the same set. I searched the site again to find that there was/is a armless chair that matches my set. I feel in love all over again and made this purchase myself. They are perfect together. Later found a piece of wall art that goes right along with them. Had no problem putting them together either. Its a must have.", 
    "This is a nice chair, but whether to buy it depends on what you're looking for. This chair has a nice style and fabric, but the quality is not great. I use it as a guest chair in my office where it will only get occasional use. For this purpose, it's a good chair. I wouldn't buy it for a high-use area, I think it would wear out very quickly.", 
    "This is an excellent chair for the money. The colors are more muted in person than shown on computer but I am really pleased with this purchase. The delivery was very timely and assembly was easy..less than ten minutes. It looks great in my bedroom.", 
    "The color as a little less muted than I expected, but still beautiful. Initially I ordered just one thinking I didn't like it I could easily return the chair. Instead I loved it and landed up ordering the second right away. It was easy to assemble and looks fabulous in my sitting area.", 
    "Have not used the chair long enough to rate it. It looks great, love the colors. I have another chair on the way.", 
    "Great chair. looks just like pic. easy to put together, unlike the other two chairs I bought which have been a nightmare. Great deal! looks like it will hold up very well", 
    "Love these chairs! I ordered a pair to go in my living room for extra seating when company is over. The chairs arrived just a few days after they were ordered and were easy to put together. The colors are more muted than in the picture, they are very neutral and go great with my rust colored accent pillows. I looked at various sites and stores before buying these and am very pleased with my purchase. Great value for the money!", 
    "Love these chairs. Easy put together. Lots of compliments from friends. Comfy and super cute for price!", 
    "Pretty chair that blends well with lots of other decor.", 
    "I ordered one chair and it arrived with a broken leg. Overstock responded quickly and sent a replacement chair without a major interrogation. I appreciated their trust in me as a consumer. I am very pleased with the replacement. It is just as it was described on the site. Lovely chair for our great room space.", 
    "I have a small living room and needed an extra chair that would not over whelm the space. It is perfect. It is not to small, a good size for anyone. The colors are wonderful. It will match almost any color pallet. It was easy to assemble. Great chair for the money.", 
    "This chair is adorable! I ordered two and am so glad I took the risk of ordering online. Great find for the price.", 
    "This chair was purchased for extra seating as a side chair in our family room. It looks great, the colors are true to what website depicted, overal a really nice addition to the room.", 
    "This chair came right on schedule, was easy for one person to put together, and was a great accent piece to my living room! The colors are subtle but fun and go with so many things. We use this chair all of the time! I am very happy with it.", 
    "Took me a bit to assemble - put the legs on backwards as the assembly instructions include signage that isn't on the chair legs. SUPER comfy as an occasional chair. It's got a funky look and I really enjoy it. Some splintering of the wood on the inside of frame which you cannot see once you put it together. I'd assume this chair will last a few years plus, depending on usage. I really enjoy the fun it brings to my living room!", 
    "I bought two of these for my bedroom and was a little nervous to buy polka dot chairs, afraid they would look cheesy! But they are very classy and perfect for the space. The colors are muted and very sophisticated. They complement the beige walls and crewel-work bedspread very well but make the space more modern. They chairs took a while to screw together (maybe 45 minutes each) because there are multiple screws that are very long. However, this makes the chairs feel very sturdy and solid when all put together so I'm not complaining. Overall, I'm delighted with my purchase!", 
    "These chairs are fabulous! I ordered two last week. They are over-sized and very comfortable! They are similar to mini-love seats. The design, color, comfort and quality are PERFECT.", 
    "This chair was just what I needed. The colors were muted enough not to overwhelm the room. The colors will go with anything that I might add.", 
    "on screen this chair looked bright, colorful and cheerful. when I unpacked it it was more muted. the color between the dots was more dark cream than white. it wasn't as happy as I had envisioned. and there were some pulled threads, etc. suggesting cheap construction (which I expected for the price). It was going into a mode apartment and would never be sat on which worked OK for us. Just which the color had been brighter and more cheerful.", 
    "Purchased 4 chairs for our office reception area. The chairs were delivered quickly, packaged well and were very easy to put together, no problems. The reception area is not heavily used, so these were perfect. I don't think the fabric would hold up in a heavily used area. But for us, they are perfect. I loved the the fabric, It gives the front area brightness with soft, muted colors.", 
    "I ordered 2 chairs, the first assembled easily, the 2nd one, not so easily, as there were some structural pieces missing on one side underneath, and the other side brace was covering the hole that the bolts were to go into! I got my chisel and notched out enough to be able to get the bolt in and secured. I really like the chairs.", 
    "First purchase from overstock.com, but won't be the last. Product was as promised and even arrived early.", 
    "These chairs are absolutely perfect for my living room, and the seats are deep enough to be surprisingly comfortable. Be sure of your purchase, however - AFTER I purchased them Overstock let me see notice that these were not returnable. I would have been furious except that I love the chairs and wouldn't ever want to let them go.", 
    "Terrific chair, I ordered the same brand chair but different color from target prior to buying this chair. The chair is real easy to put together and is very comfortable. The price was reasonable (more expensive at target & not this pattern) and $1 shipping. I would recommend this chair brand & style very much.", 
    "It looks great, fits in well with my other furniture. I use it as a accent piece for extra seating when needed. I sit on it to read the newspaper, it is comfortable. I feel safer now that I added the extra screws.. Not 100% happy with the fabric, feel it is a bit thin. I purchased another chair about 5yrs ago from Overstock, that fabric is better quality. I buy a lot from Overstock, I hope this is not going to be a trend on quality in the future.", 
    "In my office, love it! Very comfortable and looks great.", 
    "Love this chair! We got 2 to use as side chairs. I would not want to sit in them all the time, but they work perfectly for extra guests and add a nice pop of color to our seating.", 
    "I love my new chairs. They are not as vividly colored as they are in the photo, but I think they are better this way. My only problem was that they sent too many short bolts and too few long ones for one of the chairs. My husband was able to locate another and make it work as he is very handy.", 
    "The fabric is thin and cheap looking. The color is much darker than what the pictures show. Had to return."
