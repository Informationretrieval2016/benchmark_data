    "Had to return product due to shipping damage, so review is subjective. Overstock return service was wonderful. No hassles, quick refund.", 
    "The style of the cabinet fit well with my existing furniture. I was extremely disappointed in the physical shape of the packaging when it arrived. The box had been extremely retaped. The thin layers of styrofoam packing material was shredded and made a huge electrofying mess on the carpet. The assembly instructions were missing. Fortunately we were able to find them on the internet. There is no way you could assemle without the instructions. It appears the cabinet had been sitting in a warehouse for sometime as the particle board was very dry and easy to chip and split. Luckily the damaged areas are not visible. We would have returned the cabinet and requested a new one except there was no way to put it back in the box once we took it out. Now that the cabinet is assembled and I have filled it with files, it will work. The file support bars do not lock in place for the letter size files and that can be frustating if you are consistently pulling files in and out. It works for what I need but I'm leary of purchasing other furniture items from Overstock.com.", 
    "Why was it so sticky? This took forever to put together. The instructions were really bad. One page was repeated over three times. Earlier in the instructions, you're told to put two number 7's on each side of the M piece.. later on you find you cant place the M piece where it needs to go because the 7 is blocking the hole for a different piece. These are the instructions for page 2 and 11. READ THESE BEFORE ASSEMBELING IT. Be careful for page 10, remember one of those is specifically made for the bottom and the top This product is also easily damaged so be careful how you handle it.", 
    "A couple of the holes were not pre-drilled which made it more difficult to assemble. As mentioned in the other reviews it is top heavy and will lean forward with the top drawer all the way out. Description was accurate in size and color.", 
    "This is a really nice piece, we've had it for several months now. There are locks in the drawers that allow you to only have 1 drawer open at a time. My only complaint is that the drawers never stay completely closed, they're always slightly ajar. We had received ours with a little damage, but we were able to hide it so didn't bother returning. Just know it is not packed extremely well so the possibility is pretty good something will be damaged. Besides the drawers not staying completely closed this is a great filing cabinet & we are very happy with it. It holds a lot of files and I believe you can have legal in it as well since the hangers can move to wherever you wish.", 
    "The file would have been great if we got all the parts.", 
    "The problem is, the cabinet falls forward when the top drawer if fully extended, even with the bottom drawer safety locking mechanism. Not safe for small kids, or elderly people. Other than that, nice looking and functional.", 
    "Functional, but not that sturdy.", 
    "The instructions do not match this style of cabinet. Had to take apart the metal tracks to point in the right direction, be careful! And the foam packaging was shredded and stuck to all the pieces, including the metal tracks. Have a vacuum handy throughout the process, because the static cling from the foam makes it go everywhere!", 
    "I absolutely love this file cabinet, it took a little time to assemble but is a nice solid piece and looks great in my office!", 
    "Tips forward when opening either drawer. Level floor. Empty or not.", 
    "It's a cheap material file but you get what you pay fr", 
    "still serving it purpose, storing important information"
