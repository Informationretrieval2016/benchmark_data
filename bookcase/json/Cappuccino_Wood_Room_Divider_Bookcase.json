    "If you need a good quality bookcase that can hold large or odd-sized books or other nick nacks, this is the one for you. It is just perfect for small areas that still need a bookcase that is stylish and strong. The color is super and the quality is worth the money. I am very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "The product was as described. During assembly I found that one of the hollow side panels was damaged during delivery. I have not contacted Overstock about the damage. I had completed more than half the assembly and I don't feel like spending the time shipping back the damaged product nor reassembling it again. I'll put it against a wall that won't show the damage.", 
    "The shelf system was easy to put together and the best price for it's quality. The sides are real thick so it makes it sturdy. Great for storage. I put it together in like 10 minutes.", 
    "Very happy with this product. Simple to assemble. The sides are so thick. I bought two and they look so good next to each other. The finish is really clean an no scratches.", 
    "This bookcase was extremely difficult to put together. I have put together many IKEA items and although those can be tricky too, once I saw that this came with glue I knew this was going to be quite a project. The instructions were easy enough to understand but actually making them work was another story. It took a long time and probably should have been a two person job. Looks nice enough from afar and the dark espresso brown color matches our other furniture, but the actual \"finish\" on this bookcase is cheap and low quality. I wouldn't recommend it.", 
    "This is a great bookcase. Just arrived and I assembled it in minutes. It's real sturdy and very well made. I like how thick the sides are. Great value.", 
    "The bookcase is built nice & is exactly as described in the description. It is sturdy & not difficult to put together. I am considering buying another one. It is a great value.", 
    "ONLY PROBLEM WAS IT CAME DAMAGED ON THE SIDE WITH A PUNCTURE. I DID NOT WANT TO HAVE THE HASSLE OF SENDING IT BACK. WOULD ORDER ANOTHER BUT AFRAID OF THE DAMAGE ASPECT. IT WAS NOTED IN OTHERS REVIEWS ALSO.", 
    "Glad I didn't pay original price for this. Though it is heavy it wobbles when touched so I will have to place it somewhere with support. It doesn't come with a back which is a feature I liked but I think it may need an additional section of wood to hold it together better.", 
    "I bought 2-of these and they're excellent quality-- I was looking for something nicer than the ones you see at ******* *** *********. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Thank you- Overstock!", 
    "It looks tougher in reality than it shows in the picture, worth buying", 
    "Great storage solution. Not difficult to piece together", 
    "I purchased two of these to compliment my living room. I love them, well made and classy. Can't go wrong with this bookcase.", 
    "For the price this is a good value. Came well packaged, easy to assemble and fit the need for my home office in its style and dimensions,", 
    "It wobbles. The sticker to cover the holes peel off on it's own"
