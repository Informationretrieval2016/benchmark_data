    "These are gorgeous, priced well and not cheap \"sullivan\" type furniture. Very heavy, you can anchor to the wall but almost not even necessary. Had some hiccups with being shipped duplicate parts in place of the needed parts from the manufacturer in the original sets (swapped an additional box B for a box C), but they replaced it nearly immediately. The wood grain is very believable and again, this is not an embarrassingly cheap looking set in any way. Love it, we bought several and two different sizes.", 
    "Very nicely weighted. Great size to fit into smaller spaces. Easy to assemble. We added some wooden ball feet on the bottom and it is adorable!!", 
    "It is solidly built and fits exactly as we hoped for a narrow space in the kitchen area for cookbooks and whatnots. Sturdy and well built. If you'rebook collectors like we are and need a narrow case --this is the one! love it."
