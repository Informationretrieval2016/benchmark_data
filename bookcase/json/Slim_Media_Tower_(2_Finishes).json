    "This was a good experience from start to finish. The product arrived in record time, undamaged, and was very easy to put together (less than an hour and no special tools or knowledge). All pieces were intact, plus you get extra shelf brackets. Note that the unit does not have built-in dividers like some CD storage units, which makes it more versatile. The adjustable shelves mean you can store DVDs and VCR tapes as well as CDs.I thought the finish (which perfectly matched my office furniture) was nicer than expected, and the entire piece looks as if it costs a lot more than it did. All together, I'm very pleased.", 
    "Perfect for what I wanted, good quality and very classic design. Only disappointment, if trying to fit DVDs, shelving doesn't quite fit ... had to have one section of DVDs laying flat in order to accommodate all my movies.", 
    "Really like the tower, nice and sturdy and a great size for a small space. Do be careful not to split the wood when attaching the feet - attach a good inch in from the edge.", 
    "This product arrived missing several pieces significant hardware necessary for assembly of the unit (wood dowels, screws, nails). I called the phone number supplied for the manufacturer, and missing items were supplied free of charge, BUT took two weeks to arrive. In that time I purchased the items myself at the local hardware store so that the unit could be assembled rather than left to lay in a pile of boards on my floor. Once assembled with CDs on the shelves, the unit does look good, but the value is not up to the price paid.", 
    "It started off badly when my husband and I pulled the pieces out of the box. Sawdust EVERYWHERE!! Had to clean floors, counters, each piece, etc. One side was cracked and the backing is actually cardboard. Extremely cheaply made!!!", 
    "This product was impossible to assemble as it was shipped to me. Pre-drilled holes in the base, which is composed of MDF with veneer, were too small to accept the dowels provided, and could not be enlarged without splitting or otherwise damaging the veneer. I returned this to Overstock - which has a very strict returns policy - and received a full refund for this manufacturer defective item. I will not purchase a similar item again, and instead I have ordered a solid wood bookshelf from another site.", 
    "Product came exactly as described. Perfect condition and exactly what I wanted.", 
    "I did not get to use the product because it came broken in the box. It wasn't just chipped or marred, a panel was broken into two pieces. The outside of the box appeared to be in good condition upon arrival. Therefore, the material was not sturdy, or the company did a poor job packing.", 
    "Product was broken during shipment. For the price paid, I was expecting all wood components instead of particle board.", 
    "I bought this media tower to serve as a decorative bookcase for a tight spot instead of as a media tower. The dimensions were a little misleading - the width and depth were based on the larger base rather than actual shelf size, but it did force me to get rid of unnecessary clutter. It looks great and very contemporary. Although the pre-cut holtes where you put the thing-a-ma-bobs that the shelves rest on were not completely even and several of the shelves wobble just a bit.", 
    "Love this. Fits in well with my other furniture and was very easy to assemble. Looked for a long time to find a place to keep my CD's and this is perfect.", 
    "We are pleased with this purchase", 
    "I ordered this for Christmas for my husband. The product arrived early, and was very easy to put together. The adjustable shelves allows for more CDs to be stored, as well as DVDs. I purchased the oak finish and it looks great next to my oak bookcase. It is very very sturdy and stands flush against the wall, with no leaning issues. The finish is much nicer than I expected. My husband loved that he could empty several boxes into this new tower. I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Just finished assembling the media tower. It was very easy, even with the help of my 4 yr old granddaughter! Directions were easy to follow. I am very satisfied with the tower. Great quality and looks great in my room. I would highly recommend this product", 
    "Bought this for my son's room and it works perfectly.", 
    "These towers do the trick of holding CD's and DVD cases, but they are somewhat flimsy, featuring the use of particle board. Useful but nothing special.", 
    "This was easy to put together because the instructions were clear and gave good tips. Quality was much better than I expected. It feels very sturdy. I like that the base is a bit bigger than the unit - it gives it a feeling of stability. Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "Love it fits perfect in the small area I needed it for", 
    "bought for daughters extensive CD and DVD collection. she is very satisfied.", 
    "Sleek. Easy cleaning. Love the design.", 
    "This tower is sturdy and easy to put together. Holds more than we thought it would.", 
    "This now sits in the family room and has our dvd's on it. Can fit alot of movies,and takes up very little space. Looks good with my furnishings and entertainment center.", 
    "Perfect for cd storage. Just the right width and height. Was easy to put together. Arrived quickly.", 
    "The CD storage rack is attractive but not as sturdy as it appears on line. It was easy to assemble.", 
    "Easy to assemble, good quality, the back cover is a bit larger than what it should be,", 
    "Easy to assemble and I got the black finish and it looks great and holds my 157 Cd's I have with plenty of room to spare", 
    "This was a little tricky to put together but not difficult. I have every shelf full of CDs. The tower leans against the wall but is holding up.", 
    "I had a little trouble putting the backing on, but overall, assembly was not bad at all. It is inconspicuous and sturdy. It holds about 110 CDS. I am very glad about this purchase.", 
    "Great fit great look looks well in the bed couldn't ask for anything better.", 
    "This is well built, assembly was easy, and it holds enough CDs for my needs.", 
    "Saw these at a friend's home, got a great price for this stylish storage!", 
    "This is great to fit in the corner and holds a lot of dvds and cd's etc.", 
    "Well made, priced right, and great looking. However, I modified it by shortening it so it was the same height as my audio cabinet, and I also added a door with hinges.", 
    "Looks good and holds lots of dvd 's", 
    "A sturdy item and suitable for my needs. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "The shallow shelves make my collection easily accessible and they are adjustable for different kinds of media. Great for small spaces!", 
    "I got this item but had two left sides. Called and ordered a right side but received a left side again. On the third try, they sent me a left and a right, just to be sure. But it was impossible to put together. Cam-loks didn't fit the base, the wooden dowels were too big, the back is incredibly flimsy. I've put together quite a lot of furniture from Overstock, ******* and similar places but this was ridiculous.", 
    "The tower arrived in a timely fashion and all the parts fit. The finish was just what I expected it to be. It only took a few minutes to put it together although I couldn't get the \"sliders\", the little feet on the bottom, to nail in. I tried but there was nothing to hold onto when hammering and no pre-drilled holes to them to fit into, so I gave up and left them off. Basically it is exactly what I needed. The only problem is now it looks like I should have ordered two.", 
    "I have a small space between my bookcase and cabinet. This media organizer fits perfectly! I assembled it on my own, but it would be lot easier with two people because you need someone to hold the side panels while you drill from the bottom. I solved the dilemma by putting some heavy books to hold the panel in place while I drilled. Very easy. Using power drill cut down my assembly time. I bought the Oak color unit and it blends very well with the cabinet. The shelves are easily moved to accommodate all your media requirement. I end up with two extra shelves because I'm using only the DVDs and not the smaller CDs. This unit is a very nice addition to my room.", 
    "the tower arrived in good condition and had all the parts needed,the only thing we had a problem with is the blue coated metal part which was used on other side of dowel..when we locked it the plastic raised up making it too big for the hole.... so, we tore it off to fit it in. I would of preferred they put two wooden dowels instead...Other wise it's a good piece,I put both vhs and cd's in it it fit about eight vhs tapes on a shelve and twenty cd's...I only used 5 shelves though because some of my tapes were extra tall. I recommend this tower.", 
    "This product is very nice and an attractive addition to a few older ones I already own. I had ordered one and found that I needed another to to finish off the extra dvd's I own. Wouldn't hesitate to order again.", 
    "Put it together your own self. No can send you a put together tower.", 
    "I have owned many of these types of storage units!! But I had found this one to be more resourceful for its size & has many different areas to organize your cd,s,vhs,s & cassette tapes PLUS DVD,S!! It is very ATTRACTIVE to fit in any DECOR!! & also very simple to assemble!!.", 
    "The media case was easy to assemble. The material seems to be pretty good, however once assembled it is not very steady. Use tape on the back to make sure that it does not come loose.", 
    "looks good,easy to assemble, not very heavy to lift and fits nicely behind a door.", 
    "It appears to be a sturdy cabinet that easlily fits in an out of the way place.", 
    "I love mine.I love mine.I love mine.I love mine.I love mine.I love mine.", 
    "Holds all our DVD....we have a couple of extra shelves? No complaints.", 
    "This product was well-packaged but when opened the end was completely broken off rendering the case unusable. We requested a new piece but have yet to receive it. We were very disappointed in the quality of the product. It has a paper back and is poorly designed.", 
    "Takes up less space than I thought it would, and holds all my CDs! The directions were a little nonsensical, so I had to adjust and guess at some parts, but it came together well anyway. The color is really nice, too - looks like wood.", 
    "Very nice! I would buy one again! It is sturdy and holds a lot of cds! Very good quality!", 
    "I know that it's up to the consumer to review the details about how much will fit into this thing, but the picture is a little deceptive. They use CDs so just don't think you can fit that many DVDs in the thing.", 
    "I was finding decend CD towers increasingly hard to find, so I was delighted when I saw this one online. I was worried about putting it together but it was actually very easy, and took way less than an hour. It looks very nice!", 
    "I would buy another one as I increase my collection. This holder is great for games & movies.", 
    "I really like the product. It matched my entertainment center almost perfectly. However, now I wish I would have ordered the double ones.", 
    "works well with all my dvd's i ordered another one", 
    "The Slim Media Tower is a great product i had to order one for myself as a Christmas present recieved the Tower 12-8-11 the delivering was right on the dot i am enjoying my Slim Media Tower it holds so many of my movies and music cds the color is nice and easy to put together love my christmas gift", 
    "I purchased one of the Towers and, after assembling it and putting CDs on the shelfs, I bought a second one. The Towers look nice in my den, help keep my CDs organized, and, in short, do what they were designed to do. I am pleased with them and have no problems recommending them to others.", 
    "It served an immediate need, but will not last long ,unless nobody handles it. An bang takes a gouge out of the surface.Handling CDs constantle- I see a short life.", 
    "Product is exactly what I expected. I found it very easy to put together. Looks nice.", 
    "This media tower is a good, sturdy, serviceable item. It is good value for the money. That said, the media tower is of lesser quality than I expected, given other purchases I have made at Overstock. The veneer is quite thin and easily damaged if you are a klutz when putting it together, as I was. It assembles quite easily (given the klutz factor) and took me about one and a half hours. A normally skilled person could probably do it in about half an hour. It would be good to have a second person to assist. No special tools are required. Placed in a dimly lit corner, it looks like quite a high quality piece of furniture (klutz damages aside).", 
    "The upside, it was what I wanted. But, at $$$ dollars, it wasn't. I thought I searched everywhere for this....but I goofed. $$$ had same item for $$$. I could have cried because it was a gift and I had to wait a week till it got here.", 
    "I owned previous prepac towers and liked the quality so I wasn't afraid to order this tower. The only thing I wish is that this tower would come in the cherry finish to match my others but even so, I still like the tower. It fits nicely in a tight space and is very sturdy. It blends in nicely with my decor.", 
    "This unit is just as listed and was very easy to put together. the shelves are a but flimsy for me but as I am storing dvd's on it it is not used too often and works jjust fine for that.", 
    "The size of this tower was perfect for the room I put it in. Pretty easy to assemble. It held all of my CDs and a few DVDs.", 
    "Arrived well packed and the directions were clear for assembly. All the parts were present and fit well, and the finished product is very nice.", 
    "well made sturdy case, fairly simple to assemble, will hold 70 DVDs vertically", 
    "My husband and I bought this tower because we were running out of room for our 50+ dvd's under the tv stand...this was perfect and my husband said it was easy to put together. We love it!!", 
    "We bought this product in black. It was very easy to put together and looks very nice. It's a great size too and can hold lots of CDs. The only con (not much of a con) was the white powder-like dust that covered some of the pieces and I had to wipe it all off but otherwise, I'm very happy with the purchase.", 
    "I needed something stylish & simple to hold our DVD collection & wanted to have balance on both sides of our TV so I ordered 2 of these media towers and couldn't be more pleased! Assembly was easy (so my husband says) and it held all of our 120 (+) DVDs. It's nothing fancy, but they're sturdy & look great!", 
    "I chose the oak and it's basically as described........... a media tower. It's not top of the line; but it's sturdy enough to stand, hold one's DVD's in an organized manner and in this present economy, for the price charged.... it's o.k. Not difficult to put together and as long as you don't plan on moving it around, it's going to do what it's created for. It doesn't hold quite as many as advertised; but it is adequate, not unpleasant to look at and will fit in many out of the way locations. It's certainly preferable to having ones DVDs stacked on the floor or in a box.", 
    "I am a Stampin' Up! demonstrator and needed storage for our new clearmount stamp sets that come in DVD sized containers. This was a perfect solution. It fits in a very narrow space and was exactly what I needed.", 
    "I felt that this was a great item to purchase. And it was easy and fun to install.", 
    "I bought this for my bathroom, where I needed a very narrow set of shelves on which to put small storage baskets. This media tower fit the space perfectly and looks nice with the oak cabinets in the bathroom. It was shipped quickly, was easy for one person to assemble, and is sturdy. While I would have liked to have solid wood, I know it would have been far more expensive. Overall, I'm quite pleased.", 
    "The only reason this gets 3 stars instead of 1 is because a previous experience with the same shelf 2 years ago was fantastic. But THIS time, it was a whole different story. The parts where shoddily made, the holes ill defined, and the whole thing was so poorly constructed it took three hours to get it into a passable shelf. The top had to be installed downside up because of the way the holes were drilled! Not worth the trouble of returning, but my goodness, I don't know if I'll buy another one of these. I'll think HARD first.", 
    "The product arrived late. I was not informed that is was shipped from Canada, customs took time. Also a warning needs to appear next to item \"The object appears larger than is.\"", 
    "This was the minimal item I expected it to be, but I was a bit surprised to find that there were no assembly instructions. It was not entirely obvious how it was meant to go together, but I did figure it out. Also, I hammered one of the nails slightly crooked and marred the exterior on one side, but since I did not expect it to be a fine piece of furniture, I can live with the fix I applied. It sits on carpet better without the little nobs on the bottom.", 
    "We are very pleased with the media towers. They look great in our family room next to the entertainment center, and they're not bulky, so they take up very little room. Overstock shipped them out fast, and we received them in good condition in a timely manner.", 
    "I had no use for the two towers purchased, so I gave them to my parents. My sister put them together, but on carpet, they seem to always tip over. Other than that, they look great and serve its purpose. I actually wish I would have kept them because I can use them elsewhere now. :-)", 
    "We needed storage for my son's video games....this definitely fit the purpose! Easy to put together. My son and I had it together in 30 minutes. The only thing to watch for is the backing nails. You have to really make sure you have everything lined up and the nails go in straight. I let him hammer a couple of nails and they went in crooked making a small dimple on the side. We have a small family room so the slim cabinet fit right in a corner.", 
    "The product was received in excellent shape and extremely fast. The tower itself didn't look to hard to put together but the instructions were very confusing. Instructions actually showed everything upside down. I called a carpenter friend to come and put it together for me. I really like it and it goes with all my other furniture.", 
    "My husband wanted something small for our bedroom this fits perfectly , He had it put together in no time very nice looking and there are no kids to rip and tear on it so it should hold up very well he has only CDs in it so its not like he put anything real heavy in it. It is just what we were looking for in this price range.", 
    "Easy to assemble, but for the quality it should have been priced at 39.95. No real wood at all.", 
    "I REALLY LIKE MY MEDIA TOWER. IT WAS SO EASY TO PUT TOGETHER & HOLDS A LOT OF DVD'S. I WILL BE GETTING ANOTHER ONE VERY SOON!!", 
    "It had glue on it and marks on the finish which did not come off . The overall condition of this tower was very poor. I would have returned it except it is a gift which we delivered to my grandson,and my husband who is a carpenter put it together at my grandsons apartment. I consider this a very poor example of a media tower. It was not worth the price,infact it was very overpriced.", 
    "They sent the wrong color, but the unit was too heavy to fool with a return so I went with the incorrect color. The I discovered that It was cheaply made, not easy to assemble and looks very chintzy. I'll sell it in a yard sale for $10 and cut my losses.", 
    "Product was not that easy to assemble but once done it looks very nice and is exactly what we needed.Please take into consideration that we are senior citizens( over 75) and I guess it may be a little more difficult for us to put this together.We feel that the value is excellent.", 
    "The tower is nice, but it's actually more like 4' tall, not as tall as described.", 
    "We ordered 2 the second one had 2 broken pieces so we had to wait 2 weeks for the replacement parts. But they were nice on the phone and it was easy to tell them the problem and they said they would fix it. The back was very cheap and fell off when my 3 year old pushed it. So when my husband put the 2nd one together he used his staple gun and it worked much better. Overall though for what we want it to do it works great! I think we paid a bit too much for it, but it was the only thing around that would work and I had looked for months.", 
    "I have a small house and space for furniture is limited. This CD tower holds all of my CD's, with room for more, and takes up very little space. The unit came without the assembly directions, which initially caused me some dismay. However, I was able to figure out the assembly and had the unit up and running in about an hour.", 
    "Though the item didn't arrive on time, I'm pleased with the product. I'd reccommend it to my family and friends to use Overstock.com", 
    "this was the firsr peice of furture i have ordered. it came on time, it was easy to put together. only problem was after i put it togethetr i need a larger one. look out overstock here i come (smile).", 
    "Guys did a great job..excellent delivery..not damage at all..easy to assemble..especially considering I'm all thumbs..looks great..totally functional...I would definetely order another one if needed and also pass along to friends and family how easy it was to order it and all of your other wonderful products I saw while searching for my purchase...keep up the great job...Mounds to everyone..I hate kudos..smile...", 
    "I gave the slim media tower only 3 stars mainly because of the time and frustration that went into assembling it. The holes in the wood were too small for the screws that came with it, and in addition, the holes in the top piece were drilled to accommodate dowels rather than the screws that were sent. I had to buy a drill in order to open up the holes in the top.I put the tower in a far corner, between 2 other larger pieces of furniture, so it looks okay unless you get close enough to see the shiny tops of the 4 screws on the top.I would recommend this item only if you don't expect perfection and if you have assembled enough furniture to know how to improvise if necessary.", 
    "This media tower, once completed, fulfills all aspects of its advertising. It's sturdy, nice to look at, and matches the textures of most pre-fabricated cabinetry, so that it blends in instead of standing out. However, putting it together is fairly confusing because of poorly illustrated and worded instructions. The main problem here is that the diagrams do not distinguish the top of the cabinet from the bottom, and the parts are not marked. One step of the construction utilizes the \"twist and lock\" mechanism that connects a horizontal piece to a vertical one. A screw is placed through one piece and fits into a metal retainer located in the other piece. Turning the screw 1/4 or 1/2 twist locks it into the retainer. In every pre-fabricated piece of furniture I've ever put together, these mechanisms are used to connect the base(bottom) to a side(wall) because of their strength and weight capacity. Since I could not tell which was the base and which was the top from the instructions, I assumed that this cabinet would follow the same design. Wrong! The \"twist and lock\" mechanisms here are used to connect the top of the cabinet to the sides - a waste of their holding capacity since the weight of the top piece - and any knick knacks that may be seated on it - places very little strain on the sides. The base is connected to the sides by means of 4 10X3\" screws that fit into pre-cut holes in the narrow sides of the wall panels. These screws are strong enough to support the weight of a fully loaded cabinet without buckling, however it took me a while to figure that this was the base-to-side connection and not the top-to-side. Had the instructions clearly marked the base piece from the top, I would have saved a lot of time in construction.", 
    "Assembly was a bit more cumbersome for me since I'm not a very handy person. The price for the product seemed average - not an \"overstock good buy\"... but probably pretty typical for regular retail price. Box arrived torn and scuffed. I was concerned that the pieces were damaged, but they were not. I'm not wowed by the price/value, product quality or ease of assembly. That said, it holds my DVDs just fine.", 
    "I needed something that woudn't take a lot of space, but be functional...it is both, and I would recommend it to a friend.", 
    "The only surprise on this piece was that the back is simply a piece of black cardboard (on the black option cabinet). Though not visible from front, the place I set mine does expose one side so ran a little black indelible ink across the top and sides of the cardboard and its virtually unnoticeable.", 
    "Overall design is both functional and attractive. It takes up very little space. Perfect for today's contemporary decor.", 
    "All was fine. Assembly easy.", 
    "It was very easy to put together and just as it was pictured and described.", 
    "Assembly instructions were good, and I am very happy with the product.", 
    "Bought this for my teenage son who is very particular and he loves it.", 
    "nice stand look great, had more movie then the tower was able to hold great buy....", 
    "Delivery was in time and the one week waiting normal. I could do the assembly without my husbands help which means it was not to hard. Unfortunately, not everything was protected well and the nice wood sides and shelves had little scratches and damages from rubbing/sliding around on top of each other. Not to sturdy as well, but we put it against the wall which does the trick. Overall it's not to bad and it works for us since it's in the game room for the kids movies and music CD's and for the price we paid.", 
    "love it"
