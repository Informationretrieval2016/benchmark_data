    "This is a good quality and well-built couch. It will deserve 5 stars if the lower-back fabric flap is lengthened by just one inch to better attach to the lower frame's Velcro strip. Meantime, attaching a Velcro extension is a simple solution. I would buy this couch again, even with that issue.", 
    "Very disappointed. There are visible gaps between each reclining section and the center piece that does not recline sticks out further than the side sections. It stated not to sit on the arms of the sofa and I can see why. It appears to be very poorly made. I purchased the matching loveseat and the gap between the two section on it were even bigger. The only positive comment is that part of the reason that I ordered this sofa was because of the color and the grey color is very nice. Aside from that for almost $* each I don't believe that they are going to last very long.", 
    "We really like the Furniture of America Aurese Chenille Reclining Sofa. The price was right, the set up was easy, although it helps to have two people. Its comfy; just what we wantedThe delivery was right into our living room."
