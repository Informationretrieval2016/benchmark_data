  "reviews": [
    "I purchased this set for my son for christmas. He recently moved and when we visited him for Thanksgiving he didn't have any decent pots and pans. So I thought not only was the price right but the set is just beautiful without being to feminine.", 
    "These looked great, and thought a cooking chef meant they would be great, but within less than a month the exterior color started to fade, then turn blotchy. Got a great price, but now at less than a year I am purchasing a whole different set.", 
    "I haven't gotten a chance to use all the cookware in my set but I will confirm that their appearance, use and quality of cooked items and the ease of cleaning and their appearance after cleaning have definitely surpassed my expectations by far. I'm so hoping and do think that they in 5 years I will feel the same. With an oven guarantee up to 400 degrees, this is great choice, great investment and a 'must buy'.", 
    "Great set of pots and pans. Lovely color.", 
    "Sent to my daughter as a gift, she absolutely loved it.", 
    "I love the color. I would think the size of the large frying pan would be larger. Also, though the weight of the cookware would have been a little heavier.", 
    "Love these pans. Cook very evenly. High quality. Didn't realize how bad our old pans were til we started using these.", 
    "Very nice set. Non-stick cleans up very easy. Only draw back is skillets are kinda on the small side. Perfect for just me and the wife. If cooking for large family you would need a bigger saut\u00e9 pan. Would be 5 stars if bigger. Good for the $$.", 
    "I used not for long time. So far so good. I did not get my rebate yet what supposed me", 
    "This is a wonderful cook set. We bought it for our rv and use it all the time", 
    "I bought this for a gift for my daughter in-law. The main reason I picked this set was the color options. I can tell you she loved it, we will see about the test of time. I didn't realize there was a rebate, so I missed the boat on that. Make sure you print the forms when you order because there is a deadline.", 
    "Love them they are great pans", 
    "Two months of usage and they look horrible", 
    "these pots are great. i dont put them in the dishwasher, but they are simple to clean.", 
    "I had purchased Rachel ray cookware pieces in the past liked it so much I purchased the set.", 
    "we love it easy cleaning saves time", 
    "They are OK but not as good quality as would have expected from RR", 
    "Great value for the money. I purchased this on prime was delivered within 24 hours to my amazement. My first complete meal was saut\u00e9ed pork chops, mashed potatoes and steamed green beans using only these pots and pans. Pork chops where tender and very most. The cooked evenly and quickly with out burning or sticking.cleaning was even easier with a damp towel and wiped dry. This also came with a $$ dollar rebate making it even of better value..I highly recommend,", 
    "This was a special gift for my daughter and three grand baby to enjoy the best meals of a satisfied lifetime and maybe passed onto the next generation...", 
    "Good good goodGood good goodGood good good", 
    "I used the frying pan and nothing stuck to it,so I guess the rest of th pots must b good ???", 
    "Not a fan of her show, I saw this set at a department store and fell in love. I almost bought them until a little birdy reminded me to first check overstock !Door buster !!! On sale!! Club O Dollars!!!Whop whop! They cook amazingly as well. I don't cook a lot but when I do.. I DO! Not only from the savings, these pots are perfect !!", 
    "Condition was wonderful. Have been using them for many months now and they are still in great condition! The finish, inside and out, is top quality.", 
    "i got the blue ones, they are awesome, I love them", 
    "I bought these for my son, they aren't as heavy duty as I would have hoped.", 
    "Love the new color. Bought this as a gift and may need to buy another for myself", 
    "Wonderful set, have bought two so far...", 
    "Very great quality and great price", 
    "So far I love them sizes are perfect. Evenly cook, beautiful color and no burning. I would recommend these to anyone.", 
    "I got this set one month ago. the weight is not as what I was expected. And now I can see the bottoms are fading now. so not the quality that I expected either.", 
    "These are beautiful in the teal color. They are so easy to clean!! Love these!!", 
    "Super happy with these pots and pans. Love the handles and love the lids. Others complained about the spatula and spoon but I like them and use them almost daily.", 
    "Just got this, am very excited to use them. Don't know how they will last on wear and tear? Like the color a lot.", 
    "I bought this as a gift, and it has been received with joy. The set looks good, and having been used several times now, lives up to its easy clean up reputation.", 
    "These pots were a good value. I needed something new. Not sure if I would go with these again though..."
