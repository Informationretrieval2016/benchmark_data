    "I normally don't write reviews, but this table is solid, stylish and beautiful. It does not rock, the pedestal is perfectly sized for the table top. The finish is superior. I was also impressed with the delivery time frame and the company that delivered it. I am so happy with this purchase.", 
    "Just had it delivered this morning and it's SO much better than I even expected! Gorgeous table got the 55 inch vintage white. It's solid wood, very sturdy and better looking than the picture. So glad I ordered this table!", 
    "Found what I was looking for. Ordered the table and took about 4 weeks to arrive. It took some massaging for the delivery guys to bring the table through our doors as we have a pretty small house. Once on the dining area my husband and I realized we made the right decision.The table is made of real wood and the finish is very well done. Overall the result is a quality piece. I was concerned with height but I was wrong, it is perfect. I am happy with our purchase.", 
    "I absolutely 150% adore my new table!! The pedestal is beautifully designed, not too big or small, just right and it is real wood. I can sit 6 chairs on mine but they are small slipcover chairs. The color or mine is definitely white with hints of dark brown and it is very very well made. The table does not move around like many pedestal tables do. Two thumbs up. The only only criticism is that the box was huge and that I wish they would offer it with a leaf.", 
    "I felt pretty confident ordering this table based on all of the reviews. I was not certain about the color -it is a little darker than I expected but just beautiful. This is a substantial table that makes a statement. I ordered the 60\" in vintage gray and the only problem was getting it into my kitchen. The delivery men were great and due to the size of table they needed to carry it around the back to get this into my kitchen. I could not be happier with this table-it looks even better in person", 
    "We ordered this table in August 2014. The table is beautiful and is my favorite piece of furniture that we purchased for our new home. However, after 6 months of use, the table is beginning to crack. Since the one month warranty has passed for overstock, they gave me the contact info for the manufacturer. It took me a month, three emails and four phone calls to speak to someone. I sent detailed pics of the cracks. The manufacturer said to movement and fissures are expected in solid wood. I then contacted overstock's customer service to let them know that a company they are using has horrible customer service, they told me sorry, no email that I can forward the exchange to and that I'm out of luck. So beware, sometimes taking your money to local stores might cause less of a headache in the future.", 
    "I was a little tentative about ordering this table online without seeing it in person. It far surpassed my expectations. This table can be compared to what you would find in high end furniture stores. The stain is lovely and unique. I am thrilled with this purchase.", 
    "took a chance on this one worse case I return it. Table is hands down gorgeous. It is so beautiful that I stil dont want to use it!! haha Seriously, it is amazing value and the picture dont do the table justice. The pedestal is large but well proportioned and definitely solid wood, the table sits firm on the ground and has not tendendy to move around like the other junky table we kept for 10 years. There are so many good deals online, we are delighted with the purchase and recommend it to everyone.", 
    "Totally satisfied. The table is large enough to comfortably hold an informal dinner party for 6 in our kitchen, and I love the solidity and heft of the wood. Crafted to last for centuries!", 
    "you will not find anything like this offline- you may find similar ones but not sturdy and classy like this one. so many compliments from may people who saw my table. Beautiful, classy, sturdy and elegant.", 
    "Overstock shipped the wrong colour and worked with me to rectify. They shipped another table right away. The grey at the time this was purchased is very light however the picture now shows a much darker grey. I actually like the darker one. It was purchased about a year ago but excellent quality", 
    "Beautiful table. very good quality", 
    "When ordering online, especially with big purchases like this, you hope that the product turns out to be as advertised. In this case it is. It's a quality table, very well built and we are very happy with it. Before we ordered it we couldn't figure out if it had a protective finish on it. That wasn't clear to us in the description. I am happy to confirm that there is a very good protective finish on it. I got a little bit of water on the table and it did not soak in. The water stayed like drops on the top of the table for hours until I wiped it off. Before we ordered we had a little concern that spills (like wine) might soak into the wood. No chance of that with table, nothing soaks in, everything wipes off. It will handle many years of spills like a champ.", 
    "The table is high quality and arrives already assembled. The delivery company brought the table into the house and placed it where I wanted it. The only drawback, if any, is the table surface is uneven due to the wood grain finish. So writing without an flat object below the paper is difficult.", 
    "I always wanted a round table and when it first arrived I really didn't care for the color and how distressed it was. It looked much darker and not as distressed online. But after I put the hand-crafted rust red solid casual wool rug under it I quickly changed my mind. It looks fantastic!! The table is solid wood and very well built and doesn't wobble at all. I am very pleased with this purchase!!", 
    "I love the table. I purchased the white, but was disappointed by the color. The quality is fantastic and I actually love it so much I'm keeping it and getting it restained. The one picture overstock has shows a white table with lots of brown grain showing through. The table I received looks like a natural unfinished table. It doesn't feel unfinished. Also, the grain that does show through is warm red tones. Not what I was going for. The style is exactly what I wanted. The quality is exactly what I wanted, and it's super hard to find 54 inches in this style. So, I'm willing to pay extra to get the table of my hearts true desire. I wish overstock would have more pictures of different angles and closer. For example, of the actual table top. But the quality is first rate."
