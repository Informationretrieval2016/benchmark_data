    "this item is above what i anticipated. very sturdy and strong. have lots of books and it can hold them all.", 
    "Perfect fit for my narrow space. Using for crafts. Tip: use the wall brackets to secure to the wall otherwise its a bit wobbly. Good buy in my opinion.", 
    "We needed a smaller bookcase for my daughter. This is a great size for a starter bookcase and was very easy to put together. Looks great!", 
    "I was thrilled to find this narrow bookcase to fit into a small space in my living room, until my husband started putting it together. First, the cardboard back was missing, which the company replaced quickly. Two of the small brackets that hold up the shelves were missing, so I had to purchase some extras at Lowes. The particleboard split in some spots as the screws were being put in. My husband has put many items together over the years, so it wasn't his fault. I took a picture of one spot but do not know how to attach it to this report. Finally, when it was put together I decided to keep it because I cannot find anything else in that small size to fit. With all said, once it was done, it looks fine and serves the purpose. The only reason I gave two stars is because I kept it. Otherwise I would have rated it one star.", 
    "I ordered this bookshelf to organize cookbooks and magazines in my kitchen. It arrived quickly. Instructions were clear and a friend and I put it together without any difficulty. It is sturdy and the shelves give lots of space for storage.I would recommend it.", 
    "Much sturdier than anticipated and fits nice in the space.", 
    "Very sturdy and could not find this size anywhere else for the great price.", 
    "This is the perfect bookshelf for a small space. It hugs the wall, which is a nice feature. Easy to put together and hurray - it wasn't made in China!", 
    "Perfectly fit on a small wall. I like that it's solid and sturdy.", 
    "Seems sturdy, but not exactly the color I was looking for and a little cheap looking. You get what you pay for.", 
    "Ordered two of these narrow, short bookcases. They are very sturdy and look really nice beside the TV cabinet in our media room. Excellent purchase.", 
    "holds more books, records than I thought", 
    "Easy to assemble and it looks good. It was just what we needed for a short and narrow bookshelf.", 
    "Okay,but not very sturdy.", 
    "Perfect for the space! Easy to put together , looks great! If you need a small bookcase for books or display items, this is it.", 
    "it's pretty good, fits the limited space i have it in, and it holds a very active printer on the top.", 
    "Someday I will need to stop buying books or find a bigger home. Just can't get used to books online.", 
    "size was smaller than I thought", 
    "Impossible to put together. Cambolts don't fit in holes without ripping up the veneer. Screw heads so shallow unable to tighten more than 1-2 turns without stripping the head. Was using a screwdriver as recommended, not a drill. Returned it asap.", 
    "I'm very happy with this book case. It was easy to assemble, sturdy, looks nice and was delivered VERY quick."
