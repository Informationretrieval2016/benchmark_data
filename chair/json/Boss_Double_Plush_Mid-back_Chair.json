    "This is a comfortable office chair and the color was true to what you see on the website. I have wood floors and the wheels are very adaptable to them without causing scratches. I would have liked the chair to be a bit taller. The only other problem that I saw is that you are not able to lean back in the chair. Otherwise, this was a very good buy. It is hard to find brown office chairs.", 
    "I read the reviews and thought it would be perfect but the chair isn't plush and soft and it doesn't lean back at all making it a little akward. I would prefer to return this chair...", 
    "Easy to put together. Comfortable and rolls easily. Had it a month or so and still very happy.", 
    "Honestly- it was easier than ever to put together! I did it myself and I'm a small 5'2\" older lady and it took me about 30 minutes. The material is so soft and smooth to the touch.I work from home 8 hours a day at least 5 days every week and I sent back two different Serta chairs that cost twice as much. I love this chair! Plenty of cushion for the bum and perfect back support, plus my feet can touch flat to the ground. It should cost more for the comfort factor alone.", 
    "The chair looks beautiful and feels great!", 
    "We have these in our conference room so they don't get used every day so they work for what we need. Don't think they would hold up well for every day use.", 
    "Had a huge, padded office chair for 12 years. Decided to go smaller in size, yet hyper-supportive and comfortable. GOT WHAT I WANTED!!", 
    "I have purchased 12 of these chairs, most people like the chairs. We have one guy who weighs about 300lbs and his chair has only lasted about a year.", 
    "Had this one for years just replace it. Nice and comfy.", 
    "Very comfortable. Has a expensive look but not a big purchase cost..", 
    "I'm happy with this purchase, the chair is comfortable and moves around easily. The only down side is that it does not lean or rock backwards. Really difficult to put the arms on the chairs during assembly - we almost gave up but glad it worked out. Great chair.", 
    "Bought this chair for my son. He loves it, very comfortable.", 
    "I purchased this chair to replace all our conference room chairs. No one wants to leave the meetings now! They are very comfortable, fit all body heights/types and is a big hit at my facility.", 
    "Very comfortable, had a problem at first with the arm rest, but Overstock took care of it with no problem.", 
    "I really like this chair, but I'm a smaller than average person. I purchased the chair for my husband, who is much larger. I've noticed that the arms spread out when he pushes himself out of the chair, so I'm not sure how long it will last.", 
    "Affordable and good looking!", 
    "Why pay 2x as much for \"Game Table Chairs\". These chairs are the perfect height and are ridiculously comfortable! Great chairs!!", 
    "very soft and comfortable only took a few minuets to put together", 
    "The chair is very comfortable and soft, and also looks great. Well worth the money spent!", 
    "Good value for the money. Easy to put together with simple directions. Not plush but very functional.", 
    "Chair is easy to assemble and a beautiful soft brown color.Very nice quality for the money", 
    "don't know what more you could want, for the price its a great chair", 
    "Good value and easy to assemble.", 
    "I bought this for my home office. It didn't work for me because, the arm rest wast hitting my desk. I wish if the arms move up and out of the way. I gave it to my son for his desk and he loves it. He keep moving it to use on the video game room. As my husband and son request, I looked all around for a video game chair, that felt as comfortable as the office chair. So at the end I bought two more. Easy assembly and comfortable and priced reasonably.", 
    "Easy to put together. Nice lumbar support for short legged folks like me. Wide enough seat too", 
    "I like this chair. looks good and functional.", 
    "The back on this chair is not high enough to provide you with any neck support. This can be a problem if you plan on using your chair for a couple of hours. it might be better for someone who is shorter ? I am 6'1\"... It looks and feels like the manufacturer put just enough quality into the chair to make it slightly better than the cheaper chairs. It looks and feels good.", 
    "We looked for great brown leather-y chairs for our home offices. My husband and I ordered this chair after looking through many others online. Our research was rewarded by these lovely, easy assembly chairs.", 
    "Good and comfy chair. Easy to put together.", 
    "This chair is great. Its very comfortable with excellent lower back support. You don't realize how bad your existing chair is until you try one of these. The materials are very good quality better than most. I bought 2 for a shared office. I would definitely recommend it.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Comfortable, adjustable, great quality and value.", 
    "Christmas present for my husband", 
    "Putting the chair together is easy...doesn't take a lot of time. Very comfortable and adjusts up and down easily. However, keep the wrench handy that comes with the chair as the arms need tightened every three to four weeks. I get in and out of the chair from the right side based on the location of my office desk and the door so I push on the arm when getting in and out of the chair. That arm needs tightening more often than the left side. Not a big problem, a couple twists of the wrench and it's good for another month. I do recommend this chair if you're looking for a home office desk chair.", 
    "Love this chair! It looks like a higher end executive desk chair. Color was spot on.", 
    "very good value for the price and a comfortable chair for me to work on my computer. Looks great in my room and very good support", 
    "Your chair is absolutely the most comfortable chair for our desk! The colors blend so perfect! We've looked at several businesses yours is the best! THANK-YOU", 
    "Not as comfortable as I need for my bad back I should have spent more money on a top of the line chair ya get what ya pay for it's just ok :)", 
    "We bought this a few years ago but it quickly starting wearing off the \"leather\" we are now having to buy another one so if you get this only plan on it being usable for a few years.", 
    "This chair is so comfortable. The leather is soft and durable. I spend several hours a day in this chair and I am very pleased. Most of the chairs I have had in the past have made my back hurt after sitting for just an hour, but this chair supports your back and makes it very easy to sit for long periods of time. I am thrilled with this purchase and I highly recommend this chair!", 
    "Was able to put this chair together without much effort, Comfortable, good value for the money,", 
    "My husband and I love this chair. I am returning my chair because it was not a good fit for me. I am only 5'2\" and the base of the chair, from back to front was too long for my legs. I could not raise it high enough to give me a comfortable fit. It has a nice lumbar support but for me it was not in the right position. It is perfect for my 6'1\" husband.", 
    "I ordered this chair yesterday and it arrived TODAY! Wow! Talk about fast shipping. It came well packaged, pretty easy to put together, the seat is fairly comfortable, not really soft, but it's OK. It looks nice, contemporary style, BUT the seat height is only 16\" to 19\", NOT 19\" to 22\" as described. I am not happy about this since part of the reason I decided on this one was that I needed the higher height for our built-in desk. This was measured WITH the casters on to the HIGHEST point of the seat. This is somewhat of a problem since I needed that extra 3\" to sit at this desk comfortably. I buy from Overstock a LOT and usually am not disappointed. However, I have to say this time I'm not completely satisfied, especially since I SPECIFICALLY looked at the seat height and ordered this one because of the description. The chair DOES recline, even though some say it doesn't, but you need to read the directions on the bottom of the chair. The lever that adjusts the height also locks the chair in an upright position when you move it differently. Nice chair, good price, just not the height advertised.", 
    "Bought these chairs for the ladies in my office; they loved them! Very comfortable and look great.", 
    "Very good chair. Looks expensive. it is comfortable,. Easy to put together. I am very happy with this chair.", 
    "Comfortable and pretty solid for the price", 
    "As described, arrived in good condition", 
    "It looks great with my desk. It was easy to put together and is very comfy.", 
    "This chair is very comfortable and affordable. Not too big.", 
    "I bought this chair,last year, and need another,so I bought another one,so my husband can leave my chair alone,we love the chairs, Made very well and sturdy", 
    "The chair did not meet the quality expected by the description provided by Overstock. I also did not appreciate the cost to return an inferior product.", 
    "Great office chair for the price. This is my second purchase of this chair. Considering the price, I would say the chair is worth the money. One problem I have is that the same screw continues to loosen and fall out. Very annoying!", 
    "This chair looks great, is comfortable and is a reasonable price but it has one fatal design flaw that makes me regret buying it. As far as I can tell, there is nothing to keep the casters in place. Almost every time I sit on the chair, two of them slide out. I have spent hours trying to put them back in and it is very frustrating. I'm too lazy to return it but if I had the time over I would not buy it again, despite all its other good qualities.", 
    "This chair is much better than the 3 I bought my teens here 2 years ago. Except for a small tear in the arm leather covering it is quite nice. Comfortable and he likes it for hours of gaming online with friends. Good support.", 
    "Let me start with this saying this is a great chair. I was hesitant after reading some of the reviews but decided to take a chance, so here is my review:Yes this chair was a little difficult to put together but thankfully my husband has every tool known to man and had it completed within thirty minutes give or take. The maximum chair height is 22\" I would like the chair to raise up about 2 more inches to better fit the tall desk I'm using but not a deal breaker. This chair is so comfortable I can't believe I got it at such a good price and the color was true to pictured. When shopping for a new comfortable desk chair I found that a good looking comfortable chair at a reasonable price in brown was a tall order and this chair fit the bill perfectly. As with other reviewers I was disappointed that the chair had almost no reclining ability after several attempts at adjusting I gave up and decided I could live with it because everything else was spot on. After two days of using chair I leaned back put my feet up and realized it reclined beautifully, I wish I could tell you how I fixed the problem but it fixed itself ;)", 
    "Very nice looking and comfortable chair. Was a bit of a challenge to put together due to confusing instructions, but it all worked out eventually. Great value!", 
    "We love this desk chair! It is extremely comfortable and the brown compliments the wooden desk very well. The only snafu was that it arrived without the instructions but that was quickly remedied as I went to the website and chatted with a representative who sent me a link and I opened it on my iPad to put it together. It went together pretty quickly but you really do need two people to hold the pieces in place and connect them. Gusts have commented on the look and were surprised at the affordable price. Well worth the money!", 
    "Got this chair for our office (in brown), which is actually in the corner of our living room. It looks really nice and is very comfortable. The leather is very soft and the chair seems durable. Very glad I bought this.", 
    "So I needed a new chair for my computer desk. Turns out shopping for chairs is like shopping for a mattress. Well I made a good choice. I was having neck problems & went to PT for my neck, It was suggested that some of the neck trouble was due to the position of me sitting in front of the computer screen. I spend a lot of time in front of the computer every day. So I was ISO a better chair. This chair is very comfortable for me & my neck problems have improved. Plus the chair is BEAUTIFUL. I chose the brown leather, It's very handsome & has good Lumbar support. Suites my taste perfectly.And also Overstock had the best price. I had quite a few places to purchace it.", 
    "This chair was a workout to put together! Assembling all the pieces except for the base were easy. Once you get to removing the large screws that they have almost all the way screwed in, it's a nightmare! They use lock-tight on the screws and you practically need an air power tool to break them free. I used a vise-grip pliers to free 3 screws that were screwed so tightly into the bottom of the chair seat that I ripped up the felt covering on the bottom of the seat. It took me over 2 hours to assemble a chair that would've taken 15 minutes had they not put these screw in at the factory. The chair is not as comfortable as I has hoped. For the money is a nice looking chair, I'm just not sure how long it will last.", 
    "I have ordered many items from Overstock as well as other companies. This chair exceeded my expectations. It is well made, attractive and comfortable. The price is great. I had no problems with ordering this product, but any time I get a chance, I let people know that Overstock's customer service is outstanding! I just moved from Chicago to Vegas. As moving costs are so high, I found it easier to donate most of my furniture rather than moving it cross-country. Needless to say, I have ordered MANY items. Stay away from Wayfair/Josie Marin. Their customer service is horrible. Other companies have been so bad that I just wait for what I need to come on Overstock.com. Great chair.", 
    "Well, it wasn't leather. I don't know why I was expecting that but the flake leather quality is good enough. I saw a few reviews mentioning back support. I'm 5'1\" so there is zero back support for me (but it is still totally comfortable). I saw other reviews about the recline. Mine reclines just fine. It's not an arm chair, it is a desk chair. It tilts back when I throw myself back against the seat like any typical desk chair and all that good stuff. I will say that putting it together was pretty awful. It's no Ikea, make sure you have a power drill. It took me about an hour.", 
    "The only problem I have is that the chair does not recline. I have followed directions in turning the wheel counter clockwise and it does not affect the recline in any way. I would have liked it to recline just a little.", 
    "We have been looking to replace our old computer chair for a long time. For the past many months we have been keeping an eye on online sales as well as stores like Staples, Office depot, and others. Even with substantial coupon discounts, the others came close to the price of this chair, but not the comfort and looks. I bought this chair after the many positive reviews and by its styling and color (brown/pewter). It is very comfortable and has good lumbar support, which our old chair lacked. It was simple to assemble and looks great. Again, Overstock did not disappoint with delivery, it arrived in three days. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase. A+++", 
    "Much better quality than I expected. Plush leather, very comfortable. Reclines slightly, but just enough .", 
    "I knew buying an office chair--sight unseen--was very risky. Especially after spouse went to **** to check out a similar chair and came back saying it was awful. I am not sure what changed my mind, but after reading so many reviews, I just decided to take a chance. We both love this chair! It is very comfortable, looks great, very good quality, and assembles in minutes. I would most definitely buy this chair all over again. Dawn", 
    "I got this chair becasue of the lumbar support and the color. Two months later, my back and rear end are aching even worse and I can barely stand up out of the chair. The padding in the seat is minimal and I had to get a chair wedge pad to sit on. I still have to add a back support to the chair as well. If it weren't too late, I would return it.", 
    "I bought this chair to replace my husbands old one. It has great style and it fits both of our tastes. My husband also loves it because the chair goes low enough to allow the armrests to fit under his study table.", 
    "There chair looks great and is ery comfortable. I got the softer wheels and they seem to work well too. I have wood floors and they show no marks.", 
    "Overall nice looking chair and very comfortable. Doesn't raise as high as we would prefer but still workable.", 
    "Easy to assemble. It's really plush & comfortable to sit on! Rolls well. The price is good too. Very happy with it.", 
    "I actually ordered this chair to use as a dining room table chair. I love dinette chairs (makes a family dinner less formal) but didn't like the prices ($300+). After some research I found these LEATHER chairs that didn't look too much like an office chair but offered great support and cushioning. LOVE THEM! The whole family can now have dinner in comfort and play games for hours.", 
    "The chair arrived from Overstock quickly. Upon opening the box, I noticed that two \"right\" arms were inside. I contacted the manufacturer, Boss, and they sent out a left arm within a week without charge (didn't even have to send back the extra right arm). Assembly was fairly simple. As usual, the instructions could have been more detailed, but that seems to be the problem with most \"assemble yourself\" type of furniture. The leather-like material is very soft to the touch, but seems durable at the same time. Plenty of cushioning as well. A very comfortable and attractive office chair. Happy with my purchase!", 
    "I got the brown and it's very nice. It's not as comfortable as other reviewers have stated but it's not uncomfortable either. My back and legs don't ache as much after a 10-hour work day. Wish the lumbar support was a bit higher but I am very satisfied with this chair.", 
    "It has been just 3 days since I got this chair and I am in luv with this one already. I am an IT professional and have to sit in a place for hours. This chair is just the right one for people like me as it has the right design and ergonomic structure to support the back.", 
    "I had a brown leather chair that was very expensive and that my whole family loved. It eventually wore out and so I was forced to find a new one. I came across this chair and thought I'd give it a try since I have always had good luck with Overstock. I was so happily surprised when it took ME only minutes to assemble. That is saying a lot! It looks even better than my old chair and is super comfy. The material is soft so we are extra careful in fear that it could tear easily. I would definitely recommend this chair!", 
    "This chair is sooo comfortable! Glad we decided on this one!", 
    "I work on a computer most of the day so I need s chair that will last me over a few months. I am sure this one will and now everyone in the office wants one. There is plenty of seating room, not too soft and not too hard and very durable.", 
    "Good looking chair and comfortable. They have great back support.", 
    "Very comfortable chair with adequate amount of padding. Nice looking and the best part...very easy to assemble!", 
    "Comfortable chair. I didn't have to assemble so can't comment on that.", 
    "Good quality and looking, but spend more time to assemble the chairs."
