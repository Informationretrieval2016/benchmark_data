    "This is easy to put together. The only issue is that it was too short for my bed frame, my mattress hid it, but I nailed to the wall and it still looks good. It looks just like the one online and is pretty light weight. I love it, it looks so classy. I would definitely recommend this.", 
    "The headboard arrived on time with no damaged parts and was very easy to put together. I love the style and color - all true to the listing. The only thing that was a surprise was the height. With a mattress and box spring, you can't really see the headboard above my pillows and shams. However, rather than attaching it to the frame, i've actually got the headboard legs, sitting on top of the metal fram to give it the extra height it needed. Works well so far!", 
    "Nice headboard, just like the picture. I got the one in blue for my son's room. The legs are adjustable to different bed heights. The stinching and finishing is very neat and tight. Only thing is that this is not very cushiony to lean on (we sit and read books at night). But its still very nice and better than leaning on wood or metal headboards.", 
    "I'm in love with this headboard! Beautiful color and quality material!", 
    "I initially ordered the headboard in the blue color. It was not the blue I was looking for, so I returned it and opted for the Ivory. I got the Ivory delivered, and I like it, but it is squared off and not curved like it is in the photo. I am fine with that, but wanted to give a heads up to anyone who might be interested in ordering it and is expecting it to look like the photo.", 
    "Beautiful, brought as a gift and she loves it. The headboard looks great in the room.", 
    "love, love it . Arrived on time. was was well made and gorgeous. I just sat it behind bed and it works perfectly. The legs are upholstered also. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Ordered this headboard for my mother in law. It was so perfect. The color pops and it is very comfortable for an 82 year old to lean up against ;-) Overstock was great too. I ordered the wrong color and when i called they did not make me pay the shipping to return it, even though it was my mistake! They were great and the correct color came in less than a week...at Christmas. Very happy with service and the product.", 
    "Love this headboard but found it hard to mount on my bed frame. It had slots which did not line up so I had to rig it to make it work. I was able to do so and it looks wonderful. I wish the mounting holes were more universal so it would fit any standard bed frame.", 
    "I as looking for an inexpensive headboard for the guestroom and I found it! The holes didn't fit quite right, so we had to make adjustments. Good buy.", 
    "This headboard is really pretty, was easy to put together and the price was unbeatable. The only thing I found odd is that it didn't sit up high enough on our bed frame. We may be able to adjust a few things to fix that though!", 
    "I liked the price, the headboard is made well, the only thing I wasn't too crazy about was the stand at the bottom, if you have a big comforter you won't notice there are adjustment holes, the positioning doesn't make sense.", 
    "The headboard was delivered earlier than I expected and well packaged. It looks like a much more expensive headboard.", 
    "Well made headboard with easy style and good quality fabric. I chose the green one and the color was true to shown. Easy to put together, just attach the legs to base. Legs are also covered in the fabric and finish it nicely. This piece should last for years. It has brought bold color to a blank wall and makes the whole bed stand out as a finished look.", 
    "Very nice to look at but short on head of bed. It is totally hidden if you use pillows. Holes in posts don't give much option to raise.", 
    "I'd really like to know what in the heck those holes to mount it to the frame lineup with. Sure as heck isn't the common leggett and platt metal frame everyone and their mom sells and probably came up as recommended to be purchased together. I searched for a frame by Furniture of America after the fact and no dice. The bolts included don't fit in the slits on the frame, and the larger whole on the frame that would work does not line up. Be prepared to bore a new hole or get smaller bolts.", 
    "this item is awful. You can get a better headboard at target. and unless your bed is queen do not get it . full size bed you will see big ugly drilled holes on each side of your bed. AND when I pulled the legs out to screw to the headboard I cut my finger as there are some staples sticking out. I sent it back and paid $$ for that! DONT DO IT. unless you like the hassles.....overstock has changed. I shop at ******* most of the time now", 
    "The picture is very deceptive. You can barely see the headboard after its attached.", 
    "First off, the delivery was days later than Overstock promised, and they refused to help me track it down. The product itself is not at all sized to fit a full. I don't know about a queen but it's much too wide for a full bedframe. The material is cheap and it was cracked upon receipt. I'll never use Overstock again due to the lack of attention and service I've seen since they took payment for this item. Would have been better off buying something more expensive at a store nearby.", 
    "The tufting was all out of line, I thought I had the headboard mounted crooked then I realized the buttons were going down on a slant. Very disappointing.", 
    "I love my tufted headboard. It was easy to assemble, and I got exactly what I was expecting. I had never used Overstock.com prior to this purchase, but now I feel I can trust the site in making other purchases.", 
    "A little low but it seems to be good quality", 
    "I chose this headboard out of hundreds of selections. It arrived quicky, and in perfect condition. The price was very good, and it was easy to assemble. I received many compliments about how my bedroom looks all put together now.", 
    "I read the reviews prior to ordering the upholstered grey headboard and a couple people mentioned the headboard was small ... They were RIGHT! I knew the possibilities, but it was still a shocker when I seen it all come together. I have a queen and ordered the full/ queen bed headboard. I probably should have ordered a king headboard. But overall I am pleased with my purchase. I hope this helps.", 
    "Looks great in bedroom. Color true gray....love it! Don't have screws....quick run to hardware store no problem.", 
    "I really like this headboard. The quality of it is great! The fabric seems durable. The grey color is gorgeous, highly recommend!", 
    "Overall the quality seems great. I've had it for about a month and everything feels solid and good.", 
    "Looks amazing, and easy to put together. It is okay over all. It was worth what I paid for it.", 
    "I am very pleased with this headboard. It is exactly as described, looks beautiful, is sturdy and incredibly easy to assemble. Packaged nicely and arrived early.", 
    "need I say more? FABLOUS!!", 
    "Looks great, easy to assemble, color was perfect, matched the swatch.", 
    "The color and texture are true to the photo, and the adjustable size was easy to adapt to a full size bed.", 
    "I was concerned about ordering such a large item unseen. But I plunged in, and I am very pleasantly surprised. Beautiful and well-priced.", 
    "the right fir for my mothers twin bed.", 
    "This headboard is everything I expected. Some reviews said it was too short but even with all our pillows it is not. I highly recommend this Headboard.", 
    "I love the headboard, but it is not the correct color that I order. I ordered blue, but was sent green. it took some adjustment on my part to complete the d\u00e9cor. as I had ordered a blue bed spread. I was too big and bulky to try to return.", 
    "Very pretty and seems good quality. Hoping my 9 year old can keep it clean and nice.", 
    "Bought this for our guest room. Met all requirements. Guest enjoy plillows against headboard while reading in bed.", 
    "I have owned this headboard for several months now and it is holding up great and it looks very nice. I would recommend this to anyone. You might need two people to put it together though, but you can do it by yourself if need be. In case you are like me and have the product shipped to somewhere other than your home, the package fit in my prius. :)", 
    "We love this. Perfect for our room, very soft, plush.", 
    "Seems solid. Looks very pretty in person.", 
    "Fabric and color is perfect, would recommend!! Our bed is near windows and need this to block out the cold plus our pillows kept falling! This remedied both issues, thank you Overstock!!", 
    "Great quality, easy assembly, beautiful look!", 
    "This is beautiful. Wish they had it in King so I could buy it for my master as well. Beatiful piece and excellent price.", 
    "Looks pretty, color true to size, easy to assemble.", 
    "Great fabric headboard at a good price. Tufted buttons are well constructed and the quality of the fabric is very good. Highly recommend this headboard.", 
    "We love our new headboard! The box was pretty beat up when it arrived, with a tear down through packaging to the headboard, but the headboard wasn't damaged.Assembly was super easy, especially with a socket set. Looks beautiful assembled", 
    "I hesitated because it advertised as blue but color on screen looks more torquoise. It is more blue-green and works for my bedroom. The fabric and design is exactly like what you see on screen. It's very nicely made and not difficult at all to assemble. Came in excellent condition", 
    "I purchased this headboard for our queen bed. It came quickly and looks beautiful. Very elegant. The color is rich and the whole thing is well put together. Assembly was quick and easy. We put it a little higher than the instructions due to other reviews and it is perfect. A little wobbly due to raising it so we will brace it to the wall. Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "It looks very nice. It's in a guest room. The only reason is isn't 5 stars is because the holes on the headboard didn't match up with my bed frame.", 
    "Nuts and washers don't fit, have to find some that do. NOT GOOD!", 
    "This item is great quality and very nice, however my son has a full size bed and this headboard was way too big for it. measure your bed frame before you order it and make sure it will fit. the posts were completely outside of the frame so i couldn't even screw it into anything. highly recommended but check sizing", 
    "Perfect size. The only downside is I have a west elm bed frame and the screws with the packaging do not fit the bed frame but I am just stopping by my homo depot to fix that.Love the look.", 
    "This is a great headboard for the price! As a a twenty something, I like to have a stylish apartment but don't always have the funds to create it. This headboard was extremely easy to put together. The only problem I had was when I went to attach it to my bed frame. I have oblong holes on the frame (instead of the circles pictured in the instructions). Everyone has told me that the oblong holes are meant to fit a variety of screws but these simply didn't fit.", 
    "For the price, this is a very nice headboard. Even for a much higher price! It is a nice neutral taupe as well.", 
    "Color was more of a khaki than I wanted but really cute", 
    "I couldn't be more pleased with this headboard. I am redoing my master bedroom in Aqua gray white and black. This headboard is the perfect pop of color for the room. Made very well love the fabric too.", 
    "This is a beautiful headboard and was reasonably priced", 
    "This is a pretty headboard. I purchased the tan colored one for a spare bedroom. It is a nice addition to the room,", 
    "Color is not quite what I expected. Had to drill holes In the headboard to make it work for our queen sized bed. Looks fine.", 
    "Beautiful head board but the color is almost black more than gray", 
    "Looks classy on my girls twin beds.", 
    "The color is more beige than ivory. But quality seems good.", 
    "Colors are vibrant and advertised.", 
    "I can't give it a 5 because the legs were way too short. I mounted it directly to the wall. If you don't plan to do that or make new legs for it, then do not buy.", 
    "Goes with all the furniture. VERY easy to set up.", 
    "Looks great, easy to put together!!", 
    "the color was exactly on the photo. I loved it very much.", 
    "Nice headboard, looks great", 
    "Great looking piece. Nice quality. Highly recommended.", 
    "The headboard totally met my expectation in what I was looking for. Easy assembly to attach to the frame, and really adds to the room. Highly recommended.", 
    "Color was as expected, easy to attach to frame. Great item for the money.", 
    "I like this headboard a lot. One thing to know- it is designed to be mounted to a bed, not the wall. Needs a little modification to mount to wall. All around- a great buy!", 
    "Like other reviewers mentioned, it is TINY. I was hoping for a head board that would be an eye catching wow factor, but it actually looks really sad and made for a child's room or maybe a guest bed room.Not worth the price. Once you stack a box and mattress to the frame, you can only see maybe a few inches of the head board - no exaggeration.", 
    "I absolutely love this headboard. It came well packaged. It was easy to assemble and it is very sturdy. I looks beautiful and it is exactly what i wanted in my master bedroom."
