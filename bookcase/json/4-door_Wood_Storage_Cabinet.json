    "Sometimes a low-cost item turns out to be a true bargain. But not this one. It is made of the cheaper particle board, the kind that seems to easily shred/chip away for no particular reason. Instructions were laughable; one small (I mean like a 4 x 5 in) thin sheet of paper which is more parts list than assembly instructions. It does have four pictures of the cabinet in various stages of construction (the first image starts with the completed cabinet). But this isn't an issue for anyone skilled at furniture assembly; it's just a matter of studying the pieces to see how they fall together. The finished product is light but seems reasonably sturdy. What has me setting this thing out on the curb after 5 days of use is the smell. When I first opened the box, I was met with an unpleasant smell that I figured would dissipate as the pieces aired out. After doing a web search on \"particle board outgassing\", I learned that I should've 'spread the pieces out in a garage for several days'. Outgassing is the escape of fumes from the adhesive (usually formaldehyde) used to bind the wood chips together before they're pressed into sheets. The outgassing process can take up to 10 years to complete. TEN. What made me decide to put the cabinet out: this morning after opening my curtains, I smelt that smell again, almost as strong as when I first opened the box a week ago. I realized the morning sun was falling on the cabinet - pretty much heating it and probably increasing the release of gas. At this point, I'm thinking that this product is unsafe for indoor use. It may not take a full 10 years to outgas but how ever long, it will be longer than I care to be exposed to formaldehyde aerosolizing my home. Even the handles, made of some thin metal, have a smell. I took time to wrap the handles in decorative thread so I wouldn't have to touch the metal at all. Better to discard.", 
    "This product came to me broken in one of the side panels, cracked right in the middle. The back pieces were all wood veneer in the color of the cabinet on one side and other veneer colors that did not match on the back side. The magnets that catch the doors did not fit in the drilled wholes , so one snapped in half while installing, no directions, missing screws, plastic handles, scratches and dirty on the veneer. Total waste of your time and money if they keep putting out poor product like this. I put it together on my weekend and felt like I was a sucker. Do not waste your time. I took pictures and hope to contact the company to resolve the poor product.", 
    "Love it so much, can't wait for it to come back in stock", 
    "We needed closed storage for beach towels in a sheltered area next to our outdoor pool. This cabinet holds about thirty towels folded carefully. It is not unattractive and for the price really solved our problem. If it gets shabby looking I can always paint it white and get a few more years out of it. Not the sturdiest of construction and comes with minimal instructions for assembly, it was still easy to build and we would buy it again.", 
    "There were missing hardware parts and some of the plastic parts were broken. Would not order again.", 
    "Not well made. Pieces were broken and missing from shipment. I will say customer service is great. They shipped me the missing and broken parts. Plus gave me credit for sending me the wrong color.", 
    "You can leave one or 2 doors off to have shelf space which looks great. Make sure to screw the doors to the plastic part that holds them or else they keep sliding out, damaging the the wood around and might end up on your foot.Besides that I love it. Makes the room look bright.", 
    "I didn't realize this cabinet came in pink so was very surprised when I came home and my husband put it together. We gave it to the grandkids as it looks like cute pink lockers. Good product for such an inexpensive price.", 
    "I did not receive the color I ordered. By the time I opened it I was too upset so I just kept it and said I would paint it later."
