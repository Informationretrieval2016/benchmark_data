    "I got these for extra seating at Thanksgiving and they filled the bill. Sturdy and very nice looking. I originally ordered from ******* but returned them because Overstock had same chairs for better price", 
    "Great quality for a low price", 
    "The cushions are thick and comfortable. Nice quality item. They are definitely nicer than expected. I may need more chairs. If I do, I will order these chairs again.", 
    "The chairs are a gift for my daughter and husband. The chairs are perfect and comfortable. Thks", 
    "overall I am o.k with my shipment It arrives in time .only one chair is little broken on the top .I didn't complain because all the chairs came in time .", 
    "These were a replacement for ones that were borrowed. Recipient very pleased, felt quality very good. Cosco is a long established manufacturer or folding chairs. I've never heard anything but good comments about quality and comfort", 
    "Nice chairs that provide extra seating when needed.", 
    "not the same as the one sold in ****. they are smaller, the fabric feels more like nylon than fabric. after purchase i found out the they were on sale for cheaper at Cosco.", 
    "We bought these to have for extended families and they were perfect for adding extra seating around the dining table on the deck. Comfortable padded bottoms and backs!", 
    "The chairs are very sturdy. I only hesitated because the seats and back are fabric so I was worried that it would stain or rip easier however it is a lot better quality than I expected so I don't think I have to worry about it getting worn out too fast.", 
    "These chairs surprised me! They are a great neutral color, and the padding on the seat and the back is very attractive.Comfortable, too.", 
    "I ordered 4 chairs, and the chairs came with fish smell when I received them. It is NOT a pleasant smell when you use these chairs in a dinning room. I will try to leave them outside under the sun and see if the smell goes away... I have 4 other spare chairs (vinyl padded) and they have served me for 3 years, still very good (no strange smell). I'd rather have the vinyl padded chairs instead of these fabric ones (with fish smell, yuk!). I thought the fabric ones were better, but they are not.", 
    "Chairs were delivered timely and packaged well. There was one small snag on one chair cushion, but easily fixed by clipping thread. Do be careful, while the picture shows black chairs, one color option is antique linen. I didn't realize until they were delivered that I didn't order the black ones. They look nice, so I'm keeping them even though I have the black folding table. They do make a nice contrast.", 
    "We bought this for a birthday present at a later date, so have not used them, but the look great and are well constructed. Cosco is a great manufacturer and are very reputable. The price was right as they were on sale , but would have paid more. Hope they like them as much as we do, would like to have them ourselves, may just keep them. LOL", 
    "Overall, a good purchase. Looks good, is a comfortable chair, is strong, stacks well and easy to handle"
