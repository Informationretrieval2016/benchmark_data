    "The cabinet is very nice and looks just like the picture . True to color and form . The only thing the buyer should be aware of is , that the shelf in the cabinet is divided . Another words , when you open it up the cabinet has a petition board right down the middle (where the doors attached them selves when closed ).So, it's not one shelf from left to right . We purchased it to put our DVD player and cable box . The only reason why I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars is we could not use it . The middle divider made 2 separate spaces that where too small .", 
    "Got this to function in a small bathroom space. Easy to assemble, all wood and glass (not cheap particle board), and it's really nice.", 
    "I love this shoe storage, but there wasn't quite enough room in depth, so we placed it in our bedroom for extra storage. It is a beautiful piece and the glass doors make displaying items nice.", 
    "Matched perfectly with the rest of my dining room furniture - just the piece I was looking for!", 
    "Very nice cabinet. Great value. Adequate for light storage. Very Dark finish is almost black. Simple assembly, about one hour.", 
    "It took me a good part of a morning to put this together, over 2 hours, probably even 3. There were a few things that were tricky, cam locks, and I had to repeatedly turn the cabinet on different sides to attach the screws. And just when you think you're done, the backboard did not have corresponding holes in the wood part. The finished product does look nice. There were a few minor scrapes on the finish - from the packing and delivery - but overall pretty minor.", 
    "Very happy with this piece easy to put together, very sturdy and real solid wood good buy for price", 
    "Good cabinet. Sturdy design. ...............", 
    "I love this piece. Exactly as described. I'm using it as a low boy in the kitchen to display dishes!", 
    "Very nice cabinet in the craftsman style. Required some assembly. shelves are very adjustable. Doors aren't terribly sturdy, but will do fine for a cabinet I don't get into often. I really like the look of it.", 
    "Nice piece of furniture. Perfect size for an entryway", 
    "It was damaged upon arrival.", 
    "We originally purchased this item for additional storage in our media room. I planned to put a fish tank on top. When I received the item, the directions clearly stated that it's not meant to hold heavy items on top. I felt a bit misled, but kept the piece because it looks sharp.", 
    "Perfect size and great value", 
    "I purchased this cabinet to store my media components such as my cable box, DVD player and surround sound amplifier. The dimensions listed for the item were misleading as the depth of the cabinet is listed as 14 inches. The actual depth of the cabinet is 10 inches . The only part that is 14 inches in depth is the top of the cabinet itself therefore I was unable to store any of my media components. Cabinet is only good for storing DVD's or other small items.", 
    "Horrible assembly..holes didnt match up, doors now sit off by 1/2 \". Would have been nice otherwise. Glass doors, solid. Took 1.5 hrs to assemble and its not level and doors are off.", 
    "This piece is fabulous - truly much more expensive looking than the purchase price. We had a slight challenge putting the doors on the right way to close completely - we had the shelf in backwards - but it was easily fixed and the piece is better than described.", 
    "Easy to put together and a beautiful piece of furnitur.e", 
    "Love the way it looks in my living room, bought it for DVDs and it is of good quality and easy to put together.", 
    "Great in my kitchen. Fairly easy to assemble.", 
    "This is a cute cabinet we intend to use for cable box, DVD player, and DVDs. The wood was really nicer than I imagined. I was fearing MDF-like wood. The assembly was time consuming though.", 
    "This is a beautiful true to the photo product. It is easy to assemble and is a great addition to any room. The dark tobacco color looks rich and there is plenty of storage on the two shelves.", 
    "Wow! I am honored to be the first! I needed a medium smallish buffet to fit near my dining room table that is of similar color. I can safely say I hit a homerun! The packaging was great and all the screws came individually bagged and itemized. The buffet looks really sleek looking, i'm not sure if its worth the price I paid. I'm not saying its cheap looking, but a few dollars could be knocked off a bit. IT WAS SO EASY TO PUT TOGETHER! Under two hours by myself. If you are looking for something to fit in a semi-small space this would do nicely."
