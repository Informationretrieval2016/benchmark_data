    "As usual this Overstock purchase was a true find! All the sets I looked at in the local furniture stores were three times the price. I wanted a casual and non-formal feel for my dining table. My house is a new \"old\" farmhouse decorated in a relaxed beach feel. It's like I am always on vacation! This set completes my dining room. These two chairs were added to the full dining set with six chairs making this set fit eight. We are not small people and these chairs are ample and sturdy. I highly recommend this set and these chairs!", 
    "I bought these chairs to used with a farmhouse table that my brother built for me. We have sort of a \"PB\" style going on in our home. I was very nervous to order 6 chairs online in case they didn't match or were poor quality. First of all, the color on these chairs is a true antique white...not bright white and not too cream. The wood tone is very true to the picture online, and is what I would call a medium to dark color. One reviewer pointed out that the distressing is exactly the same on every chair. That is true, but is not a detail that many people, including myself would notice. The distressing is minimal, but just enough for my taste. Secondly, I rated the chairs \"good\" quality. I reserve an \"excellent\" rating for furniture that is Amish made or of similar workmanship. These are well made, and I believe will last many years in my busy home. Some reviewers commented that the chairs were difficult to put together or that holes didn't line up. We absolutely did NOT find that to be the case. My husband and I are fairly handy. We used a cordless drill, and it took less than 30 minutes to put 2 chairs together working as a team. All holes lined up and directions were clear. If using a cordless drill, be careful not to over-tighten each bolt/screw, because you could split the wood. The only thing we did differently from the directions is that we installed the seats of the chairs with the chair upright. I held the seat in place while he inserted the final screws. We had no issues with any of the chairs being wobbly. Even if we were not handy, the assembly is \"beginner level\". I would recommend 2 people as an extra set of hands is always best. If you are like me, I rely heavily on reviews when shopping online. I hope you found this helpful, and that I answered any questions that you may have had. The bottom line is that I would most definitely order these chairs again, and highly recommend them. The price is awesome compared to most chain furniture stores, and the quality is NOT inferior. Happy Shopping!", 
    "These chairs are absolutely beautiful! Just like they are pictured online. They have a distressed look to the paint finish which makes them look elegant but shabby-chic. The one thing I would point out is that the instructions are incorrect, and luckily my husband is very handy and was able to put them together easily. (Just don't rely on the instructions). I read a review that they were not very sturdy and got worried-however-we found that If you are careful when putting them together and make sure everything aligns properly (especially the legs), the chairs are very sturdy, and will not wobble at all. My husband used an electric screwdriver with an Alan wrench attachment, which made it much easier to get the bolts tight enough. I LOVE these chairs, and they instantly made my room look better; I am very happy with my purchase!", 
    "A couple days after I ordered my chairs I was in a furniture store and saw the same chairs for much more. In fact what I paid for 2 they wanted for 1. My table is white distressed, these chairs are more off white but the difference is not enough to worry about, and I'm a nit picker :)", 
    "So I'm anxious to review for PROS #1 OVERSTOCK ROCKED! They were ordered on a Sunday & received that Wednesday. #2 The chairs are inexpensive plus again - OVERSTOCK ROCKED - w/ a President's Day coupon MORE SAVINGS! #3 They matched the color of the barstools from XXXXXX - I wasn't sure that the antique white would match the ones offered by Overstock. #4 They are an antique white not - buttery & not white. A cream. #5 They are good solid big seats. The Cons #1 There are the fly splatterings but they are faint & you kind of want to scrub that off but it's only upon close looking. #2 It took us 2.5 hours to put together 6 and the real BAD part & why I'm giving them a Good rather than Excellent is that the seats are very difficult to attach to the chair. It's not because of us but due to the misaligned screw holes so that in order to get each seat to attach it took some real muscle & patience! The rest of the chair is simple to assemble & we'd have been done in 1/2 the time if the seats weren't such a pain! #3 The distressed markings are UNIFORM - so uniformly distress is unique compared to a normal wearing or a personal distressing. #4 There are no cross bars. As comfy as the seat is there aren't the places to set your feet. I WISH I KNEW HOW LONG THEIR LIFE SPAN will be so I could tell you that as well since there aren't the cross bars for a solid feel. #5 So you DO get what you PAY for. They are lighter than other Malaysian made chairs we have.", 
    "We ordered 8 chairs for our new custom made farm house table. The chairs looking amazing with the table . We have placed an order for 2 additional chairs making to total of 10. They are quite comfortable for dinning chairs. Love the look", 
    "I have a round glass table.......live at the beach....wanted a lighter.....more charming look.....my glass table has an antique white base......these chairs caught my eyes.........perfect color......perfect look. I received 2 boxes......one chair back was slightly damaged........Overstock personnel were wonderful in fixing the problem......all accomplished in a week!! I was alittle concerned about the size of the chair seats......seemed bigger than normal.......not a problem......they look wonderful, and contrast quite nice with my furniture! Assembling was easy.........wonderful......charming appeal! Highly recommend !!!!", 
    "After months of searching, I finally found what I was looking for at a price almost too good to be true. Chairs are white -- not ivory -- and seat is dark enough to go with a table I already have. So glad to have discovered overstock.com. My initial order was for 2 chairs; I just ordered 4 more.", 
    "Very sturdy and stylish---good for bigger/taller people--definitely reccommend!", 
    "I love these chairs, they look amazing in our kitchen. High quality, real wood, fairly simple to put together.", 
    "Perfect. I mixed with another wood, an antique table. The look is just what I was going for, & the price for solid wood chars was unbelievable. The workmanship is fabulous.", 
    "love these chairs. One broke early on and they sent replacement part right away.", 
    "I refinished a table and these chairs really added an extra touch to the set. Sturdy. The first time they were sent damaged, but overstock reshipped new ones quickly.", 
    "LOVE THE CHAIRS... they were missing screws and parts to assemble. Had to find something to work. HOW CAN YOU SEND 3 SCREWS INSTEAD OF 4????", 
    "Great price! Love love love the chairs!!!!!", 
    "Chairs looked nice at first look. We put them together and found theseats on 3 chairs not drilled and on one totally wrong drilled. Somepaint was missing on 1 chair. Had to pack them all together again and send them back. Customer service was excellent and we got our money back. Wish they would have a better quality control and save us all the trouble.", 
    "I, too, have had problems with these chairs. I love the look, but within the first 60 days, the backs of two had pieces break out. Not sturdy enough to have around children.", 
    "These are good looking chairs and would have been perfect for our table, but like other reviews have said, one of them arrived with a huge crack and several small cracks. Very disappointing.", 
    "These are very poorly made items. The seat frame is is only held onto the back legs/frame by two bolts which become loose after 1 sitting. Furthermore the chair does not have any support between the front /back legs which causes lots of wobble forward and aft which contributes to the loosening. I would not ever recommend these to anyone. They are a lawsuit waiting to happen.", 
    "The chairs are perfect French Country for my decore. The High backs are beautifully designed and distressed. They are very comfortable too! Would highly recommend these to anyone who likes distressed furniture.", 
    "My first purchase.....a WINNER. Quality for price, OUTSTANDING. Assembly a cinch. Very sturdy, comfortable. Charming yet sothisticated. Don't hesitate, you won't be sorry.", 
    "I purchased 2 sets of these chairs to pair with a table I inherited. I didn't want an exact style match but wanted to keep a country theme and these suited my purpose perfectly. I get compliments on their woven look backs all the time. These were not hard to put together and it didn't take more than an hour for all four. They are well made and the quality of the work makes this another Overstock bargain beyond compare!", 
    "Very nice finish. Easy assembly. Very good value for the low cost.", 
    "I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the chairs when I ordered them but the quality of them was actually very good. They were pretty easy to assemble. These chairs are very sturdy.", 
    "I was fearful of ordering online, however the chairs arrived undamaged, and as a single woman I was also thinking I would have to pay someone to assemble them. Wrong! I put them together myself. I have no skills however the directions and ease of assembly was great.I'm impressed with the solidness and sturdiness of the chairs and plan to buy two more. They look just like the picture and the wood seat is comfortable and roomy, so I don't have to worry about large guests not fitting on the chair. They compliment the antique white table I have and are a perfect addition to my kitchen. I had one seat that had a slight crack and Overstock Customer Service is AWESOME!! They are sending a replacement and will give me info on how to return the one piece that was problematic.", 
    "These chairs arrived very quickly, were easy to assemble, and look exactly as pictured. They are beautiful, sturdy and we love them.", 
    "Easy to put together, well packed . Very sturdy chairs. Only thing was thatthe distressed marks on chairs are identical.....same place on all chairs.Overall, very pleased w/purchase. Would highly recommend.", 
    "We ordered 3 sets of these chairs & are so glad we did. We looked & looked in many stores & web sites before finding these on Overstock. They are sturdy, look very nice with our big round table & are more comfortable than the original leather chairs that came with our table. They have given a new look to our breakfast set now which is exactly what we hoped to achieve. The chairs arrived in good condition & all 6 chairs were assembled by our son within an hour (thank goodness for power tools). The price was unbelievably reasonable too. I do agree with another person who said the distressing on the chairs is in the same area on each chair however I think I can add a little more distressing with some sandpaper to give each chair its own look as far as distressing goes. If not for that, I would have given these chairs 5 stars. We are very happy with these chairs!", 
    "Buyer beware, these chairs were literally impossible to assemble because the wood screws were too short. The chairs are beautiful, but too good to be true. I would NOT recommend buying these chairs.", 
    "Paint Workmanship was of poor quality and for the price of them the paint on the front of the chairs should cover the wood. I wouldn't use this service again because I think the products you carry are inferior.", 
    "We had broken two of our chairs during a move and needed replacements. Also, we needed four instead or two chairs. These sets appeared to fill the bill and the price and delivery cost were well within our budget. When they arrived on time, there was no damage. The parts were all there and the instructions were adequate. The assembly went without difficulty and we are happy with our purchase.", 
    "Sturdy, real wood chairs for under $*** per chair delivered to your doorstep. They are as efficiently packed as something from ***! Very good quality construction and easy to assemble. They have most of the hardware hidden on the underside or inside so that the chair looks like it was put together by a old world wood craftsman. I would highly recommend this set of chairs.", 
    "I bought these because the ratings on here for the most part where decent. But I should have listened to the bad reviews!!! These chairs are cute, and they match my table perfect...BUT when I got the box, they are completely YOU HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER!! Which would have been fine a few years ago..But I am now handicap and have no one to do this stuff.. one chair had damage to the back of the chair and on the second one I could not put the seat on because you need a drill to drill thru the hole to make it bigger! My drill is in another state! I called customer service, the first guy took care of me, I called back after I found the holes needed to be drilled...let's just say CUSTOMER SERVICE IN OVERSTOCK.COM SUCKS! I SAY SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME, LOOK LOCAL FOR YOUR CHAIRS, THESE ARE WAY TO MUCH WORK...IF THEY COME UNDAMAGED!!", 
    "Other than a few minor defects in the frame which required wood glue the chairs are fine, easy to assemble and just what I was needing.", 
    "These chair were exactly what I was looking for and look great in my kitchen", 
    "Ordered 2 sets of 2 chairs each. After delivered and in process of assembly discovered one set of chair backs were damaged (splintered and broken). Attempted to call for replacement (no tel # on site) and had to chat with a represenative online. They shipped a new set of chairs immediatley, but all in all I would have paid a little more (overstock had lowest price w/ free shipping) for the chairs (available at muliple stores) if I wouldn't have had to deal with the returns headaches.", 
    "I purchased two of these for our beach house to be used as side chairs for our alcove off the master BR & for extra seating in our dining room. Which means, minimal use. Besides the directions being horrible & miss marked, the actual seat is NOT connected & just sits on top. In addition, the 1st time we used them at a family gathering/dinner for Thanksgiving.....the back portion split & separated from the seat area. My father is not a wild man & at 230#'s, this seat should have held up through a dinner. DO NOT BUY!", 
    "We have tried to order these chairs twice and both times the chair backs were delivered broken and splintered. The second delivery the box wasn't even taped shut. Both me and my husband believe that these chairs would have been in perfect condition had there been even some packaging however there was no padding/packing material/air bags in the box to prevent the chairs from moving around and becoming damaged. Overstock did a wonderful job on the return of each order but we were really counting on having these chairs for Thanksgiving dinner and were very disappointed that they came in damaged twice hence the 3 star rating.", 
    "I purchased two chairs to act as side chairs in our living room. The color and size were perfect but unfortunately the packaging of the chairs was a bit subpar and one of the chairs had a crack in the scroll-work on the back. I glued and clamped the area and it looks like it is holding but the crack is still visible. I'm not sure how I'll be able to touch up that area. The other problem I encountered was in fixing the cherry toned seats to the chair frames. The frames were square and plumb but the seats weren't flat. As a result, they don't sit flat on the chair frame and it was very difficult to install the wood screws and hold the seat to the chair without visible gaps between the chair and frame. These could be really nice chairs with a little bit more quality control and better packaging.", 
    "These chairs are a cute style and I love how they look in my kitchen, BUT.......we went back and forth with 4 or 5 (I've lost count!) different shipments to try to get a match on color, and EVERY box was severely damaged, which meant the chairs were also damaged. And the last two orders were Antique White instead of the Buttercream I had originally ordered. I will say that Overstock did try to rectify this situation and was right on top of it trying to help me out. Great customer service, just not great chairs........", 
    "I purchased four chairs and I think they are very nice, however two of the chairs had cracks in them and the bottom of one of the seats was damaged.", 
    "Easy to put together. Highly recommend", 
    "Great chair. Perfect for what I wanted for a small eat in area.", 
    "The Mackenzie chairs are beautiful. The back of the chair makes them even more beautiful. The reason for four stars is that when you sit in them you lean back a bit, not straight up. The chairs were easy to put together and are very solid. They go well with the Furniture of America Betsy Joan Due-Tone Dining Table.", 
    "Beautiful items. Very pleased with the workmanship!", 
    "My chairs were easy to put together and they look great", 
    "Love this set. Looks great and is comfortable", 
    "Creamy color with the farmhouse look we wanted. Easy to assemble. Sturdy and well made.", 
    "Easy to put together and looks great. Very well made", 
    "Chairs are very sturdy and cute. They go with any decorating style.", 
    "Prompt delivery. Quick, easy assembly. Perfect update for my antique table.", 
    "I searched long and hard for 6 side chairs. Most places were very expensive or if they were inexpensive they just looked cheap. These chairs are solid, well built, and very easy to assemble (a power screwdriver makes it go faster!). They look great with a solid oak kitchen table we purchased elsewhere. They came within a week of ordered and were well packaged. They can with plastic things on the bottom of each leg, but I just took those off and was able to place felt pads so they won't scratch the floor. I would highly recommend these chairs and recommend overstock.com", 
    "Paired them with a dark wood dining room table, and they are just what I needed to brighten up our dining room. One of the chair backs was defective (anchored holes were drilled in wrong place), but Overstock was able to send just a new chair back and we didn't have to worry about returning anything.", 
    "The chairs are very nice and match our table beautifully.", 
    "These are very sturdy quality chairs, assembly went smoothly.", 
    "I absolutely love these chairs they as such a nice touch to my kitchen table", 
    "Looks great, just gets marked up easily", 
    "Substantial chairs-look great and have held up well so far.", 
    "I didn't know what to expect as this was my first time buying furniture online. They arrived on time and they were very simple to put together. Only took about 5 minutes a pc after reading the directions. They are a little larger than I thought they would be but they match my table perfectly.", 
    "these where purchased to match existing chairs to add to 6 other chairs so there would be 8 total.", 
    "Beautiful chairs, one came scratched, they replaced the seat by shipping a new set and said take out the parts needed. It was a little bit of a inconvenience but it worked out, and they gave me a $20 credit for the hassle.", 
    "Pretty, comfortable. A couple came with damage but were quickly replaced.", 
    "Bought these to go with my 5 piece Country Antique Dining Set, and i couldn't have made a better choice !!! Easy to assemble and they were delivered in just a few days and they look amazing ! Thanks Overstock !", 
    "I bought these over a year ago and am still impressed. I only purchased the set of two to go with the round table that matches. They are not only beautiful but have held up well and look way more expensive than what I paid for them. I've sat on them several times while working on the computer for hours and they are fairly comfy. I've also slid across the seats forgetting I had on jeans with the buttons on the back pockets and there were no marks left behind.", 
    "These are nice sturdy chairs. Wish the corresponding table wasn't so crazy expensive. They will work for now.", 
    "could be better with extra set of paint coat. Wide and comfortable", 
    "Ordered 2 for ends of dining table. They look great and have held up well.", 
    "This set is really beautiful for the money. One chair came with scratches on one leg and overstock replaced it immediately. Yo have to be careful with the top since it is kind of a synthetic wood it scratches very easily. Over all a beautiful set.", 
    "These chairs were a great value and very easy to put together. Delivered very quickly too, nice surprise!", 
    "They seem like nice chairs, just did not like the uniform distress marks located on each chair .", 
    "Great color and excellent quality", 
    "The table looks fantastic. It took some time to put together, but if you follow instructions, it is quite easy. Good project to do while my husband was watching football :-). Looks high quality for the price.", 
    "I was a little hesitant about buyin chairs online without physically seeing them but these chairs are much better quality than I expected. Love them!", 
    "I absolutely love these chairs. They look even better than the picture. Totally completed my look! I would recommend them to anyone.", 
    "Love these. Very sturdy!!", 
    "Received 2 more chairs yesterday and am afraid to open the box....the box is not the original TRIBECCA CHAIR BOX, and the box they arrived in is in bad shape and half opened at one end. Hoping the chair pieces are all there and in decent shape.", 
    "These are great chairs for our dinning room", 
    "Love these chairs! They go perfect with my kitchen table!", 
    "I love the look of these chairs, and they are sturdy once they're assembled. They are so easy to assemble that my 10-year-old daughter put one together with supervision! The one caveat is that the seat itself didn't have pre-drilled holes for the screws, so we had to pre-drill them ourselves. Not a problem for us, but if you don't have a drill or a multitool, it'll be difficult to put these together.", 
    "Love these chairs. They have a generous seat and were easy to put together for the most part. The seat was the most difficult to attach because there are no pilot holes to assist you in lining it up. The color is beautiful. I purchased 3 sets and probably could have got by with 2 sets since my table is small and the chairs were larger than the ones they replaced.", 
    "Love these chairs. They are sturdy and very comfortable", 
    "Just what I wanted. Good product nice price", 
    "bought 3 pairs to match with the dinning table. a good looking set. but very easy to get scratches. was hoping they could last for years...", 
    "Glad I bought this set! Very sturdy & heavy! Would purchase again! Great styling!", 
    "beautiful color (antique white), subtle distressing accents on paint, easy to put together. nice weight, but super sturdy, where I can easily move them to clean the floor. very happy. ordering two more.", 
    "These chairs are sturdy. Easy to put together.", 
    "Fast delivery, easy to assemble, really like the chair design, price was great!", 
    "Very nice chairs, just what I was looking for.", 
    "These have held up very well. I love the way they look with our farmhouse table!", 
    "very pleased. The chairs were easily put together, they're very sturdy, and exactly what I was looking for - color, size, and style.", 
    "the chairs are beautiful and durable the only problem is the bolts are not long enough so yu have to replace. Otherwise would have rated a five.", 
    "After finally getting the right chairs they arrived quickly. Easy to put together and they match perfectly with the table we purchased from Overstock!! Would recommend both the Chair as well as the table!", 
    "I bought these on sale and they are an amazing value. They are very well-made, sturdy, and they look fabulous in my breakfast nook. I bought four of these chairs, the matching rectangular table, and two green and white striped chairs for the end of the table. They were easy to put together and they arrived in good condition.", 
    "I have purchased chairs online before, so I was worried that there would be problems, especially since I purchased 3 sets of 2. (Bound to have problems with at least one, right?) But I was pleasantly surprised! Each chair was in great shape, the finish is beautiful, and it didn't take me long to put them together. You really can't beat the quality and the look of them for this price. Super happy with my purchase!", 
    "I purchased these for an extension of my island and they work perfectly. Very sturdy, fairly easy and quick to put together. Purchased them two and a half years ago and just now leaving a rating and I am still satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "Love the chairs I bought, cheapest around and high quality!!!", 
    "These chairs are better in person. Easy to assemble and a wonderful addition to my table.", 
    "Easy to put together, and look great!", 
    "Easy to assemble, pretty, heavy & sturdy. A true bargain. I bought a pair a few years ago & just bought another pair to add to the table. The first ones have held up so well, I can't tell the new from the old! A classic chair.", 
    "Very pleased with the quality of these chairs. They are very sturdy and beautifully made.", 
    "Excellent quality and look, the very best customer service", 
    "I don't feel the finishing is that well done, they could have sanded the wood a bit more to have a better class of product.Not to say it is not sturdy.", 
    "Really sturdy, heavy, comfortable. The \"distressed\" paint is slightly cheesy because the exact same sized smudges and rubs are on the exact same spots on each chair, but over all a good buy. One chair had extra glue and stain on the back and one seat was scratched, but Overstock is working with me on that.", 
    "Love this country look. OS you didn't disappoint Happy Customer :)", 
    "I had some problems with assembly including using the long screw to attach the box frame, and I went through the back of the chair. I also had trouble as one of the chairs could not be assembled, but Overstock handled my problems professionally and to my satisfaction. Great set for a small space.", 
    "Theses are beautiful and great quality but I had difficulty with the final step of putting them together. I elicited help from a friend who had the same problem. The screws won't go straight through the pre-drilled holes to attach the seat. So, currently none of mine are attached \ud83d\ude33. At least they look nice!", 
    "These chairs are beautiful and well made. They were perfect for our beach house! They are very heavy and feel they will last for years!", 
    "Gorgeous table & chairs. VERY STURDY.", 
    "Bought these to go with a table that was given to me. The table is two different tones of wood and these look great with it!", 
    "The chairs are heavy solid wood well made. My only complaint is that the screws that attach the seat to the chair are not long enough. I had to go to the hardware store to get a longer type to attach them. Easy to put together though.", 
    "Bought a large antique white table from another store and needed dining chairs to match. These were perfect.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Sturdy chairs with very nice finish. Very pleased.", 
    "These are great chairs. I order 6 to use with an antique rectangular table about the color of the seat. Looks wonderful.", 
    "These are very solid, hardwood chairs. Very pleased with heaviness and construction. Very easy to assemble. Know these will last a very very long time.", 
    "Love the chairs! Easy to assemble and very sturdy! Highly recommend!", 
    "I purchased these after ordering the counter height stools and loving them. These were at my house 2 days later and a breeze to put together myself. The worst part is securing the seat to the base. It can be tricky but I managed to complete the process in less than 30 minutes. We have been getting lots of compliments on the chairs and will be back to order 4 more. Again, I wish they had pads for the feet on all four legs, not just the back two. Besides that I think these make a great addition to the farmhouse look.", 
    "After much searching, I found these dining chairs to go with two other cloths chairs.....very happy with the color, quality, and easy to put together.", 
    "Chairs are solid hardwood. While I was surprised to see that the chairs had to be assembled- not a pleasant surprise-it was not difficult and took little time to complete. My four chairs sit well, are comfortable in the seat and the back and feel solid. These were purchased for my 2nd dwelling, they will remain with me wherever I am! They have a timeless look and quality build. I am very pleased.", 
    "I'll be honest, my husband assembled these while I was gone so all I know is he didn't complain:) However, I love the chairs and table. The chairs are comfortable and very sturdy! Beautiful design. You won't be sorry!", 
    "Easy to put together. Need a drill.", 
    "I never bought furniture online before. We bought 8 chairs (4 sets of 2). My husband put them together in a couple of hours. They are sturdy and beautiful!!!", 
    "Wonderful product that exceeded our expectations. Thank you for having quality in your product representation.", 
    "Chairs are sturdy comfy and beautiful.", 
    "Love this. I wanted an inexpensive but sturdy set for my dine-in kitchen. This does not disappoint. I was able to put together both table and chairs by myself (although I recommend you get help with the table top--it is heavy). My only complaint is that the screw holes on one chair were not the right size so a trip to the hardware store is in order. Looks good. Exactly what I wanted.", 
    "We ordered this for our eating area with 6 chairs and absolutely love it! The distressed legs are an off white which is perfect for our room and the table top is a warm brown. The extra leaf is on gimbels right underneath the table top so you just pull the table apart and pivot the folded leaf right into place. Very ingenious design! I don't have to find a place to store the leaf and it couldn't be easier to change the size of the table. It's a great table for 4 as it is and perfect for 6 with the leaf. Love it!", 
    "Great chairs. Look just like the pictures. Very sturdy. One word of warning, when screwing on the seats, be careful if using an electric screwdriver...the points can come up through the wood!", 
    "We purchased 6 of these chairs already! We love the generous seat and sturdy construction. The classic Pottery Barn cushions fit on the seats. If only we didn't have to assemble them, they would be perfect! But assembly wasn't that difficult!", 
    "I searched every site that I could think of for this sale of table and chairs, and several sites had this same brand, but this was the best price. I got the table and 4 chairs, then a set of 2 extra chairs for when the table is extended. All work great together and were very easy and quick to assemble. It took my husband and I about 10 minutes per chair, including the unpacking. A out 20 min for the table because we wanted to take out the staples on the underside.", 
    "These matched the Tribecca table I purchased from an individual. They seem to be sturdy and look very nice in my dining room.", 
    "The chairs came in great shape, still holding up to 3 kids and they are on them OFTEN! The set up was easy, too. I think I ended up putting the seat square on upside down at first, so just be careful of that.", 
    "A beautiful, sturdy chair. I would definitely buy again.", 
    "Love, love, love these chairs. They are sturdy, comfortable and go with all my country decor.", 
    "I love these chairs! One of the chairs did not come predrilled for the legs to attach. Overstock game me a discount because of the chairs not being properly drilled. My husband drilled the holes and they work great.", 
    "Beautiful chairs Glad I purchased them Great detail", 
    "I recently ordered 4 of the Mackenzie Country antique white side chairs. They were shipped in the expected time. One chair seat frame was broken in the shipping but I was able to fix it. The chairs are very nice and sturdy. They are the color and quality as advertised. They are a great addition to my kitchen.", 
    "They are comfortable and look great. Easy to put together. I did it by myself.", 
    "These were the perfect addition to my home. Very nice.", 
    "I bought two extra chairs to use elsewhere but can be added to the 7-piece dining set when I need to seat eight. Love these chairs ! They are comfortable and very sturdy and easy to assemble.", 
    "The chairs are sturdy, perfect color, just perfect for what I had in mind. The picture shown is exactly the way they are.", 
    "some work to assemble, but very nice and comfortable", 
    "These chairs are beautiful! I ordered four. They are very well made, very sturdy, didn't take too long to put together (tools are included), and the color is just what I wanted. I think a cushion is a good idea, but not absolutely necessary. They are stunning, and would be lovely in black as well.", 
    "These chairs are so pretty and of good quality. You must assemble them which was not very hard. Do yourself a favor and take out the insurance if it covers them longer than 2 years. Regularly check and tighten your nuts and bolts. You will not be disappointed. Delivery was so FAST! Overstock is a wonderful company with work with.", 
    "Only regret is not buying the table, too. Now we woukd like it because the chairs are so mice, but table is currently out of stock as separate item....but available as a set.", 
    "See my review on table - LOVE this set! Classic, beautiful, easy to maintain. Chairs are gorgeous and perfect blend of sturdy quality but not too heavy to move around for vacuuming. Easy to clean and hold up to busy family with messy dinners and craft projects! A little Murphy's Oil Soap keeps this set sparkling and in like-new condition. Absolutely thrilled and pleasantly surprised. My first major furniture purchase online and couldn't be happier.", 
    "I love these chairs. I took a leg to the store with me and had paint matched to them for my table. They were very easy to put together, we did 6 of them in a couple of hours. Would definitely buy them again. I couldn't find anything else priced as well as these, either.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful and well made! The wood is a tad darker than it appears in the picture though.", 
    "Easy instructions and nice high quality wood.", 
    "Lovely, heavy duty. Exactly what I hoped for. Did not disappoint.", 
    "We ordered these chairs and they arrived in 3 or 4 days. They are unassembled but fairly easy to put together. They look very nice and are very comfortable for the kitchen. We bought them to go with the Hampshire 72\" white washed dining table and they look perfect together.", 
    "You cannot beat these chairs for the price. The description is accurate. Very sturdy when you put them together correctly. I put them together by myself. The only issues I had were: 1) bought 4 - one box of 2 came damaged. But overstocked promptly sent me another shipment. 2) the seat bottoms were a little difficult to put on. I solved this by buying slightly longer screws. Cost me less than $2 - no big deal. Very satisfied customer. Similar chairs I saw cost 2x as much.", 
    "Very sturdy! Look GREAT!", 
    "Was a little unsure what to expect given the very low price paid for these chairs. Order four pairs and they arrived in a little over a week even with major storms causing shipping delays. They were packed well. Instructions were very simply and the chairs assembled with little effort. Using the provided allen wrench I assembled all 8 chairs in less than a half hour including removing from packaging. Chairs look elegant and seem pretty sturdy. Other reviews noted the distressing is exact on every chair which is evident. Not a deal breaker for me even with 8 chairs. Would have have paid more for these chairs now knowing the quality of them.", 
    "I have an old oak pedestal dining table that still looked good and I didn't want to part with but the chairs were about to collapse. I had been looking for a very long time for chairs only and was about to give up when I found these chairs. They are just perfect, they make the table look great. I have had many good comments about them. They really brighten my dining area, they are beautiful, comfortable and I love them. Not bad to put together either.", 
    "I love the chairs. They very well made; no unfinished edges, splinters, etc. Color very accurate. I would have given this item 5 stars, but one of my boxes came without any hardware. Very inconvenient.", 
    "I ordered 8 chairs, was very pleased with the quality and appearance, great chairs for the money.", 
    "I love my chairs. I purchased 4 chairs and my son gave me 2 more for Christmas. I am a 71 year old grandmother. I put the chairs together myself. It took about 20 minutes a chair. Very easy. They are real sturdy and beautiful. Good buy.", 
    "These chairs are perfect in my dining room. I paired them with an antique Mahogany table, and they look fantastic! They are the perfect style for a cottage look. Very comfortable...great value!", 
    "Love the look of the chairs! They are sturdy and blend well with any decor. I like the cottage style so they were perfect fit for my dining room. Fast shipment without any issues. Love, love these chairs.", 
    "The chairs were on sale for a great price and they arrived a day or two earlier then expected. My husband assembled them in an hour or so (no problems there) I was worried they would not look as good as they do online however they do look just as good if not better! The pictures give an accurate description of what to expect. We are very happy with our purchase!!", 
    "Had looked for months for this style of chair. These are exactly what I was looking for at a great price. Was worried about how they would arrive and they came in excellent condition. Read many other reviews almost all good. One had said they were hard to put together, not true at al. Very easy about 15 minutes per chair. Color was true to description also.", 
    "Received 4 Chairs , 2 in a set, came on time, Instructions were correct, assembly was easy, be sure and use all washers on bolts because you will split wood if you don't, the bolt will be to long, I also used glue on all joints just to make it stronger but not required I am just that way, lol, The color was correct and was a good match for me, I am happy with the chairs was worth the sale price.", 
    "Love these chairs, very sturdy and solid!!! Just what I was looking for!!", 
    "Easy to assemble and look great. Just what we needed and great price.", 
    "These chairs are great, easy to put together and so inexpensive in relation to similar chairs. Easy to put together too!", 
    "Love these chairs! My husband was able to put them together very quickly and was impressed with their quality, especially considering the price (he's an engineer and cabinet maker so I give a lot of weight to his opinion). They're sturdy and full sized without being overly heavy or cumbersome - making them easy for our kids to handle. And, of course, they're very attractive. Way to go Overstock!", 
    "These chairs turned out great. Quite a bit of assembly and a few washers were missing, so that made things a little difficult! These seem like great quality and I'm excited to have a reasonably priced set of chairs!FYI - the distressed marks are all on the same pieces, so when you have them together it's a little noticeable that they all look the same.", 
    "Very nice chair for the money, I didn't want to spend a lot on them and they look nice. Sturdy chair.", 
    "I bought 6 chairs with the goal to update the overall feel of my dining room. I currently have my parents\u0092 hand-me-down, Queen Anne, cheery wood dining room furniture. These white chairs really broke up the \u0093brown\u0094 and helped disguise the dated Queen Anne furniture. The only negative is that the chair frames are not made out of real wood. I guess I expected that given the price point, but luckily they still look good!", 
    "This is a fabulous farm style set, the quality is awesome. Easy to put together and so charming!", 
    "We paired these chairs with Rubberwood 40in around drop leave table and it was a perfect pairing to achieve that vintage country feel. Unfortunately my husband didn't like the look so we had to return these chairs =(. Otherwise, they are sturdy and quite comfy. My husband assembled these chairs himself and they were great!", 
    "The quality was good and they were easy to assemble", 
    "I loved the look of the chairs in the picture, but was worried about the quality. I am very happy with the chairs as they look even nicer in person, and they are of good quality. They are very sturdy and comfortable chairs.", 
    "Beautifully chair very happy with the colour and good solid chair.", 
    "Got my chairs in a timely manner and they were easy to put together. They look beautiful with my table. Good quality and the color is an antique white.", 
    "These are really great chairs, I bought 6 of them They were easy to put together. Well made and solid", 
    "Beautiful style but...unless you are sitting for a short while, I would recommend getting some pads for the chairs. They will feel hard after about 20 minutes.", 
    "Perfect amount of distressed wood to make these chairs stylish and practical. Bought the chairs for a beach home. Just what we needed to update the dining room.", 
    "love my new chairs - they appear as in picture - are a beautiful addition to my dining room table", 
    "I love the chairs. They were much better then I thought for the price. I am very happy that I bought them.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Sturdy chairs. Perfect color - exactly what I wanted", 
    "The chairs seem to be very well-made. My husband put together all 6 chairs in a very short time. We saw these same chairs at an area unfinished wood furniture store for almost twice the price! We are happy with our purchase.", 
    "I was as a bit worried about buying these chairs without seeing them in person. But there is no need to be leery. They are made of solid wood that is nicely finished and they are heavy and sturdy. I was drawn to their unique style of the back not one that you will find in every furniture store or catalog. They go perfectly with our custom reclaimed barn wood dining table and the color is just as pictured, not too white and not too buttery. Putting the first one together was a challenge as the directions are not very clear, but once we got the hang of it the other three went quickly. I put a chair cushion on them and they are stunning! You'd never know they were so cheap!Hats off to Overstock for their attentive customer service! They were able to apply a coupon after I placed my order and they were on the ball with regards to my shipment with UPS. I will definitely be purchasing from Overstock again and might even buy another set of these chairs!", 
    "I'm seldom surprised by my purchases from O.co, but this time I really was amazed at the quality and beauty of these chairs. Can Not beat the price. Love them.", 
    "Nice chairs- off white color/ slight distress finish -chair seat is dark brownVery nice looking , assembly required, shipping prompt/ no complaints/ happy with purchase", 
    "Only issue with the chairs is the screws to secure the wooden chair seat are difficult and hard to screw in place. Due to depth of the screw hole using an electric screwdriver is not feasible. I ended up using Gorilla glue to secure the chair seats.", 
    "I love them. They are sturdy. The dark wood seat really sets off the antique white. The picture of them is exactly what you get., They are truly country style.", 
    "putting the chairs together was easy with the simple instructions and all the hardware was availablevery comfortable and strong quality makes this a great chair", 
    "These chairs are good quality chairs. The seat is very large and deep. The chair backs are a little reclined. Overall they over comfortable. The chairs don't have stretchers which I do miss.", 
    "I ordered two chairs and they arrived quickly. They weren't exactly what I wanted but I looked at a 1000 chairs and these were the closest I could get to matching my other two chairs. The pictures and description matched exactly with what I ordered and received. They were easy to put together, are sturdy and comfortable.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Beautiful quality, colors, stains, etc. Love the wide seats, as well.", 
    "These chairs are solid wood and very sturdy. They are also wide enough for larger people. For added comfort, I put down chair pads. The chairs look cherry in the picture, but they are actually a little lighter than shown. I had a few problems when I received them such as cracked parts and missing pieces, but Overstock shipped them out right away!", 
    "I have owned these for a year now, and they have held up wonderfully! I would definitely recommend purchasing these!", 
    "Purchased two sets of chairs. Had read the reviews prior to assembly so I made sure I had a power tool handy. Could not imagine doing without one. The seats do not come with pre-drilled holes. However, it's easy enough to do. Easy instructions, had all chairs assembled in an hours time. I just had one issue with the last two chairs. Make sure the screw is placed correctly when screwing in the seat. The seat wasn't securely placed and was lifting had to try a couple more times until the seat was fastened correctly. The chairs look great. What a great deal!!", 
    "Chairs came very well packaged. Boxes contain 2 chairs and are pretty heavy. Overall considering the price these chairs are a great value. They seem sturdy and have a nice wide seat. I got six chairs and had issues with a couple of them being a little uneven, but a rubber pad under the feet solved the problem. I would say the color is definitely more of a cream than depicted. Nice amount of distressing, not over done or fake looking.", 
    "Love them! These chairs are a perfect compliment to the chevron upholstered chairs I bought on Overstock.com. I'm obsessed.", 
    "Very solid chairs. Not sure what the other reviews with regards to the assembly; it could not have been easier. Have you ever built a chair? This is as easy as it gets. Make sure to get the primary frame the right way up the first time, otherwise you'll have to start over and then you're going to stub your toe on a dresser and say a profanity and no one wants to hear that. I digress though. Great chairs. Looks good. Solid construction. Decent value. Ended up buying four actually.", 
    "These chairs look awesome and are super comfortable. One arrived damaged but as always customer service at overstock is super helpful and always quick to respond! No complaints!", 
    "Love the chairs!!! So easy to put together, i did it myself. Order 2 more chairs just like the others ones>..", 
    "LOVE my new chairs - GREAT quality and easy to assemble. Very sturdy and a great price. I would do it again. They lightened up my dining room but still go well with my antique china cabinet and accent pieces. Just what I was looking for.", 
    "These chairs are great! They're solid wood and kind of heavy, but they're also very sturdy. The color is as described: white with hints of gray for the \"antique\" look. The cherry wood seat isn't too red, which is what I wanted. Overall, very happy with the chairs!", 
    "These chairs are a great value. The colors and style are perfect. I was able to easily assemble the base of the chair but could not attach the seat. I asked my husband to finish the assembly and he cursed the whole time. Although the holes appear to line up, the screws would not go through. It took him 2 hours to finish 3 and he still has one more to do.", 
    "WHAT A TERRIFIC BUY. THESE CHAIRS ARE BEAUTIFUL, SOLID WOOD, STURDY AND HAVE MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN MY DINING AREA. CAN NOT BELIEVE THE PRICE FOR THESE CHAIRS. I WAS ABOUT TO BUY CHAIRS ON SALE FOR $XXX.XX A PIECE AND THEY WEREN'T NEARLY AS STURDY OR SUBSTANTIAL AS THESE.", 
    "This chair is a true find. The price is outstanding. They are very sturdy once put together. We searched for chairs for our dinette, and everything that we found was very poor quality (unless we spent $XXX a chair). All of our friends and family have asked us where we purchased them and are shocked to hear how low the price is. With a family of 6 and 4 boys they are holding up very well to all the heavy abuse. They do not scratch easily and the color is true to the photograph. Great find!", 
    "I ordered 4 chairs to be used at a smaller rectangular table in my kitchen. They work beautifully! The chairs seem to be very sturdy. The color is exactly as described. The chairs themselves are very comfortable. We did have a problem with one leg for one of the chairs but after contacting customer service, we received a replacement leg within days. I would definitely recommend these chairs if you like a country or French country decorating style. Very happy with my purchase and very happy with my buying experience at Overstock.com!", 
    "Overall these chairs are great. Heavy, sturdy, and nice looking. As far as the color goes, they are not that buttercream I was expecting, which im happy about. We have a lot of white in our kitchen and they match fairly close, just slightly off white. The only issue I have, is that the antique or distress look they tried to give the chairs, while it works in some places on the chair, basically it left a very uniform streak of purposely \"smudged paint\" on the top front and back of each chair. It kind of bugs me since its in the same spot on each chair. It more so looks like I was careless taking the chairs out of the box or something. I will be looking into color matching paint to seperate it a little, but for the price, quality, and style they are worth it.", 
    "My chairs came with some scratches (it happens) I called Customer Service right away. I was given a XXXX XXXXX store credit, rather than return the chairs. I purchased 4 of these chairs and am planning on the purchase of 2 more. They have brightened up my kitchen and I love them. I would wholeheartedly recommend to any one, including but not limited to my best friend.", 
    "Just what I was looking for at the right price. Easy assembly.", 
    "Ordered chairs to coordinate with a custom table. They are a great deal and we received many compliments. Highly recommend!", 
    "These chairs are beautiful and very sturdy. They were easily put together with no problems. I liked them so much I purchased 2 more.", 
    "These chairs are exactly what I was looking for! Had been looking around for a while at stores and online. Could not afford similar ones in the furniture store, was skeptical about ordering online, but HAVE NO REGRETS! They came quickly. They are exactly as shown. My husband put them together (4 of them) in less than 1 hour with no issues. They are sturdy and balanced. The seats are wide enough for a bigger person and very comfortable. I cannot speak to longevity but so far I am VERY impressed and cannot believe the price I got them for! I used the XX% coupon when they were on sale so they were a major deal!!!", 
    "love love love these chairs for my breakfast room. I married these chairs to a beautiful darker retangle table got from a local high end store. I only use 4 of these chairs & buy another 2 with slip cover as host chairs. I try to create a French country look & the out come is AWESOME with some accessories!!!!!. These chairs quality is so great, very study & so easy to put together. I got all 4 chairs done by myself in less than 30 mins & I'm a girly girl type. I do change out my furniture pretty often but I think I will use these until whenever they last b/s I so love the look & the quality. Shipping was super fast & Overstock does provide great customer service. I highly recommend these chairs.", 
    "Beautiful shapely attractively designed chair; easy to put together. So pleased w/ the value & the real life appearance that I am ordering another 2 chairs. Excellent pricing value for the high quality of the chair", 
    "Very easy to put together. Took about 15 minutes a chairs. They are beautiful and look like they would have been purchased from a furniture store. I think they will hold up great , even when being used by my children. Great purchase and I have already received many compliments. Would recommend to anyone.", 
    "Very nice quality, however, we were short on screws. Fortunately, my husband had ones that fit. They look great in our country home.", 
    "We purchased 3 sets of these chairs and have had them for about a month. So far we really like them and they look great in our kitchen. We have hardwood floors so we did add some felt glides to the bottom. We are very please with our purchase.", 
    "These are so beautiful. One arrived with a very slight crack and they sent me a replacement part a week later. I love them, wouldn't hesitate to order this make again.", 
    "I bought these chairs to \"match\" a table I bought from xxxx x. They're not exactly the same color, but I love the style. They were pretty easy to put together until I was ready to attach the seat. I'm not sure if I misread the directions, but there weren't any holes in the seat, so I'm going to have to drill a hole myself and try not to ruin the seat. So far wee been sitting in them with the seat unattached. My 4-year-old actually fell our of the seat because she moves around a little too much.", 
    "After all of the chairs I have been looking at - both online and in stores, these turned out to the the very best price and quality to meet my needs! I was very happily surprised at the wonderful quality for the price.", 
    "The chairs are a solid and are exactly as pictured. I ordered only two because I wasn't sure they would match my dining table, but the wood on the seat is almost an exact match. I can also change it up and add seat cushions. I plan on ordering two more to complete my dining room set.", 
    "love the chairs, easy to put together and looks great with my table. what I do not love is the fact that a week after I purchased these chairs the price went down on them.", 
    "Chairs are great, sturdy and very stylish. It took about one and half hour for my husband to put things. I like some antic style color, it brights my breakfast area.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these chairs. They are very sturdy, heavy, seemingly well-made chairs. The colors are better in person. The cream color is very shabby chic. The seats are a rich wood that is darker in color than I expected. The assembly was easy, however time consuming as I purchased three sets for a total of six chairs. Overall, another great purchase from Overstock.", 
    "These chairs were an excellent value. Easy to assemble and quite sturdy once completed.", 
    "These chairs are fantastic! They look high end and construction is great.", 
    "I ordered these chairs to use with a cherry table that I bought locally but didn't like the chairs that came with it. I was holding my breath hoping they would match and be of good quality. I wasn't disappointed. The cherry on the chairs was just about a perfect match and they are heavy and seem like very good quality. My husband put them together when I wasn't home so I can't help you with that part.", 
    "i ordered this set of chairs for our florida home. as we expected, it came on time. we only had a week to work out the delivery. my husband had to assemble the chairs. they were well packed to quard against damaging the chairs in delivery. all the pieces were included with directions, and in no time, we were sitting on them and having lunch. for the money they are great chairs. the seat is a stained finish. the back and legs a cream color washed look. perfect. the description and picture were true to it's likeness. i would highly recommend them. i have ordered many things from overstock, and have never been disappointed. earning o dollars also helps in saving money. have even had on line chats for the smaller questions.always very helpful. patty513", 
    "These chairs were exactly as pictured. Sturdy and easy to assemble though I still made my husband do it. I'm going to order two more.", 
    "Great look. Got 6 Chairs and love them. Kitchen looks great. Chairs are sturdy Seats matched my table. White antique (cream) color a great counterpoint. Looks like the picture.", 
    "These chairs are a very good value do not hesitate to buy them. Put together by a friend who found it \"no problem\". After I bought these I decided to get a new table, (should have bought the complete set.) I think I bought the table named \"Madison\" & it matches well.Didn't think it would when getting it put together but it does.", 
    "The chairs arrived in excellent condition. It was very easy to put together. They compliment my d\u00e9cor . Customer service emails kept me informed re shipping and delivery date.", 
    "I read other reviews and appreciated reading that these were substantial chairs. They have a comfortable seat, fits a bigger person comfortably. The back has great support for ones back and the tabs on the bases of each leg make them slide and move easily without friction on my new kitchen floor. Easy to put together, using a drill for pilot holes to attach the seats is very helpful, very sturdy, expect years of use from them. They blend beautiful with my dark wood floor and treasured oak table in my new kitchen. Classy !", 
    "Very nice, solid WOOD chairs. Look way more expensive than tthey are. My family is all over 6 feet, and they aren't slight. Product easily assembled, and very well made. Great purchase!!", 
    "These are very nice chairs, just the right color, and a nice wide seat. The only drawback is there are no pre-drilled, or even marked holes for the seat to attach to the chair frame. It wasn't that easy getting the seat to line up and get a drill through the chair frame as normal drill bits are too short to go all the way through.", 
    "Very sturdy and large. Easy to put together. Awesome quality for price.", 
    "Nice, sturdy, comfortable chairs - had to tweak them a bit so they would not wobble", 
    "Nice quality, very sturdy and look great. Assembly was not consistent chair to chair but overall not too difficult.", 
    "I was shopping for new dining chairs. I found the best deal on Overstock.com. Other places wanted *** or more for each single chair. I found mine on Overstock.com for *** for two chairs. They are so beautiful! They are very heavy and sturdy. They will last me forever. Everyone who sees them falls in love with them!", 
    "I love my chairs and the price is better than anything I found shopping in local stores. Glad I took the plunge and bought!", 
    "By far one of the best if not the best purchase I made on Overstock or anywhere. I tried painting my own kitchen chairs white but they looked shabby (not shabby chic). These chairs came carefully packaged - I had to put them together - but had assistance from hubby who had cordless drill and level. When you put them together it is easier to maintain the level if you don't tighten the legs all the way - then set the chair on flat surface (we have tile floor), Use a level and make sure the legs are flush with the chair form ( prior to screwing down seat). We had one chair that wobbled because we were in a hurry and did not use a level. These chairs are solid and a nice large size seat. Looks lovely. Recommend as a best buy!", 
    "I was a little unsure of ordering furniture online without having seen it, tried it, etc. I knew I could return if needed, but thought it would be a huge hassle. I'm glad I bit the bullet and ordered the chairs (4 total) anyway. I LOVE these chairs. We refinished an old table of my grandparents (table is about 80 years old). The top was stained dark and the legs were painted cream (too tricky to strip & stain). These chairs were the PERFECT match. Easy to put together & very sturdy. I am so happy with my purchase and the price was unbeatable! I priced similar chairs at local furniture stores for well over $100 each.", 
    "I love these chairs - they compliment my farm table perfectly. Hubby put them together in relatively short time and with no difficulty. I'm very pleased. Love them!", 
    "I LOVE THESE CHAIRS. THE QUALITY IS OUTSTANDING. THEY ARE SO WELL MADE. THEY LOOK HIGH DOLLAR TOO AND I HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED SO MANY COMMENTS ON THE STYLE OF THEM. I AM SO GLAD I FOUND THEM. I PUT THEM WITH A SOLID HARD ROCK MAPLE TABLE I HAD AND ALTHOUGH THE SEATS ARE A LITTLE DARKER IN COLOR THEY STILL LOOK GREAT WITH THE TABLE. I ALSO FOUND THE SYDNEY IVORY CABINET FROM OVERSTOCK AND TALK ABOUT CLASSEY WITH THESE CHAIRS. THE COLOR AND STYLE COULD NOT MATCH MORE PERFECTLY. I DID NOT WANT A HUGE CHINA OR TOO LOW OF A SERVER BUT THIS PIECE WILL SHOWCASE A FEW BEAUTIFUL COLORS AGAINST THE BUTTERCREAM FINISH. I AM JUST SO PLEASED WITH THESE ITEMS. I SOLD FURNITURE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND SEE GOOD DESIGN IN FURNTURE. I WAS HESITANT ABOUT ORDERING THE THE SYDNEY CABINET BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALL REAL WOOD BUT I AM SO GLAD I DID BECAUSE I COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING MORE CLASSEY FOR THE PRICE. THESE CHAIRS AT 2 FOR THE PRICE OF OVERSTOCK AND NO TAXES AND SHIPPING IS A SUPURB DEAL.", 
    "Love!!! Exactly what I wanted. Looks great with my rustic dining table.", 
    "RECEIVED THE CHAIRS IN GREAT SHAPE. ASSEMBLY WAS EASY TO FIGURE OUT AND THE QUALITY OF THE CHAIRS WAS GREAT FOR THE PRICE. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH OVERSTOCK WAS OUTSTANDING AND WILL DO BUSINESS AGAIN WHEN THE NEED ARISES, THANKS AGAIN FOR OFFERING THE ITEMS THAT ARE NEEDED. harleybob46", 
    "I bought these to go around my dining room table. They have a nice wide, comfortable seat. They were easy to put together but TIP--make sure you put the seat frame on the right direction so the screw holes are facing DOWN. I wasn't paying attention on one of them so I had to take it all apart and start over. I also lost all of the screws that attach the seat to the frame somehow, but my solution was to use liquid nails to attach the seats to the frame which has worked quite well so far. Additionally, prior to attaching the dark wood seats, I spray painted the chairs to go with my color scheme, and kept the wood seats as-is, which resulted in a really nice \"custom\" chair. The only downside is that the chairs have a built in, little plastic feet sliders--so you cannot attach any other felt or other slides to the legs. The built-in sliders are a little too small and hard and still do mark up my wood floors, so you have to be careful from sliding them too much on wood Overall though, I would recommend--very sturdy, good looking, and good price.", 
    "This set is fantastic. It was easy to put together (after getting an electric drill) and it is so sturdy. We have had numerous compliments and even was able to fit 9 at for a fun thanksgiving family dinner", 
    "I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a beautiful table and chairs. At this price it is a great deal. It is beautiful in our dining room. We could not find anything close in our local furniture stores. We found a cheaper product for a lot more money. You will not regret this order. We received it very fast, and the delivery men where very nice and friendly.", 
    "I really liked the chairs, just match my existing table. Fairly easy to put together however the last chair, {I purhased 4} had a splinter in the seat bottom & the top back of the chair was split where the screw went in. I contacted the company for replacement parts ; however they were not availalbe so they offerd a partial refund and $** credit for Overstock. The chairs arrived promptly and overall I am still very happy with my purchase.", 
    "These are handsome, well made chairs. Ladder back and Napoleon chair backs are common, but I haven't seen this unusual wavy lattice back anywhere else which was what attracted me to the chairs. The seat is a rich, dark walnut.", 
    "I love these chairs, they work well with an existing pedestal white table. The hardware to assemble chairs is very high quality, my husband who really was against buying chairs that needed assembly was very impressed with how easy it was to do. Only drawback, 2 sets of chair legs had to have foot pads put on because some of the legs wobbled. However, we have ordered 2 more sets, we were that satisfied.", 
    "We love the chairs. They are very comfortable and made of very heavy pretty wood. The painted portion is done really well, and the dark seats are lovely. That contrast is very pleasing to the eye, and coordinates with our kitchen cabinets very nicely.", 
    "The chairs are a little closer to the ground than my previous chairs, but that just leaves room for chair pads if wanted. The color is not what I would call cherry/white, but they are sturdy and we will change the table top of the existing table and match without much difficulty. They arrived in a timely manner, but there was a little more assembly involved that expected after speaking with the representative, but we found we could handle. It was much easier after we put the first one together. Assembly just couldn't be complained about for the price.", 
    "Love these chairs! They were easy to put together and are very sturdy. They also match my custom farmhouse table (dark walnut top and ivory base) perfectly.", 
    "after putting these chairs together, we are very pleased with them...especially with the price. they look great with our table! we might even purchase another set. putting them together wasn't very difficult. it took maybe an hour to put both of them together. we used a cordless drill. we would definitely recommend them.", 
    "These chairs are absolutely perfect for my table. I purchased six of them, and for the price, you cannot go wrong. We did have one problem with shipment. One of the chairs arrived damaged. Overstock was excellent to deal with and they replaced the broken part. My husband found the chairs relatively simple to put together, and it didn't take him overly long considering we had six. Definitely recommend!!!", 
    "I would definitely order more of these chairs. They are of great quality. The chairs are nice heavy wood and very easy to assemble.", 
    "We got these chairs as extras to the full set we purchased and are extremely satisifed with them. These chairs are very comfortable to sit in and are great accents to a \"country elegant\" decor. In our family nearly all the men are over 6' tall and these chairs are very sturdy. They were easy to put togethter and all parts fit perfecly. We are VERY happy with our purchase.", 
    "I purchased eight of these chairs. One came damaged and Overstocked took care of it right away. I shopped the major furniture stores for these chairs and ended up paying half. Would highly recommend them.", 
    "I love these chairs. I ordered 2 sets and liked them so much i ordered a 3rd set. The 3rd set came in with a broken leg and damage to the other leg. I contacted Overstock and they immediately replaced the chairs. I am very pleased with the customer service I was given and the with the chairs themselves. They fit perfect with my casual coastal decor.", 
    "The chairs are very good quality. They are quite a bit bigger than I thought they would be and the backs tend to lean back a bit.", 
    "We are very happy with this product, it really set off our dinning room table. The chairs are very tuff with a old fashion look. Just what we were looking for, and beside, you can not beat free shipping. Thanks", 
    "I really like the chairs! There was one nick on the back of one chair from my set of four, but I sanded that down and it just blends in. They're exactly what I was looking for :)", 
    "bought these as another set of chairs for our Mackenzi Country Style dining set...good option, perfect match and compliment to the set", 
    "Comfortable chair to sit in and sturdy. Love the color and the look. Easy to put together. Had a problem with shipping, one of chair backs were broken, but Overstock people were so nice and replaced it quickly. Needs bubble wrap.", 
    "This set was exactly what I was looking for. I had seen a table & chairs similar to this set in a retail store. I was reluctant to spend that much money. After seeing this set on O, I purchased. I am pleased with the quality for the price. The top of the table is made of a softer wood, so it can scratch, but touches up with just a stain marker. The chair seats are wider than most chairs for the price. They accommodate larger -boned people comfortably. I would recommend this set to everyone!!!!", 
    "I'm a believer in Overstock.com now! I ordered these chairs (6 of them) to go with a dark cherry/mahogany farm table I bought, hoping the seat color would be close enough to the table for it to look like it went together. First of all, they are beautiful chairs, nice french-country look. Secondly, one of the sets of chairs arrived with the packaged damaged, with literally a trail of hardware (screws, washers, etc) in my driveway. I didn't have half of the hardware to put them together & one chair was cracked. Overstock.com immediately replied to my request, & sent out a new set- no charge. UPS was obviously at fault for this, & I never heard a word from THEM. Overstock.com's customer service has made me a repeat customer. I bought the matching counter-chairs as well!", 
    "Ordered these chairs to match a distressed dining room table I refinished. Was advertised in antique white and the color was just what I expected. Chairs were fairly easy to put together.", 
    "Perfect table for a family of 4 or 6. When the leaf is up, you can squeeze in 8 of the chairs, but it is very tight. We do not use the leaf on a daily basis and we have 4 chairs out for everyday use. I really want 6 out for everyday use, but 6 chairs and no leaf is a very, very tight fit.", 
    "Beautiful and comfortable chair. Problem with hardware being loose in one box and scratching chairs, but Overstock handled this quickly and replaced without any problems.", 
    "Bought a table off Craigslist and needed chairs to go with it. Didn't want to spend a lot and ruin my bargain. These chairs fit the bill perfectly.", 
    "great chairs, exactly what I was looking for and for a great price.", 
    "I bought 6 chairs to go with a table I already had. These chairs are definitely more antique white than a bright white, but that is what I needed. One of the chair backs was missing a set of holes in which the seat was to be screwed into. I contacted Overstock and they quickly shipped me a new chair back. I was really happy that I didn't have to send the entire set of 2 back to them for one defective part. Very happy with the product and customer service. Great looking chairs.", 
    "I was very hesistate to purchase on line as i wanted to look at the product first. However, after seeing many other chairs in person at local sales stores as they all try to sell you the product...I was very happy with our decision... The product order came with tracking information as it was easy to track, The item were delevered with only $2.95 shipping charge which is incredible! I would recommend your site.. thanks again!", 
    "I love them and they were exactly what I wanted and envisioned. They were easy to put together.", 
    "This is a great pair of chairs! We bought 6 and they match perfectly with our antique white table. Great quality, very durable. Easy to assemble. We have already gotten tons of compliments on these chairs. Excellent value. Cheapest chairs we have seen AND they are still quality chairs. NOT CHEAP WOOD.", 
    "Beautiful and what I was looking for. One cracked within 2weeks of getting them so that was frustrating. Otherwise great.", 
    "Bought these chairs to replace some existing chairs that had just broken down over time (had been part of a set from my grandmother). Needed them to match a new round table which was a distressed white and they look FANTASTIC as if they were part of a set! They are just the right height for the table. Comfortable to sit around in while dining and after linger over coffee. My husband put them together in no time. Tip.. make sure you use the right screws for the right area one screw is longer than others and my husband split the back panel by using the wrong screw (no real damage unless you are looking for it however). Would definaltely recommend!", 
    "I bought 4 of these chairs for the dining area. My dining room table was already a distressed creamy white and the chairs look like they came with it. They went together rather easily. The only complaint I have is the screws that attach the seat are a bit to short.", 
    "These chairs came in a week after ordering them. All pieces were accounted for and nothing was damaged. The chairs were fairly easy to assemble - the seats were the trickiest part since they did not pre-drill them for you and the screws are fairly short. So, you really have to turn the table upside down (I used a side table to do this) and screw the chair directly into the seat from underneath. After figuring this out - it was no problem. Love the chairs! They make the dining room feel casual yet beautiful.", 
    "I love the style of these chairs. They were quick to put together and look great. You can't beat the price.", 
    "Had just bought a new house, my first, and wanted new dining room furniture. Wanted to mix the chairs up (two different styles) so I bought four (4) of these chairs and two of another kind/style. Just wish that I had bought six or maybe even eight of these. Love the soft creamy color and they are so well made. As an older woman (?) if I can put these chairs together, anyone can. Took me a little over an hour to assemble 4 chairs. The chairs are heavy and I expect them to be around for a long time. I love looking at them. Thanks Overstock. You came through again! (Maybe I'll have to by some more of them after all).", 
    "I love these chairs. They go great with the dark table we just purchased and are actually in our formal dining. My husband didn't have too much trouble putting them together either. Excellent purchase.", 
    "We received the first order in less than a week. Only one chair had to be replaced and ordered 2 more. They all arrived in just a few days. We thought they were easy to assemble. We love the quality, comfort, and antique look. Customer service was very courteous and helpful also. We will order from Overstock in the future!", 
    "had some problems with damage due to shipping ( not any fault of Overstocks ). Called customer service and they contacted the warehouse for the parts and were very helpful in taking care of my issue. While waiting on the parts to come in the chair backs got damaged while sitting in the area of the house that was being remolded and they even helped me out in replacing those.. I could not be any happier with Overstock for all their assistance in taking care of my issues. Thank you . oh, and I love these chairs and plan to get more of them after we are finished with the dining room remodel!!", 
    "Chairs arrived promptly. I had ordered 10 chairs and three of them were broken in shipping. They were promptly replaced. Assembly took some time and effort but I LOVE the chairs and they looks really smart in my dining room.", 
    "I bought these chairs to match a sideboard in my dining room. They were very easy to assemble and they are very sturdy. I feel they are very attractive and have nice turned legs on the front. They arrived very quickly. I would recommend them to a friend.", 
    "Love these chairs! The color was exactly what I had expected and wanted, an off-white cream type color. I purchased four (2 sets) and all the pieces came unbroken and in good shape. The assembly was really not that bad, probably because I did not have to do it by myself (you have to screw in the seat to the legs and need a strong arm to do so). I was aware assembly was required, but only from other reviews I read before purchasing. I would recommend getting your own screwdriver; the piece that comes with the chairs is not very helpful (it's one of those l-shaped metal pieces you get from every type of furniture you get from Ikea). Not only did the chairs come in good condition but, shipping was also pretty quick. The price for the quality is WELL worth it. To be honest, I was hesitant to purchase anything I had to assemble myself and assumed the shipment would come in with broken pieces and the pieces would not be sturdy or in good quality. I was definitely wrong and am very happy with this purchase. I'm using these chairs for my dining room, and already had a lazy susan wood table for it to go with.", 
    "Good, solid chairs. Not so easy to put together - make sure you have plenty of time, wood glue, and a drill. Once together, the chairs are solid and very attractive. A great buy! They looks more expensive than they are.", 
    "This product was exactly as advertised. Great quality and great price. Shipped quickly and arrived on time.", 
    "These chairs are a lot more yellow than what you see on screen. I thought they were very easy to put together.", 
    "The chairs were perfect!! Well made and easy to put together. Received them quickly.", 
    "Although the paint is off white, these chairs look perfect in my white kitchen. Love the slight distressed finish. The quality and weight are more than I expected for this price. Very pleased!", 
    "I love these chairs. They look great and the seat is wide and comfortable. I did have to call and get one new seat frame because the original wasn't straight and the seat didn't sit right. Overstock took care of it immediately and the new frame arrived in a few days...perfect.", 
    "Love, Love, Love these chairs! I put 4 of them together quickly with manual tools and the easy-to-follow directions. My husband is a bigger man and fits nicely on the large seat area. They actually look better in person than on the website! Great addition to my french provincial dining area.", 
    "These chairs look great in my kitchen which also has off-white cabinets and a built in table. I was glad the color was a good match. My husband had no real problems putting them together which was also a plus. I ordered two more to complete the set.", 
    "Exceptionally pleased with this purchase. Had been looking online and locally for a pair of nice quality chairs to use at our desks in our home office. These are a nice chair at a great value. Love both the color and the style. They are pretty comfortable to sit in as well. Each chair went together in about 30 minutes but the seat of the chair is difficult to attach. Arrived well packaged and delivered promptly.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful!! They are NOT WHITE. I would describe them as more off white. These chairs go perfectly with a pottery barn table I already have - same off white shade. LOVE THESE CHAIRS!!", 
    "Love those chairs. I am thinking about ordering more to update existing dining room chairs. The antique white finish looks beautiful. The back of the chair is high and makes it very comfortable. Big plus: It doesn't take long to put them together. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "They are very nice, ordered 4, struggled to put together but liked them very much", 
    "The chairs are comfortable with support high up on my back, although I'm 5'2\". I added chair pads that aren't really needed, but I like the extra comfort. They're all stable without wobbles. They look like designer chairs. I bought these chairs to add to the Mackenzie Buttercream 7-piece table and chair set. They fit perfectly when we open the table with the butterfly extension to seat 8. I'm a discriminating shopper and rarely make big purchases on line, but my adult children all raved about the set and even kind of bragged about the great quality and price to their dinner friends who joined us for the first family gathering with the new set. I couldn't be more pleased with the quality, value, and polite delivery.", 
    "I love these chairs. They are not too light and the dark seats are great. The only problem was there were not any holes in the chair bottom in order to attach the seat to the chair. Not sure how the small screws will work.", 
    "These chairs match the table we purchased to a T. Would suggest that a close up of the antique finish be shown to clarify term \"antique\". Hard to determine from pictures shown.", 
    "This product was exactly what I was looking for. Shipping was quicker than expected because I ordered around the holidays thinking that there might be a delay. There was a very minor scratch on one of the seats, however it was in a place that nobody would see. The chairs are very sturdy, comfortable and VERY affordable. Color is an antique white, I would not consider the color a buttercream. I had been pricing chairs for about 4 months and decided this was the best deal. So glad I decided to order from Overstock!", 
    "Was VERY please with this product. The chairs are sturdy and weren't too hard to put together once you figure it out. Was pleased with the quality and price of this product.", 
    "I ordered these chairs after an exhaustive search for a couple of chairs to go with an old kitchen table that sits in a bay window. These are perfect and match the antiques look of my kitchen.", 
    "I ordered 6 of these chairs. Overall they are VERY sturdy and beautiful as well. BUT - Package #1: this package was damaged and the back of a chair was cracked in half. Package #2: One of the seats was gauged down to the bare wood Package #3: A leg on one of the chairs which was already pre-drilled incorrectly made the leg too short and that chair wobbled terribly. Luckily we were able to use various parts from the \"damaged\" box to end up with four solid chairs. Overstock customer service was wonderful in replacing the set very quickly. Now we have 6 beautiful chairs that I love!!! Beware of the color though. These chairs are a warm creamy off white with a distressed finish that makes them even darker in spots. In the photo they appear a crisp matt white and this is not true. To see the chairs more accurately view the same chairs sold as a set with the table. In the end I am happy.", 
    "Arrived quickly with no damage. Bought 10 chairs. Great value. Solid wood equivalent chairs $500 each. Husband assembled in one eve. Seem sturdy.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful and at a great price. I have been looking for chairs to match my round table; which has a white base and a walnut top. Even though these are not stark white; the antique white works just as well. My husband was able to assemble them in an hour. I love them!", 
    "I love the look of these chairs and the price is fantastic. We didn't have any damage during shipping. The construction is sturdy. Assembly of the white chair frame was a breeze, but screwing on the dark wood seat was more difficult as there are no pre-drilled holes. Still, we are not what I'd call handy and we managed :) I'm very happy with this purchase!", 
    "Great chairs and barstools! So glad I found them!", 
    "Chairs were delivered in 3 days... comes in one box of Two. I ordered 2 Sets.. Put together 4 chairs in 30 minutes.. They look awesome and just what I wanted and the price was definitley right!!! The are a distressed white look with sturdy legs the two front legs are apiraled in design and the wood seat itself is a dark walnut color.. LOVE< LOVE LOVE!!!", 
    "Our shipment came in perfect condition, but since I was ordering 2 chairs for son and daughter in law, and her mother was ordering 2 chairs--the other chairs were delivered in damaged box. Everything was falling out. She sent back and then there were no more in stock to replace them. I had to return mine and we ordered 4 different chairs.", 
    "Easy to assembly, feels great to sit on, and I am getting tons of compliments", 
    "Great chairs, they are good quality , solid wood and fit perfect in our kitchen. Easy to assemble and shipped pretty quickly.", 
    "The chairs matched my table perfectly and the design is very nice. A couple of the chairs had some minor dings and scratches, but Overstock was great on sending replacement parts. The color looks pretty much like the picture and the antique distressed look is spot on. The chairs are pretty sturdy - although you may want to get some felt for the bottom of the legs so they don't slide around as much and helps balance them. Overall - great price for a nice set of chairs.", 
    "The chairs came quickly and were easy to put together. I am very happy with the product.", 
    "We bought two sets of these chairs to match our breakfast dining table. They look quite nice. When we received the package, there were one broken part and one missing part. We contacted O customer service and they sent us the parts immediately.", 
    "I was very impressed with the chair quality and weight. For the price, you can't beat it!", 
    "I'm upset because the chairs are beautiful but the chair backs were damaged in the shipping process. Both chairs were dinged up and one of them had a chunk taken out of it. I'm in the middle of moving and am too stressed out to even send them back to wait for new ones. I ordered these to go with the 7 piece buttercream table and chair set. I haven't received the table yet and I'm really worried about it now.", 
    "I bought these chairs planing to use one with a white desk and the other with a cherry desk. I hoped that they would be close enough. Despite what some reviewers have said, these chairs are not white, they are a pale off white, but that's okay--it looks fine against the white test. The seats, however, are not a cherry tone at all--it's more of a dark walnut color. They are sturdy and pretty. It took a few minutes for my husband to put them together.", 
    "These chairs are everything I hoped they would be. They are beautiful, sturdy, and comfortable. It took me a little while (about 3 hours) to put them together. Probably because I don't have much experience and I only had the small hand tool that came with the chairs. I would definitely recommend them!", 
    "We have the chairs with a 90 year old family heirloom white with black trim porcelain top table. So we got two black and two white. Great value for these chairs. Do not hesitate.", 
    "We needed 2 chairs and they are exactly what we needed. We did get some seat pads for the wood bottom tho.", 
    "We ordered 3 sets of these chairs to go with a dining table that we purchased at the local flea market. They look beautiful and the wide seat base make them quite comfortable to sit on even without cushioning. Our only complaint is that we couldn't drive some of the screws into the seat base - seems like the screws should be just a little longer to make assembly easier. However, the lack of a having a few screws to attach the seat base to the frame doesn't appear to affect the structural integrity of the chair. Overall, we're very pleased and would recommend to friends.", 
    "Great chairs. We bought a table w/ 6 matching chairs so these two were extra. Arrived quickly in great condition. Would buy again, good quality, shipping was quick & no problems!", 
    "These chairs are wonderful. They were pretty easy to put together and are very sturdy. The quality of the wood is excellent. I'm very, very happy and would recommend to everyone who would like a country feel in their dining area.", 
    "My husband and I looked for chairs for our reproduction farm table endlessly. We spent hours visiting furniture stores, antique stores, etc. We also spent endless hours searching the internet for cottage furniture, antique furniture, chairs, etc., etc. Finally these chairs popped up on overstock and they were exactly what we were looking for. And the price was unbelievable. We never ordered from overstock.com before so took a chance. After assembling the first chair taking a bit of time, the other three were put together without any problem. The quality and sturdiness of the chairs is equal to, or better than, any we have seen in the high end furniture stores. The color is beautiful. And the price cannot be matched. We are thrilled.", 
    "This was a great buy. The chairs are very sturdy, several bolts hold each one together. Easy assembly. I put in the bolts, my husband screwed on the seats. The white is a distressed finish an the cherry seat actually does not have any red tones in it at all. One of the chair backs were cracked in transport, but Overstock sent a replacement within a week. We love them. We purchased 6. A really great deal compared to other chairs we've been looking at.", 
    "I purchased these chairs due to the high ratings and the colors. The box was drenched in oil which soaked into the contents of the box requiring clean up of the chairs prior to assembly. One of the \"spokes\" on the back rest was broken-my husband used wood glue and fixed it. The color is more off-white than appears in the picture.", 
    "Chairs were very sturdy, easy to set up, and looked great in our dining room. I'm a very heavy person, and these chairs support me no problem at all. Will definitely buy more of these when I need them.", 
    "These chairs, once my husband and I put them together, look just fantastic for our breakfast area! The picture on Overstock depicts them as much brighter white than they are... They are a very creamy, ivory white and absolutely gorgeous. Also, we painted and distressed a wood table to match the chairs, and the color \"Cappuccino White\" from Glidden matched perfectly! I would highly recommend these beautiful quality chairs to any bargain hunter looking for something rustic yet chic. I couldn't be happier!", 
    "I have a 25 year old oak table in excellent condition that I was planning on refinishing the top to antique white and thought these chairs would be an inexpensive option to replace the worn out original chairs and update the look. And thinking that for the price not to expect much for the quality. I bought a set of two, not taking the chance on 4 just in case I had to return if I didn't like them. What a great decision to buy these chairs. The are solid, substantial and extremely sturdy. I cannot believe the quality and was very pleased with this purchase. The cherry finish is very rich and looks great with the antique white. Once I moved into a new condo, I bought another set of 2. I had shopped at local furniture stores and no one had this quality or look for the money. You can't go wrong. Today I ordered the matching counter chairs for my kitchen to complete the look.", 
    "fairly easy to put together. be careful about the wood though. ordered 3 sets and had ot send 1 set back due to wood being chipped upon arrival. overall good chairs.", 
    "Love the whitewashing on these chairs. Good size and comfortable. One of the chairs arrived with a damaged piece, but overstock was quick to replace. They were easy to put together, feel sturdy and look great in my kitchen! Very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Love the chairs. Easy to put together. I used my husband's clamps to hold the seats in place before I screw them to the chair apron so I got a nice tight fit. As long as you take the time to line the legs up it went perfect.. Forget the instructions. And be sure to put the side of the apron with the holes down so you can screw the seat on. Love them!!!", 
    "These are great solid chairs at a great price! I love the antique white finish. We put them with a very dark espresso finish table.. The seats match great. The only problem I came across was the drawing on the directions was misleading, but after putting one together wrong I was able to correct the mistake for the next 3 and fix the other one easily.", 
    "We got six of these to match an older walnut table. Two were broken upon delivery (they weren't packed very well to be honest), but they were replaced without any problems. They were fairly easy to put together and look fabulous. We have an old dark walnut table and these chairs look great with it. They are comfortable to sit in even without a cushion. The white is somewhat distressed, which looks nice with an older table, but if you are looking for a clean modern white these are not for you.", 
    "I have two young children and these chair wipe clean even after food's been drying on them for hours. They are larger in scale than I imagined and it took me only 10 minutes to put one chair together. The chair has a yellow hule in it which I would've preferred pure white/linen white but it still looks great with my table. A great purchase at a hard to beat price!!!", 
    "These chairs (8) are perfect match for the beach house. They complete a cherry table that seats eight and will look beachy for renters.", 
    "I am a father of four kids with 3 of them under 6 years of age. My wife and I have been looking for not only chairs that match our decor but sturdy enough to handle the thrills and spills of children. These chairs deliver! They are beautiful, sturdy and easy to wipe off any spill or mess. I highly recommend them. We have a beach theme in our house and the stress look on the white sections fits in perfectly. They should last forever or at least until I am tired of them. Assembly was not that pleasant though! Just tedious.", 
    "I love these chairs. I've been away for two weeks after receiving them. Walked in and was thrilled by the \"look\". They're very comfortable and look like they'll last a long while.", 
    "I did not personally put the chairs together so I can only comment on the quality and look. These are such a nice quality chair for the money and look exactly like their picture. I would like to eventually order 2 more. Very happy with this product. This is the first time I have actually ordered furniture on Overstook and am very happy with my purchaes.", 
    "I wanted to replace 4 chairs in my sun room and had looked for 2 years at various stores and online. Many of the lower priced chairs were flimsy and we knew would not hold up with constant use. Sturdier chairs were very expensive for the location I wanted to use them in. These looked perfect for the room and the price was within my budget. I was extremely pleased when they arrived and saw that the quality exceeded my expectations! They are heavy, sturdy and exactly as shown and described. You won't be disappointed with the product - and - they arrived in record time! I definitely recommend the chairs and shopping with overstock.com!", 
    "I did a lot of research in order to find chairs that would match my table and be of the same level of quality. In over a year of searching I had no luck unless you include those with a very high price tag. That is until I discovered them one day on Overstock. I ordered them, they were easy to install, and are high quality with a great price tag. I have had them for some time now and they are still like new.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful and just what I expected. They look just like the picture and very easy to put together. I love them.", 
    "I bought these chairs to go with the Mackenzie 7-piece dining set (which I also love). The chairs are easy to assemble providing you can follow directions on the 1 page instruction sheet with pictures. They arrived quickly but when I assembled, I noticed that the seat of one of the chairs was scratched/damaged. I called customer service and explained and they shipped me a new chair seat that I received less than a week after my phone call. VERY PLEASED. I was so afraid I would have to disassemble the chair/chairs (chair seat is last step and not until then did I notice the damage) and return the whole thing. Overstock sent a confirmation email after I spoke with customer service and then shippe me just the chair seat. Love the style and quality of the set and was more than satisfied with overstock customer service. Thanks!", 
    "I needed two side chairs for a dining set that would \"go\" but not match. These chairs are sturdy and quite solid, and will be versatile enough to move to different rooms of the house as needed. They are also wide enough in the seat that they are comfortable for a long dinner and chatting afterward. One caveat though, they have to be assembled, and I deferred it to my mechanic husband. It took him a while, as he had to take a chair leg in to drill out the badly placed metal piece and fit a new one. If I weren't married to a mechanic, there's no telling which direction the chair would be leaning. The distressed finish is well done, and the color is a nice creamy white. Had the legs been ready to assemble, I would have rated these 5 stars.", 
    "We have been looking for chairs to match our table for awhile and these are perfect. In some pictures they appear white, but they are actually an off white/cream color. Assembly required, but it is straightforward. My only problem is, I only ordered two because I wanted to make sure they matched and now they are sold out!", 
    "Bought these chairs to go with a table I had already purchased at a consignment store. The chairs are heavy, sturdy and the detail of the backs are beautiful. The distressing/coloring is perfect. They ended up matching the table perfectly.", 
    "Love the table & Chairs...better quality than I had anticipated!! The first table came in damaged. However, Overstock was great about replacing the damaged product.", 
    "chairs are very sturdy and classy looking. got these as extra to go with mackenzie set. table will fit 8 chairs. Excellent price and quality great if you have kids cause already has that worn \"shabby chic\" look that wears well.", 
    "Chairs are very sturdy. Very nicely made. Seats are as someone else described, a bit darker than in description, but worked out ok for me. Very pleased with the product.", 
    "Love the chairs, received them in 7 days from ordering. Took less than 20 minutes to put together. Heavy and well maded. Waiting for the table to match with 6 more chairs. They are coming 14 days from ordering. Only due to freight delivery. Will put another review in for that tomorrow.", 
    "These chairs are sturdy and well made. They are so easy to put together, that a child could do it. Can't beat the price or the shipping.", 
    "These chairs are solid! They are beautiful and comfortable. Pretty easy to put together, instructions could be alittle more defined, but we got through them! Great shipping and a great Overstock product!", 
    "received chairs in perfect condition, easy to put together. can't beat the price. and they look beatiful with my kitchen table. I love overstock, it has great bargains. .", 
    "These chairs are great! Good looking, comfortable, easy to assemble and well worth the money.", 
    "I purchased these chairs bc they looked nice and the price was much better than what I had been seeing. They are not the sturdiest chairs I have ever seen, but they work. Make sure you look at the height of the chair bc it seems to sit low to me. Undecided if I would purchase again or not.", 
    "These chairs are great quality and so pretty! They were easy to put together and arrived fairly quickly. They look like I spent a lot of money on them, but thanks to Overstock.com... they were not expensive at all. GREAT chairs - GREAT price. You won't be dissapointed!",

    "I am absolutely THRILLED with these chairs. They are solid wood, easy to put together and look beautiful. I matched the color to an existing antique table that I have and it looks like they were made for each other. Kudos to overstock for prompt shipping!", 
    "It is a beautiful set. Can be used in your dining area or kitchen. Color's are perfect for any setting.", 
    "They got here quickly and look just like the picture. We purchased these chairs to go with a solid wood table and were concerned that the wood on the seat wouldn't match, but they look just like the picture (no red in the wood color). Assembly was easy, it took about 1 hour to assemble 8 chairs and put pads on the feet to protect the floor. They are comfortable and look great. Great Value.", 
    "These are substantial chairs and quite comfortable. I just ordered another set. I just wish they came in a lighter wood finish. If the seat was lighter I would have rated at 5 stars", 
    "These chairs are beautiful, very easy to assemble, extremely comfortable,and look exactly like picture. I was so happy to have found them because they are just what I've been looking for to match my oak table.", 
    "Great chairs! They are beautiful & well made. Easy to assemble. I bought 2 sets to go with an existing table & chair set & was concerned about mixing & matching but the photos were pretty accurate & I was extremely happy to see how well they matched. Each set came in 2 separate boxes; one box was practically torn open on delivery but nothing was damaged. Given their weight they should probably have been taped up a little better but it was a fantastic buy & delivery was fast!", 
    "look great We use them `a lot they fit our needs to a tee",
