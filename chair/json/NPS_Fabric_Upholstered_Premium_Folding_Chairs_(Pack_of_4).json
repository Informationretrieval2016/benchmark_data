    "You guys at Overstock rock! These chairs are just what I wanted and needed for additonal seating for Thanksgiving. I thought to my self, \"What if they don't get here in time?\" Well, I ordered on Wednesday afternoon and they were delivered on Thursday afternoon. I couldn't believe they got here so fast! Even the rental place couldn't have gotten them here that fast. They are sturdy, and the upholstery on the seats and backs will be so nice and comfortable for my holiday guests. I ordered 2 sets of 4, and I will probably order another set. We entertain a lot and they will be used for many years to come. Thanks Overstock!",

    "I host many large family gatherings at my home throughout the year, including Thanksgiving. Extra seating is always needed so I went on the search for additional folding chairs. After reading many reviews, I ordered two sets (8 total chairs) in Russet/Walnut Brown.DELIVERY / PACKAGINGThe chairs arrived a few days after ordering vis UPS. Since I ordered two sets, there were two boxes with 4 chairs in each box. Each box was quite heavy, but I managed to pull them into my house without any trouble. One box was a bit banged up; however, none of the chairs inside were harmed. Each chair was individually wrapped in plastic to protect them from scratching or sliding against each other. I opened and closed each chair as I unwrapped them and all were in working order. QUALITY / DURABILITYThese chairs are excellent quality! Compared to some other folding chairs that I've been using for many years (**** brand), these are a bit heavier and feel more well-built and substantial. They also are overall larger than the *** chairs. When folded, they are about 5\" taller. The seat area is also slightly larger. I texted a picture comparing the two chairs to my sister and she replied with, \"Look at the baby chair!\", referring to the ***chair. It is that much smaller. Both are considered standard chairs, but the NPS chair physically looks larger and more sturdy.Being a larger gal myself, I am very conscious of providing sturdy chairs for my guests no matter their size or shape. There is nothing more nerve-wracking than wondering if a flimsy folding chair will hold your weight. A big thank you to Overstock's customer service team for answering questions about products. As mentioned in the Q&A, these chairs are rated up to 480 lbs. And thank you to the previous customer for asking that question, too!COLOR / FABRICThe Russet/Walnut Brown color is true to the picture shown (at least on my computer monitor), and look great next to my Mahogany dining chairs from Pottery Barn. The fabric is tightly woven and seems durable. I was pleasantly surprised to see Scotchgard tags on the fabric indicating a coat of fabric protectant was applied. I didn't recall this feature being noted in the product description. In my experience, Scotchgard is water resistant and a very good way to keep fabric looking nice longer. I'm happy the chairs have this already applied.Overall, I am very impressed with these chairs. Highly recommended. In fact, I think I might order another set. :)",

    "Product arrived in a very timely manner. When I opened the box 3 chairs were in excellent shape but the fourth one had the metal bar across the bottom deformed. I'm not sure as to how to return the one chair...", 
    "got exactly what we needed. delivered and in use now. They look great and do the job perfectly.",

    "I needed extra chairs for a small get together and was very happy with this purchase. Since I didn't have a lot of storage room I was looking for folding chairs that could easily be stored, looked nice enough to blend with my living room furniture and were comfortable to sit on. These were the perfect purchase and I received them 2 days after purchase. I am very happy with this purchase.",

    "Ordered these chairs for Thanksgiving dinner. The chairs are quite comfortable and well made, not flimsy; however, they are not made for large size adults (I think they would feel \"little\" in the chairs). We used them for the teens and kids and they worked perfectly. The chairs fabric in the brown color is quite nice and blends nicely with the wooden table. I highly recommend these chairs if you need some extra seating from time to time. My daughter who attended the dinner noticed them right off and said \"Wow, Mom, these are nice chairs.\"",
