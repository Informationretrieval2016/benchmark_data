    "It's a very nice piece of furniture. Heavy, sturdy, very functional. Overall, I'm very satisfied. But the corners do look like the veneer might be easy to come off. It takes a while to install, too!", 
    "keeps the entryway clutter free and is the perfect size for a household of 3. had a few issues with putting the piece together but it looks just as advertised in the end.", 
    "A nice, handsome and generous piece. Looking at it one would never guess it is holding a vast amount of shoes. Living in a small apartment, exact dimensions are imperative, and this piece does not disappoint, fitting precisely in the nook I intended it for, while also providing a lovely display for various items on top. Assembling solo was difficult do to the larger pieces and slightly inaccurate directions. But worth it once you decipher them. Get a friend to help. Really loving this piece.", 
    "It was exactly what I expected. Assembly was time consuming, but easy.", 
    "I love the look. It's hard to assemble but looks very nice when finish just like the picture. It's a little wobbly but still good for the price. Just don't be too rough with it.",

    "There was sooooo many steps to put this together took me 5 hours to do it myself..the shelving ,doors,top of shelf is sturdy but the back of the dresser is a flimsy, thin paper like covering! Ridiculous. Thought the whole thing would be thick sturdy wood but the backing isn't. The dresser looks beautiful. We left one shelf out so it wouldn't be so tight inside", 
    "Got this to have a place for all of our shoes and it is wonderful! It was fairly easy to put together. Is much sturdier than I thought it would be. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Took a few hours to assemble. Does the job of hiding a pile of shoes in the foyer. Like the drawer for storing keys and other small items. I wish it was available in brown color, so it matched other items in the foyer.", 
    "This furniture piece is exactly as described and looks just like the picture. My husband uses is for his shoes and particularly likes the little drawer at the top to store his watches and wallet.", 
    "instruction manual had 10 steps for and 3 of them were incorrect. Ended up damaging the item.", 
    "The shoe cabinet is exactly as described. It looks great and is sturdy.Only issue is one of the doors. The front handle is attached with a slight overhang below the door. This make closing the door annoying. The handle hits the bottom every time.", 
    "Hard to put together. But nice piece of furniture.", 
    "It looks great in our entry hallway. We now have a clean looking entryway without the clutter of shoes. It fits plenty of shoes, especially children shoes.", 
    "nice item thank you very much",

    "This is one of the best purchases I've made, so functional and magnificent. Great quality and very sturdy, it's right by my entrance and makes a great first impression.", 
    "we love this it has lots of space and look very good solid to can tell it will last for a long time good finish to.",

    "This Shoe Cabinet looks great and very sturdy. Took my husband about two hours to build it himself. I love it!", 
    "I received this shoe cabinet yesterday and put it together today. It was pretty easy to put together, but tough time telling which little screws were which from the pictures in the directions. I fumbled through it and am happy with the results. This is a beautiful, solid piece of furniture! I was shocked how heavy it was! I needed help getting it into the house and then moving it to the bedroom after it was put together. I love this cabinet! I wish I had seen it years ago! The years I wasted putting my shoes on those darned shoe racks where they fall off or sit and get dusty. This solves those problems and looks beautiful!", 
    "Even though the doors gave me a problem, the shoes cabinets is very nice and it look exactly like the photo.", 
    "after air out for 2 weeks. it still gives a very strong toxic smell.", 
    "Just as pictured and great for the price", 
    "I bought this for my mud room. It nicely tucks away our shoes and looks good doing it. It took my husband about an hour to assemble after I laid out and separated all the pieces. I think that if it is gently handled it will hold together well.", 
    "That's what everyone asks when they walk into the dining room. My dining room exits into the backyard through French doors and after working in the yard we stow our shoes away when we come in. No one knows what the piece is, but they say it looks nice in the DINING ROOM! It's functional and decorative!", 
    "this is a great piece of furniture! very sturdy and well made. looks really great too", 
    "When done this looks very nice. The furniture is heavy and sturdy. I wish the back side is not as flimsy but you can't tell as this is suppose to sit against the wall. It took me a few hours to install by myself. Some pieces are heavy and I installed incorrectly a few times. Instruction could use a little more details.", 
    "Looks great in my entry hall. Took me a while to put the pieces together and the instructions are fairly well laid out. There was a small section that could be a little more clear, however I agree with the 3 out of 5 scale for assembly.I would recommend this piece for entry furniture, especially because of the small drawer at the top where we keep keys.", 
    "I was looking for something to help de-clutter my spac. This cabinet caught my eye because of the unique design. After reading reviews of this product and comparing it to similar pieces, I went ahead and chose this one. It was a little confusing to put together, and because of that took a little longer than anticipated to assemble, but it was worth it. It's a sturdy piece that looks like I paid much, much more for. The drawer at the top is convenient, too. So happy with this purchase!"
