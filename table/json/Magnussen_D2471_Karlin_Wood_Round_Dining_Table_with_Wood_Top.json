    "This was the worst decision i made. The base of this table chips every time it comes in contact with a chair leg and that is every time a chair is pushed under the table. Under the simulated wood paint is a yellow plastic material. I have yet to figure out how i am going to hide this. Save yourself and spend the money to get something made of real wood or at least has a better finish.", 
    "It is the perfect ash color and gorgeous finish. A lot of show for little money!"
