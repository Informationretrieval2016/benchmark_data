    "The product is good with proper instructions. But one of the door wasn't fix properly.", 
    "Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase because I knew what to expect. As stated in the product description this is a particle board product that you put together. It uses wooden dowels, white glue, cam locks with studs and a few screws. Compared to other do it yourself furniture I've worked with the manufacturers have addressed some weak points with these products with new hardware. Contrary to other reviews I found that getting the doors aligned was a very straight forward task. In-fact it was exceptionally simple if you can either read and follow the directions or have prior experience. Even a Non-Engineer can do it! Build the cabinet on a firm, level surface to ensure it's square, mount the doors then follow the adjustment instructions for aligning them. Pros: Well packaged. Plenty of Styrofoam, corner protections and protection between pieces. Box within a Box packaging so everything showed up just fine.No missing parts and everything you need to get the job done.Only need a #2 Phillips screwdriver to put it together. Handy to have a bit of extra glue and a #3 Phillips screwdriver but not required.Included clips and spacers that secure the rear panels into the mitered slots preventing any annoying rattle. Cons: There is no mechanical connection between the recessed base and the body of the cabinet. The initial connection is made with only wooden dowels and a bit of glue on them and it's held in place with compression only from the weight of the cabinet. There should be some screws.It's particle board. This is essentially throw away furniture and is best used with care. No children hanging off the doors anything like that.Manufacturers should have included a felt pen to color in any chips or other defects.Manu's should also have included a piece of strapping to run across the back that would keep the cabinet square and increase it's durability."
