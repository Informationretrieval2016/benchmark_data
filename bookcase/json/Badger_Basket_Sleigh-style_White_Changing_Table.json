    "love shopping at overstock/mi Thanks supporting M1", 
    "Purchased for my granddaughter's nursery...it has worked well.", 
    "Did the job wellGood for the price", 
    "I would not purchase this again. It was extremely difficult to assemble, although the instructions are simple. Pieces didn't fit together well and one piece broke. The fact the lower shelf bases are flimsy isn't a big deal, but a sturdier top shelf for the baby would seem logical, but isn't the case here. I would not buy again. Very disappointed in an American made product. Feels like it was made in China.", 
    "This is good for time being. We used for first 1.5 years, and then it completely broke (its cheap wood). Im OK with that, just needed diaper changer and place to put cute coordinating baskets for the nursery. Their wasnt much option anywhere else. If your looking for quality item that will last longer (or for second kid etc), this is NOT the item.", 
    "The table was easy to assemble but that is the only good thing I can say about it. It started with the splinters I got in my fingers because of the poor finish. The paint job is horrible, it looks more like it was just primed but even worse is the smell. I put it outside to air out -there is no way I will put it smelly like this in the nursery where my little one sleeps. I highly doubt that this is a non toxic finish as advertised! Two parts arrived with a crack. I only saw the small one first, wasn't happy but thought that I could live with it. Then I realized the other one, it is on the top rail and way to big for being ignored. I do not want my baby to get splinters as I did. Also the included pad is very thin although I think that this is the case most of the time if the pad is included. I will contact the manufacturer & overstock regarding replacement and to verify that the paint is non toxic. .....guess this is my punishment for being lazy and not going out to a store to buy a product I looked at first.", 
    "This piece is surprisingly strong when assembled. Both my husband and I had to hold the rails to get this put together. It is not a one person job. There were some imperfections on the shelves (the lower two shelves are quite thin) and the paint job was only fair. Nevertheless, it will do the job it was purchased for quite well.", 
    "My husband assembled this in about 10 minutes. I'm able to fit 3 decent sized baskets on each shelf, which is convenient. It comes with a very thin changing pad that I didn't think I'd use, but my old pad was thick and put baby level with the sides of the table. Since that made me uncomfortable I'm now using the new pad so I don't have to worry as much about her rolling off. She doesn't seem to mind it.", 
    "I ordered the white table, but was shipped the brown table instead. The mother-to-be was happy with the error. We are keeping it!", 
    "This was relatively easy to assemble (I did it by myself), but the bottom two shelves do not fit. I noticed that on the top shelf that does fit, the 4 corners are cut off so they can slide into the grooves. The bottom two shelves only had corners cut off on one side. The end result is that the shelves are just a hair too long, and the parts do not line up. The screws cannot be fully tightened and the piece looks junky and unstable. I am going to get a saw and get rid of the corners so the shelves will fit. Overall, disappointed.", 
    "Adorable addition for the baby's room! Hubby put together in 30 minutes - really impressed. Unique too :)", 
    "We love the look of the changing table and once put together, it is of very nice quality and sturdy. There are some flaws in the paint but nothing too dramatic that we will touch it up. The problem we faced with our order was that when it finally arrived, one of the sides was broken and the product was unusable. I contacted Overstock to get a replacement part and although Customer Service was prompt in responding to my needs, I did not receive the \"replacement piece\" for 10 days. The replacement piece ended up being a whole new changing table, not just the one piece we needed. The reason we received an entire new product is because the pieces are not interchangable as each table looks to be individually made. Setting them side by side, the two tables are even different lengths and heights.... Anyway, we were disappointed that it took so long for us to get a working product but we do like the piece and it is a nice addition to our nursery.", 
    "Bought this for a baby shower. . .made a really cute gift. I also purchased three med/large baskets for the bottom shelf that added bulk, also the better changing pad. The one that come with the table is very thin. Easy enough to assemble. . . as long as you have at least four hands! Directions were good enough.", 
    "Product is just what we were looking form and the price was very affordable.", 
    "Beautiful piece of funiture. Great addition to any nursery", 
    "The change table arrived and the box was damaged, which thus damaged the item. When trying to put it together, the boards were cracked and glued back together, didn't fit evenly and the end pieces were warped so it wouldn't fit together.. I wouldn't recommend this item.", 
    "I was really excited to recieve this in the mail not knowing what to expect. I recieved it in a week and boy was I surprised. My husband had already put it up when I came home and I was instantly in love with the product. I love the design of it and it's really white just like the picture. I was scared it might be off white and not match with my baby's crib but it blends in perfectly. A cute changing table at a cheap price, what more can I ask for. I would just note that there was a bit of wood that was missing some paint but it's no biggie. Im not gonna cry over something little that wasnt painted right. You can decoate this was any color and it would match since it's white. It aslo came with a changing pad which was convinent. I just had to buy a pad cover for it and it was good to go. If you're looking for an inexpensive but good quality changing table then this will do the job. Im so glad I made this purchase.", 
    "I bought this changing table with hopes that the quality would be what I expected and it was, me and my mom put it together and the shelves below were big enough for 6 storage baskets, loved it!", 
    "Changing table was VERY easy to put together. It's nice because out of all the simple changing tables we looked at this was the only one that has the screws on the side so you can't see them. All the others have the screws on the front. Top shelp, where the changing pad goes, is very sturdy. Other shelves are less sturdy but enough to hold baskets filled with diapers, etc. Very nice look. Classy and simple. White is a true white, not antique.", 
    "I bought this as a gift for my daughter and son-in-law who are expecting their first child in June. They said assembly was easy. They feel that the table is very sturdy. The only problem is that there are 2 knicks in the wood. Overall, they are satisfied.", 
    "This changing table looks nice, and was easy to put together. The pad included had a strong chemical odor and had to be aired out, so don't expect to use it immediately. I wouldn't want to put a baby on something that smelled like that. The lower shelves are a little flimsy, but they will just be holding diapers and stuff, so big deal. Just don't purchase it with intent to store heavy stuff on the lower shelves. The top is plenty solid, though and that's what really counts.", 
    "This changing table is very good quality for the price & easy to put together. I'm 7 months pregnant & did it alone. It's sturdy and very nice looking.", 
    "I absolutely love this changing table. It is sturdy, bright white, and looks very sophisticated in my son's nursery. It was easy to put together and looks amazing especially for the wonderful price!", 
    "I found the product very attractive and matched the crib already bought. It is simple and attractive.", 
    "This diaper changing table wasn't a part of my furniture collection but it matched perfectly! It was easy to put together (read ALL the directions first). I put it together myself being 7 months pregnant. It has great shelves with plenty of room for large baskets to hold diapers, etc. Shipping was fast and cheap!!!", 
    "I purchased the baby changing table for a gift and it was everything I expected it to be. The quality is excellent and it arrived in perfect condition. The packaging was great and nothing was damaged in shipment. Also, it was very easy to assemble. I am extremely pleased with my purchase and I will definitely make future purchases from Overstock.com.", 
    "This product was relatively easy to assemble (Hubby did it in about 2 hours with minimal problems), and turned out to be bigger that I thought it would be! It is a very stable peice of furniture that goes well with other pieces from other collections. You would defintely want to get another pad for the changing table (it's pretty thin), but overall it is a great addition to any nursery!"
