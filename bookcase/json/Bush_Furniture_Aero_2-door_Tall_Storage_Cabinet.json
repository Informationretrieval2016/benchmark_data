    "Dimensions listed are for the exterior. Inner dimensions are significantly smaller due to design.", 
    "This product isn't easy to put together and you are at the mercy of the holes being drilled at precisely the right spot. There are so many more connectors to line up in this product. Two piece back was a surprise. The actual storage space is the same as a 12\" depth cabinet. The rest is wasted decoration! I'm keeping it because my husband would have a fit if I asked him to try to box it back up!!", 
    "Sturdy and good looking for the price!!", 
    "Sturdy and doesn't look cheap. The directions could be a bit more clear in a few places. I would purchase this product again.", 
    "very attractive, nice design, smaller than I hoped. Made well, sturdy.", 
    "I actually thought this cabinet would be wider and less narrow. However, I love that I do not have to lift it in order to move it from place to place. I can simply push it around without it scratching the floor. I was able to store a lot of things away in the closet and it stays closed pretty fine. It takes a VERY LONG TIME to put together. Or, maybe it was just that we were tired. Either way, it was more than an hour. But, overall, great quality.", 
    "fairly easy assembly and nice storage"
