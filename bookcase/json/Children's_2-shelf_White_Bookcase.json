    "I like the style of this shelf but that is where the positives end. It arrived already dented in two places, but I told my husband just to go ahead and put it together anyway because I hate returning things. So he did. It stunk to high heaven so once assembled we put it outside for a night. The next day we brought it in and put books, toys and stuffed animals all around. It looked really cute until my husband smelled one of the stuffed animals... they reeked! That toxic paint smell was still there and permeated the stuffed animals. We returned the shelf to outside and left it there for 3 days. At that point it was ok to move back inside. It was disappointing to have to go through that process", 
    "Bought this for granddaughters room very nice! She can easily access her books, with no worries of pulling on her self like so many others!", 
    "Exactly what my 2 yr old daughter who loves to read needed. She loves it! She even puts her books back on it, well most of the time.", 
    "Spacious shelves, top of bookcase makes a nice display area.", 
    "Perfectly beautiful in my grand babies nursery!", 
    "This is cute little bookcase. It's time consuming but relatively easy to assemble. One reviewer mentioned the smell...she was correct. It does have an intense smell, but it goes away after a few days. We bought it to go below a window in my daughter's room. Looks great.", 
    "Very easy to assemble and pretty nice looking", 
    "I'm very disappointed in the quality of this shelf. I read \"******** ******quality\" in someone else's review, but it is definitely not! And it's not all solid wood either like the description says, the back is particle board, almost like cardboard. It's wobbly no matter how many times I tighten the \"bolts\". I bought this to place in a spot where you'll be able to see the back as well as the front and thought from the description that it was all wood. However it looks cheap from the back with the particle board and all the screws showing. This shelf is no better than the cheaper priced ones available at *******.", 
    "Love this product. \u2013 All wood!", 
    "Everything about this shelf is just like the picture. Good paint job. Solid wood. Everything fit together upright and tight. It's like buying pottery barn kid furniture without the price tag!", 
    "Nice bookshelves, very attractive and not hard to put together. Just what I was looking for for my office, not necessarily for children it can hold office files, books etc.", 
    "I love the design of this little bookshelf - the little \"sides\" on the top are nice for display purposes so that your trinkets etc have a bit of a backdrop. Putting it together was relatively easy, although the holes weren't perfectly aligned. I broke one piece of hardware due to this problem, but luckily there was an extra one in the bag. It's relatively sturdy, but due to the little issues I had with the bolts, I feel like I can't load it up with books. Overall, it will do its job just fine.", 
    "Look good and is of good quality", 
    "very well made. the only thing is the instructions are a little confusing for the back panels. the two panels are supposed overlap. and the cut away sections are what overlap each other at the center shelf position.", 
    "quality material, and easy assembly.", 
    "This was perfect for our teenage daughters room to put a TV on. It is the perfect height, narrow in width, matches everything, sturdy and deep shelves with plenty of space for books, etc. on shelves.", 
    "This shelf is just what I wanted. It is easy to put together and fits under the window in my extra bedroom. The quality is wonderful. I would highly recommend this little beauty.", 
    "This shelf was sooo easy to put together! It's for my daughters room and looks great with books and a few other items on it. It arrived several days before expected too, great shipping service even with standard shipping! Definitely recommend this item!"
