    "I was a little nervous to order something like this online without having seen it first, but I'm so very happy with this purchase! (I'm particular about wood furniture because my father was a woodworker. And it was hard to find something with these dimensions that wasn't veneer, which was why I ordered online.) The table has a beautiful wood grain and a lovely warm stain, and it's solidly built. I like how the drawer is not obvious but easy to open. It was very easy to screw the legs on. A perfect fit for our living room."
