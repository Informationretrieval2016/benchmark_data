    "Nice design, easy to assemble. instructions say two people to assemble, but i had no problem putting it together by myself. once together, is very stable and strong.", 
    "I ordered 4 of these bookshelves for my library. Assembly was easy enough for me to handle by myself. The striped back panel looks great and is screwed on as opposed to tacked on, which is time consuming, but well worth the extra effort. Tip: if you're putting more than one of these bookshelves next to one another, reverse the placement of the long narrow face panel on the inside bookshelves to outward as opposed to all inward. BIG difference in the appearance of multiple bookshelves together. Transformed my room completely!", 
    "I ordered this bookcase as it was the perfect size for the corner of my bedroom. Very pleased with the way it looks - exactly like the picture and the white is a true bright white without any grey or green tones.", 
    "This bookcase is a great piece; easy and not too time consuming to put together. And when it is done, sturdy and good-looking.", 
    "Love this bookshelf. Sure, you have to put it together and that takes a little time for figuring, but they have made it so if you put the top on the bottom and the bottom on the top, you can just take them off and reverse them! How do I know? Brilliant of them, less brilliant of me. I got 2 and love them.", 
    "I was very pleased with this bookshelf. It is sturdy, and has very nice detail. It looks like an expensive piece of furniture. Assembly was not too difficult.", 
    "Good shelf. Building the shelf took a couple of hours. The instructions could be better.", 
    "This is a nice item and the size is perfect for my needs.", 
    "This bookcase was very simple to assemble, and it looks really nice. I chose the grey background rather than the striped, and it's a nice grey that contrasts well with the white. The shelves are sturdy, and the base is extremely sturdy, which I appreciate. Overall a great piece!"
