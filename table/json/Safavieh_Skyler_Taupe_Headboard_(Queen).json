    "The lines of the bed are beautiful. The color grey would have been more descriptive. The picture should have reflected the bright chrome nail heads a the lighting showing the color is closer to charcoal grey, rather than taupe which is described as grey with a touch of brown. Because of the lines I thought of keeping and having upholstered in cream linen with dull, antiqued brass nail heads. Safavieh, please do this headboard in other colors & nail heads.", 
    "Good quality and very attractive.", 
    "This is a great headboard. Loved the color, price, fabric. However, upon opening the bottom half of the headboard was covered in pulls - like a kitten had used it as a scratching board - is the only way I can describe. It was WAY too much trouble to send back so I hid it with a lot of pillows. Beautiful & priced right. But regardless of what you spend, it should never show up damaged.", 
    "My daughter's bed is nice but it never looked really finished without a headboard. This headboard easily bolted on to the metal frame she already had. The taupe is in the mid-color range I would expect and the cloth has a nice texture to it. It will go with a variety of bedding styles, including the linen duvet on it now.", 
    "Beautiful headboard. Definitely light grey. Goes great with my room!"
