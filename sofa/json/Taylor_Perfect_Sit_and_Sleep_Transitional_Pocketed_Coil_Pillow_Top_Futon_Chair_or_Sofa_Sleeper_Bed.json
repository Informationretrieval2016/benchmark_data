    "BEFORE ANYBODY ASKS, I READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS AND WATCHED THE YOUTUBE VIDEOS THAT WHERE REFERRED IN THE MANUEL Very poorly made product. The screw holes weren't completely machined out, had to drill them out myself. The \"stretcher arms\" have no cross support. The mattress is not centered on the frame, so if you sit to close to the edge it tilts back onto to its self. BIG SAFETY HAZARD IF YOU HAVE KIDS. The cover does not fit neatly as all the picture depict. It feels flimsy In both the couch and bed position, It ships in one big box which is so tightly packed it makes it next to impossible to repack it in order to return the product. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF AS I DID!!!", 
    "The sofa comes completely broken down to include the innersprings being packaged outside the mattress. As I was trying to insert the innersprings into the mattress the zipper literally broke apart as I was zipping it up. The innersprings were also vacuum packed for shipping so I was forced to shop for my own box to fit them into to return them. Overstock customer service did well in rectifying the situation, but if you are a value shopper, save yourself the headache. Don't buy this one.", 
    "I was anxious to get this sofa/bed and use it mainly as a temporary bed. It went together in about 3 hours time. I had to tap one hole to get a bolt to thread properly. The directions were okay, needed to re-read some of them to understand what to do. It would be nice if they labeled the separate sections 1, 2 and 3. Then you'd know where to start assembling pieces; i.e., the frame, then mattress, etc. It looked nice going together then once I was done and adjusted everything for the bed setup I found the front steel support bar extends out beyond the mattress about 4 inches. With this being the side to get in and out of the sofa bed it will bang your shins. The mattress can not be pulled forward to cover the bar either because of a pocket design that's used to hold the backrest piece in place, while used as a sofa. I'll probably turn it around and put the exposed metal section against a wall and use it this way until it's used mainly as a sofa.", 
    "I like this couch/sleeper. It's not the most comfortable as either, but it seems I'd have to pay quite a lot more to get a better product. This was just the right price for me, and I'm quite happy with it. It won't get used a lot, but a few times per year we'll use it for guests, so it will suffice.", 
    "My very competent son was assigned the task of assembling this sofa. It took him about 3 hours to complete. There were directions missing, and although the finished product looks good, the front skirt is held on by a sticky tape that I restuck at least 3 times in about a 6 hour period. On the positive side- it has a really nicely finished back and does flatten out fairly easily. The innerspring mattress is comfortable. We will see how well it holds up over time.", 
    "Very good quality overall. However after mounting was completed the lower seating, unextended, is elevated upward as such as the leaving 2 people from the sitting unbalance the entire soda which tend to roll over us.The manufacture shall re-analyse the position of the sitting with respect to the entire balance of the sofa.", 
    "No complaints about the couch, other than the difficulty of assembly (figure at least an hour). Very comfortable and won't find a cheaper one elsewhere", 
    "It was a 2 day assembly project due to very poorly written and illustrated instructions. My brother and I got so frustrated on day one that we just let it set. The manufacturer was helpful when telephoned; however, I had to go online to get the number. The futon was delivered a day early without prior notice, so I had to wrestle the two large boxes inside by myself. When all is said and done it'd very average in quality. I would not recommend its purchase.", 
    "I'm very glad that I purchase the sleep sofa and tell everyone about it.", 
    "very hard to assemble, not good quality", 
    "its only been about 5 or 6 months and it is already broken. The frame is very weak for people to sit on. This couch is not worth the price. Did not realize either that i had to put it together", 
    "Very comfortable to sleep on. Not so easy to put together but not bad either. Sits out from wall a little more than like when in upright position.", 
    "Instructions were horrible, holes drilled wrong and the color didn't even come close to what it looked like on line. Rather than waste time disassembling it completely we redrilled hole ourselves. [...]", 
    "I like the firmness of the sofa, however if you sit on the edges you have no support so you lean down.as for the bed part I don'tlike the way it is put together, the bar sticks way out and if you turn it where the bar is to the back then you need support under it. But sitting in the center is good. Anyway for the money is not bad.", 
    "Couch is comfy when in bed mode or if you sit in the middle of the couch. The spring does not go the entire length of the couch so ends seem to droop down often. Was surprised that the couch had a high back. Set up does not look like the picture. I may have bought a different couch had I known. It blocks my windows. Set up was not too bad but it is a bit of a pain to covert back and forth to bed mode. Overall for our short term needs and the pro of a good price, it was worth it.", 
    "Not great directions for putting together and it looks awkward assembled, like the back of the futon is super tall. It is comfortable, but if you have it open and you sit on the one side you have to be careful that the futon doesn't tip to that side. It is also awkward to open and put back up to a seating position.", 
    "I bought this piece for my bishop office and he love it,it's so comfortable.", 
    "wasn't what I expected but is a nice little couch", 
    "Tilts when sleeping easily, not good for adults. Kids are fine.", 
    "it is very comfortable but it took 2 days to put this together. I would suggest anyone who is doing this use a electric drill. The manual way was a killer. but all in all we like it.", 
    "Very comfortable, quality cushions, arm rest are low enough to support head and neck well. makes for a good temporary visitation sleeper.", 
    "Was not that hard to put together for me like some mention it was for them.My only complaint my be is the seat cushion could be more comfortable.It came to my home in record time.", 
    "Would have been better if it was made a little sturdier", 
    "went together without a problem put the frame together myself in 1hr. two of us 20 mins. to put springs and cover on it all done 11/2 ready to use comfortable", 
    "Very comfortable and ready for guests", 
    "We bought this futon for our guest/play room. Specifically for our two granddaughters to use when they spend the night. Sounds good, right?While the sofa and the sleeper are quite comfortable and looks great, it is very difficult to convert into the sleeper. I am not able to do it by myself. The worst part was the putting together! The instructions are poorly written and the pieces are not labeled well. We had to take part of it apart, because we assembled it backwards. Also, some of the screws and holes did not fit properly and my husband had to get some of his own screws, bolts and nuts.Do not buy this unless you have someone in your house that is handy with tools.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Looks better and more comfortable than other futons. Works well as a guest bed.", 
    "The base of the futon needs to be rethought one little leg is not enough to hold weight when used on a regular bases", 
    "Perfect for our cabin and much more comfortable for guests then a traditional pull-up sofa bed as there isn't any bars to hurt your back."
