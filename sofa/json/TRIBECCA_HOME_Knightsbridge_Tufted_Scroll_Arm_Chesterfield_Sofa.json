    "This just arrived in three large boxes. My husband and I put it together in about 10 minutes. We love it! Color is beautiful and design and quality is very impressive. I think I'm going to order the matching chair now. It is firm but I still think it's comfortable to sit in, the firmness is all a part of the design so it doesn't bother me a bit. Thanks you, Overstock!", 
    "First let me say that I was super impressed by the delivery time of this item. the couch showed up at my home in less then three days. Now sadly on tom the negative. The couch looked great I bought the red one and loved the way it looked but man it was super uncomfortable. I secretly kept it to myself until even my ten year old daughter started complaining about the couch. I only had it in my home for less then 24Hrs before I packed it up and put it back on the truck. I was once again super impressed by the quick response and the refund from Overstock. They did charge me the return shipping fee but for the size of the item I felt it was a fair cost.", 
    "I really am enjoying this sofa. It had everything I was looking for as well as being super affordable. It has the look of something expensive from those other online retailers. Chesterfields are so expensive, and most I looked at were out of my price range. I saw this one and couldn't believe it. I have been wanting this one for months. I had originally wanted leather, but my cats quickly disabused me of that. It took a week to arrive and came in 3 boxes on two different days. It wasn't too difficult to put together by myself, you just need to be able to lift the pieces. It would be easier for two people, but can be done with one.Some things to note:It is a bit (very) firm. The cushions will relax a bit, but the back and sides will most likely never relax. It isn't something a few throw pillows couldn't fix to alleviate that complaint if you have it. I have a spot I usually sit, so I will be moving around cushions to make them relax as well. I don't know if the pricier versions are more comfortable, or if it's the style. Just take this into consideration when comparing sofas. Another plus is that the cushions are reversible. I just put a cover on it as I have pets and want to hold onto the newness a bit longer to protect it. As for some concerns. I didn't care as much for the fabric as I hoped. As great as the linen looks, it is a bit itchy on bare skin. I am hoping that with some time that will ease. Should have known as I don't care to wear linen clothes. I received the Dark Grey color. It is more of a washed out black/charcoal. It gave me pause when I pulled it out of the box. It has a bit of a blue tone to the dye as other reviewers said. I was worried it would clash with my wall color BM Thunder. I think with time, the dye will become less intense so it will look more like the photo. I accessorized with throw pillows and throws and I don't notice the blue tone. Lighting also helps, try using a warmer light in the room.It's been a few weeks and I can't say enough good things about it. I have taken quite a few naps on it. If you are looking for a sofa to sink into, this isn't it. But for the style and price, I think you can't go wrong as long as you understand that.", 
    "I have gotten so many compliments. It comes in 3 large boxes took my husband and a friend like 30 minutes (if that) to assemble. Couch feels sturdy and is perfect for our living room.", 
    "This couch is just simply awesome! Totally worth the money as it's comfortable and stylish. It was shipped in less than a week, in three separate boxes. Assembly was simple and quality is great. I would buy another in a second.", 
    "It's gorgeous, well maid and very sturdy.. I got the gray once.. The fabric is nice, could get dirty quickly though if you have kids, but I dont.. The foam seem solid and the finish is neat.. It took like 20 minutes to unpack it and put it together.", 
    "The other reviews are a bit dramatic. Yes, when you first get the couch it doesn't feel like some old loveseat that someone has been sitting in for 20 years. It's not mushy or soft, it is on the firm side. However, just sit in the darn thing for a while and it will soften up over time. It's a brand new couch, it's expected to not be \"broken in\" yet. We have had this couch for about 6 months now, and it's extremely comfortable and looks amazing.", 
    "The best sofa I have ever purchased! I was a bit leery making such an important purchase sight unseen.. I'll start by saying That the sofa came as described by others- in three separate boxes but was very easy to put together. The cushions are firm yet soft. The fabric is beautiful -as described and without flaw.I would without a doubt purchase another. I am now looking into purchasing the love-seat!", 
    "I have a this sofa for some time now and the it has held up beautifully with two children under 5! The cushions are firm but surprisingly extremely comfortable. Add a few toss pillows and you have a very functional and sophisticated sofa. It was delivered quickly in three separate boxes and I was able to assemble it by my self in 30 mins without any tools! My husband was very surprised when he came home that day. This is a great buy and I recommend it to all!", 
    "I am really happy with both the couch and the love seat. My concerns were color, fabric, comfort and look.Color came out great!! Dark grey with a hint of blue and the fabric design has a little light greys. Very rich looking for the monies. Looks like $5000 couch. Comfort well there not broken in quite yet just bought them. Ill buy two comfortable accent chairs. Easy to setup shipping was quick.No regrets.", 
    "I read all the reviews before purchasing. They were accurate about the firmness of the cushions and that is a positive for both the style and the longevity of the sofa. Bought both the sofa and the loveseat in the grey, very classy addition to my living room and a nice change from my old sofa loveseat that pretty much swallowed anyone who sat in it. I will probably get a few throw pillows mostly for accent color. We have found in the few days that we have had the sofa/ loveseat that the corners are the perfect spot to snuggle into and be really comfortable. Loveseat arrived in two boxes over two different days. I called customer service and they assured me the second box should be at my house the following day. It was. Overstock customer service was very pleasant, polite and helpful. Thanks! Putting the furniture together, piece of cake:)", 
    "I ordered this sofa because it was a knock off of a Pottery Barn sofa I liked. It was delivered on time and looks great! I absolutely love it and am happy with the quality.", 
    "This couch is beautiful. It was easy to put together. I did it myself in a few minutes. It was harder to get the couch out of the boxes than it was to assemble it. The back is a bit low so know that going in. But it's elegant and the back and seats are firm. I just love it! An excellent buy.", 
    "The couch is a little hard but other than that it was very easy to put together and it looks nice in my living room.", 
    "Just what I was looking for. I bought the purple one that matches with my gray and purple decor. I had receive many compliments. The only downfall is that is not as comfortable as my old couch, but i can live with that. I recommend it.", 
    "I ordered the purple linen. The color is incredible! The couch looks so luxurious and expensive in person. I'm very satisfied.", 
    "no tools necessary...but still a little tricky to assemble...but super awesome!", 
    "Love this sofa. Reminds me of well-made Carolina furniture of old. Sturdy, but beautiful.", 
    "Elegant and beautiful. Easy assembly.", 
    "I was hesitant in purchasing a sofa online without sitting on it first. The reviews I read about this sofa were mixed, which didn't really help with the decision-making process. I took a chance, and I'm sooo glad I did! The sofa is beautiful and looks great in our formal living room. We got the dark grey and it's very true to the picture on our computer screen. I don't see the blue hues other reviewers mentioned. The fabric is linen, which feels similar to jean material, but I think it's very elegant nonetheless. Very happy with our purchase and the delivery, which took less than 5 days.", 
    "Beautiful color. goes very well with my accent wall and the light grey color is beautiful.", 
    "I really love this couch. I love that it looks exactly as pictured, the linen material is nice, and the couch is sturdy and comfortable. I am so pleased with my selection.", 
    "Good quality and feels very comfortable.", 
    "Great sofa and very confortable, it feels firm without being to hard, perfect for our flex room.", 
    "I absolutely love the raspberry color of this sofa! The small stature makes my room's ceilings appear to be higher. It is firm, but cosy. The low back comfortably supports a relaxed, arms outstretched, pose.", 
    "We receive TONS AND TONS of compliments on this couch. Keep in mind, this is definitely more of a \"sitting couch\" rather than I couch you want to lounge on all day. The back is stiff (as it should be), and the cushions are very well made and comfortable. I can lay on it and I'm about 5'10. We do wish it was slightly longer, but we are taller people. It only took me (and me alone) 20 minutes to assemble, as everything is connected by hooks. We bought the light grey fabric and it's very rich looking. Love it!", 
    "This is a nice piece. It's firm and well made. The details and very nice and easy to put together.", 
    "I like to start with this arrived quickly just 3 days from placing my order.it arrived as stated in three large boxes. The longest part of whole process was taking it out of the boxes.it went together without use of any tools in under 10 min. It was a little lighter but perfect. As mentioned in other reviews it is firm but was still very comfortable. I couldn't be happier and recommend this product", 
    "The color seems to have some navy undertones but the sofa looks and feels expensive", 
    "I am super happy with this couch. Comes in three boxes that aren't too heavy, just large. Didn't require any tools to put together. Took maybe 10 minutes to put together with one other person. Overall a firmer couch, but I personally don't like sinking into couches. The lighter grey goes well with my decor and love the pintucked back. Highly recommend as a couch for a new apartment or home!", 
    "LOVE THE STYLE. THIS IS NOT A PLUSH CUSHION COUCH, BUT WE BOTH HAVE BAD BACKS AND FIND THIS COUGH VERY COMFORTABLE. I HAVE EVEN SLEPT ON IT COMFORTABLY. NOT THE EASIEST PIECE OF FURNITURE TO PUT TOGETHER HOWEVER", 
    "I'm currently sitting on this fella'. :). It looks lovely. The cushion is very firm and seems that it will last for a long time. If you want a squishy, \u00fcber cozy couch, I wouldn't say this one is for you, but it is classy, elegant, and comfortable.", 
    "This seemed like it would be perfect bc I spent months looking for a look within a certain budget. However, there are so many issues I would never buy a put together couch ever again. Mostly, its expensive for what it is. First, I specifically asked overstock if the delivery guys would deliver this to MY UPSTAIRS APARTMENT (im a small single gal) and they just left it outside at the entrance. I had to spend the evening unpacking the boxes and bringing it up myself piece by piece- NOT HAPPY. Finally got it all up and put it together. I have to say I loved the color- got the light gray and the fabric is nice. HOWEVER, The pieces on one side don't sit flush. Considered returning but it was such a hassle to unpack I didn't want to go through the trouble of repacking. It seems sturdy but I can tell the side that doesn't sit right. This couch is firm and comfortable enough, but it doesn't seem durable at all and it feels cheap somehow. I would not recommend this couch unless you are literally buying for a showroom and not planning on actually living on this couch.", 
    "Took just a few awkward minutes to slide the steel brackets together; it's very sturdy and it does the job. The seat cushions are plenty soft, but the back and armrests with the tufting is not soft, so just be prepared for that. The corner where the back meets the armrest is nice and curved, so it's very comfortable for the back and side support.", 
    "I'm enjoying my purple couch looks exactly like the picture just what I wanted sits very high study nice cushion", 
    "Thank you overstock for the fast shipping but this couch was without a doubt the worst purchase I have ever made. It came in three huge boxes.. Super uncomfortable and it was barely holding together by a few brackets. Not worth $$$$ at all.. I got an American made couch after this order for the same price and it's a real couch. It came in one piece, as a couch this price should. Don't waste your time on this purchase, don't be fooled by other reviews.", 
    "Firm couch, seems very durable so far. Easy to assemble (although it comes in three boxes, so it looks intimidating at first). Love the linen. Not the softest linen to bare touch, but perfect and hardy enough to survive kids.", 
    "Tufted, scroll arms, and charcoal gray! This is just the sofa I was looking for, and what a great price. 1 of the 3 boxes arrived separately, but Overstock was completely accommodating of the inconvenience this caused.", 
    "I was hesitant to purchase such a large item online - but I am so glad I took the chance. The couch was easy to assemble (gasp, I said assemble. Yes it came in 4 pieces but you can't even tell now that it is put together) it is exactly as gorgeous in my home as it is in the pictures. It is a very firm couch but all you need is to add a few pretty throw pillows and you are good to go!", 
    "This couch is beautiful! I bought the dark grey linen however if your room has a lot of natural light (like mine does) it will look more like a deep blue denim. After reading the reviews, I was concerned about the comfort of the couch however it is very comfortable in my opinion. If you are used to super soft couch then you will definitely notice the difference. It's sturdy and stylish and I love it.", 
    "Pretty great deal for what it is! Beautiful couch, comfortable, and the cushions allow for you to zip them off and wash...which I'm sure I'll be doing with two kids under two. The color was a little darker than I had anticipated and the packaging was rough...I'm glad it wasn't damaged. Totally worth the money and risk to order online!", 
    "This couch set is nice for show and minimal use. Not comfortable for family rooms setting.", 
    "I am impressed with this sofa. I thought that nice I had to assemble it my self it would not be sturdy and strong, but after I put it together and sat on it for a few days I noticed how strong it is. The materials used seems to be great quality. The only con is that the back is low and I love high backs, but that's my fault for not measuring because the measurements were in the description. The dark gray is darker than it appears in the pic, but it makes it look even more elegant. I would recommend this item.", 
    "The sofa is very firm but ABSOLUTELY beautiful; I would highly recommend it.", 
    "I love this couch. Great design. Easy to assemble. Literally two step process less than 10 minutes. Fabric looks great!", 
    "The sofa is more of a true purple color rather than the plum purple it looks like in picture. Was a little surprised at the color when opening the box, but I like it. Love the sofa....it is firm, but comfortable. I don't think the material is scratchy at all as I read in another review. Could take a nap very comfortably on this sofa. The reviews about it being SOOO firm scared me, but I'm so glad I got it. It holds it's shape while comfortable at the same time.", 
    "Honestly I was pretty excited to get this couch. It's very pretty. However, we've had it six months and it's already loosing firmness and one of the cushions is coming apart. Wish I'd made a better investment,", 
    "takes a little bit of breaking in to get comfortable but is a great value and easy to assemble", 
    "I love this sofa, but it's a much lighter shade of gray than what appears in the picture, which appears to be a dark gray. A handyman assembled it easily in 20 minutes. It is super firm, which I like.", 
    "Red! Beautiful! Took only a short time to put together. The people who made this were geniuses.", 
    "Great sofa, easy to put together. Took me about 20-30 mins by myself. The sofa itself is very beautiful (got the red one) and it goes perfect with my modern decor. The cushions are kind of firm, but i like them that way and they go right back to its original shape after having someone sitting on them.", 
    "This sofa came in three boxes and I had it unpacked and put together by myself in less than 20 minutes. I got the charcoal color. Not only does it look great, it feels sturdy. I was a little worried about other comments of it being uncomfortable, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is not uncomfortable at all. I bought the round ottoman to go with it and couldn't be happier with my purchase.", 
    "When looking for a couch I saw this one and wanted right away. I had a friend who is a decorator over and I didn't tell her which couch I ordered but asked her for advise on style and what to buy. She said let's use overstock and opened the computer and searched for maybe 5 mins and then showed me the couch that was her favorite which is this one that I knew was arriving the next day anyway. They only disagreement was the color. So happy to have this couch it is the center piece of the room and is so comfortable and looks very expensive.", 
    "We love the way our sofa looks. But it is very firm. Not very comfortable.", 
    "So far so good. very sturdy...careful moving- pieces could come apart while doing so. Overall -good product.", 
    "This is an elegant piece of furniture. It is well made. The fabric is a great color. We got the lighter grey. The cushions are reversible. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it's a bit stiff. As others have mentioned, part is the style and hopefully over time it will soften up. Everyone who sees this couch is wowed. And the dimensions are great for even a smaller room. Just love it.", 
    "We looked everywhere for the perfect sofa - and found this very one in stores at a much higher price. The sofa IS firm ( we just got yesterday ) but the seat height is nice and high compared to our low slung Italian sofa this replaced - nice and easy to get off of. The fabric ( light grey ) is a linen tweed - not solid which is perfect for hiding fur that may occur with our two dogs jumping on the piece while we are not looking. Set up was a breeze and we are very pleased.", 
    "I love the way this looks in my home. It is sturdy, but I am okay with that. Easy to put together too!", 
    "I purchased the red one. It was very easy to assemble, reasonably priced and very comfortable. I love this sofa so much, I really don't want anyone sitting on it. When you first get it, like any other sofa it's firm. Give it a couple days and it'll soften up. I'm so pleased with my purchase.", 
    "this sofa is firm and gives our apartment a dope look! We got the grey. I spend more time with my husband on it now that we've gotten rid of our super soft old sofa.", 
    "I love the sofa, however the cushions had a few scattered spots on them. I am waiting for overstock to replace the seat cushions, that is the only reason I gave it four stars.", 
    "Very happy with this couch!", 
    "I was super skeptical about a couch that came in pieces. The price seemed too good to be true. But for once, I was completely wrong. The couch is well made and very rich looking. I prefer \"firm\" couches not only for the comfort level but because they hold their shape. I can stretch out comfortably on this couch and my back won't ache after a nap. If you like to sink into your couch, this isn't the one for you. I ordered the lighter gray and the color is a bit darker than what is featured in the pictures online. I haven't had to wash it yet so I can't comment about upkeep or spills. You can't beat this deal and I have gotten nothing but compliments. I'm very very glad I bought it!", 
    "A wonderful sofa and so easy to put together. My wife put it together while I was at the grocery store. delivery was on time and quick...", 
    "We received this within three days of ordering it. Comes well wrapped, and easy to put together. We got the red, including the loveseat. Very comfortable. Nice solid, high quality products. Excellent!", 
    "This couch is exactly what I have been looking for. I ordered a similar one from another company and didn't receive it after almost 3 months of waiting. When I found this on overstock, I immediately ordered and got it in a week! It's so easy to assemble. It has a very firm feel which holds up better over time. The look and feel is that of a much more expensive couch. Very pleased!", 
    "Great looking living room couch. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "Quick delivery, easy set-up..Looks alright but poor quality..color is navy, not charcoal..zipper on cushion was broken when we received the sofa..The most uncomfortable livingroom furniture I have ever sat on..Ever..Very disappointed with this purchase. This sofa is not worth anything close to $$$$", 
    "This sofa makes a wonderful statement", 
    "I love my couch and it came easy to put together. It is one of my favorite purchases from Overstock. The cushions are rather stiff at first, but over the last several months they have softened up and are incredibly comfortable to sit on.", 
    "Amazing affordable sofa with many color options... Though set up is a bit tricky more than one person to help assemble... Nice firm couch", 
    "Not the most comfortable sofa and smaller than envisioned. Although I looked at the dimensions sofa looked small when put together, but my livingroom is huge with 10 foot ceilings. I like the style and so far seems nicely made.", 
    "It's so pretty. But it really is hard. I'm glad this was for a formal room that's rarely used.", 
    "My husband and I were able to put this couch together rather quickly. It is in our family room. We love the support it provides and no extra pillows are needed. It also looks terrific in the dark gray. We are very happy with our purchase", 
    "This couch sits beautifully in our living room. We received so many compliments.", 
    "It is a really beautiful sofa, especially for the money. The color is gorgeous and it brings a classical feeling to my tiny NYC apartment. It comes in 3 boxes and I was able to put it together but myself. My only complain is that the cushions are a little smaller than the space so they don't fit tightly and there is space between the cushions and the couch, so it can be uncomfortable at times.", 
    "I was very excited to purchased this sofa and I read all the reviews and I should have believed when the people described the purple not matching the picture. I regretted it as soon as it arrived but I liked the shape of the sofa and that I kept it. Few weeks later I noticed one of the buttons had/was sunk in and you could see the white filling. I keep my sofa covered with a trow blanket so I'm certain is was a defect. I contacted Overstock and they offered to send me a replacement which I considered but I didn't want to go through the trouble just to have another sofa that may fall apart as well. They ended up giving me a certain amount of store credit but IMO not a good deal. For how much this sofa cost I didn't expect to get such a low quality item. It is a very pretty shape but not good quality and not accurate in color. I really wish overstock allowed pictures in their reviews. I'm sticking with amazon for my purchases ever since this incident. Way better costumer service and not all this crazy questions when an item is defective.", 
    "I have had this couch for 2 months so I cannot speak for how this will wear with time. However, the color (I got the red) and make of the couch is beauuutiful. I have received multiple compliments on this couch. The colors are true to the pictures shared here. Its vibrant, comfortable, and overall a great buy. The couch came in 3 large boxes. You will need help moving them. Assembling it took about 20-30 mins.", 
    "We absolutely love this couch. In fact we ordered 2 for our living room. We ordered the dark grey color. It is a very textured looking color that has a linen look to it. It is a hard couch so if your looking to sink in you won't. It is definitely nice too look at though. Also, we have made returns to overstock in the past. They are VERY easy to work with and we are thankful for that. We buy a lot from this site.", 
    "Everyone says it is too firm but I like that, better than saggy. It's soft enough that my husband just fell asleep on it. It was easy to assemble, I had my 7 year old help me. Love it! Just wish it was available in blue.", 
    "love the red fabric. The sofa is well made. Hoever it was difficult to line up the arms when putting it together.", 
    "Simply love the look and had added this to my cart, while I was about to purchase it went out of stock. Extremely classy and perfect for my house, hope someone can help!!",
