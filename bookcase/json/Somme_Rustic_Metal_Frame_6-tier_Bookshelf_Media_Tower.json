    "From a bird's eye view on overstock this piece is a bit expensive considering the amount of raw materials involved. However the wooden boards are very heavy and high quality, I'd never believe they were not 1 piece real wood. It was very easy to assemble using only 1 single kind of screw, and it was up and running within 1hr!", 
    "I was pleased with the price and look of this unit. Only some of the pieces were labeled so it was difficult to put the right piece together and I had to take it apart and redo it half way through. You need two people and a pair of pliers to straighten out the soft metal braces that had mashed up angles. After a couple of hours and a few words I don't usually use - I had a bookcase I liked the looks of.", 
    "We bought four of these shelving units plus the low console for our tv. They were certainly easy to assemble, and seem relatively sturdy, but I will say that I was a little disappointed when they arrived. On 3 out of 5 units, we had to use pliers to reshape the steel so that the pieces would fit together. In some cases it was evident that the shipper had dropped the box, crushing the metal, in others, it seemed like a manufacturing oversight. Now that they're assembled, I'm happy, and believe that they'll hold up over time, but that's still to be determined. I am disappointed when I walk by the shelves that the places we had to pry the metal are visible. On another note, depending on what you're shelving, book ends are essential!", 
    "Delivered sooner than expected. Easy to assemble, needs 2 people just because of the size. Very pleased w this purchase", 
    "super quality - I'd recommend this to anyone!", 
    "Quality item, easy to construct- made of nice materials- looks sharp.", 
    "I ordered 2 of the larger bookshelves and put them together to make one big wall shelving unit. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price. My only negative comment is that one of the shelves was damaged slightly in the corner from shipping I assume. We put that corner in the back where it can't be seen. Overall, I'm happy with our purchase.", 
    "Perfect for what we were looking for. Very sturdy and easy to assemble. Looks like a piece of \"furniture\", not just a metal shelving unit for stereo components.", 
    "This is a very nice piece for the money. Solid, classic style that would go with any decor - super easy to assemble. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Great looking and very easy to assemble.", 
    "I needed something sort of industrial, sort of elegant, sort of rustic that would mix shiny mercury glass decor, with black metal chandelier, and a pottery barn style room. These are perfect! Just as described, easy to put together, and sturdy. And the wood is real, so it doesnt look cheap! I would totally buy again.", 
    "Get another shelf for the money. Its nice and I had no problems but its way too much money for what it is and how you have to put it together.", 
    "These look great and add a nice look to any room. A little wobbly if not constructed carefully, but overall high quality.", 
    "These shelves and beautiful and well made. Not too difficult to put together, but there are 32 screws per unit. The shelves and a dark warm brown and include a brace under them so they won't sag with heavy objects or books. I am very please with them.", 
    "It is a very heavy shelving unit weighing in 135lbs, but it makes it extremely sturdy. It looks great, the shelves are actual wood, and they have a bar going across them for added looks and support (prevents bowing of the shelves). We saw similar shelving unit in crate & barrel for $***, and this $*** feels even sturdier than the C&B one. So very happy we got this. Considering getting the smaller one as well to match the large 40\" we got.", 
    "Quality furniture. We bought five pieces as display shelves. Easy to assemble, sturdy hardwood and metal product. Highly recommend.", 
    "The shelves themselves seem to be made out of quality materials, but the shelves I received had very obviously been returned by someone else. The metal support beams on some of the pieces are completely bent in the middle. Looks like a manufacturing/QA problem."
