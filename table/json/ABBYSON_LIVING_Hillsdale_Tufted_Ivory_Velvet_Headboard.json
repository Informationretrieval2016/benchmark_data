  "reviews": [
    "Hard to assemble. No instructions and pre-drilled holes did not line up, had to go out and buy additional hardware to make it work. But for the price, I'm happy with it.", 
    "I first noticed this headboard months ago but it quickly sold out. When it was finally back in stock I jumped at the chance to get it. It is even more beautiful than I imagined and exactly what I wanted. Super elegant and pretty.", 
    "Love this headboard. It's exactly as pictured. My only issue would be that we had to basically make a frame to attach it to the bed.", 
    "Its exactly what is described. Very well made.", 
    "Very stylish. Great material. And great price", 
    "This is such a cute headboard!", 
    "I am happy with this but the color is more tan than ivory to me.", 
    "This is a really pretty headboard! It is well made and has a simple, yet sophisticated design that would work with many different decorating styles. My only complaint was the color, which is closer to khaki with grey/taupe tones (definitely not ivory) and clashed with my new bedding. However, the headboard is so pretty and such a great price that I decided to just exchange the comforter set. It arrived a day earlier than expected and was packaged really well. Overall I am very happy with this purchase!", 
    "I love this headboard, I'm glad I got it!", 
    "This is more of a light grey than ivory, but it is beautiful. Only wish the bolts were included, but it attached easily with 4 bolts. Very pretty.", 
    "This headboard is exactly what I needed. It's such great quality for the price. Easy to assemble. The fabric is so luxurious and I love being able to sit up and read in bed. Highly recommend!!", 
    "I love the headboard-except for the fact that a couple of the decorative tacks are off-line.....I'm going to have my upholsterer look at it to see if he can fix it. It's definitely a bargain anyway!!", 
    "Decent value for the price. No instructions provided or screws/bolts to connect the headboard to a bed frame. Currently unattached to our bed and resting between the bed and wall now... Looks good though.", 
    "Was skeptical to order this online; I prefer to inspect large purchases in person but this was well priced and exactly what I'd hoped it would be...classic, sophisticated, elegant looking. It was easy to assemble as well. Overall very happy with it!", 
    "Great headboard. Very soft and comfortable to lean on. My only complaint is that the color is more silver than it looks in the picture! Other than that, it's exactly what I wanted.", 
    "I LOVE this headboard. The color is more beige/tan than ivory in my opinion but still works in our master bedroom and looks beautiful. Assembly was ok other than the center support board not being long enough to line up with the pre-drilled holes. We left it off and just have the headboard pushed against the wall with the bed instead of mounted on our bed frame (wanted to see how it looked and haven't gotten around to finishing mounting). I was in love as soon as I saw it out of the box!!", 
    "Received this headboard on time. Was able to assemble it myself. Note: You'll need to purchase additional hardware to attach headboard to : 4 bolts, 4 nuts, 8 washers. I put the bed on my queen size bed and it fit well. It adds a subtle elegance to the bedroom; exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "The color I received looks nothing like the image. It has a taupe look with a tinge of purple. Definitely NOT ivory. It threw off the whole coloring of my room, and now I'm not sure if I can even return it or how easy it would be. Also, the bordered pins were put in too high in a couple places, making it look sloppy. I'm not one to typically write reviews, but this is not acceptable. I'm very sad, since I was looking forward to this purchase. My one positive would be, it's nicely padded, and if the colors and pins were put in correctly, I'd love it.", 
    "Just as I had hoped. This headboard is perfect for your elegant bedroom. Easy to assemble too.", 
    "This headboard was true to color, nice soft fabric. It is perfect as it is neutral color and appears to be good quality. Looks great, a bit oversize on the sides even for our CA King bed but it looks nice and with comforter, etc. there you don't notice that it is a bit wider. Happy with purchase.", 
    "Great quality and value. The headboard is well made, easy to assemble, a great look that can go with any style of furniture. The color was true to the website, very pleasant. I was concerned that the bow design would look too large in king size but it looks perfect- understated yet stately. Highly recommend this beautiful headboard and you can't beat the price..", 
    "Love it. Simple assembly.", 
    "Absolutely love the headboard. Beautifully made. It came in ivory or gray - couldn't decide because both looked awesome from the picture. Chose the ivory because of room color & very happy. Legs are hidden in velcro-closed back. Will need extra long bolts. Easy to assemble.I would definitely recommend the product - no regrets. Well-made product. This is the 3rd item I have ordered from Overstock and very happy on each product. When I priced tufted headboards at a furniture store, they were double the price and not as many choices as I found on Overstock.", 
    "looks perfect but did not come with with legs had to make are own so we did not have to hang it on the wall"
