    "I was very excited to find this product at overstock.com. My budget was $50 and I found it at overstock.com for $**. Now we an organzed toy area toddler classroom at our church.", 
    "This was just what my grandson neededl. It went together easy and looks great in his room.", 
    "Holds just the right amount of small toys to help keep my sons room tidy.", 
    "Very well built and easy to assemble. My grandson loves to totally empty the bins and rearrange them!! Great for quick pick up before company arrives!", 
    "I bought this for my 4 year old grandson, and he loves it. It's easy for him to find his toys, and there are lots of different bins for him to keep his toys sorted. He keeps his toy room cleaned up better since he has a place to put his toys in.", 
    "have had this for several years now, no issues, heavy toys on upper shelves and never a problem", 
    "broke easily with my two toddlers constantly throwing the baskets! :)", 
    "This has proved to be a perfect organizer for my granddaughter's toys!", 
    "Keeps all of the little toys neat!", 
    "This storage unit arrived in record time and was SUPER easy to assemble. Made such a big difference in my children's room instantly. If you have lots of small toys that need storage this is a great choice.", 
    "Perfect for organizing toy, books, ect... I purchased it and it arrived in less than a week in good condition. I works great the quality is good and I am very pleased with the purchase.", 
    "It's easy to put together and really holds sooooo many toys ! We love it because it keeps all the small parts organized. My two year old son actually told me it was \"cool \" when he first saw it . He likes things organized too, lol!", 
    "Product was easy to put together and arrived within 2 days of placing the order. It is sturdy and colors are adequately represented in the picture. Highly recommend this product and vendor.", 
    "We were missing hardware and purchased more than we needed at hardware store. We would have waited forever and had an upset child had we waited for overstock to send missing hardware.", 
    "This was the perfect organizer for my three year old son's room. The rows could be a tid bit wider, would be the only thing I would change.", 
    "Very pleased with this toy storage unit. The grandkids can do a quick pick-up of toys by tossing them in the bins before they leave. They can assign bins by color to each have their own, or store just puzzles, just craft dough, etc in individual bins and just bring one bin to the table to play. Perfect for what I wanted,", 
    "I bought this for my 18 month old grandson. I keep him 3 days a week and we have toys everywhere. The day he came after my putting this up he was so excited. he would go up and get one toy out at time. He didn't want to leave the play room. Now he gets a tray out an takes it to where he wants to go and plays. When he is finished I tell him to put his toys up and there is no problem he just takes the tray back and puts it on the rack. I think one of the best features is that the toys can be separated and he can see what he is getting. With a toy box everything has to be taken out to find that one toy that just happens to be on bottom. Would definitely buy again and even thinking about a 2nd one.", 
    "Perfect for storage of kids toys under 7 years old. Just their size. Holds quite a bit and is sturdy. I give it an A+ for the price. Thanks again overstock !!", 
    "Great product. Easy to install, great price and it serves its purpose. I am able to store various toys in the bin and my child will put them back where they belong.", 
    "I purchased 2 sets of these shelving units to organize our grandson's toys. They give him a great overview of the his toys so he can see better the selection that he decides to play with at the time.", 
    "i am so glad i purchased this shelf to store my toddler's books, toys and stuff animals. it's very durable and it looks it's made of high quality. we bought this when he was still a newborn coz we didn't know where to put all his stuff that was given mostly as a gift to him. now that he's 1.5 yr old, he gets his toys/books there and he is learning where to put all his toys/books back. whenever he needs a toy or a book or a stuff animal, he knows where to go. easy to install too. my husband did it in a jiffy and i think i could do it on my own too. i highly recommend this product.", 
    "I LOVE this organizer! I bought it about a week ago and I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to assemble. At first it looked smaller than I thought it would be, but once assembled I was able to fit a lot of stuff into the bins! This organizer helped eliminate a lot (almost half!) of the clutter in my son's closet, and I love the way it looks. I wish it was a little bit more sturdy, but once you get the stuff in the bins it doesn't really matter. Overall GREAT product! And worth the money!", 
    "This was for my 2 yr old grandson. The colors match the bedding he just got. The height if this organizer was perfect for him. He can reach all the bins. Since bins are removable, it is much easier to take one over to the toys for clean up.", 
    "This piece of furniture is worth it's weight in gold. Finally cleaned up the endless mess of markers, stickers, crayons, paper etc. couldn't be happier. Our color scheme is primary colors so it works with our home. Wouldn't look as cool with a pastel room I don't think.", 
    "When I opened the box, I found one of the main sides damaged. It looked like it had gotten scraped and that someone had taken a tan marker and colored over the scape in an attempt to disguise it. This was of course on the side that faces out and would be visible. Not overly noticeable, but still, it was supposed to be brand new and thus \"perfect\". Thankfully, they had given me an extra screw b/c one of the screw heads wasn't even on the screw, nor had it broken off in the package. They had just given me a bum screw. If I had it all to do over again, I wouldn't buy this anyway. It wasn't as easy to get things in and out as I had thought. The shelves are pretty close together and there's just not a lot of clearance. Just a personal preference.", 
    "I would recommend this product to any parent who has issues with a disorganized play/bedroom. Easy assembly and it gets the job done!", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised that the horizontal bars are metal (they look like wood in the photo) so this item is strong and fairly sturdy due to that. It has been a nice addition to our toy storage. The plastic bins are high quality but their newness in our house has made our daughter want to empty them and play with them. They can withstand 26 pounds of weight walking on them upside down FYI. It comes with wall brackets but it does not explain how to install them when the plastic bins jut out in the back enough to prevent you bracketing the thing flush with a wall. I have not tried to use them but I am assuming the design allows the wall brackets to put a few inches distance between the solid sides and the wall, so there will still be room for the plastic bins at the back.", 
    "Overall it was a good purchase. It is perfect to organize your kids toys.", 
    "Ordered this for a kids \"play area in my office. Is a good size for the area, good price and the only disappointment was that the colors of the bins were not true primary colors but a little washed out. Would have been a problem if I were trying to match them with room decor, but not for my use. Kids love seeing the toys out & to go through the bins to see what they can \"find\"", 
    "This is a great product to try to stay organized with all your kids toys. it's hard to get them to put them in the right bin, but is easy to use and take stuff around the house without making a disaster. I've purchased four of these already. GREAT product! Easy to find stuff in the bins too.", 
    "It is a nice and colorful organizer. we like it a lot.", 
    "Great product- helps keep the house clean and the kids are able to help as well.", 
    "I was very pleased with the 2 units that I ordered. They were everything the description said that they were, and they look great; are very sturdy and of excellent quality and will serve my grandchildren well.", 
    "This toy organizer is a great way to help kids get and stay organized. It helps keep everything off the floor and in the right spot. It's very sturdy and is worth the price!", 
    "Arrived quickly; very easy to assemble, even with my only \"help\" coming from a 3 year old. Works great, better quality and sturdier than I expected.", 
    "Good colors and design. This went together easily. Toys are in view, but orderly. I had some concerns about the stability before I ordered, but the product is solid.", 
    "Putting the organizer together wasn't too bad. It was when we finished building it, It was a bit flimsy especially when my one year old tried to grab a bin from the shelves. Once we actually put all their toys into the bins to weigh the shelves down, and secured it to our walls that organizer is much safer. It does hold a lot of toys, and looks great.", 
    "Fantastic product, has really helped to keep things tidy, If only I could get the kids to do the putting away!", 
    "Very useful and colorful storage for children. Stacks well against the wall and seems sturdy.", 
    "Very happy with this product. I wish it was made in more colors, we sanded and painted ours black so that it would match my son's new racecar room decor. Love the bright colored bins and it is a great way to store toys with little parts and bigger ones too. My 2 year old likes putting things in the bins and that is a good thing!", 
    "We love our new toy organizer, It holds the majority of my daughters toys very well. I actually received two of the small red bins broken so I called customer service and they were very helpful, right away they shipped me two replacement bins. We received them in about a week and Honey-can-do did not require me to ship back the broken ones, one less thing I had to worry about. So we are very pleased with the product and the customer service that comes along with the company.", 
    "My grandson organized all his toys, and now he can see where everything is without having to dig to the bottom of his big plastic bin. We love this and it encourages him to pick up his toys and put them in the bin they belong.", 
    "Product was what was described. I thought it was a good price until I went to our local Menards a week later and saw the same thing for $$$ instead of $$$. Was a little bummed about that but oh well, you live and learn. Do more research before just buying something online.", 
    "Great for storing small toys that get lost in the big toy box. The two different size bins allow you to store larger toys, too, as well as books and puzzles. The open bins let you see the contents at a glance.", 
    "Great kids toy organizer, was able to fit in my sons closet. Love it", 
    "I ordered two of these items, which were shipped promptly in their original boxes. The first one went together quickly (15 minutes) but had extremely dirty pieces that required cleaning before and after assembly (adding about another 10 minutes). Assembly involves just 18 screws, yet each is essential -- the second one I ordered arrived missing one of the screws so cannot be completed without a trip to the hardware store for a replacement. For the price they seem fine but you have to be willing to clean and assemble and perhaps find spare parts.", 
    "The kid storage organizer arrived in a very timely manner. I was pleased with the quality and ease of assembly.", 
    "THis was one of the best purchase i have done in a while the only thing that was a disadvantage was the colors that it came in. but otherwise perfect for a baby room", 
    "Found this WAYYY cheaper somewhere else (same exact product) and also one with more neutral toned bins. Would not recommened buying this on this site."
