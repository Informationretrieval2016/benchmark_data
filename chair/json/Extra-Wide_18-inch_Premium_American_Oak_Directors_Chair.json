    "Love these chairs. Excellent value and versatility. I ordered natural with red canvas and the red is more orange than red. If they were really trying to sell it as red, it would be tomato, and impossible to match! I got replacement canvas from another store and, with the price, still think I came out ahead.", 
    "I needed two chairs for my library and decided to try directors chairs. These arrived amazingly fast and in good condition. There was no assembly other than to put the canvas back and seat in their obviously appropriate place. I thought they looked a little flimsy at first but once they were on the chair they were actually perfect. I like the wood - sort of a medium oak looking color which went well with the forest green color I chose for the seat and back. There are little plastic tabs on the bottom of the feet so as not to scratch up a floor. The chairs are comfortable, solid and look great in my library!", 
    "I am using this as a desk chair and it's both supportive and comfortable. The construction is more sturdy than I expected at this price point and my only complaint is that some areas of the wood isn't sanded and finished smoothly. The red color is more tomato (on the orange side of the spectrum) but I like it and overall great value.", 
    "GREAT CHAIRS !! HIGHLY RECOMMEND......JUST FOLLOW THEEASY INSTRUCTIONS AND YOU ARE ALL SET.....", 
    "Overstock is just an amazing company. Shipping rates, quality chairs, and even returns.. Worthy of all 5 stars for sure!", 
    "Simple to assemble. Thought it was going to be slightly taller like a high chair.", 
    "Nice wood grain, solid and nice choice of fabric colors. Thumbs up!", 
    "She loved it and so did we.", 
    "The chairs look better than standard and have a great beachy feel", 
    "The extra-wide width is a plus.", 
    "These directors chairs are great for extra portable seating. Easy to fold up and put away when not using and much mor comfortable than folding chairs or stacking plastic ones.", 
    "Very pleased with my purchase. Nice solid chair, strong canvas.", 
    "great director's chair . wide and sturdy", 
    "The channels in the wood part of the chair, that the seat fabric must fit into to get the seat onto the chair, were ridiculously small and took the strength of several people to pull it into place. I would never have been able to do this by myself. Have had many deck chairs in the past...never a problem. This was ridiculous!", 
    "The American Oak 18 inch director's chair is the most solid director's chair I have ever sat in. It was easy to assemble, and as comfortable as firm. The only negative is the metal supports are impossible to fold out straight. However, that did not diminish the reliability of the chair at all. In fact, I have had this problem with every director's chair I have used.", 
    "I love these chairs. They are extremely comfortable and you can fold them up and put them away if you want."
