    "This chair is incredibly easy to assemble - all you need to do is attach the legs. It's very attractive, as well. However, the seat cushion has already become quite saggy, and I've only had the chair about a month - and I hardly ever sit in it. I still rate it as \"good\" quality, however, since it is inexpensive, and I feel the quality is good for what I paid.", 
    "For the price, these chairs are great and we are pleased with how they look in our living room. They are lower so do not obstruct the view window we placed them in front of. They are extremely comfortable and fit with our West Coast mid-century modern, Scandinavian decor in our open concept home. We blew all our money on our reno so were on a tight budget to finish the interior decor. If you have money, obviously try to get chairs that are higher quality. If you plan to use these chairs for everyday use, I do not think they will last more than a few years. The fabric is nice but super thick or tight woven. The legs are sturdy enough for occasional use but not for heavy every day use in my opinion unless you're a petite person. One of the legs on the two chairs we purchased was wonky so we had to request a replacement.", 
    "I spent an hour or so sitting in this chair with my laptop last night after I put it together (which went quickly--you just need to screw the legs on), and I have no complaints about the comfort or size. The blue, though, is brighter/less muted than it appears in the photo.", 
    "Just assembled our new aqua tufted back chair. Upon opening the box, I was greeted with a multitude of small plastic balls that ran all over the floor. Apparently one of the silicon anti-moisture packing bags had been ripped open on delivery and had leaked everywhere. No biggie - just have to vacuum after assembly. However, it was the strong chemical smell that was the real put off. The whole room smells of it now which makes me wonder what tub of chemicals they dropped it in before sending it out. I've washed my hands twice and they still stink. While the actual assembly was easy enough, the wood used on the underside of the chair couldn't look any cheaper, and when you sit on it for the first time, all the legs splay out due to the construction design. This should affect the actual usage of the chair, but coupled with my other gripes, it's annoying. After spending last weekend shopping and assembling Ikea furniture, it definitely falls short as I really expected something more from a $190 chair. In terms of comfort, it is what I expected. A little hard to sit on, but it is a feature chair after all. The body is nice and wide and the fabric feels good. Where it wins though is on looks. It complements our living room really well looking exactly like it does in the picture. Overall, disappointed upon opening and assemble, but will see how my impression changes over time. It looks good and hopefully the smell will clear quickly (will be leaving all the living room windows open tonight)It will however be the last Overstock purchase I make.", 
    "I ordered two of these chairs for the living room and they are of good quality, comfortable, and were easy to put together! Friends loved them and wanted to sit on them instead of the new couch/loveseat I bought. Not sure why the 'guacamole' colored ones were more money (different supplier?) but wish I had enough room to buy more.", 
    "Great accent chair, great color, comfortable and easy to assemble. So happy my hunt for an accent chair to over and I Have this great chair.", 
    "This is the cutest chair. I have it in my den to add some color. The actual color is true to the picture. The chair was really easy to put together.", 
    "The chair's ok, it is just much bigger than I expected. Note dimensions before you order. I'm in a small NYC apt. and I thought the armless option would be good for the space, but it's actually pretty wide and deep. It will work, though. Color is nice. Style otherwise is pretty good.", 
    "Chair is absolutely beautiful in popular aqua blue! Armless with spacious seat allows free movement and sitting however you wish! Button tufts add a touch of elegance to a traditional style. Highly Recommended!", 
    "I like this chair but it's way too low for the rest of my furniture. It is 17 inches from ground at the HIGHEST point and the part where you actually sit dips and inch or two lower. The color is pretty. It's pretty much exactly like the picture with a heather look of green and blue but definitely more blue. I'd keep it if it didn't sit so low. It's quite firm though, so many not.", 
    "Perfect for small spaces and very comfortable", 
    "I'm so glad I ordered this chair! It's a perfect accent color in my uncommon design of red and Aqua ! I want it in other colors! Easy to assemble. Its durability is really welcome because It's my dog's favorite chair to look out the window.", 
    "Better than expected. Very comfortable, I love the fabric and color.", 
    "These chairs added a pop of color to our family room and were quite easy to assemble. However, it took a while to get used to positioning the chair so that one of the legs did not rock due to it being shorter than the others.", 
    "This chair is solid and comfortable. It was easy to put together and is quite substantial", 
    "This chair is comfortable and beautiful, but the place where one of the legs attaches to the seat must have been extremely weak because it gave out after just a few months. So now our chair sits in the corner looking great, but we can't let anyone sit it because the leg is going to give way. Big bummer because we love the color and style.", 
    "This chair is amazing for the price point. It arrived packaged very well and set up was super easy, only taking about 10 min. The color is a soft teal/aqua and is not overpowering. The fabric is a nice thick woven material. It is not super soft but is comfortable and for its purpose as extra seating in a guest bedroom it works very well and doesn't look cheap.", 
    "The color is beautiful and it is a very comfortable chair. When it arrived, we just had to install the legs, which was very easy. I would recommend this chair!", 
    "I have never gotten so many compliments on a piece of furniture. And friends and family of all ages talk about how much they love this chair. It is comfortable. I added a throw pillow which makes it even more comfortable. It is also sleek and doesn't take up too much room for how comfortable it is. Color is exactly as pictured. You won't be disappointed. Easy to assemble the legs too!", 
    "They are even better in person. They really brought our office together.", 
    "sturdy, easy to put together, great price for extra seating, color true to picture.", 
    "I'm very satisfied with this product. Good quality, fast shipping!", 
    "This is a beautiful chair with the seat and seat back fully one seamless piece. The legs were very easy to attach. I wouldn't consider it a comfy chair to settle in and binge-watch TV or movies, or read a book. But its wide seat makes it a nice guest chair in a living space, office or bedroom. That it's armless means it takes less room and fits just about anywhere. A low-profile horizontal grey pillow sets it off nicely.", 
    "I'm only rating this a 4 because I haven't had a chance to use it yet. It seems stable and is comfortable, but it could use a little more padding in the seat area. Matches great with my other furniture. Legs very easy to assemble.", 
    "The chair was easy to assemble, comfortable, and the color is even more vibrant than in the picture!", 
    "These chairs (we bought 2) look super in our mid-century house as a fun splash of color. Comfortable.", 
    "Understandably, it is very difficult to identify colors on a website. This chair is very, very blue. I was disappointed in the workmanship. The back and the seat are one single cushion, with a row of stitching where they meet at the seat. I believe it lessens the quality of the chair. I do appreciate the easy return process.", 
    "Nice wide comfortable chair. Fun color and style.", 
    "This is a cute chair and it goes with my living room set well. When I got this chair, one of the legs did not want to screw in...the grooves did not line up very well. Decent construction but has a little wobbliness to it. Fine for me (single female under 150 pounds). However, I would not recommend for a family or heavy usage.", 
    "This is a bright aqua chair ideal for a smaller person like myself. It has an angled back for relaxing and doesn't take up too much space. I have the:Eff Aqua/ Teal/ Silver Faux Silk Taffeta Iridescence Curtain Panel and they match perfectly. My couch is a medium grey. I couldn't be happier", 
    "I love everything about this chair! I bought it for its looks, but was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it is. Easy to put together.", 
    "The color is as pictured- teal. The back is angled back, not straight up. It's not as comfortable leaning back. have to hold your head up to be comfortable. It leans back too far. But very decorative. We bought two.", 
    "The style of these chairs is really nice and the color is true to the photo. They are also comfortable to sit in. However, they are not very high quality (to be expected for the price), and I'm not sure how durable they will be. We plan to use them rather lightly, so hopefully they will be okay. Overall, I am glad we ordered them.", 
    "Great chair for my bedroom corner! Love the color and pretty comfortable!", 
    "For the price this chair isn't bad, but there are other better options in this price range. However, if you are looking for color, than this care is a good purchase. It is just really squishy in the seat. Like it has been sat in A LOT.", 
    "Great looking but not made for long term use. Maybe a bit over priced for the quality.", 
    "Bought two for living room. Surfy, comfortable. Color of fabric is not the same one is a little lighter.", 
    "I purchased 2 chairs - one is wobbly and the buttons are loose, the other is more solid and the buttons are tight. Inconsistent quality. Also the chairs are super light and feel like they might not hold up well over the long run. But they sure do look nice!", 
    "Very pleased with the 2 aqua chairs I ordered. They are exactly as pictured and easy to assemble (have to attach legs). I will only use them for extra seating when I have a larger number of guests, so comfort is not that important to me, but they are actually fairly comfortable, too. Free shipping was only 2 days and the instructions were very clear. Inexpensive compared to other options available.", 
    "This is a nice addition to our entry way. It is a sleek, attractive, easy-to-assemble chair. Exactly what we were looking for.", 
    "Got this on sale and I really like it.", 
    "She loved it...fits in perfectly with her new couch.", 
    "I needed something at my store that was stylish, large enough for men to sit in and sturdy! It fit my criteria and I will probably be sending many people overstocks way.", 
    "We just got these for our living room, our style is a mid century..industrial mix. I wanted two chairs to complement the smaller couch we just bought. The kids are all gone now, so I didn't want or need the big cushy lounging style furniture any more. These fit in great. Not to big..very comfortable for extra seating.. You can sit cross legged in them..a big perk for me and not be cramped. The color is spot on. And they assembled easily. The fabric texture is great. Not a everyday lounging chair, but that isn't what I wanted. Would fit in well in an office or bedroom also. My only thought on them is pay attention to the chair height..they aren't tall... the back comes up to just under the window sill edge at my house. That may be a little low for some.", 
    "This chair is even prettier than the picture. It makes me happy to look at it. It may be smaller in scale than you are used to with contemporary furniture but I think its style is a breath of fresh area. Not sure yet how it will hold up yet.", 
    "This is a great chair, especially for the money. The color is true to the picture and it is built pretty well. Unlike some of the comments, I had NO trouble putting it together and everything lined up right. I was missing one washer though. It was stable and comfy! Not too low and not too firm! Its the perfect addition to my living room.", 
    "The chair is super easy to put together which I did within 30 minutes. The style is simple and chic. The fabric feels lush and the seat is wide, looks great in my newly re-done master bedroom.", 
    "Just what I need for my living room. The color is perfect and it's so easy to put together.", 
    "The chair is beautiful. The color is exactly as shown and it was very easy to assemble. It is the perfect accent chair for our office.", 
    "This chair is so fabulous. I love its mid-century vibe and the color is beautiful--more of a brighter blue than shown. It is comfy too. I loved it so much, I just ordered another one!", 
    "Niice and comfy, not bad for the price, I have gotten many compliments on the chair. I use it for business use , when talking to a client"
