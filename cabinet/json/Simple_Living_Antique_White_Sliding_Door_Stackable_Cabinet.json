    "I love these shelves. I had a difficult space situation on the sides of my fireplace. The living room is quite dark and small, and needed storage without it looking like a workaround or taking too much space (depth). I took a bit of a risk stacking four of those all the way up to the ceiling. They look terrific. I combined these and the acrylic door options 2+2 on each side of the fireplace, and they turned out fantastic. Look like custom built furniture without breaking a bank. I didn't have any of the issues with unmatched pre-drilled holes between wood door and acrylic door cabinets - they are all done by the same template. Same about color matching - they are perfectly matched. Cabinets are very easy to put together with just a Phillips screwdriver. I like that all parts are painted on all sides, regardless of which way they face, all edges are coated. Also I liked the packaging, all corners and sides were well protected, and corners reinforced. One of the boxes came dented on one side, and I had concerns about the contents, but everything looked great inside. Acrylic panels look very much like glass, I see no difference at all. Also wanted to comment about shipping -- it was fast. I mean, it's free and shipped within 4 business days, even came one day ahead of projected schedule. This is my third major purchase with this company, and I have nothing but good words to say about the whole experience. I do recommend this product without hesitation.", 
    "Please NOTE* The sides on this are open. Those slats have nothing over them, anything can crawl in and dust can get in so don't think about storing boxed groceries here unless you have a solution to cover the openings on both sides. The shelves are not wide enough for large fry pans or cookie sheets so there is minimal numbers of items you can put in here. All in all, except for the sides being open on a cabinet that you want to keep clean, it's a decent product.", 
    "I bought this as a shoe cabinet and it serves the purpose. If you have very large feet this cabinet will not hold very many pairs of shoes, but if you are a size 8 or lower it will do just fine. The assembly was super-easy (once I went online and figured out how a bolt nut should fit :)). The directions were clear. All the various screws/nuts were clearly labeled. All the parts were in good condition. Minor problem--I was missing two screws that would have held a center leg but managed to find spares in the tool box. The shipping was quick and delivery was on time. I have had patchy experiences with Fedex but this time the person who delivered the item was extremely polite and efficient. Overall I am very pleased with the look and ease of assembly (I was worried about the sliding doors not working well but they fit in just right).", 
    "We bought 2 shelves to stack in our kitchen. So far has worked out as advertised. Materials are not super sturdy but about what you would expect for this price point. Works well for storing random kitchen accessories. Doors are easy to open and close. Assembly was actually pretty easy although the back panel for one didn't fit right so we just left it off. Shelves look really nice and so far the paint has not scratched.", 
    "I bought three of these, one with solid doors two with glass. The glass is acrylic and looks ok. They were simple enough to build. It does what I need it to do. Not bad for the price. I wish the screws had covers. I would make it look less kit built.", 
    "I ordered this to hold my cookbooks and a second one (clear doors) to stack on top to hold my tasting dishes. They are perfect. I also wanted them because I thought they would match my white cabinets. Although they didn't match, the day was saved because they matched the chairs to my new (must have) kitchen set. Even if they did not match the chairs, I still would have kept the product. I searched everywhere for these cabinets! I rated them a four because of the color (looks more white online than what it actual is).", 
    "I ordered the product on Monday received it Friday and was using it on Saturday. It was exactly what I needed for a small kitchen The quality was good and I am very pleased with the product and service I received", 
    "Good looking piece of furniture and it suits my needs but you get what you pay for--the console is wobbly and if you put anything heavier than the 3 wicker baskets they show in the picture the top sags and prevents the doors from closing.", 
    "This was easy to put together per my husband and we had two of them. The only problem is that the picture does not show that it really has 2 doors and the whole front is closed off, also the pieces had some chips in them.", 
    "for the price the quality of the product is good. I do dislike that the screws can be seen BUT I just headed to the local hardware store for screw head covers VIOLA! it looks professional.. looks great in my kitchen.", 
    "There is no issue with functionality and the easiness of assembly. The biggest problem with this cabinet is the smell of chemical adhesives, probably fume of formaldehyde. Sitting near it for 30 min gives me headaches. Not sure Overstocks.com check for the product for safety issues. Definitely not recommended for those with young kids or elderly at home.", 
    "We bought two of these to use in our pantry - and they look good, work well, and were fairly easy to put together.", 
    "Thumbs down on this one. The smell is so strong from the paint finish I couldn't keep it in the room. On the aesthetic side, the screws that hold the ends on are completely exposed, which detracted from the sleek lines.", 
    "Not a bad buy but not a heavy duty cabinet....... you get what you pay for. This will do until I can afford to buy a real wood cabinet.", 
    "I was very pleased with how easy these cabinets were to put together. I purchased 2 of them to stack. They were very easy to assemble and I like them very much. I am using them in my laundry room/kitchen for additional storage. Very nice!!", 
    "pay close attention to the height and width on this product. i was so focused on the space that i wanted to put my cabinet that i didn't even look at how tall it will be. i was shocked at how short it is. still an ok product.", 
    "I purchased 2 of these for a vacation rental house, stacking them on top of each other. They were the perfect size for the location and are holding up very well after a year of rental use.", 
    "I found it too short for what I needed", 
    "easy to put together (I'm 71yo/did it myself)/fits perfectly in kitchen", 
    "It will work for staging. don't think it would last very long if I had people getting things in and out every day. made of cheap material and difficult to put together", 
    "Has added storage and good looks to the kitchen area ... Has enabled me to keep some small appliances I was contemplating donating because of lack of space. Will probably purchase a second one.", 
    "Limited space in a small kitchen, only had about 15\" for vertical storage. Purchased 2 & stacked them. Very easy to assemble and secure stack & attached too!", 
    "Great item to stack with other stackables. They work great together look great!", 
    "I used this for storage space I love it", 
    "Great cabinet just not very big I would recommend getting a set of 2 or 3", 
    "This would be great for a midget or for a child's room for toys!!!", 
    "Doors stick and do not move smoothly. Shakes items on top", 
    "I bought this as the bottom modual for the one with the see thru doors. I put my casserole collection in the top one and this one holds cook books and other pans. These doors do not slide easily when the top one is full. guess it doesn't like the weight.", 
    "Putting this together was a cinch. It says you need 2 people but I did it myself in about 30 minutes (while watching tv). Looks great and very nice. My only \"but\" is that it chipped easily as I moved it to put it where I wanted it. I'm not even sure how or where but showed me that it's basically cheap plywood. Either way, for what I paid, def worth it! Now I have liquor storage ;0)", 
    "We removed the legs, and attached brackets to hang it on the wall above the washer and dryer. It works perfectly for storing laundry supplies.", 
    "My mom ordered and I must say it is perfect in a tight kitchen in an older house. Adds storage and frees counter space without overbearing the space. Light enough to move and clean around. Versatile because its part of the stackable models. Great buy", 
    "had to return as too hard to put together", 
    "sliding door continues to fall off.", 
    "I bought two sets of these for my soap shop for displays. looks and works well.", 
    "This is an excellent product! Looks great, and I love that you can buy additional peices to stack to make a taller cabinet if necessary.", 
    "Purchased to use as a TV stand. Not quite the quality I had hoped for, but easy to put together and looks great in the room.", 
    "Yet another great purchase choice from Overstock. This is the third piece of furniture that I have purchased for 3 different rooms in my home.It is very sturdy, and fits perfectly, thanks to the dimensions that were given for this product. I was concerned with the \"white\" that is described, but like the other pieces, the antique white is what I would describe as light ivory, or light cream. I did use the feature that enables the buyer to ask questions about the product, and they were great as well. I love doing all of my shopping with Overstock.", 
    "This cabinet is cheaply made and not very big at all. I did the measurements of what it states it is before I purchased and when it arrived it was smaller. I was looking to use it as a linen cabinet and this was just too short on functional space and made of very cheap materials.", 
    "We use the inside as storage for pet food and other pet supplies, and the top for cookbook display. Don't remember having any issues with install. Great storage solution.", 
    "They are very well put together. I just wish they were wideer", 
    "This cabinet fits perfectly on top of my refrigerator yet blends into the wall so I have a place to store my appliances that hides their clutter when not in use.", 
    "I bought two of these, one with glass doors and one with the wooden doors. They are very nice looking. However, when you stack them, if you put much of anything in the top one, the bottom cupboard becomes very hard to open. Also, the product is not closed at the ends, so dust gets in. Still, I am glad I bought them.", 
    "I love this. It is smaller than expected when only one is purchased and they are not stacked, but it's a great value and good looking unit.", 
    "A little unsturdy, but all in all was perfect for what I needed", 
    "These are tiny. Like a long nightstand tiny. But went together easily and are good quality. They look nice in my office, just a lot smaller than I planned for...", 
    "Perfect for holding snacks in my kitchen, love it and recommend to anyone!", 
    "I put this together by myself in less than an hour. I really like this cabinet. It was exactly what I needed.", 
    "I used this cabinet as the base and the glass door cabinet on top of this. I really like these. They do not look cheap (even though they were) and the size is perfect for my small kitchen. I use them to house small appliances that I don't use every day, paper products, and cat food.", 
    "Nice for the price, but small and ends open.", 
    "Nice looking. Easy to assemble. Only minor complaint is the shelves are not very deep.", 
    "The item was scratched up and a corner was dented. The top will not stay on securely...you will lots of wood glue. Disappointed.", 
    "The unit was pretty easy to put together and looks great. the only problem is that it looks like it should belong in a toddlers play kitchen... Definitely my bad that i didn't measure the wall and pay close enough attention to the actual dimensions of the unit but now that it's put together I don't feel it's worth dismantling and returning it. It basically comes up to the middle of my thigh and I'm 5'4'' and i was hoping for something that was a bit more substantial. it's also not very wide either. Even if i were to get the second stacking shelf to go on top I don't think it'd be worth it. I've learned my lesson and will be measuring and re-measuring before any furniture purchase no matter how good the deal seems. You get what you pay for here. good for a small apartment i guess...", 
    "Nice but has a chemical smell.", 
    "This arrived in perfect shape and my son put both of them together for me in less than 90 minutes. We used a bit of silicon spray to get the doors to slide easily. The color isn't true stark white. Its more of \"eggshell\" in color which fit in well with my color theme. I live in a small beach cottage (1K sq ft) so space is at a premium in my equally tiny kitchen & dining room. I needed a place for my cookbooks, canisters, cooking/baking odds and ends that I use frequently. I bought both this cabinet and the cabinet that fits on top with the glass doors. It fits perfectly in the space I had designated for it and I hung a wine glass rack over it from the ceiling. I put cookbooks on the ends of the shelves and that keeps out the dust, etc. I get all kinds of compliments on it and am very happy that I bought it.", 
    "We purchased 2 of these cabinets for our kitchen (due to limited cabinet space). Both were delivered as promised and easy to assemble - stacked the cabinets to create one tall cabinet. Looks great in the kitchen - everyone has complimented how well they fit and look. Solid/sturdy structure and build; doors slide well without sticking (which was my worry when stacking). When we move in a few years, we're planning to paint the cabinet and use as a china cabinet instead of a pantry.", 
    "I picked this up for my spare/sewing room. Came really quick, well packed, although the directions were lacking I put it together fairly easy. It looks nice, just the right size to store books, baskets, and sewing items. Live it", 
    "I would give this 5 stars but the 4 back rail screws wouldn't hold. Not the end of the world because we are using them as pictured. We are very happy with the look of the cabinet. They were easy to put together too.", 
    "Can't believe that they allow it to stack. With 50 lbs per shelf...imagine adding 4 of these on top of one another as a customer has done. It's very unstable and not even good enough to use for firewood. The smell is really bad.", 
    "Needed extra storage in kitchen. Bought 2 of these and they are very nice. Hold alot of my mixing bowls and platters.", 
    "I bought this at a great price - less than *** - to put in my daughter's room for her books and toys. For the price, it is a great value. I wish the instructions were a little clearer. I read reviews saying the same and was very careful with assembly. As far as odor... unless you are super sensitive to smell, it is not overpowering. The color is more of an antique white (like Pottery Barn) than pure white. I would recommend.", 
    "The cabinet is made better than we thought for the price. I am using it in the kitchen area for extra things. Color is nice. Not disappointed.", 
    "This cabinet is easy to assemble and best of all is stackable. I bought three cabinets to stack in my mall dining room and they look great. The off whit is perfect against my dark dining table & chairs. The only drawback would be that the sides are open.", 
    "Looks great, decent quality, for the price I have absolutely 0 complaints.", 
    "Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this purchase. It is real wood and looks quite nice put together. It took a LONG time to assemble - lots of parts, but in the end it was worth it!. It is very small - too small for a hallway entrance piece in our home - but it is well made so we found other use for it!", 
    "I am very pleased with this product. I decided to get this item in particular because it is stackable. I wanted to try it out first before getting a second one. The directions, I'll admit, are not the best but at least all the pieces were numbered/labeled. It does have a dinky back piece but it is held on with screws, not nails and the holes are already there. DO NOT USE A DRILL!!!!! It is a little work, but I used a regular screwdriver and had no problems although the wood did split in one place so be careful. Overall, a great product. Will be getting a second one soon.", 
    "I don't recommend this product, Very cheap looking product, I guess you pay for what you get!", 
    "The cabinet was not difficult to put together. Only took me about 30 minutes. It appears to be more expensive than the price I paid. I was especially pleased with the sliding doors and how easy they slide. I have been looking in all the furniture stores and they offered nothing like this sharp looking cabinet.", 
    "Since the assembling of this item, it has been a beautiful addition to my dinining room, however, the process to getting here was unbelievable. Like previous storage items that I purchased (all of these items were pruchased on the same day), the assembly requried the purchase of additional nails, screws, nuts and bolts, because the original that came with the product would not hold the item together. I am hoping to get at least one to two more use out of this item before having to throw it out. I will NEVER purchase storage pieces or furniture from Overstock again.", 
    "This is the perfect cabinet for under the window in my kitchen. It's not large but I measured carefully so I knew the height and width. However, it says 13\" deep but the sliding door tracks take about 1.5\" inches. It won't hold my larger serving platters but I have plenty that needs storage. My boyfriend is a great handyman, so it's sturdy and doors are secure. I really recommend it. Cute and I love the ivory color.", 
    "i looove this cabinet. the doors slide sooo easily and the color is perfect. it holds and hides a large amount of STUFF lol the price is really good and if i had the room i would buy another one. it's very classy looking.", 
    "We got a great pantry system for $***, and we've added lots of storage to the kitchen in a stylish and space saving way. A few things about the cabinet: Assembly is a bit tricky as the directions aren't super clear. We purchased three units to stack on top of each other and ended up having to disassemble the first one because the directions didn't clearly mark front/back pieces. Once we did the first, however, the next two were easy to put together. Other thing is what previous reviews have said--the sides aren't closed, so your items inside will be seen from the side. We put poster board inserts along the side and painted them to match to give it a finished look, but be aware that the side is open. Overall, though, we are very happy with our purchase and would recommend it!", 
    "Really good quality. Surprisingly sturdy. A bit confusing to put together, but that may have been user error. I was able to construct it on my own with not too much of an issue.", 
    "Difficult to assemble and had to be reinforced with longer screws to hold the shelf inside. So many small pieces...we did it, but it was achallenge. Looks nice when done, though. For roughly $100 bucks, not bad.", 
    "EASY ASSEMBLY WITH ADEQUATE STORAGE SPACE; SLIDERS WORK WELL; SHELF NOT AS STABLE AS I WOULD LIKE BUT WORKABLE", 
    "VERY NICE LOVE IT VERSITILE MANY USES IN DIFFERENT ROOM", 
    "While I'm keeping it, the inside shelf doesn't attach to anything making it almost worthless and a little dangerous. It was easy to assemble and is attractive but the issue with the inside shelf is a big one. If there were even notches in it to set on to the supports, that would help greatly but for now, it slides too easily.", 
    "When I received this, it was dented in a couple of places and the packaging was very shoddy. It wasn't very easy to put together, and is rather rickety. It was too low for what I needed it for. I would have returned it but it was too much of a hassle to take apart and repack. I gave it to my daughter and the screws were falling out while being carried. And the sliding doors didn't line up and move very well. Disappointed in the quality. Not worth the price I paid. Would not recommend to a friend.", 
    "I love it! Easily stores everything I need in one classy looking place. Highly recommended.", 
    "Product arrived damaged and cannot support the weight of a small microwave. The drawers won't slide if there is the slightes weight on the surface.", 
    "I purchased two of these unit and stacked together. Assemble yeas a little tricky for me. I will be purchasing several more of these units as I love them. The colour I found leans more towards a very light buttery yellow tone.", 
    "It fits perfectly on the wall of my kitchen and has given me extra storage!! I just wish the sides were not open. My son has fixed this with some white boards from the hardware store", 
    "I love this versatile stackable storage cabinet! I bought two and I did not stack them but feel I could if I decide to later. They were relatively easy for my husband to assemble. I have placed them in our kitchen flanking our kitchen table and chairs. They provide much needed storage and keep mail and clutter off the table. I am in love with this off-white cabinet which provides brightness against a dark wall, and I highly recommend it if additional storage is a need for you!!!", 
    "This piece of furniture is not worth the low price! The thin backboard is the support for the three other sides which is apparently why there are 24 screws included for attachment. Please do not attempt to move the cabinet by touching the top because the doors will fall right off! Very flimsy, poorly constructed, no paint in the door slides and worthless connecting pins for the heavy shelf. I do not recommend this product.", 
    "excellent product ,delivery and service.Would certainly recommend to any one", 
    "I absolutely love the design of this cabinet, but it was a lot smaller than expected. I had to but a second cabinet to make it taller due to the height of it. Also be careful when putting the cabinet together to not put the cabinet together backwards. I have bought plenty of furniture from *** in the past, and the assembly is similar to that but seems to be sturdier.", 
    "The cabinet was easy to assemble and looks good. We didnt put in the middle shelf because I wanted to store larger items.", 
    "Having purchased other cabinets and shelves from O, I am disappointed in the flimsy structure of this cabinet. I wouldn't put anything heavy on the interior shelf and it's smaller than it seems in the picture. Still I kept it because it fits under my double window nicely and I will put plants on it as they come in for the winter. It IS attractive.", 
    "This is a tiny piece of furniture, but it looks nice and has a nice style. I gave it a 3 because when I put it together the holes did not match and I had to get out the drill which did not make me too happy.", 
    "very easy to put together, fit exactly in space we needed and provides a lot of space, only complaint was that one of the little legs wouldn't stay screwed in so I just sat it on that leg and haven't had any problems since", 
    "Keep in mind this is particle board- not real wood so it is easily damaged. But it came shipped in decent condition- minimal scratches. It is easy put together- I did it by myself in about an hour but I was easily distracted by other things :-)....HOWEVER I ordered two of these- one with the see through front and one with the wood panels and I received two of the see through plastic doors. I still like it and just plan on buying the frosted stuff to put on it for privacy to hide my mess- but I wish I got what I ordered so I don't have to make a special trip to get more supplies. Also- this doesn't bother me since I am not putting anything valuable in them, but the sides are open so dust and things can easily get in. This can be fixed to thin plastic/glass but it is something to consider", 
    "Got it together on my own in under an hour. It fits perfectly in our living room, giving us storage without a lot of bulk. The instructions were easy to follow and everything fit together perfectly with the pre drilled holes.", 
    "a wonderful extra storage area. It is a great asset to the kitchen/dining rtea", 
    "Took me 45 min to assemble by myself No issues I may paint and antique it myself", 
    "Love love love these... got three and they are stacked in my bathroom for extra storage in a nook area. They fit perfectly in the space and they are great because the glass doors make it easy to see what is in there and if I need to replenish something.", 
    "We bought this with the other stackable piece that goes with it. It was a bit of a pain to put together but my husband managed (though he's not particularly) \"handy\" and the two pieces look good. People who have entered our new apt. comment on it and if they don't look two close think its actually a nice piece. I would recommend it if you don't mind spending a couple of hours putting it together. The shelves are very narrow but good for holding glassware etc.", 
    "The unit is exactly how the product was described. However, the quality was much better then I thought it would be for the price. It was easy to put together and looks great! I would recommend this product, and may purchase additional units! However, it would be nice if maybe had an option for additional colors or just a plain wood grain.", 
    "I LOVE these cabinets! I purchased two (one w/ solid doors and one w/ clear acrylic) and stacked them to increase the storage in my small kitchen. The one with solid doors works great on the bottom for storage and the clear acrylic works fantastic as a display cabinet for glassware on top. I definitely recommend! I shopped around for ages looking for good-quality display cabinets and was very pleased with these. As long as you don't expect too much, this is a quality product for the price. I have since purchased another with solid doors as a TV bench--holds so many DVDs and keeps everything out of view so my living room looks nice and neat. Great buy!", 
    "I bought two of these along with their counterparts with solid doors for my kitchen. I live in a small apartment with very few cupboards. The color matches the ones in my apartment and all the clutter is now gone! I am very happy!", 
    "this product I would recommend to anyone. It was really easy to put together and works really well as a stackable item. Nice accent to store those items in the kitchen when you don't have a lot of storage room. the white goes well with all decor.", 
    "This product has a very reasonable price which is what I was looking to spend. So you can't expect the highest quality. But it doesn't look shabby or cheap. It's neat and cute. My only complaint is that the manual had the worst directions ever for putting this thing together. I prefer manuals that combine pictures with words giving you directions. Also these directions did not give any warnings about how to orient the pieces to prevent you from putting pieces on backwards or upside-down. So what ended up happening, after I had put most of it together, the adjustable shelf wouldn't sit properly. Only then did I realize that in step 1 I had put the side panel on upside-down so the holes did not line up! This was rather frustrating because if I flip it now, there will be holes left from the nails I used to put on the back panel showing on the front! So be careful when putting this thing together.", 
    "The only problem I have is there are no instructions", 
    "I really like the way this came together, I needed just a little more storage in my kitchen/dining room and this works perfect. It isn't the strongest thing but it is steady. I am thinking about getting another one to stack on top of it.", 
    "It was a little smaller than what I thought it would be. I got it for my kitchen but I'm using it as a TV stand instead. Holds all my dvd's and cd's so over all it served another purpose well.", 
    "I love these cabinets. My only issue is that it claimed that it could be mixed and matched with the acrylic sliding door version, but when we put it together we found that the holes weren't drilled in the same locations in the acrylic door version of the cabinet I also bought so we had to screw them together ourselves (instead of having it attached by the dowels that we were supposed to be able to use). Other than that, the cabinets are working great and they look beautiful in my kitchen!", 
    "The picture is deceiving. The product is 2 ft tall. No one outs a picture frame that low on the wall. I was hoping for something taller. Costs 50 to send back so we kept it.", 
    "Easy to put together, nice feet on it, not too heavy, but doesn't look like a high quality piece of furniture, but it is fun. Good storage that I needed. Useful.", 
    "It arrived quickly, was easy to assemble with picture instructions. Its the perfect size to hold all of our specialty glasses for wine, martini, etc.", 
    "I was very pleased with this cabinet and would recommend it to all my friends.", 
    "I bought 2 cabinets that I stacked on top of each other and i really like the look. they're acting as a pantry/storage in our new aparement, since we've downgraded on space. they seem sturdy and durable, but look very nice.", 
    "This product is great. The size was just right for the space. The doors slide easily and looks very nice with other decorative pieces. I would suggest a more size and color variety since I could use another in a different location in a tanish color and longer up to 60\". I would recommend this product.", 
    "Very happy with these 3 stacked... Buying another set of 3 to stack..", 
    "I had been looking for some buffet or sideboard in white for a long time. This one worked out fine for me, there are two things I don't like, one, it will be nice if it were a little higher for what I wanted it , the other, the sides are open which means I'm going to be dusting quite often. In general it fit fine in my little dinning room, my china looks great inside. I love 2 things, the price and the ''child proof'' sliding door. I have 5 grandchildren.", 
    "Purchased the item before, was not sure if it would work, seemed taller in picture. After assembling it, it look fantastic in my kitchen. So well we purchased another one. You will not be disappointed if your looking to save space.", 
    "Fairly easy to put together. Everything fit and it looks good. Exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "The color and size of the product were fine. I wasn't expecting something spectacular, but I was hoping that it'd be usable at best. I wanted something functional. The shelf inside is too narrow so it doesn't stay in place. The back of the product did not fit within the space allotted so some adjustments had to be made on my end to make it work. It would have been an issue had the shelf been used, but since I decided to opt out of the shelf, it worked fine. When buying a product, I at least expect all of its parts to be used properly. Oh well, it will do.", 
    "I have a very small pantry and this cabinet fits very well in that space. It's a good fit for my needs.", 
    "Easy to put together and is excellent for narrow space. great additional storage for my kitchen.", 
    "Putting things like this together generally drives me crazy, I was happily surprised when it went together in a snap...only using my trusty screw driver & referring to the minimalist instruction guide. I was apprehensive about 'how' sturdy it would be, yet, upon completion it seems like it will hold up. Have had it up for a little over a week and it seems to be fine. The only other concern I have is I stacked another one on top but, there was not an option to secure the two together or at least it is not clear in the instruction booklet nor is it obvious when trying to figure it out on my own. The number of hardware pieces were appropriate and nothing seemed to be missing or lacking. The packaging was tight and secure so nothing was damaged and delivery was prompt.", 
    "This is an excellent product. We actually have 2 with the sliding solid door and one with the glass door and have them all stacked and they work great. Exactly what we were hoping for!", 
    "I was looking to organize clutter in my bedroom. This product was easy to assemble (took 30 minutes) well designed, and the measurements were spot on.
