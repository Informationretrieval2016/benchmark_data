    "I love the design, it's simple. Might be a little small as other reviews stated but it's fine for me. Table was chipped in transit but overtock takes care of the issue fast and professional that makes me feel comfortable of continuing order furniture on line.", 
    "This table is very sturdy and nice. The only thing is that wet spots such as from a cup that is wet, will not go away and permanently stains the table.", 
    "This is a great quality, perfect size, sturdy dining table! The color is perfect!", 
    "Great table, easy assembly, matches well with the chairs I purchased too.Would have been nice to have some variety in the veneer layout, it's too repeating and thus looks a bit cheap", 
    "Very nice table well made and easy to assemble. Love it!", 
    "The table is beautiful ans as described. It was slightly damaged during shipping but Overstock.com customer service was a pleasure to work with to resolve the issue.", 
    "Smaller than I expected, so make sure to look at the dimensions, otherwise, great mid-century Danish look. Quality is good.", 
    "Perfect table for 4 chairs- looks exactly like the photo. Mine was , however damaged but they sent me another right away. Great customer service!", 
    "The reason I give it 2 star is because it arrived broken on two sides on the top part of the table, and you could tell that the quality of materials was poor (besides the obvious issues with the packing needed to protect the product). In a previous review I read that someone had the same problem TWICE. The table is otherwise gorgeous. Beautiful design , great size and color. It's unfortunate. I returned it.", 
    "First of all I give it three stars because unfortunately this is the second one of these tables that I have ordered and they both were damaged in the exact same spot due to insufficient packing. I reported it to Overstock and hopefully they can add more packing to the bottom of the box since the table worked it's way through the styrofoam and is dented on the edge. If not for that I would give this 5 SATRS... really great table in look and design...."
