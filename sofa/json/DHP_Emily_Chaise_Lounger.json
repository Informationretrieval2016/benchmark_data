    "I love this chaise! It is perfect for my office! I wasn't crazy about the chrome legs, so my husband attached wooden legs from Home Depot and it looks great! Very nice for the price!", 
    "I haven't found anything wrong with this Chaise Lounger as of yet and I've had it at least half a year. It's not really good for over-night sleeping and it's not really meant for that. Doesn't take up much space and it's great for naps..", 
    "We ordered 2 of these to use in our camper to replace the platform bed. They are exactly what we were looking for. They were delivered much quicker than anticipated and in great shape when they arrived. The quality is also better than I anticipated for the price!", 
    "I purchased this for a corner by the fireplace, opposite a mid-century chair. The chaise looks nice and the comfort level is decent. No, it's not super cushy, but I wouldn't expert that from any modern, faux leather furniture. By adding a small pillow and a plush throw, it's cozy enough. I expect the cushions will soften a little over time, but can't verify this because we've only used it a short while. The 'leather' is a matte finish and looks fine. However, be aware - the chaise is designed to hook onto a matching futon - so there are velcro straps underneath (which you can roll up to mostly disguise) and a section on the lower sides that is not fully finished, has black fabric instead of the leather. On the black chaise, this isn't glaringly obvious, but on the off white version, it could be. Be sure to zoom in on the photos and check this out, so you know what to expect. Easy to recline, pretty easy to assemble. Construction seems sturdy and front legs are substantial. Being low to the ground, it's easy for a child or pet to join you for a little lounge. Overall, would recommend so long as one is aware of the limitations.", 
    "Nicer than it was described", 
    "The price is great. The shipment was good. The chaise lounger was easy to put together. I only had this chaise lounger for a few week. So far its okay.", 
    "This chaise is a bargain. Easy to assemble the legs, very comfortable. Some of the seams are a little rough, but for the price, it's terrific."
