    "It's better in person than in the pictures. It looks beautiful is firm but comfortable and very easy to assemble and change positions. Definitely happy with the purchase!", 
    "This is very low to the ground and super cheaply made. Not worth $600. After seeing it in person I wouldn't pay more than $250."
