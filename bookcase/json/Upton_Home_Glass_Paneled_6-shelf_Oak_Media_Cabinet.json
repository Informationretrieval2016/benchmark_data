    "OK, so I guess you can't expect too much for less than $200 these days, but this made-in-Chine (surprise) \"solid birch\" cabinet is actually made of fragile particle board with a cardboard back. The first of the white-metal cam-locks that hold the thing together broke when I tried to install it, and it comes with no extras. The wooden parts had various dents and dings in them, and I would have sent it all back if it weren't just too much trouble to do so. The paper-thin veneer trim on the face of the glass doors is actually split all the way through in one place and would not have passed any self-respecting inspector in a U.S. factory, I suspect. Upon assembly, which is a bit of a pain with vague instructions, the fit and finish is poor, with doors that don't line up and one that scrapes the top of the cabinet. Cheap screws strip easily and pucker the particle board when pre-drilled holes don't line up with hardware, etc. You get what you pay for, but if you want to buy something this junky, go to Wal-Mart or Kmart and see in person what you are buying before you fork over the cash. BTW, I bought another media cabinet from Overstock a while back for twice the price, and the shelves are already sagging badly from the (not much) weight of some DVDs. Thought before ordering this that maybe I'd just picked out a bad product that time and the \"solid birch\" would be better, but I thought wrong. -- MQ", 
    "Not happy with it. Doesnt look how I wanted and isnt the greatest of quality. Wont buy here again.", 
    "The instructions were very difficult to follow; the pictures were not in connection with the step-by-step instructions. Also once assembled it\u00bfs wobbly, if you have small children it should be anchored to the wall.", 
    "This is a really pretty piece, the first piece of furniture we've ever bought online. We had some issue with a damaged door but Overstock's customer service department took care of it right away. We found it very easy to put together, took us just under an hour. We regret not purchasing a second!", 
    "I bought two of these to hold our massive dvd collection. They both worked. Little darker finish then I was hoping for but overall I am happy with them. No missing parts. Extras included for both sets. Finish throughout was consistent and no marks were made during shipment. Easy to essemble and mount to the wall so our toddler can't tip them over. Only thing I wish it had was a hinge lock on the outside instead of pull knobs for the door. Kids can get into them easily.", 
    "When the cabinet arrived, many pieces looked used. There were wear spots on the shelves. Four pieces of hardware were missing from the packaging. Overstock customer support told me it would be another week until they could deliver new hardware. Two of the other pieces were defective -- one camlock broke as we tried to use it and one of the screws had no threads. This cabinet did not seem to go through any quality control. This cabinet is definitely NOT worth the money.", 
    "Okay for an inexpensive media cabinet, but the quality is a little below average. Not too difficult to assemble if you have some mechanical abilities. The back panel is supplied in two pieces with a piece of tape holding them together from the back side. This aids in packaging the unit into a smaller envelope size, but takes away from the structural integrity of the unit while the back panel is screwed to the back of the unit . I would recommend placing two steel straps on the back from corner to corner to help with this design weakness, or a couple of flat metal brackets to hold the two back panel pieces together and attached to the back of the shelves. The oak laminate is very thin, too thin, and I can already see the laminate peeling off from some of the edges along the front of the unit. Don't try to move the unit after it is filled with DVD's as you may experience a structural failure. Lastly, one of the doors appeared to have been warped so I received a replacement from the seller. It turns out that the predrilled holes for the hinges were not drilled square with the door as the replacement exhibited the same problem. Now I have to try and figure out how to make it square. From far away, the cabinet looks attractive enough, though it does appear to be darker than the picture on Overstock's website. It's worth the money even though I have had to work through some of these annoyances.", 
    "This media cabinet is a little difficult to assemble, but it is really a nice cabinet for the price. It's darker than I thought, but goes fine with the rest of my furniture. I would recommend this if you are looking for something simple to store your cd's and/or DVD's.", 
    "It looks nice, but not as sturdy as I expected. I did not see any mention of the fact that the cabinet must be anchored to a wall (preferably with one anchor in a stud) in the product description. This is essential information dependind on where you want to place it.", 
    "I was so excited when I got this product; shipping was super fast......and then I opened it. The instructions were overly wordy as well as confusing, the diagrams two pages away from pertinent directions (if any at all were available), and the veneer was damaged in several locations. It took a total of four hours to assemble this piece, and that's after remembering my drill about an hour and a half into the ordeal! Holes were missing, or in the wrong place. Several pieces weren't even mentioned in the directions, though they were shown in diagrams... And once I was finally finished putting the silly thing together, I discovered that there was absolutely no way I could have it on carpeted floors without anchoring it to the wall! To make matters worse, the screws provided to anchor it into the wall didn't fit the anchors!! I got nearly to the point of tears out of sheer frustration.Finished, if you overlook the dings and scuffs that were visible as soon as I opened the package, the piece is lovely. Don't get me wrong; it'd be much better in real, solid wood. It's a fantastic display cabinet for all the little odds and ends we seem to accumulate, and the size is perfect for what we need... but the sheer frustration, plus the visible wear and tear that it started off with? I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone, be they friend, stranger, or enemy. Spend the extra few bucks for a better quality piece, you won't regret it.", 
    "We purchased this cabinet to use for our DVD and CD collections. It looks great in the living room. But, it came with a few flaws: Pieces missing, damaged shelfs, one undrilled hole. The cabinet had lots of pieces to be put together. My husband is handy at putting stuff together so it was not a problem for him. After contacting the company about replacement parts, they sent a shelf with the wrong finish. After a quick call to them it was taken care of. I should be getting the correct shelf in a few days. Overall, we are pleased but do wish the product had more solid wood in it and not fabricated material. I would have been glad to pay extra for a better-made product. I guess this cabinet will last for a few years before it shows much wear and tear considering it is not constructed of solid wood on all parts.", 
    "If you have a lot of time to put this together and are very very very patient, by all means buy it, because it looks pretty nice. I had to drill quite a few of my own holes and do a lot of creative \"fitting\" of the pieces though because many of the holes do not line up, or, where they do line up, it creates a lopsided piece.", 
    "This product took hours to assemble. There are hundreds of bits and pieces to put together. However the worst part is that once assembled the cabinet tiltled forward. The boards making up the sides of the cabinet were uneven. A dangerous hazard considering the weight of the item and that it has glass doors! After all that work, we disassembled it immediately for fear someone would bump into it and it would fall over!", 
    "ok, it looks better than most furniture in that price range. the veneer is or at least looks like real wood. holes were all drilled in the right places and it went together good EXCEPT the little cam locks that draw the posts in are crap material. most worked ok, but about 1/4 of them seemed like the posts were not quite in the right position and the cams just broke apart. they look like metal but you can break them apart with bare hands. i solved the problem with hot melt glue in the cam holes. the other problem, which i am returning it for, is the left hand door was drilled for the handle (2 holes) in the wrong position. someone obviously put it in the right side jig. THEN THEY WOOD PUTTIED THE HOLES (and a bad job of it) and re-drilled them in the right position. i work in a machine shop and if someone sneaked a mistake like that through they would be fired. (oh yeah, china. i might have just gotten a worker executed). anyway, nothing to do with overstock. they can't and shouldn't open every box. i rate the cabinet above average in looks, fit, and wood quality for that price. the cam locks? be VERY careful and you might only break 3 or 4. and the door mistake, just downright pathetic. very obvious and unsightly. i will send the whole cabinet back if i have to. hopefully i can just get a new door. oh, packaged VERY well. the box was sort of beat up when it arrived. everything was very well protected and not a bit of damage.", 
    "It is a very nice cabinet, I am using it not for media but for my crystal. Very happy with it.", 
    "It's very cute. Smaller than I thought, but that's ok. I found a place to put it.", 
    "For the $$$ it works perfectly and holds amount stated.", 
    "The cabinet is attractive and perfect for my family room. Easy to assemble, just follow the instructions . Very Happy with it", 
    "Was a lot smaller then expected. Not worth the money.", 
    "It's rather cheaply made, but you get what you paid for. The doors do not alignment perfectly, and the top shelf is a bit of a \"wtf\" since it is so short that it doesn't fit anything vertically. The fact that you can't adjust the shelves is really annoying.", 
    "The assembly was a little time consuming but the result was great. We have had this for a few years and it is a nice addition to our living room' We now have too many DVD's to fit in it so we're buying another one to match", 
    "This looksikr I have finally found what I leave been looking for!!! A lot of storage!Very excited to get it fina", 
    "a bit smaller than i thought but over all great quality and holds a lot of dvd/cds", 
    "A very fine looking cabinet. I am very impressed with the product and the ease of assembly. So much, that I am going to order a second unit.", 
    "I highly recommend this product to all types of consumers. A discerning eye will see that it is not a $1,000 bookcase... but it does fit in nicely in my family room full of Stickley furniture. It arrived nicely packed, on time and looks like it did on-line. You do have to put it together and the instructions could be better but I managed to get through it and I'm not the most adept person with a set of tools.", 
    "It's exactly what I was looking for. Very cute and functional. Not real sturdy, but looks just like the photo.", 
    "I really enjoyed the styling of this piece that I bought two of them. After downsizing but not ready to give up my music, I really enjoy the wood and the glass doors to create stylish organized space for collections.", 
    "Quality for the price is really good. Takes a while to assemble these but the end product is worth the effort, I purchased a second one once I finished assembling the first.", 
    "I like the looks of the cabinet, especially the doors. It is a heavy duty product and I would recommend it to friends and family", 
    "This media cabinet was much more than expected. The color and quality exceed imagined product. For the compact size, it holds very large selection of media. Cabinet has a built in slight backward slant, great for California.", 
    "Assembly required two people and would recommend an electric screw driver to assemble -- lots of screws used to assemble product. The cabinet looks great and the oak color matches existing furniture, which I was real pleased that happened. Cabinet is a bit top heavy though, so it's recommended that you do mount to the wall once assembled.", 
    "This cabinet looks very classical and rich. It has a lot of pieces so it takes about two hours to assemble on the first one. THe second one was about an hour and a half to complete.The price is very fair and is exactly as advertised.", 
    "The cabinet was made of quality products and very easy to assemble, with all the hardware separated into individual packets", 
    "easy to put together, quick delivery, quality material.", 
    "I love this so much I wish they had a corner china cabinet in the same style!", 
    "The media cabinet was received , I was very pleased after I put it together ( very easy).", 
    "This by far is the prefect match for my laminate flooring in my living room. We needed something to store all of our CD's & DVD's in. It was not hard to put together at all. I might just have to buy another one to put on the other side of our chaise lounge. Didn't know how many CD's & DVD's we really had until we started putting them in the cabinet. I love it!! So glad I purchased this product.", 
    "I have antique oak furniture and the color of this cabinet blends very well with my antiques. It fits so well with the style of my other furniture and most people think it is an antique too. Of course, I don't tell them it isn't.", 
    "Matches one I purchased elsewhere years ago. Good quality and and style.", 
    "It will serve the purpose. Was easy to put together, my grandson had it done within an hour, with a little help from his 10 yearold cousin.", 
    "The cabinet looks good nice and the wood goes well with our existing wood in the room. The doors both arrived with damage to the top panel above the glass, same spot on both. It was as if someone had lifted the doors by the top panel inside of the sides where it is the strongest. The veneer and wood support here broke, exposing unfinished wood. I had to hammer the pieces back in place, apply dark wood oil to the exposed unfinished wood areas, but now it is barely noticeable, and it looks really good now.", 
    "I have two very large sets of dishes, and a very small apartment. This piece is perfect for storing all of my cups, saucers, dessert plates, and a few small serving pieces. It is a good value for the money, and looks great in my livingroom. I put this together myself with just the aid of an electric screwdriver. The instructions seemed a bit backwards, upon studying them, I relisted the order in which to proceed. I am very pleased with this product, and it has more room inside than one might realize. Definately a good investment!", 
    "I am very impressed with the media cabinet, so pleased I bought it just what I was looking for.", 
    "Am using the cabinet for holding glasses behind my bar. Its great. Not to deep and that what I wanted.", 
    "The shelves were in bad places. I was not able to fit any of my Disney VHS or even a lot of my DVDs.", 
    "Some of the screw holes were a bit tight and had to be enlarged with screwdriver tip before the screw would fit. A little bit of a flimsy product as some of the cam bolt locks dont grab correctly. Overall, it looks lovely and the color is well represented on the site. Some have called it cherry--it is a mild cherry, not too much red.", 
    "This was packaged very well, but there was some damage in shipping. The manufacture replacement parts came very quickly with no hassles. Super easy to assemble, looks very nice. The size makes it very easy to fit into spaces. I was so happy with the product that I ordered another one.", 
    "I am so pleased with this product. I am so glad that I purchased 2 of them because they go great in my living room.", 
    "It was very hard to put together, very time consuming. It came in way too many pieces. The finished product is nice though.", 
    "I love the cabinet! It came with directions that even I could put together with no problems. All the hardware was there. I needed no help.", 
    "Description and picture were spot on. I had a very small space to fit a piece of furniture,this worked perfectly. It is on a wall between the living and dining rooms and mimics a hutchorcurio matches my existing antique dining set very well..Nicely made and attractive for the price point :) I'm considering another for the bedroom to use as a bookshelf for paperbacks, the depth makes work perfect in tight spaces.", 
    "i would recomend this product to anyone fits well in any room. whish i had room to fit another cabinet..", 
    "This is an attractive DVD/CD cabinet. It is reasonably priced and easy to put together. That being said, the quality and workmanship could be better. The front panel cut-outs were a bit uneven and one of the side panels was warped. However, this is just going to be in a TV room, so I wasn't looking for designer furniture, just something functional. It is functional and looks nice as long as you don't look too closely.", 
    "I was attracted to this cabinet for two reasons... Craftsman style and it's depth. Both of those things met my expectations. The quality is good. The assembly is tedious and took me a LONG time to complete. I wouldn't get another piece like this one unless it was really needed. However, this piece fits into my design and accommodates my needs very well.", 
    "I put this product together myself which I conceder to be quite an accolishment. Instructions were very easy to follow and when I was Done I was very well satisfied with the cabinet. I would reccomend this product to any of my friends.", 
    "This oak cabinet was packaged well and is the color stated. It is a nice addition to the living area of our home. It keeps dust away from the interior. I am glad I bought it.", 
    "I recently purchased a Glass Paneled 6-shelf Oak Media Cabinet, which took several hours to put together. I found it a little difficult to attach the doors by myself. I wish I had asked someone to assist me with the assembly. Once thge Media Cabinet was assembled, it fit in with the other furniture near it and was large enough to house my new DVDs. The cabinet is of good quality and should last many years. I am happy with my purchase and can recommend it to others. It wil look exactly like the picture you view on line.", 
    "I'm not very displeased with this product for the price. It does have one design flaw, in that the assemly hardware is located in such a way that you need a stubby screwdriver to get it locked together, which the instructions do noy mention. Otherwise, It was easy to assemble and the parts fit together well. I was surprised that the doors hung fairly straight without having to tweak the assembly. I may very well get another.", 
    "I thought I was getting wood and wood veneers instead of particle board...not impressed with the composition but esthetically is ok.", 
    "This cabinet was the perfect size for what we wanted!! It did have a few little spots on it, but nothing real noticable! It did take a little while to put together!!", 
    "Like many of the other reviews noted, this article is not of the greatest quality. However, all of the pieces were included (with some extras) and it went together smoothly with two people, a manual screw driver, and a power screw driver. The unit seems a bit fragile, but it looks very nice and will hold my DVD/CD collection efficiently. I looked on many different websites before I purchased this, since I was looking for something with an oak finish. The color is darker than oak and actually looks more like cherry. Overall, I am satisfied with this product, and at the same time, I feel that it is overpriced for the quality.", 
    "This is advertised as a media cabinet, but we use it for our alcoholic beverage, like wine and beer glasses. By leaving one of the shelves out, there is more height on two of the shelves to accommodate taller glasses. It works beautifully and protects the glasses with the glass doors.", 
    "Well I thought it was a little taller from seeing it on line. That's the only thing that was a con other than that it looks great in my living room. My husband stores his CD's & DVD's. It keeps the dust off of them.", 
    "The cabinet looks alright and wasn't hard to put together, but it is NOT sturdy. I don't use it much but have had to move it a couple times and it is falling apart already.", 
    "I have put together lots of furniture in the past, but this was the most difficult item to assemble. The holes are drilled too deeply, so the Cam Locks and bolts don't lock into place. Luckily, I own a really great nail gun, so I was able to put it together. Also, make sure to measure the distance between the anchors before you try to attach the cabinet to the wall. The assembly instructions say the anchor bracket holes are 22\" apart, but mine are actually 23 1/4\" apart. This isn't a huge deal, except I had to make a second hole for the anchor (and patch the first). Now that the cabinet is together it looks great and is sturdy, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend this assembly project to anyone without patience (and a serious tool set).", 
    "Rec'd the Oak media cabinet very quickly after ordering. It came in perfect condition, very well packed. It took my husband and I about 2 hrs to put it together. Everything lined up, all the pieces and hardware were there and the directions were pretty concise. Looks very nice when competed. I would suggest having two people put it together, it would be difficult with only one.", 
    "This item worked great for our media storage problem since we are collectors of classic movies DVDs and VHS.", 
    "The glass in the doors is really rough along the edges. and not enough wood screws were included in the kits. I had to buy quite a few extras", 
    "This a a very nice cabinet, a great value, but the assembly instructions are poor. I started to assemble this and did not notice that one of the fragile front panels were cracked in several places. This is the second product that I have ordered from overstock that was damaged. I was able to partially fix it, but the damage is still noticeable on close examination. So if you order this check closely for damage.", 
    "The cabinet looks awesome and complements the other furniture I have in my living room; however, putting it together was frustrating. The pictures regarding the hinges are very confusing, and, even though I read other reviews regarding the assembly before I started, I still had to redo the hinges three times before they were assembled correctly. All in all, the cabinet looks great, but hold off on assembling it until you have a few hours to spare.", 
    "The oak media cabinet arrived quickly, was well packaged, and none of the wood or glass had been damaged in transit--which was something I thought could happen. It is a very pretty piece, and looks lovely where it is placed. I just happen to have more CDs than it can hold, but at least now, the majority of the discs are stored, and not on open shelving in the living room--which looked so untidy.I think the piece is highly overpriced, for the quality and because the customer has to assemble it.The instructions for putting it together could have been much better, and I do believe that two people are necessary for the assembly process. I did it myself, and the entire time wished I had waited until I had an extra set of hands and sensibilities.The doors were hellish to connect; trying to get both hinge pegs to line up with the slots in which they were to reside was an exercise in frustration. In addition, not all the hardware was included, and the hardware that was there could have been marked or described more clearly. I guessed on some uses, but feel I guessed correctly.Moreover, the magnets to hold the doors closed were not included in the box, and since the doors remain closed on their own, I decided not to bother contacting customer service to have replacements shipped to me.It is a pretty piece, but had I had time to look elsewhere locally, I feel confident I could have found something similar, already assembled, and for a lower price.", 
    "There were some cracks in the wood of one of the front door panels, but they were easily filled and finished with a touch of paint. Otherwise, it was in perfect order.", 
    "I'M PLEASED OVERALL WITH THE LOOKS ( ELEGANT) AND SIZE OF THE CABINET. IT'S EASY TO ASSEMBLE.THE DELIEVERY WAS QUICKLY...", 
    "Was easy to put together (put it together in an hour), looks great and holds all my CD's.", 
    "Fast shipping, great piece of furniture. Easy assembly too!", 
    "If I saw this product in a store, I NEVER would have paid more than $75 for it. This product is held together by wooden pegs and glue! Therfore, no matter how nice it looks, it's just a cheap product. When looking at it from a distance, it looks very nice. However, get some good lighting and you can see how cheap it really looks. It's made from plywood with a wood design finish, which can very easily peel off. For a pre-fab, I happened to receive one where the holes did not line up, or there just weren't any holes. Plus the manufacturer did not do a good job labeling the parts to put it all together. I only knew this because the instructions said to use a part (with a picture of it). I had to use my own screws to hold the thing together. Since it's not cut very well, it ends up being wobbly and needs to be fastened to the wall - another sign of a poor quality pre-fab cabinet. Plus the doors will never line up properly; one door will be higher and the gap between them will be larger at the bottom. I saw a similar cabinet like this in a store for $50, and another similar cabinet made from actual wood for $200. It does make a nice \"placeholder\" until you find the one you really want, but don't pay more than $75 for it.", 
    "The product is nice looking and has more room for other things than DVD's.", 
    "I was very pleased with this product. It is a very nice cabinet. It was a little difficult to assemble, but was worth the effort. It arrived in a timely manner and in good condition . I now wish I had two of them.", 
    "No matter how good you are at assembly, you will meet your match with this cabinet!!!!! Be fair warned, all the holes are too large, no mallet is ever needed and the instructions are a waste of time. Pictures of the parts are helpful.The box it arrives in is just a memory and a wonder that it made it at all.But bottom line --- it looks great when finished. As a matter of fact it looked so good, that I am about to order another one to go on the other side of the entertainment center.", 
    "I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good challenge! It is a very attractive and sturdy piece once assembled......that is the clincher though. It takes patience and a stiff drink to get through the assembly process! Be forewarned.", 
    "Looks GREAT! some minor blemishes and warpage, but in the end, it looks great. Be aware that the doors are heavy, and this may reqire anchoring to a wall (parts for doing so included!)", 
    "I bought this item to store DVD's for my entertainment system, and it performs that function quite nicely. The assembly portion was actually quite painless, contrary to some of the other reviews, and took all of about an hour for me to put together alone. Overall, the finish looks better than I expected, and it's actually quite solid when assembled properly. The drawbacks I found were that the shelving isn't quite spaced for DVD's, so they just squeeze into the shelves, so you can't pack them snug if you ever plan to get the movie out again. Also, the glass broke during shipping, and caused some cosmetic damage to the wood paneling. It was easily amendable with wood putty and stain. Otherwise, it's a nice addition to my livingroom furniture.", 
    "This piece works perfectly in my home. Very nice looking. The only complaint is the amount of time it took to assemble and that you have to anchor it to your wall so it won't tip over. That eliminates the ability to plug in a small lamp to sit on top of it.If you're looking for a low-priced, good looking bookcase to fill an open spot, this is it. If you're short on assembly time and don't want to drill holes in your wall, pass on this one.", 
    "A unique and interesting piece when assembled. Be careful when nailing the back into the preset holes as they can fracture the inside wood. It also takes two people to maneuver the preset panels once the glass doors are in place. A little tricky!", 
    "We ordered and received our cabinet in record time. It was not damaged in any way during shipping, and putting it together took less than an hour. The color of the cabinet is perfect and matches other pieces of furniture we already own.Our only gripe, is that we own far too many DVD's and wish they had a larger model. Will most likey order another of the same, just to make sure they match each other.", 
    "I love it! I was so afraid of ordering this and it coming in damaged. This product was so well packed there wasnt even dust on the item! It didnt take long for the put together and even after putting all my dvd's, cd's and vhs tapes in I still had plenty of room for more. I would have liked to have a little more option on the adjustability of the shelves as I have many of the larger boxed vhs tapes, but I layed them down and it still worked out fine. I am very happy with this item.", 
    "I Purchased this media cabinet for my daughters room thinking it was a bookshelf with glass doors. However, she will be able to use it for smaller books, cd's and dvd's. Next time I will be sure to take the time and read the description and dimensions.My friend assembled one of the cabinets for me and it took some time especially with the glass panels. He will be putting the second unit together when he finds the time!I wouldn't recommend to a friend if they need a bookshelf. Definitely need time to put together.", 
    "The \"ease\" of assembling this product was anything but! Some of the pre-drilled holes were misaligned so that, by the time we realigned everything, it took the two of us 5 hrs. to assemble the cabinet. Once we placed the cabinet where we wanted and filled it with the c.d.'s and dvd's, we quickly found out why this product included a wall anchor. It is top heavy and will fall forward. Once we worked out all the quirks, the cabinet serves it's purpose (to store all c.d.'s and dvd's together) and looks to be well-made.", 
    "Yes, it does look good. However, I had to drill holes for hardware because they were misaligned, and much of the veneer was damaged. Also, the assembly system did not work properly, so be prepared to augment.BIG PROBLEM: The unit is front heavy because of the glass and wood doors-it will tip over unless you bolt it to the wall-POOR DESIGN!!!! Be extra careful during assembly because of this problem.Given the headaches, it should be priced at less than $100.", 
    "The unit was exactly as pictured. The finish is very rich and I am very pleased to have it in my living room.", 
    "It is a BEAUTIFUL Cabinet!I love the way it looks and have received many compliments!I would have given this cabinet 5 stars, but due to the instructions that came with it, I ended up making a few mistakes as the instructions are difficult to follow since the steps and the illustration are not on one page and the lines run together. I have put together many pieces of furniture, but this was the toughest.Other than that, the cabinet is good quality workmanship and better than the pic in looks!Once it was complete I had the doors on upside down, so I started off wrong?? So read it over and over until you are sure you have it correct the first time.", 
    "Froma distance, the CD cabinet looks beautiful. However, when lookingclosely, you notice that one door was made by piecing together severalpieces of wood and leaving small gaps in between. Unfortunately, thisdoes not look good.", 
    "This media cabinet looks even better once it's together than on the website. Appears to be high quality but is a beast to put together! Screws heads broke off when tighted, pieces wouldn't fit together easily, pre-drilled holes didn't match up. But if you know a bit of woodworking and can fit things together or force them it's worth it.", 
    "I had a total of 32 hardware parts missing. The company did ship the parts and took 5 days to arrive. When trying to place together the cam locks would not tighten on the cam screws or would break. The structure would have been unstable and would colapse.", 
    "poorly designed. Had to go to hardware store and purchase L brackets to stabilize. Nice looking cabinet once the L brackets were in place.", 
    "Looks okay. Nice style. The boards were of a poor quality and not high compression MDF, poor MDF. Falls apart if screws not placed exactly in center of board. The glue that came with the item was dried up. Had to buy my own. Not enough scews, but came with extra door handle. Bought my own swrews.Instructions written poorly and 1 page was printed reversed.There is a bracket in the back to hold it against the wall , it is there because this product is not sturdy, after thought bracket if you know what I mean.", 
    "I was very dissapointed with this product. It is poor quality and not solid at all. Bottom line is it's a piece of junk. I would not recommend this product.", 
    "The pictures did not do the product justice. I love my cabinets. I am excited to have the DVD and CD collections organized - now I won't buy duplicate titles. I had previously purchased luggage and was satisfied with that.", 
    "Came with all the parts, YEAH!! I started during the middle of one afternoon. I didn't finish it that nite, because it was a bit time consuming. The directions, although seemingly logical, and not difficult, was a bit much at first. I decided after getting half accomplished to finish it a few days later due to brain overload. I personally do not like to put together things with a gazillion screws/parts but the finished product was worth it. I do wish it was all solid oak/wood like the doors, some of it (the shelves) is mdf type with a faux finish, but then you would be paying a lot more for it. The doors and door handles are very nice. I do like the completed product very much and it fits in great with my decor. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the time it consumes putting it together. If you are a patient person or have someone who can help you, then I would recommend it. I have one more to put together, all by myself, and for that reason alone, I am not looking forward to it. :o)", 
    "The doors were gauged out so bad and my husband didnt discover this until he had already assembled it. The materials are of very poor quality and this is definitely not a cabinet to display proudly in a visible area. We will have to find some wood putty to match the doors to make it at least viewable.", 
    "The cabinet looks very nice in the room, but if you look closer you may find a few flaws. For example, the backing does not quite fit, leaving one side unattached for the most part, luckily it is against a wall so becomesless noticable, but remember that when moving it. Also some of the none fitting screw show through. Another word of caution, it is very wobbly before putting things in it, I almost broke it twice. Once completed and filled, it does look like a nice piece, though you may know more.", 
    "The cabinet was a bit complicated to assemble; you should have some previous experience assembling boxed furniture. The front cabinet doors do not entirely meet in the center, there is about a 1/4 inch gap. The product was well packed and all the small pieces (screws, dowels, etc.) were accounted for, but the manufacturer takes no liability for any product damage, so it's between the buyer and Overstock.com . There was also a bit of lifting of the veneer, but some white glue should fix that. The cabinets are handsome and do look reminescent of furniture from the late 1800's early 1900's. Certainly will hold a lot of dvds and cds. I am happy with the product and will enjoy using them.", 
    "First for the positive - This IS a very nice-looking video cabinet. The wood is lovely and it matches exactly with what I have in that room.Unfortunately, however, I think there is more negative than positive to report - There were scratches on the glass. Some of the wood had visible flaws. The cabinet would not stand sturdily without putting shims under the bottom front (scary!). There were some areas where the fit was not optimal and I had a difficult time getting a few of the lock assemblies to work properly because of ill-fitting parts.I have put together a LOT of furniture over the years and this piece had THE worst instructions of all time. I go through from beginning to end and some important stuff , that needed to be prioritized, was not mentioned until after you had put together certain parts. That is frustrating, as I always am careful to read through each instruction to make it easier on myself and putting important parts of an instruction after they have you attach parts is not conducive to making it work as it should.", 
    "This required a little more muscle to assemble than typical home-assembled furniture, mainly due to pilot holes for screws being very shallow, but overall, not difficult. A power screw driver is recommended over a manual screw driver. The finished product looks good, primarily because of the glass doors with curved mullians.", 
    "I bought this hoping it would help me organize--it has. Now I'm moving and hoping that it will still be available when I get to my new home. I can use two more! It's beautiful and holds a lot of movies and CDs. You won't be disappointed. Just save some for me!", 
    "I was really disappointed in this item. As I put it together, the screws and locks would break. Once assembled, it didn't fit together nicely and never stood solid. I took it apart and sent it back. I have gotten other furniture here and have been pleased, but not with this one!!", 
    "Overall I am very happy with my media cabinet. I would have given a 5 star rating if I didn't have to redrill the cabinet for one of the hinges. Fortunately I have experience in cabinet making and the tools needed. The cabinet has a very nice finish and look. Very classy looking. For the price it is good quality. It holds my collection well and I am very happy to have all my CD's and DVD's in one place.", 
    "The CD/DVD shelf is beautiful but it was VERY timeconsuming and difficult to put together. THe holes for the unit were not uniformally drilled, making it difficult to put together. The wood was not sanded down and when we put the glass door in, it cracked and we had to replace it (another 30.00). It is a beautiful outcome, but the product quality is poor.", 
    "The pre-drilled holes were not where they should have been therefore the doors and door knobs do not line up. Although the cabinet serves the purpose for which it was purchased, I did not consider this a good buy. If it weren't for the fact it took quite a while to assemble, I would have shipped it back.", 
    "I bought 2 of these cabinets for DVD and VHS storage. I really like them. They look very nice in my home. However, they are not very easy to put together. You will need a rubber mallet to hammer the sides in place. Assembly took about 4 hours per cabinet. Also, the back of the cabinet is a very flimsy pressed wood. The product description states that each cabinet holds 166 DVD's, which I did not find to be true. In order to use all the shelves that the cabinet comes with, you have to make the top and bottom shelves shorter (i.e. two shelves will only hold items the size of CD's). Even with its flaws, overall, this is a good product for the price. It arrived very quickly, and although the box was slightly damaged, the cabinet pieces were well-packed in foam and free from damage.", 
    "The cabinet looks very nice once assembled. The instructions are not the clearest I've ever dealt with. The diagrams are a little confusing, and I've assembled many pieces of furniture in the past. The holes for dowels are sometimes drilled too deep and not enough glue provided, some starter holes are missing for things like the glass braces. Have a drill with a very small bit handy.Unit is stable on solid flooring, but must be secured to a wall with provided brackets if on carpeting. Looks nice and will serve the purpose I intended.", 
    "I didn't realize how short this would be after we put it together and the shelves do not have enough space to put anything big.. It looks nice but I wanted something taller", 
    "THIS PRODUCE WAS NOT WORTH ANYTHING. I WOULDN'T GIVE 5 DOLLARS FOR IT. IT WAS TO SMALL FOR MY USE AND IT WAS NOT STURDY AT ALL EVEN IF YOU HAD ATTACHED IT TO THE WALL IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN STURDY. THE FINISH ALSO SCRATCHES AT THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH.", 
    "Looks OK, but it was difficult to put together, had a chip on it but after my son-in-law took 3 hours assembling it, I decided to forget trying to take it apart and send it back. It will be in a back room and serve to keep little hands off the DVDs and CDs because I will put a child lock on the outside. Very disappointed!!!", 
    "It is very nice but I didn't realize I had to put it together. It was very time consuming but the directions were easy to follow."
