    "Looks great but it gets stained really easily. I recommend not to sit on it with black clothing esp polyuretan fabrics. the set arrived with only one hardware so put a note when you are buying the item \"check the hardware amount\" if you dont want to wait another 2 weeks . lastly the color looks beige or yellowish on the picture but dont worry it is really white.", 
    "I bought these chairs for staging a condo. Works well and looks pretty. I would not buy these chairs if you plan on giving them a lot of use. The legs are not strong and, in fact, I ordered them twice as a leg broke in installation. If you just use them for a look and occasional use, they should work", 
    "very comfortable chairs..easy to put together...strong back support..comfortable cushion for your butt", 
    "I am very disappointed in these chairs. We tried putting them together and because we got the wrong size screws the leg cracked. It is over a month and I am waiting for the right screws to arrive. Meanwhile my house is cluttered with enormous boxes. I order a lot of stuff from overstock and I am very disappointed with their service.", 
    "I ordered these chairs to go with a table I found in a consignment store. They look great with the table and are very comfortable. I've had many compliments on them.", 
    "Holding up well. Makes my small dining room look elegant.", 
    "Sturdy and cute just a little short...nevertheless sophisticated", 
    "I found these chairs to be beautiful, easy to assemble, and sturdy for my uses. They go well with the dining table that I chose and the small space I have for the table and chairs. They are also easy to clean.", 
    "These are dining room chairs but I have them in my bedroom... ABSOLUTELY AWESOME", 
    "Was not very happy with quality can complain of overstock customer service the best", 
    "Nice chairs. They are white and the crystals add an elegant touch. Happy with purchase", 
    "The chairs arrived in a timely manner. The legs were a little thin but the chairs have held up and seem to be sturdy.The material on the front of one of the chair backs was pulled and wrinkled and doesn't look very good. I got busy and didn't have time to package it up and return it so I guess I'll live with it. Good chairs for a small table.", 
    "Added an additional two to the collection for my complete set!", 
    "Ordered 2 of these chairs to match an existing white Princess Bedroom Set that has the faux crystals. Looks absolutely beautiful - like a little classy bistro set in the bedroom - feels like a resort room. Love these chairs - adds a nice bling touch and they are comfortable and easy to wipe clean if needed. Would order these again in a heartbeat!", 
    "When I received these chairs, I was shocked by the fact that the seat is 15 inches from the floor. They look like preschool chairs. They won't fit the average dining room table. DO NOT PURCHASE this chair, unless you are getting them for the children's table. I must send them back.", 
    "There was 1 minor glitch with one of the chairs. The leg on one chair is off by a little bit. Nothing that would cause me to send them back. Overall the chairs are Beautiful and exactly as you see them in the picture.", 
    "I love my new dining room chairs! They looked exactly like the picture. Color is perfect. Size is exactly what was advertised. I have had so many compliments on them.", 
    "The chairs look good and are comfortable. They are lighter than I expected, but feel sturdy nonetheless. I would have preferred white buttons instead of the diamonds, but it still works in my all white sunroom!", 
    "Absolutely love the chairs specially the bling on them the only thing is that I wish they were a little heavier.", 
    "I have ordered 2 sets of chairs, but UPS has lost one of the box. I contacted the customer services and I got fast response. I got a replacement shipment and receive the other two chairs a week later. The overall quality of the chairs is good and comfortable. It looks nice in my kitchen area.", 
    "These chairs work perfectly w/my decor: light,modern,stylish & a bit glam, but also within my limited budget. All the parts were contained in my order,& the chairs were easy to assemble even for someone like myself. The order was received amazingly within just a matter of a few days of being placed. There was a small dent/splinter in 1 of the legs which I called Overstock about & was most graciously assisted by their rep Travis & 2 new legs were sent within a few days. The chairs look beautiful in time for the holidays. Also I love how spill-resistant & easy to clean they are, & was money definitely well spent. This was my 1st time ordering from Overstock & had initially been apprehensive ordering furniture this way, but the service was excellent & dispelled any fears I had, will definitely order from them again.", 
    "I actually really like the chairs. Very stylish in my breakfast room.", 
    "Run away from these chairs. These warehouse of tiffany chairs are poorly made and look cheap. Packaging: the parts came in a box that was too small, with the ends of the legs poking out, and had insufficient packing. Assembly: the screws to attach everything together were random sizes; some fit and some did not; worst of all, the legs attach in a way where they are wobbly and there is no stability. These chairs look worse in person than on the site. The shape/design and proportions are strange. They don't feel like they would hold up under any regular use. The \"buttons\" for the tufting look like they came from a child's cheap plastic jewelry set. I sent the chairs back (and kudos to Overstock.com for making returns easy and painless).", 
    "These chairs look great, but are built and shipped under very sloppy conditions. We ordered 12 of these chairs for our dinning room and these are the problems we had. 9 of 12 damaged seat bottoms, 3 of 12 damaged seat backs and 2 bad sets of legs. Some of the damaged replacment parts that wharehouse of tiffiny shipped out were damaged as well! I hope you have alot of time untill you need a complete set and to deal with overstock customer service if you order these chairs. On a good note overstock was great about everything!", 
    "very good...would order from this stock again...easy assenbly...good instructions.", 
    "i love the chairs, they were exactly like the picture, they are very sturdy", 
    "the buttons on the chairs are HUGE and SUPER SPARKLY GEMS. just not my style and it's not in the description and hard to tell from the pictures because they kinda just look like big silver buttons in the pics. anyway, i don't think the chairs are so bad as to rate one star, i just wanted to get your attention so you would read this and be aware of what you're possibly purchasing. i immediately returned these chairs, so i cannot vouch for the quality of the product.", 
    "They are perfect for the price. THey are a little smaller than expected but perfect for a smaller table. They are elegant & classy looking. You would never know you would get such cute chairs for the price!", 
    "These chairs are so cute! They add even more\" glam\" to my mirrored breakfast table. The \"bling\" is just what I wanted to add the wow factor. The chairs are very comfortable. Please keep in mind that they are on the small side, but my husband and I are both pretty tall and they are fine for us. There were no directions included, but my husband was able to put them together with ease. I'm VERY happy with my purchase! Thanks again Overstock!"
