    "This is by far the worst purchase I have ever made on furniture. This microwave cart is complete piece of junk. For this price I was expecting **** quality and **** has always been acceptable. But this piece is nothing to compare to ****. First of all, it's not well engineered. The places where there should be holes for screws do not have them. If you follow their manual you will find yourself drilling in the wrong places. Their pictures are misleading without specific measurement. Trust I can assemble furniture with good instruction. I have assembled things a lot more complicated than that, like a computer desk with a hutch with glass doors (that took me three days because I don't have a power screw driver). Also, the pieces don't match in sizes either. one door is obviously bigger than the other. After I put it together, the drawer closed but wouldn't open. I had to go rough on getting it out. The screw they put there is too big and caught the wheel and beat it up pretty hard. I had to grind down the wheel in order to open and close.The edges and corners are super sharp and can cut you easily. Again I had to smoothen them to avoid accidents. The quality is just awful. I am seriously thinking about returning it if I could do it not at my own cost. Don't know how that works.", 
    "Saves space and looks great too!", 
    "perfect i totally love it !!!!", 
    "This cart appeared to fit our needs and ordered it before I read the very negative review. I did not tell my husband about the review and watched carefully as he assembled the unit. He completed the assembly in 2 hours, with no trouble. The door hinges need a little tweaking, but within acceptable limits. We like the finish and the unit suits our needs. We are pleased with our purchase."
