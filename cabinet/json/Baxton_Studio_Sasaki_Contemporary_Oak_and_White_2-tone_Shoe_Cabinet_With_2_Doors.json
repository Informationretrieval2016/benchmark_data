    "I was a bit dismayed by the flimsy/cheap looking components when I first took them out of the box. Honestly, though, once it's put together it looks pretty decent. It would look out off place if everything else you owned was super-high quality fancy-pants, but I have it alone near my front door so there's nothing to comare against. :) You need a drill to screw everything together. Directions were easy and piecces were numbered.", 
    "I'm not one to write reviews but this product is so terrible I felt I needed to. Do not buy this product!!! Instructions are difficult, the pieces were chipped in parts and the wood color was off on other parts. The doors don't line up and the back panel is lop-sided. Additionally, the white panels on the doors had black stain marks on them that do not wash off.", 
    "The price really does indicate the quality. The legs are plastic and the body is largely particle-board. We returned it.", 
    "Great shoe cabinet. Assembly was simple, and there is plenty of room for our shoes. It has a nice look to it, could easily be placed anywhere in the house.", 
    "Nice piece that hides all shoes and looks nice.Got compliments.", 
    "love this I bought two of them", 
    "The piece was easy to put together (except the legs, which had no preset holes to use) but the color of the oak is much darker than it appeared in the picture. Otherwise, I like the look of it and it is doing its job very well."
