    "High quality, sturdy, attractive bench. Easily assembled. Very happy with purchase.", 
    "Love it! Matched my hamshire table perfectly. Very sturdy & rustic. Get lots of compliments!", 
    "But with lots of imperfections and cracks in wood.... Had to return one of them", 
    "Sturdy, well-made. Tons of compliments.", 
    "I ordered this bench to go along with the 82 inch Hampshire table (lime wash). It fits perfectly with the table. It is heavy(!!!) and great quality. The distressing looks a bit deliberate at times. I've already gotten many complements! I'm hoping to get a custom made cushion made for the bench so it doesn't look so matchy-matchy with the table.", 
    "just what I expected perfect and very heavy duty", 
    "This bench is very sturdy and will no doubt stand up the rigors of daily life with 3 kids. I wanted the medium brown but received lime wash instead--the mistake is my own apparently, though I do with the picture (medium brown) matched the only current color option (lime wash). There was also a screw missing underneath but my husband was able to fix that easy enough.", 
    "A beautiful, heavy solid piece of furniture BUT I must admit I'm not thrilled with the color I received. The limewash shown is much much lighter than the one I got - mine is closer to the dark one shown with a very light limewash in parts of it. It's too heavy for me to rebox and ship back though! I still love it, just wish it was more like the one in the photo. Regarding opening/assembling - firstly - wow this is HEAVY. In my usual excitement over new furniture I ended up opening the box and building it on my own even though it suggests a \"team lift\" I'm a 5'2\" female and was able to do it myself but it was not easy weight wise. Assembly once out of the box is a piece of cake though and super fast. I think a chimp could do it. : )", 
    "Came as shown in the picture and works really well with the table.", 
    "Gorgeous for the price!!!", 
    "This is a sturdy bench that looks great on one side of dining table", 
    "I want to start with the most important quality which is the solid acacia wood with Janka hardness scale of 1750, which for red oak is about 1200 and hard maple 1450. This is some serious hard wood that is going to last for a very, very, very long time. The quality of wood for me is the most important factor in buying furniture. With that said, the medium brown is a nice rich brown that is still transparent enough to show plenty of the wood grain and the variation in wood color making for a stunning looking bench. I can not wait for the table to arrive. I very highly recommend this bench and the table being made of the same wood with the same finish and am very happy with the purchase. I did have a little damage with one of the legs which Overstock is taking care of in their great tradition of customer service", 
    "I was looking for a bench to have at the end of our king size bed. Previously had a fabric bench, but got a new upholstered bed and didn't want to worry about matching fabrics, etc. This was one of the few wood benches I found that was as long as I wanted and had the walnut finish I was looking for. This piece was well packaged. Very heavy. Was difficult for me to move by myself. Legs screwed on easily and it looks wonderful!", 
    "Absolutely love this bench! Beautiful color and wide! I bought it to go with a table I had also ordered from Overstock but the table had flaws and is now out of stock! Hope the next table I buy will match the bench!!", 
    "Nice solid bench. overpriced but am happy with it despite the $$$", 
    "I ordered this bench in lime wash. It's beautiful! Some reviews mentioned how one or two legs were darker than the rest. I think this just adds to the amazing character of the bench. It was very, very easy to put together, but it did take two of us to turn it over. It's very solid and sturdy. I ordered the matching dining room table and can't wait until it arrives next week.It's exactly what I was looking for. I debated ordering something this large online, but overstock has always been reliable for me.I couldn't be more pleased. It's a work of art in solid, heavy wood!! I'll post pictures when the dining table arrives!", 
    "A little expensive but good quality for the price. It is very sturdy!"
