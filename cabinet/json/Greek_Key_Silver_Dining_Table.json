    "Received the table in two pieces in a timely manner and noticed it was flat. You have to assemble the table base. It is important to read and follow the directions or it will take you longer to assemble ( it took me 3 hrs) as I did not read it at first. Overall, the table looked silver in the pic but is actually grey. It is a beautiful table and have received many comments", 
    "Using this for staging a home and it looks great!", 
    "Love, Love my table and now waiting on WHITE/CHROME chairs. My guy had a problem trying to put it together but with two heads its better than one lol.", 
    "You definitely need to people to help put this together, but not to hard to assemble. Glass did arrive separately the next day though. Overall great looking table"
