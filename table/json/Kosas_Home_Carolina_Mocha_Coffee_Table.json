    "Love this table. Picture is very accurate and it is very sturdy. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I think it's slightly overpriced.", 
    "This table fit perfectly in front of my sectional couch, replacing an old ottoman that was too large for the space. It has the same grayish brown undertones as the couch and the pedestal allows for easy sliding in and out of the seating area in front of the couch. The wood is light, but seems sturdy and the table was very easy to assemble."
