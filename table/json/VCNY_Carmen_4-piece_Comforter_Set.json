    "Read previous negative reviews and was plesantly surprised. Negative reviews are addressed as follows: THICKNESS: not thick or thin, adequate thickness for use as a bedspread. Its does not look like its a pillow when placed on the bed. Again, I believe its intended use is as a white bedspread due to intricate pattern. I place it over my comforter when I make the bed and looks amazing - just like in the picture. True comforters are measured in \"ounces of fill\" this one is adequate for use as a lightweight comforter though I would not reccomend since it wrinkles easily if used as a comforter for daily use. COLOR: white is a true bright white not ivory or cream. QUALITY: Its polyester but very soft. there are no smells. Again, I purchsed for use as a decorative bedspread so I will dry clean it and not risk ruining pattern or accidentlaly shrink by washing in water. VERY DELICATE: one review stated it was falling apart by making the bed and just pulling, Not true, maybe they were very rough and broke the stitching when pulling the fabric or the one they received was damaged. It can be handled normally without damaging the fabric or stictching. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase. Again my intent was to use it as a bedspread and not comforter. I have been searching desperatly for a True White bedspread that was very rich looking and inviting at a reasonable price. I found it in the Carmen white comforter. Comparable comforters other online stores M***ys and P*****ry B**n were $200 - $400 price range and ruched instead of diamonmd pattern - this pattern when found was closer to $400 in other stores.", 
    "Ordered white and gray. The white is a bright white, exactly what I wanted. The gray one is darker than in the picture. At night with the overhead light on it almost looked like it had army green in it. Was too dark for what I wanted, but was still pretty. Also, ordered it in a king for my queen size bed. It is an extra thick mattress and the king is a little to big but the queen size was a little too small, so kept the king size. This is a light to medium weight comforter. I am very pleased with it and like the way it looks on my bed.", 
    "The color is true to the picture, I ordered the beige. In the photo is appears the shams are euro shams but they are not, they are standard shams but nonetheless very nice. As expected when it arrived it was quite wrinkled from being packaged but just a few spritzs with the iron and steam and it looks fantastic. Even the little throw pillow it comes with looks great after a little steam wrinkle release. Great value for the price! Pair it with a different color coverlet and your bed will pop! I've spent so much money on bedding sets in the past and I love this one the most!", 
    "This product would make a wonderful addition to any bedroom. The color I ordered, blue, is bright and really perks up my room. The best thing is this comforter stays in place overnight unlike another one I have that always seems to slide toward the bottom of the bed. It is nice and fluffy and very cozy to sleep under without a lot of weight on top of you.", 
    "This comforter set is great! I went for the taupe because the white looked too bright and it was more beige than I wanted. I was hoping for off white like it looked in the picture. But none the less the pattern looks cool and the set is soft and warm. I love it.", 
    "We love this new bedding. It is so light and comfortable. It has nice fashion appearance, and looks great in our room against the sage green color of the walls. On a side note - my son's sippy cup dripped some chocolate milk onto our 'new' comforter - but never fear! It wiped right off as it is almost like a microfiber material - waaahoooo! Enjoy!", 
    "I was a little skeptical after having read some of the review for this blanket. But I was so in love with it...I couldn't help myself and bought it anyway. It arrived in good condition. I immediately washed it on the gentle cycle of my washer. No problems there. I spread it across my bed and I made a little happy squeak. I really really like it. It's a light-ish blanket, but it keeps me very toasty.", 
    "I was so excited when this arrived - it looks just like the picture and looked great in our bedroom. However, just two weeks later and already the stitches have popped from two of the \"gathers\" - right in the middle of the quilt in a very obvious place. So now those areas lay flat when the rest is still \"puckered\". Very disappointing. If it wasn't such a hassle to pack this big thing back up and ship it, it would go right back. This is one of the first times I've had an issue with Overstock - very disappointed.", 
    "The comforter is not very plush. The design is made by several stitches which came apart on the pillow cases on the 1st wash even though washed according to instructions. I would NOT recommend this item. I am returning within 3 weeks.", 
    "I love thlis set, looked very good on my bed. HOWEVER I washed the pillow shams before we used the set, and dried them on medium. BIG MISTAKE. They turned a darker color. I can't replace them without buying another set, and every time I look at the set now, I see the darker pillow cases. I'm pretty disappointed.", 
    "Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase. A lot of other reviews that I had read about it were all simple things to fix. For example, some people complained about it getting damaged in the washer, or the packaging it was shipped in making it wrinkle. I went to a laundry mat and used a large front load washer and washed it on a gentle setting, solving both problems. One should always wash new linens, but never in a top loading washer - it's just too harsh. I washed it there and partially dried it in the dryer, hung it up afterwards to finish drying and get any remaining wrinkles out. This worked really well for me! Also, the color in the picture is a bit off (I got the taupe one); it is a bit more khaki in color, but still really pretty. And yes, it is thin - as others had mentioned, but not terribly so. It's too hot where I live to have a thicker comforter, so I'm quite pleased. It looks gorgeous on my bed, and it was definitely worth the money! I just suggest others to take a bit more care when first getting it home; don't just stick it in the washer, and it should be fine. :)", 
    "After reading some of the reviews, I almost did not purchase this comforter...but I am so glad that I did! Thank you to everyone who reported positively, because your reviews helped me to take the chance. I have a very large Bernhardt king-size four-poster bed, and the comforter hangs to just a little longer than a true comforter length--not bedspread length to the floor. You do need a ruffle (as one would expect with a comforter!). The comforter is soft, luxurious and thick. It has much more cushion than I was expecting, because of some of the reviews that say it's 'cheap' and 'thin'. The outer material is soft--not hard and cheap like some reviews said. It's a matte finish, almost like an Egyptian cotton sheet. I'm not sure what the negative reviewers were expecting, but this comforter is EXACTLY what I was hoping for. I cannot believe the level of quality for such an inexpensive price!!! Maybe it's a good thing that I DID read the negative reviews, because it just made the beauty of the comforter that much more of a pleasant surprise.", 
    "I was very excited to see that it was well made and not dingy like others like it from other brands. I have been using it over a week and so happy with this purchase especially after reviewing thousands online before buying. I have no problems with any wrinkles like others may. I just wish it had a few more inches on each side.", 
    "This is a very nice comforter that brightens up the entire room! When you order the white color it is a very bright white.", 
    "The gather stitching is starting to come out after only two weeks.", 
    "I had been looking at this comforter on another sight and was trying to justify the high price. I was overjoyed to find it on Overstock. I ordered the taupe which is darker than pictured, but wanted it that way. It is perfect! Casual , yet adds a modern touch. Not super heavy which is good. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you Overstock for your awesome selections at a great price!", 
    "After viewing the photo of this particular Comforter Set I was convinced that this was a home run...Wrong! Not only did it not look like the photo the material wasn't up to par either....strike two!...none of the seams line up nor lay flat...it was one big wriggle mess...strike three! Out of here... back in the box for a return!", 
    "I always wonder what I am going to get when I order something online. For $100.00 you cannot go wrong with this comforter. Its soft and comfortable. It looks very much like the picture.I love the texture and over all look. I can actually give this product a good review. The only reason It didn't get an excellent is because I never give anything excellent reviews until I have had it a year and it is still as good as the day I bought it. so far I am loving it.", 
    "I fell in love with this set online. It looked very elegant. When I received it I was very excited. I got it in dark gray. It is gorgeous. Light material, so its not to hot. It looks great with a modern d\u00e9cor. I have not had any problems with the stitching. Everybody loves it.", 
    "I have owned the product less than one month. This comforter set is a beautiful color and is a perfect match for the 1500 TC egyptian cotton sheets I got in charcoal gray. I couldn't tell what the material was made of from the picture, but for the price it was worth the gamble. The material is very soft and somewhat thin, with a brushed microfiber feel to it, much like a windbreaker. I was looking for something lightweight and this was perfect. also, it only has 2 shams and one decorative pillow. much better than the last with 4 shams and 2 small pillows that have to be removed every night. If you have cats they will snag this material. I do question whether the gathers will hold up over time also, since the material is thin. If you are looking for heavyweight comforters, this is not for you, but it is filled with a good bit of fill, so it insulates really well. actually too hot some nights with either my 650 or 1500 TC sheets. The best part about this purchase is that it was lost in transit and overstock had a replacement within 48 hrs.", 
    "I purchased the gray and I think the color was exactly like it is shown in the picture. I purchased a king, and I know a few reviewers said it was small for a king. I have a california king bed, which isn't as wide as a normal king, and it covered exactly to the point of the box spring, which is where you bed skirt would normally start. So for my case it was fine, but a normal king it would maybe not be wide enough. But I love the way it looks on my bed. Very luxurious and rich. My only real issue is that I think the shams are really big. I have oversized king pillows to go in my shams, and they still don't hold the corners up nice. And while the quality is good, I wouldn't say it is great. I do worry about it holding up over time. It just seems very delicate. But overall I am extremely happy with my purchase.", 
    "It's cozy and looks great. The color was as expected.", 
    "Let's get the one bad thing out of the way, it could be a teensy bit longer on the sides (we bought a king-so maybe that has something to so with the sizing) but since it is a comforter and not a bedspread, that is completely understandable.This blanket is perfectly warm and super cozy. PERFECT comforter thickness. It is so pretty when the bed is made. I noticed a few reviews said the pintucks have come undone and luckily we haven't had any issues with that. The pillow shams did need a little ironing after being packaged but that was super easy (just make sir you use the correct setting on your iron). We bought the grey and it is a perfectly true grey. Would coordinate with any color really well.Yayyy for this comforter!", 
    "I purchased this item as a Black Friday Doorbuster item. I guess you get what you pay for. It looks nothing like the picture on the website - the pleats are barely noticeable. The quality of the fabric is very low and tore almost immediately. The tear was small so we just strategically placed pillows to cover it up. Then I went to wash it for the first time and it melted in the dryer. Save your money and do not buy this set.", 
    "In the very beginning we were happy with our purchase, though it did look a lot less fancy than the photos. After some time, the fabric has pilled and is soooooo uncomfortable to sleep under, it's a total disappointment. I would NOT buy this product again, and I would NOT recommend this product to anyone either.", 
    "I ordrerd this set a while ago, but did plan on using until Spring/Summer. This weekend I planned to put all on bed, and when I opened the package i was very disappointed. It takes too much time to mail it back, so I'll use it as just a white comforter with tread coming out. Was going to order the Duvet, but the same thing may happen. I think this is one of the few times when i would not recommend this to anyone.", 
    "I looked for days online trying to find a nice white comforter for my bed. I fell in love with this one and even though it was a little pricey for only three pieces, I bought it anyway. Not only are the shams standard size in a king size set, the king comforter doesn't even come close to fitting my bed! I thought maybe I had just put it on wrong but it didn't matter what way I turned it, it DID NOT fit! Wishful thinking at its best. On each side of the bed this comforter literally hands over MAYBE an inch so if you have a king size bed sadly this comforter is not true to size not to mention the shams are not king! My son has a full size bed so I put it on his bed just to see size difference and it fits his bed with some overhang but still not much. I love the look but unfortunately I wouldn't recommend anyone with a king size bed to buy the king. This set is NOT true to size.", 
    "I just love this set it made room go from stale to glamour! It did come wrinkled but I took my steamer and ran over it and it popped right up with the pin points showing beautiful!", 
    "Would have gotten 4 starts if the shipping was quicker. Good, quality set. Machine washable. We wash this once a week and the color hasn't faded.", 
    "I bought the teal. Color and it looks amazing. Washed on gentle and only lightly partially dried. It came out besutiful", 
    "Exactly as pictured and looks more expensive than it really was! Bright, crisp white.", 
    "I am happy with all that I have purchased. Quality is what I look for, and I find it in everything I have purchased from O.com.", 
    "This comforter is one of the most comfortable and warm comforters that I've purchased in quite a long time. Love it!", 
    "Makes me feel like I'm floating on a cloud.", 
    "BEAUTIFUL! Excellant blend of texture!", 
    "This comforter dressed up my bedroom like you wouldn't believe. Lots of class.", 
    "Most beautiful spread imaginable. SO soft to the touch, it feels like air but is WARM", 
    "This simple 4 piece set turned my bedroom into a spa retreat!", 
    "This comfort set brings such beauty to my bed room. I am so happy I ordered them.", 
    "Love this comforter set. The material is soft and seems durable. I just wish I could find a bed skirt to match.", 
    "beautiful, better than in any store", 
    "This was nice and light for South Florida weather. It is very durable, I wash it and put it back on my bed and looks great.", 
    "I purchased this set in grey. I love it. I have had it for quite some time now, over a year, and even after several washings, it still looks like new. I highly recommend this comforter set.", 
    "My comforter actually lasted me longer than I thought. It's going on its third year and is still in pretty good shape. After multiple of washes, the pattern/texture tends to change a big, so it isn't as ruffled as it was when I first bought it, which is fine. I'm purchasing my second comforter of this kind as we speak!", 
    "I can't say enough about this set. I have had it over a year and it looks just as light and \"puffy\" as it did the day I got it. Very Elegant! I would recommend this Comforter Set!", 
    "I love this comforter. It's not thick or heavy. Great value.", 
    "Great quality for the price. I don't like big bulky comforters, so this one is perfect and lightweight.", 
    "I wanted a comforter like pictured from XXXXXXXXXXXXX store, but it was waaay expensive. I liked the blue color of this comforter set here at O.co, and the price wasn't too bad, especially since I had reward dollars to help. After I bought it I found the same style set at Target, but it wasn't the same color, and I haven't had the best of luck with quality of Target brand items for bedding over the years. I'm glad I bought this set offered here. It is of decent quality, and as long as you wash and dry it on gentle/low heat settings, the stitches shouldn't come out easy. I've only had one of the \"tufting\" stitches come out so far, and it was in the pillow sham, that gets pulled/shoved/twisted by my husband nightly. If you have a needle, it is easy enough to quickly fix.", 
    "This comforter set is not the cheapest price wise, but definitely cheap quality. I have had it less than a month and 4 of the little twists have come undone on the comforter and some on the pillows (which I don't even actually sleep with) as well. I try to sew them back myself but it's a bit ridiculous that I would have to do that after a month of owning it. Plus the comforter in general wrinkles very easily so it just does not look good anymore. I would really only buy this if using it for a guest bed that won't be used regularly.", 
    "This is not what I expected it to be. The quality of the material is poor. It is not fluffy as shown. It is thin and not even as warm as a blanket. Some of the stitching has already come apart and unraveled. It is not worth the money I paid for it and frankly would like to return it. I would never buy this brand or product again.", 
    "The pillows with the set were beautiful and the fabric and weight of the comforter were nice for the price, but many of the comforter \"gathers\" were either ripped or ripping and, unlike the pillows, the comforter had barely any \"gathering\" and looked like a plain grey comforter. Huge disappointment, was nothing like the photo. I am returning this immediately.", 
    "looks great on the website, its cheaply made inexpensive material not heavy in weight as light as a feather. not for winter nights.it looks so luxurious on the pics posted by the site or manufacturer.i opened the package after waiting about three weeks or so it was so cheap ,then they have the duvet cover on the site but it doesn't come with the small pillow cover?????", 
    "I love this set! Bought Grey and it is a perfect grey! Washed and dryed it and it held up perfect so far!", 
    "I've been looking for this style of comforter for ages and wanted a lighter summer comforter for the summer. I was excited to see this style for a low price, but I was so disappointed when it came, the fill is so cheap it was crinkling. I put it right back in the box to be returned.", 
    "I bought this for guest bedroom it is perfect, love it, I would recommend it", 
    "This is a nice set. Nothing fancy though. I felt that it was an average price. Probably could have gotten something similar at a discount store, and possibly cheaper. One great thing . . . .overstock membership did allow me not to have to pay shipping, I got 5% back from my order, and I didn't have to go out and search for something. I was shocked to see that I got a throw pillow with it. Don't know why I hadn't remembered that. A nice set, but not spectacular. Not too heavy. I wanted something clean, easy to care for, and white. It fit the bill!!!!", 
    "We have had our comforter for a few years now and it still looks great and feels great.", 
    "Soft, lays nice. Perfect fit for my guest bedroom. It comes out wrinkled from the bag, but you would too if you were shoved in a bag (lol). After a few days they do go away. I did take a steamer to help it look better. Happy with my purchase :)", 
    "The accent pillows are gorgeous. The gray does have more of a taupe color but we love it anyway and it is reversible which is perfect!", 
    "I just love this set, love the style and color.", 
    "Beautiful material looks really nice", 
    "Was OK. Nothing special . color was burgundy red. Just seemed cheaper made", 
    "My bedding looks just like the pic love it what can l say xxx", 
    "Got this - wonderful feeling - and bought a set of gray on gray striped sheets for it, too...a soft and soothing way to slip into bed at night!", 
    "The bright white bedding set was a fast, easy and inexpensive way to give a fresh, new look to the bedroom. Good weight and quality for the price. Only complaint is that it arrived a bit wrinkly, but I took care of that with a steamer.", 
    "I really like it looks really good and the fabric is great it feels like cotton I really recommend this product", 
    "I purchased this bedding set for our master bedroom to lighten the room up. Its easy to take care of, doesn't wrinkle easily & looks great with any color decor.", 
    "I put this conforter on my master bed, it is real nice, the material is a little thin and needed pressed, (I spayed it lightly an put it I'm my dryer) it is light weight but I don't use it as a blanket. I would recommend it time my friends. I bought white and it is very white, I am going to order the gold or burgendy as a change up.", 
    "Looked like the picture. I really like it.", 
    "I made this purchase in January of 2014 and I do not regret it. I ordered the grey and it is very pretty, not too light and not too dark. It is puffy and soft, I just love the pin tucks, it seems to be well made and has held up for the past two years. I would order this again if I needed a replacement.", 
    "Lightweight, soft and extremely comfortable! Beautiful on, changed the entire room! Very good for the price!", 
    "As the saying goes\u2026\u2026 You get what you pay for. I do like this comforter set the price was definitely right, but the material is a little bit on the cheap side let me reiterate\u2026\u2026 You get what you pay for . I got this set because I needed to have my other bedspread dry cleaned and didn't want a bare bed in the interim.", 
    "by the time I gave it to them it was to late to send back", 
    "This is a bit thin but works well in the classic bedroom. I gifted it to my daughter and she loves the weight. Not too hot. It has an elegant look but the fabric is more like a percale sheet. Use a duvet later if it necessary...priced right!", 
    "I bought to put in a guest room. It's pretty. It's not overly heavy, like a down comforter would be but will do the trick in the summer months.", 
    "Love this comforter. So soft. You don't want to get out from under it. Made well. Looks great.", 
    "Ordered the chocolate king set and it looks great in our master bedroom. It is easy to wash and has held up great!", 
    "Very happy with it. Haven't washed it yet but it does wear well on the bed. Many complements.", 
    "This item took almost 2 weeks to get to me.Also on the Duvet there is a whole section that has no design on it. I am going to see if I can fix it.It is supposed to have a ruched design ,but is just a flat area. I am not real happy with it", 
    "This is a soft and beautiful comforter set. It's so warm and cozy but not too warm. I like that it's pretty lightweight but is warm. Beautiful too. The patterns and colors of the fabric are gorgeous.", 
    "One of my favorite bedding purchases!", 
    "I was not happy when order came cause it was not the color of Navy shown in pic, and it collects dust cause of the material. I have not but 1 othertime been unhappy but this is one of them. wrinkled and not the color in pic. Shams all wrinkled and I don,t have a steamer and tried the iron thing and I would be there forever. So from now on if I ever need a comforter I am going to the store. This way I will see what I am buying. But dont not but just cause I am unhappy.You may be.", 
    "I ordered they grey color, which turned out to be a really pretty grey/beige color. I was hoping for the comforter to be a little bit thicker, but it makes for a perfect summer bedspread.", 
    "Has done well. Nice to change for the seasons.", 
    "I bought the white set. It is bright white. The fabric is lightweight, maybe a microfiber. The comforter is thick and warm, but wrinkles. It covers my 14\" cal king mattress on both sides, but barely! Overall, I am pleased with it.", 
    "Haven't used it yet, but looks amazing.", 
    "Love this set but after you wash it many times it looses its fullness. I use this for a guest bedroom.", 
    "I am very satisfied with my items Thanks.", 
    "The comforter isn't as fluffy has pictured", 
    "The product met it's advertised quality", 
    "I ordered it in a queen size. It was too small for the bed, so I returned it. It's okay, but looks much fluffier online.", 
    "Thread count is low. It looks nice for a short time before stitches come out of comforter", 
    "Material was poor quality and was so thin it looked like wrinkled bed sheets on the bed. Would not reccomend", 
    "I love the everything about this comforter!!! It's super fluffy and looks just like the picture! Sometimes you order online to find out it doesn't look anything like the picture but this one is really fluffy and pretty.", 
    "The price is great and the product quality is worth the money. It is just as the picture show and looks great on my bed", 
    "At first I was disappointed that this comforter was not a heavier material and it was quite wrinkled, but I found by putting it on the bed and ironing it right there, that this bedspread is beautiful! Bought it for home staging to sell. My room looks great with it and the price was very nice!", 
    "I bought this in teal and it literally brought my room to life!", 
    "Gets lots of compliments. Wears well and having put it through large washing machines it comes out looking like new. The white has neither yellowed or lost its shape or clumped into balled patches. It's nice.", 
    "Very good. My husband likes it so much. Glad to get this one.", 
    "The pleating adds an elegant touch without being over the top. The comforter is light weight. No dust ruffle, but I have a high queen size and ordered a king which worked out perfectly. There are some wrinkles from packaging that are difficult to smooth out.", 
    "Not the quality I would have expected", 
    "My daughter has a think with all white sheets and she just loves this.", 
    "Was not what I expected , never used the comforter set.", 
    "was looking for a very white comforter and this is lovely and white, bright. it looks fab and is very cozy too, very happy with this purchase", 
    "Love it ! Not too hot for sleeping very soft and easy washing . Great price so worth it", 
    "Spent hours trying to get the same smooth look from the picture. Never happened.", 
    "Wonderful comforter. My husband really appreciated that it's light weight and soft. We purchased this to replace our heavy weight down duvet. The material is nice.", 
    "I was really excited when I bought this, but, had to send it back immediately, unfortunately. The color was not accurate or like the picture at all and the material was incredibly cheap. I didn't even take it out of the plastic it was shipped in...it looked that bad.", 
    "I'm almost positive they sent me the wrong color. I had ordered a king size plum and they definitely sent me the burgundy color or their idea of plum is way off. I love the comforter it's soft and the king covers my queen bed just right. I would send it back but don't want to deal wth the returns. I am contacting overstock to see if they will make it right.", 
    "Love the looks, light weight also. Wrinkles easily tho.", 
    "This a great comforter set. Great for any age group.", 
    "Light weight, stylish, and it serves the purpose. If you are looking for a heavy duty comforter, this is not it. Good purchase for me.", 
    "I have been searching for a WHITE King size comforter for a while now !! This one is Great Quality and Looks amazing on my bed !! All the other white comforters I had looked at were $$$-$$$, and this one is a great deal and Beautiful !!", 
    "I ordered the white King size comforter & I was absolutely pleased with it! Although the cotton on the inside was wadded up but it was fixable but other than that it was perfect! It is very warm & not to thick & is light. Highly recommended.", 
    "This was exactly what we needed and we are satisfied with the quality.", 
    "Not pretty! I couldnt get out the wrinkles! It looked like we slept on top of the comforter instead of underneath!", 
    "Color was lighter then I expected.", 
    "Love the beautiful color!!", 
    "I wasn't sure about this set, but I ordered it and when the hubby liked it, I knew it was a winner. The comforter is soft and it looks elegant.", 
    "did not like it, got it out of package and it did not look like the picture so I sent it back", 
    "Grew up using them as a child, lets see what happens as an adult", 
    "Got this set for my bedroom it is absolutely beautiful!", 
    "nice looking but the \"puckering part\" pulls be careful!", 
    "The comforter is very soft and light but keeps us warm! The color was the same as in the pictures so I was happy with that, too. Great deal for the money!!", 
    "This awfull .. Washes terrible !", 
    "Bought this as a Xmas gift for my daughter. It was exactly liked she wanted and she loves it.", 
    "I love the beauty and comfort of this item...I would highly recommend this comforter to all my family and friend.", 
    "I've seen pretty comforter sets like this before and was very excited to see this on the website. However, we i opened the package I was underwhelmed. It was cute, but not elegant as the picture depicts. I think it looked a little cheaper than what i was expecting.", 
    "Great shipping, beautiful product. Only problem is it wrinkles easily. but it is beautiful.", 
    "Looks great on my bed. You can layer with other blankets to add color. I ordered the white.", 
    "I got the mustard color and suits perfectly with the teal tufted headboard and teal bench nice contrast, good buy...", 
    "Very hard to get out the wrinkles", 
    "If ordering, don't expect the Plum color to be Purple upon arrival. It is more Cranberry. Very disappointed that I had to pay return shipping, when the item was nowhere near the color represented...", 
    "Beautiful set. Took forever to be delivered (2&1/2 wks) . Haven't laundered yet so can't vouche for quality of material or workmanship of product. All in all, so far pleased, no problems. Very delicate stitching wouldn't recommend for tough everyday wear and tear. Mine is in a guest room.", 
    "This comforter set was a different material than I anticipated. It was a decent value for the money. Definitely not designer quality. I thought delivery was slow.", 
    "I like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "Nice bedding but the plum is more of a red/burgundy color. I returned it for this reason only. Other than color not matching the rest of my bedroom, I did like the set. It isn't super high quality but the price is right.", 
    "I purchased this for a master bedroom. The design fell apart after one month and one wash. There is a rip in the seam that is not due to any stress or damage, but just poor construction. Would not buy again and will now have to replace when I can afford it. Very disappointing.", 
    "Absolutely love this Carmen comforter set. It is very durable while not being heavy.", 
    "This is a OK set. I found it was made on the small side. If you have a thick mattress it will probably be a little short. Although it does look nice.", 
    "Color a bit darker than I wantes", 
    "My mother-in-law loves her comforter", 
    "Doesn't look as nice as the picture. You get what you pay for.", 
    "It's about what I expected", 
    "Loved this.... Will order more", 
    "Beautiful duvet! I love the softness and it has made the room.", 
    "I ordered this comforter set in gray. The shames and little pillow are a different shade than the comforter. I don't like it and plan to return it.", 
    "Beautiful color. Nice weight.", 
    "Don't feel it's 5 star worthy because I don't feel it is the best of quality or will last as long as some well made comforters. However, I still love it and find it to be very soft, fluffy, and comfortable!", 
    "Quality was 110% Very good price and this design is so feminine.", 
    "Got a great deal on this and it looks as nice on the bed as it does in the picture (which is not always the case with bed covers).", 
    "This comforter set is beautiful and it creates a luxurious atmosphere in my bedroom. I am very pleased.", 
    "Bought this for master bedroom. Perfect for a dreamy look. White is pure white. Love it!", 
    "Soft and comfortable material. Beautiful color. Very good value for what I payed. Took a while to get here though....", 
    "Brought this for my best friend for christmas. Her bedroom is a light blue with white trim. The white comforter set makes the whole room pop!", 
    "We've had this set for over a year now and it has looked beautiful in my daughter's room. Clean, billowy, and better yet...comfortable! I love walking in to chat with her and being drawn to the comfort and warmth of this beautiful set. Try it...you won't regret it!", 
    "I love the look and feel of this product", 
    "Elegante, keeps looking like new.", 
    "This set is gorgeous and absolutely perfect. The material feels great and is of terrific quality.", 
    "The comforter is so soft , It has the right balance cool on warm nights and warm on cool nights . A softness that you just have to feel for your self.", 
    "As an Interior Decorator I would recommend this product to anyone. It has a beautiful design that will compliment any bedroom decor", 
    "This is the prettiest, most comfy and warmest comforter set I've ever purchased!!! It's a beautiful addition to my bedroom and I will be purchasing another color for the spring!!!", 
    "I purchased this 2 years ago and at first I loved it because of the lightness of the material. But the inside stuffing has moved around and it was so wrinkly after washing.", 
    "It accented my room decor very well and was comfortable", 
    "I ordered white, light weight", 
    "Fits and looks very nice on bed!", 
    "This is pretty. However, it is too thin & will send it back!", 
    "We love this new addition to our bedroom. So pretty!", 
    "paired this with some faux fur throw pillows and love the look!! Delivery was fast and would recommend.", 
    "It was very affordable and looked beautiful on my new bed! I am very satisfied!", 
    "Very pretty!! Soft material and beautiful Navy Blue color. I actually bought a comfort from some where else and ended up returning there's and keep this one. Not only was this nicer but cheaper!! Only downfall is my dog loves to jump on my bed and white hair really shows up, but that's just a part of owning a dog.", 
    "Comforter OK I wouldn't order it again", 
    "I bought the white for my daughter. Perfect weight not too heavy, not too light. And it's a bright white. Love it, and washes well.", 
    "I love this. Cook bought one for my daughter that looks great, is versatile, and sturdy.", 
    "The pin-tucking is quite loose (I have a queen size that's perfect) and it doesn't drape far enough down the sides. This is for King bed, maybe that explains it?", 
    "warm and cozy on these cold nights", 
    "I couldn't ask for a more lovely set. Easy to wash, exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "It looks more like a plain white sheet vs the picture. Still soft and average quality.", 
    "Beautiful set but changed my mind after reading the reviews.", 
    "This was suppose to arrive at my home on December 22 because it was a Christmas gift. I ordered it December 14 and just received it on December 29. I was without a gift for my grandaughter and this was the only thing she wanted. Thanks so much Overstock for your horrible delivery...a week late. I will now order from Amazon. I have ordered many things from you but no more. When I tried to find out where it was I got no where with the person on chat. Good Bye Overstock", 
    "the comforter set is very pretty", 
    "Nice set liked that is did not have a bunch of pillow, just simple and soft. Nice color.", 
    "Great style with a low price tag. My room looks great and my bed very stylish and put together with this comforter. Thick and soft and looks great.", 
    "I was apprehensive about ordering online, but read the reviews, and the price was right, so I did. I'm so glad -- it's a beautiful true coral -- not too orange, not too pinkish-red, and is light and fluffy. It's for a FL condo, so I'll likely sleep with a cotton blanket rather than the comforter, but it looks so beautiful on the bed. I accessorized with Trina Turk colorful pillows in white, mixed color patterns (turquoise, lime green, coral, etc.). Oh yes, also bought the Greek Key headboard from Overstock, and it's as reviewed, too -- solid and beautiful.", 
    "Well not so pleased...first off the picture deceived me as I assumed the king size would fit my bed and look as the picture. It does not you need a dust ruffle...second it comes wrinkled and is hard to iron out because of the pleats, Third when you fold it down it wrinkles more...wrong type of material if you like the neat look.", 
    "This set is extraordinary and would like to suggest a pale blue as it would compliment the master bedroom. This would be relegated to a guest bedroom. The pleating is what makes it look much more elegant and expensive. Highly recommend.", 
    "This item is the color it says it is (coral) It is great quality for the money and nicely made.", 
    "Minus the wrinkles the comforter is cute and simple. ( fair) Not amazing but not bad either", 
    "Bought this in plum as a Christmas gift for my best friend. She received it and it was a totally different color that she cannot use. Now she doesn't have a present from me and in order for her to receive a replacement or something else, I have to get in touch with Overstock, give her email address so she can receive a return label instead of them just send it to her. I am superbly disappointed.", 
    "Love in and is comfortable .", 
    "This set is gorgeous. I was a little apprehensive on buying this after the reviews but I decided to anyways. The fabric is a little thin but definitely softer than most comforter sets I've purchased before.", 
    "Love it. This comforter is very soft and comfortable. Looks great.", 
    "This is a nice set but it arrived with some loose threads and I found a similar item for a better price elsewhere.", 
    "I was concerned because of some of the reviews, but this comforter is just what I was looking for! It looks fantastic and is extremely comfortable to sleep under. Not hot at all. Airy feel and lightweight and doesn't crush my feet. I stay nice and comfortably warm without getting hot. Love it!", 
    "Beautiful comforter. Will be getting more for gifts.", 
    "This comforter set looks so pretty on our guest room bed! I can't wait for my guests to enjoy its comfort!", 
    "Cheap fabric, loose threads, returned it.", 
    "Lint and other things attach very easy to the material and it is not easy to come off. I was expecting better quality.", 
    "Just like the comforters in elegant hotels. Looks beautiful.", 
    "This comforter was a disappointment...it was too small for my queen bed, the color wasn't what I expected, and the quality of the fabric was inferior. I sent it back, but was out $** for shipping. :-(", 
    "Happy with the classy look of this set. Color matches everything and I have had no problems with the sewing or seams coming apart as seen in other reviews.", 
    "Is so soft and looks great. I was surprised to receive a throw pillow with the set...love it", 
    "Like it so well I bought another!", 
    "It's very light comforter paired with quilt perfect for winter and summer months good by itself", 
    "I received the comforter in a torn outer package. The accessory pillow was a bright Orange, not burgundy color as ordered. The material is very scratchy and not at all what is described. It will work for a guest bed but would not recommend if looking for something to sleep with nightly.", 
    "not too heavy or warm. good for warm climates. lasted about 8 months before it started to tear up in the washing machine.", 
    "I got the blue green color and its been about a year and I still love this comforter! Very soft and looks great! Thinking of even getting one for the guest bedroom but I don't want to be redundant", 
    "This set is very pretty, however it falls apart at the gathered points As you can see there are over 100 points that are gathered to make the design and when 5 or 6 of these fall apart the design is ruined! Would not recommend this set unless you are willing to keep sewing up the fall outs", 
    "this was a gift and my daughter loves it", 
    "Very nice; classy and good quality", 
    "The comforter set looks well made from outside the packaging. I never opened the actual package and took it out, because I ordered plum and it looks like a very red burgundy. I was look for a purpley plum color, so I had to return because it didn't match. But looking at the product, it looks like it is well sewn and good quality.", 
    "Soft and very good quality...not too heavy.", 
    "This comforter is beautiful, and comfortable.", 
    "this has gotten many compliments but you do have to handle with care.", 
    "I really hoped this would have the detailed stitching like in the picture, but instead the pleats are not as noticeable as in the picture. Comforter runs big", 
    "This is by far the best comforter I have ever owned. We have 2 dogs and a cat and it does very well with pet hair. It is easy to shake or brush off pet hair. Also easy to wash in the washing machine. I have washed it many many times and it still looks great. My boyfriend gets hot really easy and he loves this comforter. It keeps me warm but keeps him from getting too hot. I have had mine for several years now and it still looks great. We just bought a house and I'm buying another one for our spare room.", 
    "It's not bad, but It's much smaller then pictured. Definitely needs a bedskirt and if you have a good mattress, it won't cover from the top of the bed to the bottom of it. Arrived very wrinkled. Hope that comes out with time.", 
    "Love it very warm and stylish", 
    "Love the blue color and the quality of the material. Very soft to the touch. Each little pinched area is strong and stays intact even with kids and dogs jumping up and down off of it.", 
    "I bought the turquoise comforter for a beach rental and it is perfect! Beautiful color, great price, and quality. Highly recommend.", 
    "This is a great set. We bought it because my husband and I don't like a heavy comforter. It's has been great so far. We haven't washed it yet though.", 
    "Nice, but not true to color.", 
    "I love it. Only thing is it is not as wide as I thought. Otherwise a good priduct", 
    "the comforter set it very nice my daughter loves it.", 
    "Very warm and nice looking for price, great value and highly recommend", 
    "Definitely not as thick as the picture leads you to believe but the color was awesome (I got the mustard) and the material is comfy.", 
    "Really like the look and color was beautiful", 
    "Very soft and loving the tufted style on the comforter. Good quality and totally recommend this to everyone.", 
    "nicccccccccccccccccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeeeeeee", 
    "Good quality. I would purchase again in a different color.", 
    "The set is well constructed and looks great on the bed. I will say it may run small. I am using a king size on a queen bed and it is not too large.", 
    "Cheap cheap cheap, sent it back immediately! Keep in mind, no bed skirt. Size is small. I do not recommend", 
    "We brought the King for our queen and it just perfect! Soft, luxury feel to them! So impressed!", 
    "The Carmen comforter and pillows set is lovely and snuggly. The set washes well.", 
    "have had for a while very warm.", 
    "Pretty but skimpy, wish I had ordered king size for queen bed.", 
    "Comforter is not true to size. Queen size seems more like a full fit", 
    "I have this comforter in gray and love it so much I bought it in white too!", 
    "Received the comforter after coming back from vacation and found it to be very poor quality and several of the stitched tucks unstitched.. After paying $$ that's not acceptable. Very disappointed looks Nothing like in the picture.", 
    "Not high quality, but looks nice and easy to maintain. Better than a duvet cover.", 
    "I regret buying this, my initial instinct was to return it & I wish I did. Right out of the bag the material just felt so staticky but I figured that would pass so I put it on the bed, it didn't fit in the washer so that was a bummer, but 2 days later the first stitch came undone when pulling up the comforter & it was all down hill from there. Within the next month there were one dozen stitches that came undone then I tried to sew them back up myself since I didn't think I'd be able to return it after using it & no luck, stitches continued to break anytime the comforter was pulled one way or the other. I've been meaning to write this review for a long time but didn't get around to it. I don't recommend this cheaply made product whatsoever.", 
    "I've enjoyed this set very much & highly recommend", 
    "Made very cheap. No stability to it. The color was totally different. In the pictures, it was navy When it came it looks more like a blue green.", 
    "Love Love this set ,looks so nice on my bed so much so I got one for another room !", 
    "This is the second comforter I order and had to return because the color was not what I wanted. The picture and the description said blue, but in reality, it's more of a teal and leans green.", 
    "I was coming from having a down comforter and was not sure if I would like this one. It is so soft and beautiful in my bedroom. Highly recommend.", 
    "I purchased this set for my 17 year old. She loves it! Excellent quality for the price! I was a bit leery about purchasing white for the winter but quickly discovered this is quite pretty when accessorized with fall colors...Christmas will be even more beautiful I suspect.", 
    "A nice set for the price.", 
    "Love this! Good quality and cozy", 
    "Works well. Grey is very pretty. Maybe doesn't feel as thick as i thought, but works well", 
    "This is a really pretty comforter. It looks just like the photo. My only issue is that if you're sitting on top of it, and it gets tugged at all, the thread holding the gathered parts together pops, and wrecks the look of the comforter in that spot. I only used it for about six months, and then had to switch it up because it was starting to look ratty.", 
    "Totally happy with this lovely comforter set. It feels great, it looks great and the price was right.", 
    "'Sort of' a 'shabby/chic' look. Good value.", 
    "The material inside the comforter was completely stiff and defective on one portion along the side.", 
    "I needed something to stage a bedroom for viewing. It did the trick. I received many complements. It is crisp white and plush. It held up to washing and low drying. The added pillow is nice.", 
    "I ordered this and when it arrived I was very pleased with the color and design. The fabric is very soft and fluffy, it is pretty warm which isn't always the best in the south, but this makes a wonderful winter comforter", 
    "Very cheap looking and way to light. Have a queen size bed but order a king. It still does not cover the bed. Using it in my cat bed.", 
    "This was for my daughters room, she loved it.", 
    "nice for the price--- starting to notice it falling apart in places and only have used it a few months", 
    "This is a great set. The fabric has a suede like feel, which I like. Color was right on.", 
    "We have this comforter in our guest bedroom and it's perfect! Great quality, color is the same as in the picture, and it makes the room look much more elegant than it was before. I recommend this set!", 
    "This beautiful bedding is cozy to sleep with and is the perfect weight...didn't get too hot or cold in it. Love it!", 
    "Wrinkled and not what I expected. Returned.", 
    "Very thin material. Stitching comes apart. I gently pulled the cover to make the bed and two of the diamond gathers came apart so now it looks even cheaper.", 
    "This comforter set fits my bed and pillows well. Funnily, I know I bought a white comforter, but this is a WHITE comforter ... blinding, fresh fallen snow, WHITE.", 
    "I washed it once after my newborn messed on it and ever since then it's been coming apart in various places. The little throw pillow was never wash and it too was tearing. I only owned it for a month before I gave it away", 
    "This comforter is amazing. Soft, extra large for my king size bed. The pintucking is beautiful. I washed and dried it before putting it on my bed and it came out beautifully!", 
    "This is a very bright white...exactly what I wanted. Bought the king size for a queen size bed. Seems to be longer than average...and the sides are a little skimpy. I've put it on crosswise and it seems to work better. Because other comments talked about how light it is I thought it would work in the south (with air conditioning lower at night)...it is still very warm. Probably will be just right for the fall and winter here.", 
    "Very nice I bought in 2 different colors. Good quality as well.", 
    "I would give this 0 stars if I could. The cheapest product I've ever purchased on Overstock. The comforter sounds like it has plastic bags in it.", 
    "Brought this King set to go on a Queen size bed and it is too small even for that size. Might recommend King size for maybe a full size bed. Also, has lots of wrinkles that are hard to get out. However, the set is so pretty and very soft that my granddaughter wanted to keep it so I did. Otherwise I am usually very happy with my purchases and will continue to buy from Overstock. Thanks.", 
    "Comforter detailing adds texture for a great look for the bedroom. I added colored pillows for a pop of color. Feels like a luxury hotel!", 
    "Beautiful chocolate color that adds rich color to any room.", 
    "I purchased the taupe \"king\" comforter... It does not reach on the sides of my mattress.. Disappointed.", 
    "I've always wanted to try white bedding, but had concerns about soiling it simply with normal handling, let alone what a family and pets can cause. I am so glad I bought this, though. Our bed was very \"busy\" looking before (a multi colored comforter); this white bedding gives it a much cleaner look, and I bring a little color in with the sheets and pillow cases. I will definitely add a throw or blanket so there will always be some alternative to sitting directly on the white (or putting our luggage on it, or laundry basket, or whatever else we place on the bed). Have not tried to wash it yet, and I have concerns about this because the batting seems to be a little loose throughout, since it is only tacked at every 'x'. I may run a stitch along each edge to give it a little more firmness. Between making the bed and pulling up the covers, the edges will get a lot of wear and I am concerned how it will hold up as is. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars; otherwise, would have been a 5. I really love this comforter set!", 
    "I ordered the king size in blue, the color is pretty true to the picture (perhaps a little lighter). The sides are very short which is noticeable even on my platform bed. After washing it, the filling tends to bunch but not so much that it is a big problem. It is soft, and I find it to be a good medium weight for sleeping.", 
    "Love this quilt set. Great quality \\.", 
    "Gave this to a friend for a gift. She loved it.", 
    "Durable and easy to clean.", 
    "Second one for me... Soft, warm, and goes with all decor", 
    "This set added needed bright touch to Cape Cod master bedroom with mainly green coordination in rug, bathroom, and furnishings. King-size fir on bed was very appropriate as was sham & pillow accent. Hoping our household will take care to keep sparkling white color. Weight is very good for warmer weather with just sheets, or for cooler weather with light weight blanket addition.", 
    "I love this comforter. Is is so cozy", 
    "Arrived exactly on time. Soft, pretty and very comfortable. Light, whichI like. Similar material to another comforter I bought last year. Feminineand adds elegance to my room. Haven't washed it as I just received it recently, but feel confident it will be fine in my washer and dryer.", 
    "I really do love this comforter. After reading some reviews I was apprehensive, but I'm so glad I took the plunge and got it! It's crisp white and adds a really elegant touch to my bedroom. The queen size fit my bed perfectly! I'm a little worried about how to go about washing it, but I put a blanket on top of it when I'm just lounging to help keep it from getting dirty. Overall it's one of my favorite things in my bedroom!", 
    "Sized correctly , good color & fabric choice.", 
    "Very soft, good quality but I did not end up liking the taupe color. Would recommend.", 
    "I bought this queen size set for my high school age daughter and it's a perfect fit. It's classy yet functional, with a nice design element on the top of the comforter, with the gathering. These perfectly matched our existing Nicole Miller white curtains. It is not as iridescent as I anticipated, but this is a good thing, as she can lay on the outside of the comforter without damaging any of the design features. We are both happy with this purchase.", 
    "I love this beautiful comforter set. It add such a nice touch to my decor and it is very well made.", 
    "Love! Love this set! Very soft and soothing. Has a bright white that gives my M bedroom over the cloud look.", 
    "My only gripe would be that the pleats aren't more prominent. Comforter is soft and well sewn. Wrinkled out the bag, but most have disappeared after a few weeks. Overall, I'm pleased.", 
    "Very elegant set. Very soft and looks great against my daughters dark gray tufted headboard. Lightweight but will keep you warm.", 
    "I love the look of this set. The color and fabric are exactly what I was looking for. Light silverish gray with a slight sheen to it. Only problem is that is is kind of wrinkly when it arrives and needs to be ironed which takes forever due to the pleats but totally worth it to get the look I was going for.", 
    "Great looking comforter and great price. Only issue is you need to be careful pulling this as some of the seams rip - certainly reach out to Overstock as they take care of you!", 
    "Purchased for my brother and sister -in -law and they absolutely loved this item. Comfy yet stylish.", 
    "Great for the price and it's so pretty.", 
    "I'm very happy with the quality and value of this set. It looks great.", 
    "dog sleeps on it, awful, I'm donating to sharing and caring", 
    "Really comfortable and pretty! Just a little complaint...the way the comforter was folded inside the package, kind of made the pinched pleats flatten out on one side :(", 
    "And the stitching was defective. So poorly made. I considered keeping it defective & all just so I don't have to deal with the return hassle.. but I don't even want it in my home it is so cheaply constructed.", 
    "Stitching where gathering are not very durable", 
    "Love, Love, Love this comforter set. It is on my daughters bed. It looks beautiful. We don't use it every night so I don't know about comfort and if it gets too hot. We roll it down and use a blanket. Very well made.", 
    "The comforter is warm and looks nice; however, I've had it for a few months and the batting seems to be bunching.", 
    "This comforter has nice clean lines and give my bedroom a classy look without being over done.", 
    "Very, Very comfortable and washes so easily. Just the right price and just what I was looking for.", 
    "The fabric looked cheap and the filling was very thin, not the luxurious appearance of the photos. After using for 3-4 months, fabric began to tear. I would not recommend this product.", 
    "I love the color & Look I chose (Blue) the material to me feels different then I'm used too. However I think it's because I'm used to down comforters", 
    "I had this comforter in orange but later purchased a bigger bed, so I ordered the same comforter again in blue for a change. The king size fits my bed very well. Hangs nicely over sides and end. The blue is accurately described as Aqua, not teal. It's a lovely shade. Not too bright. The batting in it sometimes doesn't stay where it should, but it can be fixed with a quick shake. I washed the orange one several times, and it held up well.", 
    "I love it, and it looks great!!", 
    "I got the gray one. It is a pretty comforter. The material is so soft. I really like it", 
    "was not happy with the comforter....when washed and dryed it wrinkled bad", 
    "love white but never looks quite right, wrinkled, doesn't smooth out will", 
    "very pretty.great quality.", 
    "I love my comforter. It's exactly what I wanted", 
    "lovely color however there is very little filing, appears very flat almost like a sheet", 
    "chic looking. the stitching could be a little better but overall, you get what you pay for. it is a light comforter so winters in new england, double up on blankets. great for the summer months.", 
    "I gave to my mom for you birthday and she loved it", 
    "This is a great set - nice and neutral. Despite some other reviews, this fit our extra tall king perfectly - it was not too short. Love the pillows it came with. Not super high quality, but a great cover for the day!", 
    "I have had this comforter for a couple of months now and have been very happy with it. I needed a cream colored comforter, so I ordered the taupe. While it is darker than a typical cream color, it works well for my needs. My favorite thing about it is how soft it is. It is lighter weight than I anticipated, so I had to add a blanket on cold nights. It will be perfect for this summer. I have machine washed it without any problems and it returns to its soft, fluffy condition. Some reviews have mentioned that the stitching is too delicate and can tear. This almost occurred to me when I was making the bed and didn't realize that the comforter had gotten tucked in. Now I am more cautious and haven't had any problems. I would definitely recommend this comforter but just caution against pulling it.", 
    "Haven't had it more than 6 months, washed it once and it came out with tears and strings loose. It's very pretty if you don't plan to actually use it. Don't buy!", 
    "Beautiful comforter and pillow. They do need to be ironed, which takes quite a while. It is very wrinkly when it comes out of the package, so take the time to iron it. It's worth it. Once ironed, it looks just like the photo and is so pretty. I love my comforter. I'm trying to keep it clean though so I don't need to wash and re-iron it!", 
    "Excellent quality item. Is not showing signs of wear after several months of use.", 
    "Only thing I didn't like was the picture of the blue bedspread is not what came. It had a bit of green in it. But, other than that. I love it.", 
    "It looked like something I would see laying in the road. Quality was non-exsistant. I would not have purchased it at any price if I had seen it first", 
    "I love this comforter set for my guest bedroom. It's a nice bright white and the fabric is soft. The fabric is a little on the thin side but it looks rich and elegant. Some of the reviews said it wasn't wide enough and they sized up but I didn't have that problem. I also have a down comforter underneath it and the width is perfect. I wouldn't want it to hang down any lower. You can't beat the price either!", 
    "I wanted more than one set so now I have 2 sets and they are both great", 
    "This comforter set is much too busy with it's puffy seams. I had to return it, which was not a problem at all.", 
    "The concept was great but the product arrived very wrinkled with no way to press it. Quality was not up to par. Had to return.", 
    "This grey comforter is beautiful, light weight but heavy enough to keep you nice and warm and it really makes the room shine! My bedroom is grey and chocolate romantic chic and this comforter is EVERYTHING! I would definitely buy it again! 5 stars!", 
    "I love the style of this comforter set and ordered it in blue. When it arrived and I opened the box it was definitely not blue-it was green. I was so disappointed!!!! There is no way it should ever be called blue and the photo showed it was the blue I needed to match my room. The photo should be shown in the correct color and not deceive people.", 
    "Very nice quality and the color is rich looking. Over stock is very easy to do business with. They really care about their customers , I would definitely recommend this bedspread and doing business with overstock,com", 
    "I was pretty disappointed with this comforter - it just looks really wrinkled and then the seams ripped in a few different areas.", 
    "This was just the set that I wanted and not disappointed.", 
    "Simple and sophisticated! Great value for the money!", 
    "Good weight and materials was really nice", 
    "Going to return this item.......material too thin to feel nice and it hold wrinkles too readily.", 
    "Color is exactly what I was looking for chocolate brown. Comforter is very thin not plush at all. But it looks very nice in the guest room. Dry cleaned before putting on bed and have not experienced any loose treads Other than standard shams picture is accurate.", 
    "Is bountiful both I was looking for the White one, bath Its look goo too.thanks!", 
    "This is a plush comforter. Nice amd soft and a great shade of blue.", 
    "The picture looks shiny but the set isn't. For the price this was an good deal. I do love the look of this pin tuck design. The materiel could of been better.", 
    "Hard to match the color but otherwise I love it", 
    "I have been very pleased with this bedding set. Looks great on the bed. Fits my king size bed well. I read some reviews that said it was wrinkled when they opened it. It did have wrinkles due to it being shipped in a box but I ironed the wrinkles out with a regular iron. No problem. I would recommend this set. One more thing, my set did not come with a bed skirt which was fine because I don't need one with my bed. But if you need one you might want to double check on that.", 
    "Nice, soft material, interesting design. Middle weight for all seasons.", 
    "Bought this in Brown, as the Grey was sold out. Love it!", 
    "Super cute- washes up very nicely - great quality for the price!", 
    "We use this in the master bedroom. It is a beautiful set and makes the bed look wonderful. I wish it were a tad larger on all sides, but even so it works great on our kind size bed. Recommended highly.", 
    "I kept bc I don't like to return, I gave that to my daughter, it's a good set, but BIG ERROR on the color sent it to me as a WHITE and was IVORY/LITE YELLOW.", 
    "My client did not like the quality - had to return", 
    "This seems like a nice quality item, however the blue is not blue as the pic shows. It is more of a sagey green color. Definitely will return it.", 
    "This comforter is warm but not too heavy, and it is very pretty. I got the blue color, and although I was looking for more of a darker teal color this looks very nice.", 
    "Love the color. It is a true white. Extremely soft! Actually wasn't expecting it to be that soft. Very pleased!", 
    "I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!! Very good quality-- and warm :)", 
    "I loved the way this comforter looked. It was very lovely and made my bed look like a cloud. Perhaps I did not launder it properly, but I thought I followed the instructions and the comforter came out irreparably damaged.", 
    "The quality is good and fits nicely however the color was much darker than shown in the picture. So you need to be aware of that.", 
    "Not sure about the blue/green color I picked yet but great quality.", 
    "Tore really easy and made poorly.", 
    "Love this bedspread. Always looks great.", 
    "softer than it appears & a beautiful gray for a great price", 
    "A Little let down on the quality and stability of the headboard. I purchase one in September similar for my daughter and it was great so I thought it would be safe and I paid less for hers.", 
    "This is a very attractive comforter set. Material is quite soft with little sheen. This would have had a five star rating, but it did arrive quite wrinkled and is not that easy to iron since it isn't a flat surface. A steamer would probably take care of the wrinkles quite easily.", 
    "I bought this and don't get me wrong, it's beautiful on the bed. All the stitching has pretty much come apart. This started the first week and worse when I first washed it.", 
    "Very comfortable with enough loft to stay warm. Wide enough to adequately cover both sides of the bed. It makes getting out of bed in the morning even more difficult.", 
    "I love my comforter ( 5 stars) but I wish the pillow cases were not that thin. (2stars) I play around by putting pillows In front of those pillows so it is not that obvious and I had to buy completely white pillows since mine had a small blue line that you could see through those pillow cases. Not enough a burden to return it since as I said the comforter is great and washes so easily. Very light and soft.", 
    "I love this comforter set and may purchase another for my downstairs bedroom !! I purchased the beige and it is exactly what I expected. I was a bit hesitant in purchasing because the price was so low, but the quality is much higher than the price. It washes well. The only negative about the set is the small throw pillow which doesn't have a removable cover.", 
    "Nice. Enjoying it very much", 
    "This was just what I wanted and appeared exactly as picture showed. Love it!!", 
    "Looked nice before washing. I followed the laundry instructions exactly however it looked trashy and cheap after first wash. Also, the pintucks came out on first wash - 2 on one sham, 4 on the other sham, and 3 or 4 on the comforter. Tried to fix pintucks by hand sewing but that was a hassle because more would need fixed after each wash. Also I \"burnt\" the comforter in the dryer, even on lowest setting, since it is a cheap thin material. Very disappointed -- only used this set for 5 months, thankfully I still have my old comforter to use until I replace this.", 
    "I ordered this comforter set after tons of research. I didn't want a high maintenance comforter that requires dry cleaning or going to a laundromat. I was pleasantly surprised after washing it in my regular top loading washing machine on the gentle cycle and then letting it air dry, there were barely any wrinkles. This comforter is very soft (way softer than I expected) and looks great on my bed! My only complaint is the king size is a little small for my king size mattress. It covers the entire bed but barely drapes on either side. For the price though, this conforter set is great and I would highly recommend it!!", 
    "We like it very much. Very good value. Only 4 stars as it is not \"expensive\" looking - which of course it is not! Great for a casual bedroom.", 
    "Looks nothing like the picture.. cheap and flat. Severely disappointed.", 
    "The comforter is extremely soft, warm and pleasant to sleep under. It looks very elegant and can brighten up any room. I was very happy with my purchase, even though I am quite a picky shopper.", 
    "We were looking for a neutral color and this bed ensemble was perfect! The design on the top is very pretty. Happy with purchase.", 
    "It looks like an item that belongs in the Better Homes & Garden magazine. We loved our bed and mattress before we received the comforter. We love the feel as we snuggle at the end of a busy day. Thank the lucky designers, manufacturers, buyers (procurement purchases) and sellers (profit sharers) for us (me), epmb.", 
    "This set is really beautiful. Others have written on it that it pulls apart easily, and it probably would if you started pulling on it. When I rearrange the bedding, I lift the section that I am moving, instead of pulling on it, and I haven't had any problem with stitches coming out. It looks like a designer piece.", 
    "This set is more beautiful in person. the color was exactly the same as you seen on screen...make my room look so sophisticated...very soft. definitely and would recommend this to anyone. getting one for my daughter..", 
    "guess it wont be here by christmas.. thats sad.. why do you offer the special guarantee that it would be", 
    "I have this in both my master and guest bedroom, just in different colors.I have a cat who loves to play under the covers and it has held up so well with the beating it takes!hahaGreat item, great color, great price.", 
    "A few of the gathering stitches have come loose. Other than that, it looks good. I don't think I'd buy it again, though.", 
    "The only bad overstock purchase I have ever made. Poor quality. The first comforter fell apart during first wash, so I thought maybe it was a bad one, ordered again, came out of the wash pilled. The tucks / pleats began to come out after the 2nd wash. Don't waste your time on this one, I hate to say.", 
    "This is the most beautiful bedspread and is the perfect weight and so soft. I have had it over a year now and it still looks new. Love it!", 
    "Bought 2 of these - one for guest bedroom and one for master. Lightweight but still provides some weight for sleeping without being too warm (good for AZ weather). Looks great. The accent pillow looks a little cheap so I am not using it but overall, no complaints and the price was great. I have seem similar comforters at much higher price points.", 
    "I love the plushness of the comforter but the taupe color borderlines on being peach and I'm not a huge fan of that color.", 
    "Very nice and looks beautiful on our bed. Looked at a lot of sets, and this one was the best value, and the color I wanted.", 
    "I ordered a King for a Queen bed, and glad I did. The size is just right!! The fabric is wonderful. Its very warm, soft and my 2 dogs love it. The quality is very nice. It washes very well. I took it to the laundry matt and used a big washer. I cool air dryed it though. It washed very well. I was afraid it wouldn't do well in the washer because of the other reviews, thats why I took it to the laundry matt. I used a **** **** and it did well. All the dog thingesss were gone. I'm very happy with this comforter!! I'm sure you will, too :0)", 
    "The website photos were gorgeous but reality is that the comforter is very thin and has wrinkles that won't come out. Very disappointed.", 
    "It's very short and wouldn't cover the sides of the mattress at all...not even close. Jut looked cheap and not elegant like the picture", 
    "Great comforter, very pleased with this purchase, would definitely recommend this product!", 
    "Love this comforter. It's the perfect level of thickness. Not too thick and not too thin. Love the fabric material. Very soft and flattering.", 
    "love the comforter. will recommend to my friends. light and seasonal and comfortable", 
    "Bought this comforter for my daughter's college apartment. Very pretty.", 
    "I could have done better by quilting together some toilet paper and stuffing it with low grade cotton balls. Please spare yourself the hassle of returning it and purchase something else.", 
    "It is so warm and cozy!!!! It's not heavy in weight, but it's so comphy, not extra blankets needed. I bought the gray color and its so pretty. Just masculine enough for my husband, but not manley. Mix with different shades of grey through put your room with silver accents for a \"classic glam\" look.", 
    "This comforter set was above what I was expecting for the price. It's hard to find a good selection of Cal King comforter sets that are reasonably priced. This particular set containes the comforter, 2 king pillow shams and 1 decorative pillow. Although it is a solid color, the texture adds an element of interest and design. I added more decorative pillows to give the bed some color. Looks great in my space! I'm so happy with this product.", 
    "Very warm and comfortable. Lays perfectly on the bed. Seams are straight and the product seems to be nicely manufactured. The colors are warm and vibrant.", 
    "Color is perfect for my bedroom decor! Love the detail and matching pillow.", 
    "Not a bad piece for the value. One of the pleats was undone, but it took 2 minutes to stitch back. Expected it to be a little heavier, but it still look great in my client's guest bedroom.", 
    "Similar sets are so much more expensive in the catalogs. I've been eyeballing the ones at W*st E** for a long time and I'm so glad for overstock to get one just like that one but so much cheaper. It is soft and silky with a slight sheen. It is thick enough not to appear at all shabby on the bed- looks exactly like the picture in this regard. It is also not super thick, which I did not want living in Florida. I cannot speak as to how it holds up as I just received it. After reading the reviews, I too ordered the king for a queen size bed and the size is perfect. Of course when you order the king for a queen you will also get king size shams, but it's an easier fix than a comforter that is too short. I ordered the taupe and it is not even close to taupe. I actually think the color is much prettier than what is pictured so I'm fine with that. I would call it a dark cream color with an ever so slight yellow undertone. It may appear like a champagne depending on what color is on your walls. The set I received is definitely not taupe, tan or khaki. The batting does not feel top-of-the-line when you squeeze it but is is very comfortable and does not look cheap at all on the bed. It looks elegant and modern and you feel like you are sleeping in fluffy clouds. For under $**for the entire set, I am thrilled with it so far. I will probably dry clean rather than wash due to the pintuck stitching.", 
    "Expected a better quality comforter. still very good and usable but would not buy again with this price.", 
    "This comforter is a lovely neutral color. Not quite taupe, not quite gray, not quite cream. It lays nicely on be bed, the shams look great, and best of all it is SO soft. It is still too warm for us to use it at night, but I can't wait to wrap myself up in it!", 
    "Looks good and is very light weight, when they have another one like it in a different color I will buy it.", 
    "I love our new, blue comforter! It adds so much to the room and it looks so nice all the time now. I get complements all the time and I am always asked where I bought it. There are a few loose strings now after normal use, but I just tie them off and trim them. Really it's held up well with a cat, dog (who knows she's not supposed to get on the bed) and 2 one year olds.", 
    "Ordered the brown color It looks very nice and is pretty warm. We ordered for our king size bed and It is a little short on sides..so I had to buy a bed skirt...so wished would of bought a California king. My only other complaint is the two shams are already starting to come unsewn. For the amount of money I thought would of been better quality.", 
    "The comforter was not as nice as I thought it would be and the comforter for a queen bed hardly fits so I would recommend going a size up to cover the sides of the mattress. I would have returned it but didn't want to mess with getting the comforter back into the bag. It does look exactly the same so I am happy about that, it's just not the size and quality I would have liked.", 
    "Perfect weight soft comforter. Looks more expensive than it is. It's a good quality comforter set, especially for the price for the King. I was shopping for a set to get me by until I found something else. I didn't know I would like it so much! I'm no longer shopping for comforter sets.", 
    "I really like this comforter - light enough for Texas summer evenings; the style allows it to never look rumpled. The color complements most any furniture.", 
    "This set definitely looks like what is depicted in the image, however the taupe has a yellow undertone which I was not expecting and what I am most disappointed with is how it feels...the sheets are soft however the fill for the comforter itself feels like the scratchy stuffing often found in pet/dog dogs. :( I wish it felt nicer but it no longer is something I use as a blanket, instead it now sadly serves more like a mattress pad.", 
    "Lightweight and looks great. I am hoping that it's easy to wash.", 
    "The comforter is soft and warm - actually a little too warm for me - I am always hot! Not sure why some said it was light. Very good look - love it in my room - gray is a great charcohol shade.", 
    "I love this set! Everyone should own at least 1! It looks very elegant yet casual at the same time.", 
    "Beautiful color. Very soft and comfortable. My daughter wants a set for her room too!", 
    "The Comforter was everything I ordered and looks awesome on the bed.", 
    "The comforter included in this set feels like it was made of foam. The comfort-ability of the comforter is awful, it feels exactly like you are sleeping with covered foam- almost rough and stiff. There is no thickness or softness as expected by a true comforter, I regret opening the package. I expected way more from the product.", 
    "I love the spread. It is not too thick and bulky on the bed. It fits and hangs on the sides of the bed just right. I am very pleased. It is just what I wanted! Very attractive!", 
    "I never saw the bedspread, it was a gift for my daughter but she is very happy with it.", 
    "This comforter set came with an excellent feel and looks great ! The quality is better than expected.! Very pleased with this set. This is the second set I have ordered and I was very satisfied!!!!Thank you!", 
    "I received the Grey comforter in King size. The size fits well. In the picture it looks more fancy than it is in real life. Some of the tufting is weak but I still really like it and so far it's very comfortable. I've only had it for a short time so I don't know how well it lasts. The Grey is darker than I thought it would be but still pretty.", 
    "Haven't washed the comforter yet, but the quality is nice and it is very attractive.", 
    "Taupe set is true to the picture, a light tan. Not as poofy as I though, but warm and looks good on the bed.", 
    "I have one of these in my NY home and loved it ...so knew it would be great ...and it is. Price of my New York cover was a bit less than this one which explains the the good, rather than excellent rating of its value", 
    "Super buy, every one who sees it makes a very positive comment,", 
    "This product is creme not taupe. It's good quality but I did not want a comforter that light in color.", 
    "Love this comforter. It's very soft and so pretty! Great neutral color (which is what I was looking for).", 
    "This comforter looks and feels great. Received just as described!", 
    "My comforter arrived sooner than expect, and I LOVE it! It's super comfy, bright white, and perfect for Chicago weather. I couldn't be happier.", 
    "I love my new Bedspread! It was the best price I could find at Overstock.com and it looked better than some I had seen in stores!", 
    "Just what I was looking for--comforter & shams without a bunch of \"extras\". The color turned out to be more of a greenish blue than the blue in the picture, but I was even more satisfied with the color. I couldn't believe the price & took a chance & was more than pleasantly surprised with the quality.", 
    "Great product already on bed! And looks great and beautiful.", 
    "pin tucks pull out right away. super comfy and soft but the design does not hold up if you are going to actually use it. Otherwise for a guest room that is never used it would be ok.", 
    "I received the wrong color but I am very happy with aqua blue color, it gives a brighter aspect in the bedroom.", 
    "This set is nice, the comforter seems quality and has held up well after 6 months of everyday use. It is a good size and fits the king size bed well. It is not too hot in the winter and not too cold in the summer. looks great on the bed. will purchase again.", 
    "I just love this bedspread. It really makes the bed look great.", 
    "This is a nice product however it does not fit a QUEEN size bed. It is too small. Hangs over edge about 12 inches on one side and 9 on the other. I should have ordered a KING size. But since a package deal the pillowcases would have been way too big ALSO the blue is not blue", 
    "ordered king size very small for bed very lite weight", 
    "I always wanted one of those bedrooms with beautiful white linens. Now I have it. The kids have moved out and I have turned one of their rooms into the guest room. I purchased an iron sleigh bed (from Overstock) and this pretty white comforter set, white sheets as well. It did not disappoint. I finally have it. If you are on the fence, just get it it is very very nice.", 
    "I am truly satisfied of the quality and the pricing..", 
    "It is very wrinkle prone-even after using the steamer on it. I have had no problems with the threads pulling loose at the pleats as was mentioned in other reviews.", 
    "I was impressed by the quality of the comforter, especially since it was such a good price. It was fluffy and looks amazing on our bed. The color was pretty true to the picture. I'd definitely recommend this comforter.", 
    "Such a cute comforter. Great price and quick shipping; it was an overall great purchase!", 
    "I'm very pleased with this product. The color is beautiful and looks great in our guest room. I also like the additional decorative pillow. This is a super buy since it includes the two shams as well.", 
    "Perfect for spring temperatures, without heat or AC. The weight and warmth is just right to keep you comfortable all night. It looks good as well.", 
    "I was diaapointed reguarding the color of the Blue. Its more green than blue. I bought curtains to match the color I thought was blue. I wanted to send it back but decided to keep it to avoid the hassle. Its just ok!", 
    "Very happy with this comforter. Exactly as pictured.", 
    "the color said it was blue, strangest blue I have ever seen it is as tealas you can get doesn't look like the picture at all", 
    "Love this set! I am terrible bed maker and IMO one can tell! Please bring back the lilac! I want another set . Classy and even comes with a matching pillow! Lots of compliments on it! They it you won't be sorry! It's light weight but warm enough for winter! I expect it may go well with a/c.", 
    "I think this is a nice product for the price, however, it clearly has some synthetics in it that do not breathe well. The look on the bed is just fabulous and I am happy with it as guest bedding, but I wouldn't like it for my bed.", 
    "I love this comforter set. I purchased this in white and it feels so soft. I love my bed now. Once this gets old I will repurchase this again.", 
    "The comforter set was poor quality/poorly made the buttons and threads in particular.", 
    "I absolutely love this comforter. The blue has more green than I thought, but it looks really good on the bed!", 
    "This arrived on time as expected and looks really nice on the bed.", 
    "A very classy looking Comforter Set.It gives the bedroom and the bed a feeling of elegance.There are so many colors to choose from and one is sure to fit your room atmosphere.It makes you want to go to bed.I certainly love the impressions and the puckered diamond designs makes my beds so inviting.", 
    "The set is very cute and really dresses up the room. The color is very true to the picture online. The comforter is a little thinner and lighter weight than it appears, but we are going into summer so that shouldn't be a problem.", 
    "Looks very trendy. Nice quality and love the feel. Would highly recommend.", 
    "Beautiful soft baby blue comforter. Really soft with nice design. Needs a dust ruffle with it, and more pillows, but other than that, it is perfect.", 
    "Very comfortable and soft. Great update for any bedroom. Delivery was quick.", 
    "I purchased this for my daughter in law and was so disappointed when I saw it on her quest bedroom.", 
    "I LOVE IT. IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT FINDING THE CORRECT SHADE OF LAVENDER FOR MY ROOM AND THIS IS PERFECT. I BOUGHT THE QUEEN FOR MY DOUBLE BED AND IT FITS GETS. IT'S REALLY CLASSY LOOKING.", 
    "Bought this comforter for spare bedroom, it was nice quality and neutral design.", 
    "NIce comforter! Looks expensive yet casual with a bit of sophistication. Goes nicely in our master bedroom. We will be adding some accent pillows and a throw to finish it off.", 
    "I was very excited when my new comforter set arrived and couldn't wait to put it on my bed. This put the finishing touches on my room. I recently ordered The Excel canopy bed from Overstock - The whole bedroom now looks luxurios and rich. I am very satisfied.", 
    "Some one said it was a true WHITE and was why I bought it...and it is. Looks great. Just using the comforter because I have different color pillows. Wish it was double sided, even it if would be more costly. Thanks Overstock, for having something than the boring square type.", 
    "The price for a 4-piece bedding set is a bit steep. However, I LOVE the bedding. The blanket is plenty large enough for my King size bed, and it is soft. It looks great. the pillow cases are kind of an odd size, but I don't mind since I really bought it needing a new blanket. Overall it is great, I've only had it about 2 weeks.", 
    "I never recommend ANYTHING to a friend as it is only a way to loose that friend but in this case and only if ASKED I would. I received this and let it sit for a few days before even opening. On the weekend when I changed bedding I put this one on and was amazed at the appearance and comfort of the product. The casing for the pillows, have not used yet, are different and fit exactly so that is so much better then any other I have had or seen. The smaller pillow is still in package as are the pillow cases as I have not put it on the bed. Unfortunately I have cats and they go up on the bed every day and it would just give them a toy to play with. All in all I am very pleased with this purchase and will continue at this site to look and if NEEDED buy again.", 
    "I was a bit skeptical to buy this after reading some of the bad reviews but I LOVE this comforter! I bought the chocolate brown one and it looks so rich and elegant in my room. My kids sit on my bed to watch movies and tv and none of the pleats have come unstitched. The fabric is thin but its so soft. I would purchase this again for sure and would highly recommend!", 
    "Color was not at pictured, which I was hoping. The picture was blue and I needed green blue which is what I received.", 
    "I thought this was an oversize comforter from the picture, and would not need a bedskirt. Needless to say a bedskirt was needed and was not included in the deal.", 
    "I bought the Queen size Carmen color set and it matches the online image perfectly and I absolutely love it. The comforter is thick, soft and very warm, we have a black cat and brown cat and their fur doesn't stick to the fabric (a huge plus). There were a couple strings but nothing big overall I am extremely happy with this purchase and I definitely plan on getting the Grey one next.", 
    "This is a beautful set can't wait to put it all together with other things I bought.", 
    "We bought our comforter in December 2013. We love ours but haven't washed it yet. Some people expressed concern for its durability. We have 2 cats who love to play and wrestle on it and it is doing just fine. We find the comforter soft, pretty and warm. We are very pleased and have no complaints.", 
    "I was very nervous when I first purchased this set since I like to feel the fabric of bedding when I buy. I bought this set in January and wanted to wait a little while until I wrote a review. The color (taupe) is perfect, and the gathers have held up well through quite a few washes now. It is the perfect weight; not too cold, not too hot. Absolutely wonderful!", 
    "I bought this product in white and was very happy with what I received. This comforter was a little stiff (as expected) when I first received it but since it has been used and taken to the dry cleaners over the last 3 months it has gotten much more comfortable. I have a huge feather bed that doubles as my mattress pad which makes my queen bed much bigger than a normal queen and it still covers the entire tops and sides. It is very stylish and affordable! Very happy with this purchase", 
    "I bought this in dark brown; it is too dark. The material attracts lint and is a mess. There was a tear in it when I first opened it up. I would have returned it, but was told it was not returnable.", 
    "I chose the beautiful aqua/teal/blue color, and I am so happy with it. It is a shade that feels good to look at and that coordinates well with a range of blue, purple, and green tones, which I have in my bedroom. I bought the king set, because I like a longer drape over my queen bed, and the comforter is perfect. It is very lightweight, so it makes a nice top layer for colder nights, but it does not smother me. The shams are king-sized, so, until I get larger sham pillows, I just folded back the sides, and no one knows! I look forward to plumping them with larger pillows, which will give my queen bed a more finished appearance, especially with the accent pillow. I am considering another set for my guest room!", 
    "The comforter is doing it's job well. I would recommend to someone to purchase", 
    "The price of this set was exceptional in my opinion. However, it says it's machine washable and after the first wash,( I have an extra large capacity washer with no agitator), some of the pintuck stitching came apart on the shams. I'm not much of a seamstress, so now I am concerned about the next washing. I used the hand wash cycle, so I'm certain it's nothing I did.", 
    "Very cozy and warm. thought the color could be a little less muted and should have bought the blue, other than that really happy.", 
    "I have not seen this item firsthand. I purchased it as a gift. My daughter in law loves this comforter. It is not too feminine, but the tufts make it interesting and soften it. The quality is very good and it is not skimpy in size.", 
    "I think its a very pretty set and great price as well. However, as others have mentioned, the particular color I purchased looked lighter and on the \"cool\" side of colors, but when it came in it was a tad darker and more \"warm\", but we're gonna make it work :)", 
    "I purchased it about 3 weeks ago looked at all the reviews and decided to try them my self. When i placed these on my bed it looked amazing fluffy and very nice i got it in the grey color. It is now about 3 weeks in and the pillow shams have already unraveled at the little knots now they have little holes at the center of each tufted. The comforter is still doing good but i know its just a matter of time other than, that it is really warm and soft to the touch. I wouldn't recommend these for daily use maybe for a spare bedroom that doesn't get used often because it is very nice looking but i know it wont hold on for long.", 
    "I absolutely love the color I. have nothing more to say.", 
    "This is just something pretty i put on top of my comforter. I would recommend you wash it on the light cycle with cold water and dont plan on washing it too much because the pinched stitching is super delicate. But overall im happy with my purchase", 
    "I knew from the picture that I would love this comforter set and I was on target. It is so elegant and lady-like (LOL). Lavender is my favorite color and that's way I decided to get this one. I'm extremely picky and it has taken me years to find something I liked. Well, not only do I like it, I love it. However, I am a bit apprehensive about washing it. I will take the advice of the person who recommended using an oversized washer and dry it half way, then let it air dry. Otherwise, I do highly recommend this comforter set to anyone.", 
    "While this 4 piece comforter set (really 5 since a pillow was included) is soft and warm, it's rather ho hum in color and general appearance. I expected more for the price.", 
    "This comforter is beautiful and a great value. I am very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "good quality looks great I think I will buy One more in another color.", 
    "very happy with the color and style . wish it had been a little more thicker .", 
    "this set with white lace trim sheets(purchased separately) were perfect match for the shabby \"glam\" chic room. the bedding is very soft and have gotten tons of compliments on how \"sexy\" the bedding is. great price for high quality set. love and definitely recommend buying", 
    "I bought this as a cooler option to my winter down comforter. The fit and finish is nice and it serves its purpose well as a cooler option for spring and summer.", 
    "Nice and comfortable fabric. Picture did show the comforter to the floor. and mine does not even cover the mattress? It looks like it would be perfect for a double or a queen size bed. Could be mis-sized? I will need to purchase a bed skirt, which I had not wanted to do.", 
    "The material is scratchy and uncomfortable. It looks luxurious in the pics, but is not soft and pillowy like I was hoping", 
    "Looks very nice on the bed - love teh color, can use it on any of the beds in the house. It was well worth the money.!!!!", 
    "This comforter is a rich looking comforter with substance. Because of the pattern it looks more expensive than it is. Another great buy! Very pleased..", 
    "It was of poor quality and I sent it back.I was very wrinkled and look very cheap", 
    "I love the design, but the threadcount must be SO low - the quality is incredibly cheap looking and feeling. I ordered it in white, and it is practically transparent.", 
    "Very rich looking in the brown with our accent colored pillows. I love that it came with shams and pillow. Getting it all in one is awesome.", 
    "The quality is not as nice as it appears in the pic. It was very wrinkled when it arrived. Had a strange odor from the dye. I washed it and hung it to dry to get out the wrinkles. It washed well, but one of the knitted bloussons came off.", 
    "Looked at this item a number of times before I purchased. Finally I said \"YES.\" Very happy with this purchase , the white color was beautiful with my red accessories. And, the product was excellent made. I have been a lover of red, white and black for a number of years. Everyone who visits comments on how beautiful my home is. Thank you Overstock for reminding me of you wish list. Also, this is a great time to let everyone know that if necessary you return policy is excellent. Very easy and nice polite representatives to help you.", 
    "It was shipped in a timely manner, and the color matched perfectly (dark gray), the scrunchy, gathered look it shows is accurate and I think the quality of the material is okay for what I paid, it isn't super soft, slight rough-ish. It does, however, keep me very warm on cold nights. The matching pillow cases & accent pillow are very nice touches too. Stains do wash out easy (by hand), but since it is such a thick comforter I barely could fit it in my dryer.. so forewarning on that. But overall a great product, same description as described when originally bought.", 
    "Beautiful on my bed. Goes great with curtains. Warm as toast, don't even need my electric blanket.", 
    "The comforter set is perfect. The color was exactly what I needed and appears to be very durable without being overly heavy.", 
    "Very nice set, too bad it didn't come with a sheet. but highly recommend.", 
    "I love this product, its very soft the touch. I have a king size bed and it hangs nice, I would have liked it to come with two throw pillows. it will add a touch of Elegances to any bed room, and they are warm, really holds the heat.", 
    "I purchased this set for my adult son. He didn't particularly like it, but has since changed his mind once he got his bedroom set up properly. It looks great, and I hear that it is very appropriate for cold climates in the winter.", 
    "Love the design! It's dressy enough for me and casual enough for my husband.", 
    "I ordered this set for my son and daughter-in-law as a housewarming gift for their king size bed. They love the comfort and quality of the materials. The color is perfect and as advertised.", 
    "The polyester cover is slick and the comforter slides everywhere. It always looks disheveled and I constantly have to adjust it. Also, the diamond shaped seams are starting to come undone. I like the look of it, but that is about all I like about it after I've had it for a few months", 
    "Beautiful and cozy. Washes very well; I use a gentle setting and didn't wait for it to completely dry. A beautiful addition to our room", 
    "This \"comforter\" is exactly as described. However, the picture is deceptive in that it appears to be a \"bedspread.\" The measurements are true. The picture looks as though a king size comforter was placed on a queen size or even a full size bed. I am not disappointed with the color, fluffy or puffy design. The material feels silky and came out of the packaging with very little need for steaming, etc. I am very pleased with my purchase for the price I paid.", 
    "Bought this blanket because I LOVE the look and it is supper compfortable.... but I have only used the blanket for a a month and the design is coming un done and ripping the blanket =/", 
    "I don't dislike this cover. I bought it for a guest room. It looks nice, but its a little thin and probably would not buy again. DId not dislike it enough to return though.", 
    "I am in love with this little comforter set. It looks nice, covers the bed well, and even came with an extra decorative pillow which I failed to read on the description. I'm excited to sleep in it tonight!", 
    "I purchased the Brown comforter, very nice, looks good, would buy again", 
    "I got this for my daughter and she loves it.It fits nicely on her queen bed.The color is very pretty.", 
    "Very pretty although I did expect a darker color. Blends to well when I wanted it to enhance the darker colors. It is different and with a little colorful additions working out well.", 
    "I loved it, it went right with my bedroom! however i wish that it came with sheets and that would've made it awesome!", 
    "I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it.", 
    "The comforter is warm adn stylish. Love it! It was exactly what I thought and the price was great hard to find a comforter that cheap that is a King.", 
    "I am always skeptical about ordering bedding online and this bedding I was highly satisfied with. Perfect fit for my bulky king sized bed and great color! I may order the white one too!!", 
    "I'm using this set in our master bedroom. It's not a very thick comforter but it does look nice.", 
    "This comforter is not only lovely to look at, it is super, super warm. I had forgotten to turn on the heat one night and didn't know until I got up in the morning and realized how cold my house was. I really love it!! Would definitely recommend this set!!", 
    "The color was exact and perfect but there was little if no puffiness in the comforter itself. It was totally FLAT like it was old! I was very disappointed! The shams were ok, but the comforter lacked umph! I have wanted this style for a very long time yet I wouldn't recommend this exact product to friend or family member.", 
    "Ordered this for Christmas and was very pleased with the quality. Nice, rich color with quality material. I am very pleased with this comforter set.", 
    "Beautiful Comforter Set. But my girlfriend didnt like the color, so I had to return it for a white one.", 
    "Gives a certain excellence in the bedroom. Very nice feel and look. Thank you.", 
    "The Comforter and shams are beautiful and a nice quality of fabric. The shipping was an issue.", 
    "Comforter puffed right up after removing from packaging. Great to have the additional accent pillow. I added lightly designed sheets in a soft blue and accented with an orange velvet pillow & throw, turned out really pretty. Super comfy, exactly as pictured, would order again.", 
    "Neutral color and looks great on my four poster bed. Most comforters look very wrinkled after a while. This set has a nice appearance and good for the price. Makes the bed look more finished when I am in a hurry in the morning to quickly fix it. Very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "Even with the mishap on the delivery, customer service was very accommodating and friendly. I love the design of the comforter and the color. I had been watching it for a while and decided to treat myself for Christmas.", 
    "Quality is great but color was not the same as pictures. Took to long to get but customer service helped great.they reordered and got here in time for Christmas.", 
    "I love it, it looks perfect in my bedroom. It looks like the original photo and for the price it is a pretty good deal to buy.", 
    "I bought this set to replace a very loved but tired one. It looks great. I have a very thick mattress so it was really close on the side drops, but with a little help I made it cover enough. This was a fantastic bargain.", 
    "made in china, of course- felt like cardboard..had to be returned.", 
    "Great value! Got this as a daily deal and shipping was fast. Item looks exactly as pictured in the photo, but the polyester filling is a bit clumpy and a bit cheap feeling. Although I'm used to having expensive down comforters that are nice and fluffy, I can't complain for something that was 1/4th the price and looks just as nice! Would definitely recommend.", 
    "Great look! Better than expected and worth the price", 
    "The comforter set looks and feels like a big fluffy marshmallow - very inviting and seems to be just the right weight for most of the year.. In winter I need to add a light blanket but that's easy to do.. I love it!", 
    "it is the right color...could be a bit bigger, as now I have to find a bedskirt!", 
    "The quality of this product is way over priced for what you get. Material is very thin and the picture is not at all what you get. However, I am keeping the comforter set because I am tired of looking.", 
    "Absolutely happy with my purchase. Very elegant looking. Rich color-gray! The only thing I wish it came with is a skirt and more pillows! I would definitely recommend this! Looks just as the picture shows!", 
    "If your looking for a fairly decent comforter this one will do, but its not worth more than $XX IMO. I've found better \"values\" on comforters in department stores or your local XXXX XXXXXX etc. They might cost a bit more at the store but the overall quality is much better too. If you want something for the long haul this may not be the set for you either, I give it one year based on the extremely thin material, its almost sheer. So overall, looks decent, fairly warm yet light, and its an average value for the price but don't expect to be wowed!", 
    "The weight of this comforter is perfect for chilly nights (medium heavy) and feel is pretty soft. The color matched perfectly, the blue has a touch of aquamarine in it. I highly recommend this product - I can't even imagine sleeping without it now! AMAZING!", 
    "I love it. It's what I expected from what I saw in the photo. Color was also as shown. The quality is pretty good. The number of reviews are what sold me on this product. One complaint--the pleating/gathered points in the fabric are held together by little stitches of thread....one of which came undone on my pillowcase. Sad, but fixable...I just didn't expect it to happen only two weeks after I got it. Still looks great.", 
    "Nicer in person , I would hightly recommend this item.Well worth the money", 
    "I love this comforter, it is gorgeous. It is just a tiny bit darker than what is pictured but I like it better anyway. It's just warm enough but I live in Texas so I don't need anything too warm. It washes well, it sits well on my bed. Perfect!", 
    "I puchased two of these one in the blue and one purple. The blue is more gray blue than aqua blue. The lavander color is pretty accurate. The thickness is good, but the material is not as soft or shiny as I thought it would be. Can't beat the price. All in all a great value.", 
    "I fell in love with this comforter from the first time I saw it. I circled around and looked at probably every queen size comforter available in this price range, and nothing else really compared. The blue color is a little more \"blue-green-ish\" than the picture, but it is still really pretty.", 
    "gave this as a Christmas present- was real nice- nice a thick good color- especially liked the detailing on it", 
    "Looks great . Great value love the color. Would recommend highly.", 
    "I would rate the value as average, the material is not good quality . Hard to clean, thread hanging from the comfort , no bed skirt . I would buy from web site but make choices on my products.", 
    "I am ver pleased with this product. IIt is light weight yet so cozy wrm.It makes it easy to spread the bed every morning.", 
    "i'm giving this an average review because i love the material, however this doesn't look much like the product in the picture. the ripples are shapeless.", 
    "This comforter set is very nice. Color is crisp and feels plush. However, the folds are not as defined as I would have hoped.", 
    "I bought 2 of these in different colors. I went the king size as I desired more of a plush, full look. The king size is perfect for my queen beds.", 
    "We love this set. We got the white set and it looks great in king size", 
    "This was suppose to arrive next week but to my surprise ... it came yesterday! It's a lot warmer than my last comforter and the smaller decoration pillow's stuffing was weirdly bunched. It definitely needs a toss in the dryer to help release the wrinkles it got from the packaging but overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase.", 
    "Very nice fabric, white is true white, size was accurate. First unit had minor damage but was replaced promptly and hassle free.", 
    "I ordered the blue version as we wanted to place it in a room with a blue rug, blue wallpaper and blue paintings. To our agast, when we opened the shipment it was GREEN!!!! We promptly called customer service and they shipped a second one which was NOT Blue but GREEN. They obviously have a problem on their web site but customer service to their credit was outstanding, refunding our purchase and sending via email a post paid return label. I would definitely consider Overstock.com again as their return policy is fantastic for when they goof they man up to it.", 
    "Purchased as a Christmas gift. Very nice and pretty.", 
    "I was extremely displeased with the product the color was some off greenish blue and the material was something I could have bought from XXXXXXX.", 
    "The bedding did not have a luxury luster that I expected that is why I am rating this as average. It comes with a throw pillow.", 
    "I really like the comforter and shams. The set looks good on my bed.", 
    "I don't usually purchase bedding online because I like to see and feel it in real life. I'm very pleased. It is easy to wash, looks and feels great. Love the taupe color and it's made really well. This is a best buy.", 
    "I do not think that this product was very good quality for the price. the dimensions were also not the size of a king size bed", 
    "The quality of bedspread is so so. It is a pretty spread but needs to be handled carefully not to tear out the thread on the tucks. It has a blue undertone which make it a pretty shade of grey and goes good with her room decor. My granddaughter likes it very much. She has a grey linen tucked head board and this spread look great on the bed.", 
    "I cannot believe I actually paid money for this item. It is 100% polyester and very thin. It reminds me of a college dorm comforter. By the look of the photo it looks like a good quality product. Because of the ruffles and pickups, the polyester keeps the item wrinkled and looking very cheap. I will most likely never purchase from overstock again.", 
    "I like structure as a topping; this needs steam every where, it is very thin material...the picture doesn't show that.", 
    "This bedding set is quite pretty and is easy to incorporate into any decor. It washes well and seems comparable to the higher priced bedding sets!", 
    "very warm and comfortable, color is just like the ad", 
    "This comforter set was not as nice or fluffy as the picture depicts it. I don't hate it but for the price I was expecting something nicer.", 
    "I purchased this in June and after one wash on delicate cycle and air dried it is falling apart!", 
    "I returned this unopened, as I had found another that was exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "This comforter is very pretty ... a little less soft in feel than i thought but still not scratchy. Overall, a good value.", 
    "Love the look and feel. Will be looking for similar look/feel for winte", 
    "Looks great but you can tell the fabric is cheap. Fabric does not resemble that in the picture. If you are looking for something nice and durable, look further, but if you are looking for an afordable decent comforter then this is a great option.", 
    "I bought this set for my bedroom. It is made very cheaply. I even considered sending it back. The little gatherings on the comforter pull apart very easily. I ordered a queen size for my queen size bed and it is to small. I would not recommend this to anyone.", 
    "The material feels cheap/ The comforter itself does not look like the picture at all. It is MUCH smaller and doesn't cover my queen size been efficiently enough. You can see my sheets on my bed from ANY perspective. I tried offering it for FREE to an 18 year old and she declined.", 
    "Not only is this comforter set BEAUTIFUL, it has A luxurious feel, a comfortable weight, and the quality and workmanship is excellent . This is a product I've fell in love with! I count myself lucky in buying this product! Thank you,", 
    "I ALREADY HAVE MANY FRIENDS ASK WHERE I BOUGHT THIS SET. IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND THIS STYLE WITH THE GATHERS. LOVE THE FEEL OF THE MATERIAL. I BOUGHT THE TAUPE TO COORDINATE WITH MY BROWN AND TEAL DECOR. LOOKS FABULOUS!", 
    "I absolutely love this set I bought. I bought it in white and it look so pretty with my grey sheets. The accent pillow is a nice touch to add to the set. I have a double sized bed and it hangs over the sides evenly. It can get a little too hot but the material is soft and the quality is excellent.", 
    "The duvet itself is beautiful, however much thinner than i expected and it is rather short for a king size. Unfortunately after a few weeks I noticed that in many place where it is pleated, the pleats are coming undone. The comforter has little tiny holes now throughout, and looks like if it were to have buttons that they got ripped off (easiest way to explain what it looks like when the pleats come undone).", 
    "Satisfied with product. stays in place well. Nice color", 
    "I bought the gray one. It's looks nice with my purple walls. It's simple, but looks classy.", 
    "I am very happy with the queen set I bought. I purchased the taupe queen set and I love it!!!", 
    "Superb quality for the price! You can't beat it. The texture, color and comfort is unsurpassed! Excellent quality.", 
    "I love it! My only complaint is I wish it covered the bed a little better. I bought the gray in king size but king almost seems too small but it works since you can't see the other side of my bed when you enter the room. I'm pretty happy with the quality of the material. Very satisfied overall. I would rate it excellent if it covered a little better.", 
    "Love this comforter! The Grey is a great color and it seems to be holding up great so far!", 
    "It's a decent comforter for the price. It didn't look quite as nice as the picture, but not enough to bother returning it. It looked like it had a little more sheen and richness in the picture. I only wish I would have measured first and ordered a king size for my queen size bed. That would have covered the sides better. And if the King size was longer than 90 inches (it's the same as the Queen), then I would return and exchange for a King, because it doesn't cover length-wise when the bed is made. But since it's the same lengthwise, I'm just going to keep the Queen and get a bedskirt to help hide the boxspring.", 
    "The color was not good. To muddy for my taste. The quality of the merchandise was fair. A little muslin-y", 
    "I brought one loved it brought another one for a friend. Great product. I would recommend this for a lovely bedoom. I give this product a#10.", 
    "The comforter arrived in a timely manner. However, it was too narrow for my large king bed. Overall it looks like a well made item. I wish it had fit my bed.", 
    "I love this comforter. Got it in blue. Either my monitor is whacked or the color is not realistic, as this turned out to be more of a soft turquoise. But I am happier than if it was the blue I initially saw. Paired it with mocha accents, (bed skirt, drapes, throw pillows, etc.) and I am so happy with the outcome. Very soft and comfy for sleeping. Not too hot, not too cool, just right. Considering buying an additional one for our guest room.", 
    "I've seen similar comforters at department stores and in catalogs that were much more expensive. This was the right price and looks fantastic on the bed.", 
    "My grandchildren love the linens on the beds at our house. so for Christmas I purchased matching Comfort sets for their beds. They love them it definitely makes them fill snug as a bug in a rug. It also gives warm memories to our daughter, looking back at the how she snuggled in our bed as a little one", 
    "The champagne fabric feels and looks great. Goes really well with deep red walls and natural oak floors. Would have been even better if they had included two king pillowcases along with the shams.", 
    "Good quality. Shipping was appropriate. Description was accurate.", 
    "Beautiful comforter for a great price! I love Overstock for our bedding!!!", 
    "Very pleased with this comforter! I got the white king size for my king size bed and found that it fits true to size. It is a bit wrinkly when you first get it on, but I didn't think it looked bad at all. I added some velvet pillows in different colors to give it a pop of color and I love it! It's really soft and washable, which was a must for me! I haven't washed it yet, so I can't report on that, but overall I'm very pleased with it.", 
    "Love this comforter, just the right color and weight. Perfect for summer and perfect for winter with a blanket.", 
    "The comforter came out as a wrinkled mess when removed from the package. The pattern was lost amidst the wrinkles on the comforter, but slightly visible on the shams. However, after washing the sheets and ironing it, it came out beautiful. I ordered it in white, and it is true to the picture. It is a great item for the price, and I am so happy how it turned out.", 
    "Gray was perfect! Very pretty set! Quality of product was very good. I love this set.", 
    "Simply beautiful. I have had many compliments. I accented it with purple. Just gorgeous!!!!", 
    "Great price, looks great and is not too heavy. Very pretty.", 
    "Could not be happier with this product. It looks great and the comforter is the perfect weight for what we were looking for.", 
    "Well made and everything I was hoping for. It is very beautiful and is very cozy on cold nights.", 
    "Just what I was looking for at an affordable price.", 
    "This set is beautiful. Looks very expensive although it wasn't. Looks lovely in our guest room.", 
    "So when I saw this set online, it seemed like exactly what I wanted, When it arrived, first off, it was ultra wrinkly...but the biggest disappointment was that it just felt very polyester-y and itchy. It's not something I would use as a blanket...it's very light and the fill just feels scratchy and uncomfortable. With that being said, I still think the design is very feminine and looks good from afar...now, It just sits on my ground now unless I have company or something because I would never use it as a blanket.", 
    "Beautiful comforter - just as picturesque and nice quality. Would purchase from this brand again.", 
    "We have a queen bed and I ordered a king size. works fantastic on my bed. Nice, fluffy and not too heavy to sleep under either.", 
    "my comforter is a king size and wish it was just a tad bit bigger so that it would fall down on the sides a little bit further, but other than that...we love it!", 
    "The brown king size Carmen 4-piece comforter set arrived quickly and fit perfectly. The design and construction is equal to more expensive comforters. The material is very durable and cleans easily with a damp cloth. I plan on purchasing other colors for family members. Overstock hit the ball out of the park on this product!", 
    "I was skeptical when reading other reviews but decided to order it anyway and was quite impressed with the quality and thickness. Very pretty.", 
    "Got this in gray. Absolutely love it ! Looks great on our bed!", 
    "Comforter seems a little small for queen bed....it is tufted on top but quilting does not go through and I doubt it will hold up after drycleaning.", 
    "I just had my guest bedroom redone and this comforter and shamms with decorative pillow was the perfect choice to complete the look I was going for. It's simple, yet elegant. It has a wonderfully soft feel and is oh so comfy! My guests will love it.", 
    "The color is true white as described but like the comments of other, the quality is rather poor. This is being used in a guest room so it won't get much use but I do worry about how this would look if sat upon.", 
    "I absolutely love this comforter!!!!! So soft and fluffy!!!!!!!!", 
    "This comforter set is really cute...not the highest quality, but a really good look for the price!", 
    "Haven't washed it yet. Looks like the picture but better.", 
    "Love this set - very clean and upscale. Nice quality and color. Would definetley buy again.", 
    "I was disappointed in the color. I was expecting a powder blue comforter the color is a aqua green. Maybe there is a problem with the photo presentation. I am noticing the same comments on other bedspread that are feature as blue coloring people are commenting that the color is more teal green than blue. Pam", 
    "Nice simple plain set. Happy with this purchase. Color (purple) was very accurate.", 
    "I'm enjoying this product. It matches my Master Bedroom d\u00e9cor perfectly............... I bought the King-Sized one for my Queen Mattress. It's not too heavy and not too light, a great fit !!", 
    "I purchased the blue comforter set, and it is gorgeous! Almost a darker teal color. I would totally purchase another one of these. Very comfortable and light.", 
    "I bought this my mistake thinking it was the duvet. Material feels cheep and it was too small for my King bed so I'm going to use it on my guest queen bed. It fit fine from head to foot, but not from side to side.", 
    "Quality and material both exceeded by expectations! I was wowed when I opened the bag. I was expecting something of much less quality. It looks great and makes me feel like I just crawled into an expensive hotel bed.", 
    "The look of the product is mediocre. Very light quality and doesn't even cover my king size bed. I guess the king size beds in China are a lot smaller. This is my first and last purchase from this website!!!!!! You get what you pay for!! Done", 
    "I wanted to love this comforter because of the pin tucks and color. It is a pretty color ( grey) and a medium weight comforter for a good price, but I should of listened to one reviewer who talked about the size of the king size not fitting all the way on the sides of the bed width-wise. It would be perfect to buy a king for a queen size mattress. Ultimately, I returned b/c one of the pin tucks came undone (after a few days with no washing ) leaving a hole.", 
    "I've been looking for a comforter set for a while. There is other ones similar to this one that are very expensive. When I saw this one for the price I had to get it!!! It looks great & it doesn't look cheap.", 
    "Just rec'd my Queen Size Blue Comforter set today. I was originally torn between the Taupe and Blue but glad I went for the blue. The color blends beautifully with my area rug and my newly decorated bedroom decor .The size is perfect for my platform bed and it hangs nicely. I'm trying to justify another set for my daughter. I love that it's soft and fits into my standard size washer and dryer.", 
    "Packing resulted in very wrinkled comforter. . Very difficult to press. The image both on the internet and on card included showed a beautiful \"luster\", but actual fabric is dull.", 
    "Average quality comforter. If you're looking for something different then this may be for you. But it's not high quality. Perfect for a first-time homeowner but if you want something of quality, this isn't it.", 
    "I purchased the taupe color, but it's definitely not as fluffy or \"shiny\" looking as the image - color is more of a dark cream/tan, definitely a few shades darker than the image appeared on my Macbook. The quality is also similar to a bed-in-a-bag set; not as fluffy or plush as the image. The seams do not pop like in the image either, so it doesn't look as fluffy & comfy as the image. I'm not disappointed enough to return, but I wouldn't recommend or buy the similar duvet cover that I liked as well as I assume it's the same material.", 
    "The color is not taupe and is not consistent. one piece looks taupe, two look khaki and the comforter is in the middle. The quality is ok, Shams do not fit queen pillows which is ok since I would rather use king although they are a bit too tight for king and not laying correctly.", 
    "same quality as more expensive tufted comforters -- very happy", 
    "Okay, first I thought the fabric would look like how it is in the picture.. and it looks like a satiny- silkish material in the picture. Haha, I was wrong. It's like a cotton-polyester material.. which looks kind of cheap. Then when I take it out of the bag it comes in, its covered in wrinkles.. I hope they go away because I'm honestly afraid to wash it. I'm still deciding if I should return it or not. Really not what I expected, but I guess I just should have high expectations with this site in the first place. My old black comforter from WALMART looks better than this. and I paid about $@# for my black comforter.. I paid $@# for this one. After writing this review I'm actually really disappointed with my purchase.", 
    "If you are looking for a nice set for the price this is a good buy!!", 
    "Love the comfort. Great product. Nice looking and it's very warm.", 
    "I really like it. Good quality, not the best, but you get what you pay for. Great neutral light color for summer. Also lightweight.", 
    "This comforter is so bright and fresh looking. Goes great in my country home. washes wonderfully and goes right in dryer, puffs up and looks great again. Love it!!", 
    "I got the purple comforter. The color is beautiful and it feels great on your skin. Great quality for the price.", 
    "The Carmen Comforter Set is beautiful and it's exactly as advertised. I ordered it in white and it's a bright white which brighten up my bedroom and looks great with the red decor that i have. I have already received wonderful complements from my friends who have seen it on my bed. I am very very pleased with the chose that i made.", 
    "I love the look of this set. Bought taupe and put with white dust ruffle and added small white accent pillow. Bed looks very rich and inviting.", 
    "Good quality, as advertised fast delivery. I would recommend if you need a set like this.", 
    "This comforter is simplely beautiful! however I would recommend you have a bigger bed room to accommodate the size of the comforter. But all in all it is absolutely exquisite!", 
    "I received the item on 6-20-13. I will be returning the white comforter. I was not impressed, it was rather light weight,by viewing it on line. I just knew it would be much thicker and it wasn't, I was disappointed. The cost of this item isn't worth $**.00", 
    "Light weight and easy on the eye. I did have to wait for the taupe color to come available, but was worth the wait. I shopped for others in the meantime but they are all too loud, to cheap in appearance or WAY to expensive! This one is perfect! Dress up the look with additional pillows in vibrant color; works with any color. Very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "This comforter is very comforting,with its softness and plushness.", 
    "It came so fast and was very impressed with quality!", 
    "I LOVE THIS COMFORTERI! IT LOOKS AND FEELS AS SOFT AND LUXURIOUS IN PERSON AS IT DOES IN THE PHOTOS. MY FRIEND LIKED IT SO WELL, I BOUGHT IT AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR HIM!", 
    "It is a lovely comforter when it come to looks but it is way too thin for my taste on a comforter. Wish I would of have had spend a bit more money on a better one.", 
    "I was worried when I purchased it that it was going to be to thin but not at all! It is heavier than I thought! It's perfect for Texas nights! We have a tall king bed and it covers all the way to the box springs!", 
    "Love the comforter set but expected a little different color blue.", 
    "I was a little hesitant to purchase this product after reading some of the negative reviews, particularly the ones that said the tacks fell out with normal use. I have had the set for about a month and have slept in the bed nightly and made it daily, treating this comforter as I would any other (not treating it gingerly, as if I expected it to tear) and have not had any problems. It is a beautiful, soft purple and looks great against the black and white color scheme in the room. I would have preferred the color to be a bit brighter, but I think the actual color is accurately represented by the picture on OS. Overall, I am very happy I went ahead with the purchase. It's chic and elegant-looking, and I would recommend it and/or buy it again.", 
    "Gorgeous fabric. Feels so nice. Very soft and plush. Always looks nice.", 
    "Lightweight, comfortable and attractive. Good quality.", 
    "I am very pleased with the comforter. No surprises, it looks just like the picture. The color is right on. Love it!", 
    "Great comforter. It's exactly as advertised. Shipping was prompt. We love it.", 
    "This product is a good quality for the price! I love how soft and light the material is. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Poor quality. Disappointment. Would not recommend .", 
    "I loved the fact it was bright white and not off white, I took another customer's suggestion and ordered the King for my Queen size bed and I love the look.", 
    "After reading all of the prior reviews, I went to a couple sights to comparison shop. I found nothing to equal the value of this comforter set. I ordered a king for my queen sized bed as many suggested. It is a crisp white with lovely reuching (sp) detail! It's perfect for a spring and summer cover. Light enough not to smother but substantive enough to be comfortable. It is amazingly soft under the covers too! I love to just stand back and enjoy my beautifully made bed every morning!", 
    "Fair Quality bedspread reasonable price. Local well known Department chain had same thing for same price . Having said that a lesser price would have been a better deal", 
    "This comforter set looks very nice, but there is no way it fits a king size bed. I bought this for our master, which is a king, but ended up putting it on our guest bed, which is a queen. It seems to fit the queen well.", 
    "Looks so nice on my bed! Its very soft and light weight but not too light. I wanted a summer comforter and this is perfect. I bought the Tan and it looks very rich-I highly recommend!", 
    "I received the comforter and it was more of an aqua color than blue. I was slightly disappointed at first but I have gotten compliments so I guess it is okay. If you are searching for a true blue as I was this would not be the one for you. I would have rated it a 5 star but the color was not accurate.", 
    "Lovely set. Purchased king size for a queen bed. Came very wrinkled--thought they would relax out, but they haven't--will have to iron.", 
    "I love it but noticed last night there are two pulls/tears where the gather/pleats have come undone. Disappointed and will call today and see what can be done.", 
    "Order came very timely and looks just like the picture! I love it and would recommend it to others!", 
    "Great price, great product. Would definitively recommend to a friend or family.", 
    "The comforter is fairly light weight and is warmer than I expected. The brown is a nice deep warm color that matched our bedroom well. I've washed it once and it came out still looking new.", 
    "I was really disappointed in the quality of this comforter. It is very thin and flimsy. I would not recommend this product.", 
    "Very nice, love the quality. Just like the picture!", 
    "Was so excited but ended up disappointed, way to much on the pleats..... my husband hated it. overall it cost me to return the item so it cost me to be disappointed.", 
    "I was disappointed in the color. It was more beige then the picture seemed. Material was soft and presented fine.", 
    "Great price on a quality comforter set., quick shipment, packaging was very good. I could not ask for a better item for the price. The comforter was as good as one I had bought from a high quality retail store. I hope it holds its shape first time it is cleaned. I will be sire to post if it doesn't.", 
    "This is a perfect option for the spring/summer seasons. It is very light-weight. Some of the other reviews said the white was very bright white. I did not find that to be true. There is nothing over bright about the white. It was exactly what I needed for my bedroom. I would say I think the price is a little too much for the quality of the bedding material.", 
    "The fabric is thin and the tucks are not sewn very well. The taupe color is a dark khaki tan and not cream or ivory, so it was returned. The white is bright white and very cheap looking. I love O but these don't owe up to the standards of other quality products ordered.", 
    "This is a very nice looking and soft comforter. I actually used it on a full-sized bed, as I like having an oversized comforter that hangs lower than usual on the sides. I ordered the blue and it is almost more of a light turquoise, which I love. It looks much more expensive than it was! My only complaint is that the set did not come with a bedskirt, and the color is very hard to match. I ended up using a white bedskirt and decorating with white sheets, dark teal accent pillows, and a dark teal throw at the base of the bed. It looks very inviting!!!", 
    "Very nice comforter, well made, very warm, color matches picture", 
    "Disappointed in the quality of the comforter for the price. The photo displayed is a little misleading in that it appears to have a different \"look\" o the design instead of it being little \"tacks\" to give this look instead of it being the actual design of the comforter. I was disappointed in the comforter but kept it because it is hard to find gray comforters and I didn't want the expense of sendng it back and still having to pay for the original shipping and it just wasn't worth the hassle. It makes me a little reluctant to order anything else with a \"design\" for fear of being misled by the photo.", 
    "For price it was well worth it. The look was the same as i saw online and the quality is good, lightweight and just beautiful.", 
    "The product came quickly and in the time frame noted. I am happy with the product but would have liked a better description of it.", 
    "The set is very elegant, just what I wanted for a spare room. It is light weight but that makes it year round. It washed well before I made the bed. I got a queen size for a double bed and do not need a dust ruffle to avod seeing under the bed and the box spring is covered. I am very happy with my selection and the price!", 
    "Pleasantly surprised at the quality. I haven't washed it yet, but love the feel and appearance.", 
    "I love it! It was exactly as described. Perfect summer weight, yet plush. I purchased the blue. Great color. Wipes clean of dawg prints easily without having to put the whole thing in the washer.", 
    "I thought this would look much better than it did. I got the white, and it was bright white, but I think looked cheap. The one pictured look much more luxurious than the one I got. I returned it.", 
    "I'm still going to give this comforter 4 stars...b/c I love how it looks...the material is good....wrinkles easily...but a pretty crisp white...which is exactly what I wanted. The only hang up that I have about the comforter is that there was a little hole in one of the seams. To anyone looking at the comforter...you wouldn't see it....but I KNOW it's there....so that bothers me. I had thought about returning it for another...but didn't want the hassle...plus was having a b-day party at the house...and needed something pretty on the bed. Shams and throw pillows look perfect.", 
    "As in all the items I have purchased from OVERSTOCK.COM, I find a wanted product I have been looking for at a price I can afford. This comforter set is so similar to one I had and could not find again. The big difference is the quality is better and the price was just right. Every part of my purchase was better then the original comforter set I was trying to replace.", 
    "Looks nice in pictures. When it arrived it looked really cheap. I returned it immediately.", 
    "This comforter is exactly what I hoped for, it's soft and warm but not too warm so you can use it for multiple seasons. The color and quality is great and I love the throw pillow it came with. It's just what I expected for the price, very good.", 
    "Comforter is a nice taupe/beige color. Pin tucking adds ellegance. Soft and pretty in the room. Throw pillow is a nice bonus. I would recommned this comforter in any color.", 
    "Just painted my bedroom and was looking for a lavender comforter and almost gave up until I came upon this one. Read some of the reviews about it and debated and then finally purchased it and glad I did. I had actually found something similar in a different color and bought ( more $$$) too thinking I would check them both out. The lavender Carmen 4-piece comforter arrived and hasn't come off my bed since.....it is well made, just the right weight for Houston weather, and a FANTASTIC price. Definitely a WIN WIN!!", 
    "I love my new comforter! Looks fabulous on my bed!", 
    "I am pleased with the look of the comforter set and the white is a brilliant white. It is somewhat thin for a comforter but in my case it's used in a guest room so the thickness is not that important but I was somewhat disappointed. It does looks amazing on the bed and I do love it. The set was bed ready with little wrinkles and no need to steam at all..The shams and decorator pillow are very nice and really add to the whole look. I added some color with extra mutli colored pillows, a matching throw and it really popped. I may order another color to keep on hand since the price was reasonable and delivery was right on time. Very happy with this set.", 
    "This set is great. I bought it for my granddaughter. My friends and love it and asked where I purchase it. So I told them. Highly recommended it.", 
    "I ordered the taupe comforter set. I was happy with the quality and weight of the comforter (I didn't want a heavy one). The color is a bit dull, but it works alright, I need to find a couple of contrasting pillows to brighten it up.", 
    "It amazing and looks nice on my bed. It's all you could ever expect from where I bought it", 
    "I previously purchased a comforter set from OS and had to send it back as it was very poorly made and completely wrinkled. This one did not disappoint. Very nice quality and looks great on my bed. And...no wrinkles!", 
    "Received the comforter two days ago and washed it (gentle cycle of course) and slept in it last night. Love the feel of the comforter, felt almost like silk. Husband thinks it looks fancy and likes that it is breathable because his body temp runs hot. Best comforter purchase I've ever made.", 
    "I got this to put under my purple anthropologie quilt because I wanted big comfy bedding. It looks great together but within a week the stitching started coming apart. Guess you can't expect quality for $80...", 
    "This comforter is sooooo soft (and beautiful to boot!). It seemed a little thin but with a thin blanket under it, it is very warm and not heavy at all to sleep under. Would definitely recommend this comforter. I purchased the lighter color which arrived exactly as I expected. It really adds a touch of elegance to the room.", 
    "This is a beautiful set that I bought for my 13 y/o old daughters bed. She loves it!! I did take the recommendation of an earlier reviewer. The reviewer suggested ordering one size up, so I ordered a king set for a queen bed. I am so gald I did! The king comforter hangs over the queen bed as the picture shows. If I would've ordered the queen it would have been to small. As always Overstock is flawless in their transatction and shipping is lightening fast.", 
    "You wanted the taupe, but it didn't come in king size, so you are debating on whether or not to get in dark brown. Well, I did and it looks AMAZING!!! Get cream dust ruffle and cream sheets and a splash of tangerine and you are good to go. Great quality. Five stars all the way!", 
    "This comforter looks really nice and is very warm. Only issue is that a few of the stitches holding the crinkle together have come apart which makes that section lie flat. I would wash on a very gentle cycle.", 
    "This comforter is very pretty and I'm anxious to get it on the bed. I have a King size also, and they wash great.", 
    "Nice comforter. Was the exact color I thought it would be. Warm and looks great.", 
    "I think this comforter set is lovely, but I have only seen it from the box, because I ordered it in White and my order says White, but the set came in a ugly taupe color. I am returning it as soon as I receive the return label.", 
    "I bought two Carmen 4 piece comforters. The comforter in gray was darker than how it was pictured online. I also purchased the tan/taupe comforter (looks more of a biege). Both comforters looked lovely on my queen sized bed. Be careful when making the bed as the puckered stitching is rather delicate. My husband did not know this when he made the bed and when he pulled it we lost a few stitches. I later sewed back them together. Overall - I still love the comforter and would buy again.", 
    "The comforter set is a little bit on the thin side, but it does look pretty and gets the job done. I had no issues with wrinkles in the set and it seems like it would be very easy to wash", 
    "Beautiful comforter. It is a little smaller then I expected but the beauty overtakes the length!", 
    "This looks great on our bed which has dark wood! I only wish I had gotten king size for my queen bed so it would hang down on the sides a little more. Other than that, beautiful, beautiful!", 
    "Product came as described, fast delivery, enjoying it very much.", 
    "I really like the luxury look that this comfortor has. My only regret is that the darker taupe color i really wanted was sold out so i took a lighter color but it still works. The quality looks great and it is very light which makes it easy to make up the bed.", 
    "This product looked much better in the picture than it did when I received it. It felt cheap. I would not recommend it.", 
    "I absolutely love this comforter. The bright white contrasts beautifully against my dark furniture. The material is a good quality and the pricing is comparable to other similar sets. The comforter is not too heavy or thick which is great for someone who gets hot during the night. I would recommend this to anyone. I do have a cat and took a chance purchasing white... The material does attract cat hair and white does show spots easily-however I was easily able to clean spots with warm water and cloth. I am completely satisfied and happy with my purchase.", 
    "Purchased this comforter in November but have only been using it for about a month. Went to pull the comforter up to make my bed and one of the \"puckered diamonds\" broke and now there is a large hole that can't be repaired and unfortunately can't be hidden. It looks nice but probably not for every day use.", 
    "I purchased it for my 13 year old daughter and she really loves it. After month of looking at the stores i found this one. Very soft and goes perfect with her decor.", 
    "This comforter is just what I was looking for. However, if you want a heavy, warm one, this is not it. I wanted something light, beautiful, and easy to make the bed and it fits the bill perfectly on those counts. I have a platform bed that is elevated a bit and it falls exactly where I wanted it to on all sides without the need for fussing. In order for it to look like the picture, your bed would need to be a bit low to the floor (sorry don't have measurements handy). It does need to be steamed to get the wrinkles out. Be careful if you use your iron to do that because if the hot iron touches the fabric, it will melt :-( I made a tiny hole near one of the puckers while steaming, and haven't decided how to repair it yet, but it is totally unnoticeable for now. The fabric looks more plush than it feels. It's clearly not silk or anything high end to the touch, but it is not cheap feeling either. My husband likes it too, although he puts on another throw to sleep as he says it doesn't keep him warm enough. I really like this purchase!", 
    "THIS BEDROOM SET IS GREAT QUALITY AND THE COLOR WAS PERFECT FOR THE DECORATION I WISH IT COULD COME IN CHOCOLATE FOR MY BEDROOM TOO.", 
    "They are soo comfortable and looks attractive. This set adds value to your bedroom.", 
    "This comforter set is absolutely beautiful!! Crisp white, soooo elegant!!! I have chocolate brown drapes so I purchased a couple of extra chocolate brown throw pillows to tie everything together. Also purchased from Overstock a white shag rug for bedroom!!! Oh-la-la!!! Very chic!!! You won't be disappointed if you're on the fence about this one!", 
    "This style and material gives an upscale appearance to the bedroom. After years of buying comforter sets, I now prefer to have something that looks expensive but doesn't hurt my wallet but most of all, EASY TO MAKE in the morning. I am so happy that I bought a King size for my Queen bed. It's fuller and the shams are not so tiny....the fuller look is so beautiful. Wish there were more colors.", 
    "This comforter set is very chic and modern. Love love love this product and overstock.com offers the BEST price hands down and the shipping was very prompt.", 
    "Looks better in person. The comforter is beautiful and fabric is wonderful to sleep in - almost a little silky feeling. Very pretty - I ordered the beige which is just slightly more gray that the picture appears. Very happy with the purchase - just need to find a bed skirt that looks good with it.", 
    "Comforter is very warm and provided with 2 pillow covers.", 
    "Love set. Fits my queen size bed with a memory foam on top. (from O.S.) The quilting is perfect. True to the picture.", 
    "This comforter is better looking than the photo! And soft! My only complaint is that it seems to be a lint magnet. Everything sticks to it. I just washed it so I'm hoping that that will make a difference. But a very beautiful comforter.", 
    "Good quality. Looks good. Arrived on time............................", 
    "feels nice, yet thinner then it looks on the computer, I thought It would be a little heaver duty.", 
    "Beautiful, well priced, nice quality, but the tiny stitches that make the pattern are so delicate that they come loose, spoiling the effect of the pattern. It is a very quick fix for anyone that can thread a needle - but it is bothersome to have to worry about what you toss across the bed.", 
    "I t came quite wrinkled. There is no way to iron it....so I am living with it. Nice warm comforter and a deal for the price!", 
    "This was for my daughters room, we looked every where for the quality but least expensive set. This set has made her room very pleasant.", 
    "This comforter is even prettier in person. It fits properly and quality of the material is excellent. I love it. I have been looking at similar ones and the price at Overstock was so much less!", 
    "Looked lovely on my bed and in my room and was very soft and comfy, but after only weeks the details began to come unsewn. In fear of them all coming out I had to send it back immediately and order something else.", 
    "This is an ok comferter. I guess my only dissapointment is that the batting/filling of the blanket feels really cheap. It feels like when it gets washed the batting will get lumpy and move around. Other then that it met my expectations. It wasnt very wrinkly when I took it out so i was able to use it without ironing. Size feels about right.", 
    "This was everything I wanted and more and it fits my cal king!!!", 
    "This is the exact kind of comforter I was looking for. Love the pin tuck design. If you are looking for a stark white comforter, this is it. I must say it is a little loud, kind of like a down comforter sound, but very comfortable. The material makes it easy to wipe off dirt, which is nice.", 
    "Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present. She loves the taupe color in her bedroom. It brightens her bedroom and is so comfortable! Great choice. I definitely recommend this CARMEN 4- pc. comforter set!! GOOD VALUE.", 
    "Great comforter. The color was the same as the picture and very soft.", 
    "I expected the set to be much more durable/sturdy feeling. It's very lightweight and feels of a lesser quality. I'm disappointed in the price versus quality ratio. Also the pillow shams are on the small side. Otherwise, it does \"look\" nice on my bed (looks exactly like the picture). I've decided to keep it just avoid the hassle of shipping it back. It's not horrible, just not what I was expecting.", 
    "Darker than I thought. Shorter than I though. Feels nice and looks nice.", 
    "This comforter set was exactly what I was looking for. I love the look of this and in this picture, it looks nice and fluffy and comfortable. When I got it, the quality of this comforter set is below average by alot. The color and design is pretty and that's the extent of it. It has almost absolutely zero stuffing. It is SO THIN! I'm not sure how long this set will last, its not great quality. IF you have a lot of blankets on your bed to give it some height, it's ok. But, if you plan on having a plush comforter set, forget it. It looks like they completely forgot to add ANY filling in it at all. So flimsy! Was dissapointed when I received it. I am keeping it because it is pretty and I hate returning stuff. Otherwise, if you are looking for a great quality and fluffy/full comforter set...do not get this!", 
    "The fabric is pretty cheap and doesn't look like it will hold up well. I have it folded across the end of my bed to add some \"texture\" to the bedding, so it's good enough for that. The color, a very light taupe, matched the picture very well.", 
    "Comforter is beautiful. It does not slide off the bed and hangs beautifully. I could actually open the package and put on the bed and it was perfect, not all wrinkled and needing time look nice. I highly recommend this product. Arrived timely and could be used immediately. I love it.", 
    "I was very disappointed with this item. I had it on the bed for a week before the stitching started to come undone. a whole row is now unhooked and it left rather large holes. Not something I can fix and I don't think I will be ordering from here again.", 
    "This comforter set makes our master bedroom look like such an inviting retreat!! Just don't pull on the top due to the gatherings. You'll rip them if you do. Adjust it as needed by gently pulling from the underneath. But I LOVE this set and have received many compliments on it", 
    "Loved the accent pillows and the comforter is plusher than I expected. Very pleased.", 
    "We ordered this grey king comforter set and honestly we really like it. It feels like good quality, medium weight, good size for our king (we have an 11.5\" mattress) and is very attractive, providing just the right amount of texture and character. We have 3 complaints so far after just having this set for two days. 1. Comforter just ripped! I was sliding off of the comforter on my backside and a stitched pleat ripped right open, about a 1/2\" space. While it doesn't feel cheap, we are very surprised at how easily the stitching ripped. 2. The shams are Way too big. We have large king pillows and the shams are extremely loose, even after washing them to try to shrink them. 3. The shams are a different color than the pillow and comforter. The shams are obviously a darker shade than the rest of the bedding. Still in the same color family, just darker. Really want to like this set and do, it just makes us wonder what the next few years holds for us.", 
    "Love the comforter!! The material is so soft and the overall look is very rich looking. So glad I chose this.", 
    "This comforter is both comfortable and cute! The fabric is nice and light-weight and doesn't wrinkle too badly. It doesn't have quite the sheen I was expecting but it goes great in the room I use it. Definitely a good buy.", 
    "Pictures are truly worth a 1000 words; however, it is sad when the product looks nothing like the picture. It appeared to be so plush, so luxurious looking online. It was in reality paper thin and cheap looking!", 
    "This comforter set is very soft and comfy! The beige is very complimentary to any decor. Would recommend if you want a little frill, but not a lot of additional color.", 
    "Absolutely love this set! Great quality, looks just as pictured.", 
    "I have never had a bad experience with anything I have purchased on Overstock. I did read a few of the reviews and people mentioned that the comforter was thin and it was not as luxurious as it looks in the photo. I order it anyway and they were right. It's not bad overall. It's an ok look, but it's definitely not worth the money I paid for it. maybe 50 dollars would be the max I would pay. I will more than likely put this in my guest bedroom and buy another comforter for my room.", 
    "I have been looking for this type of comforter for a year now. There are similar ones available , but they are much pricier. I am so happy with the quality and look of this cover. Glad I waited!!", 
    "I love this set! The color as noted by others was a little dark but I found mine to be light and very close to the color on the website. I purchased the taupe set. I agree that it is light weight but for me that is not a problem. I simply added a down alternative comforter underneath but will remove as warm weather comes back. I live at the beach so it is perfect for us folks that live in warmer climates.Theg puckering is even better in person and almost seems as it it is woven to get the puckered effect. Size was not a problem for me as I was putting a queen on a full bed.", 
    "The color and quality of this comforter set was exactly what I wanted. It works well in our master bedroom, is just warm enough, and looks great.", 
    "I bought this set in the white. I have a queen size bed but decided I wanted it really long and wide so I got the king size. Its perfect!!! Its a beautiful white and really looks great in our master bedroom. Even my husband, who does'nt comment too much said how great it looked. Everyone who has seen it ask where I found this. Overstock is awesome!! It is a light weight comforter but keeps us warm and comfy. The pintuck look is very pretty.", 
    "Looks Beautiful on bed. Thought it would be longer.", 
    "This is very nice. I have had so many compliments. I put this in my master bedroom and paired it with blue green curtains and throw pillows. My only complaint is the color. It is definitely more beige than the image shows.", 
    "The comforter came quickly and has a beautiful pattern. It is quite soft and an overall very good purchase.", 
    "I ordered the grey color and thought this comforter set was going to have a little sheen to it (almost a platinum-like color) but it actually was a very flat, gunmetal grey color. Not pretty at all. The photo makes it look like the fabric is much dressier than it actually is. Maybe the white would've been prettier, but the grey was not at all.", 
    "Not as nice quality as I was expecting but I still kept it. Not as soft as I would have liked and doesnt look as crisp and exact as the picture. It is warm though and I dont need any additional blankets.", 
    "Love the color and the weight of this comforter. Feels so luxurious! Can't wait till spring to change colors of my pillows, the grey is a nutural color making it very versatel.", 
    "This comforter is different than most the diamond texture you see in the pic is real in person not as shimery as some pictures but i bought the grey and it looks great in my room (nice look, classy and not to \"girly\" )", 
    "I looked the world over for this comforter ... I love it it's as it appears on line. It is more creme than taupe but not ivory. It is a king not an inch larger. I do wish they had more color options!", 
    "this comforter was very nice looking but it had four dime size holes right in the center. not worth ***", 
    "I bought this comforter in gray for my daughter for Christmas. The package arrived timely and in perfect condition. The price was great. We had been comparing similar styles at * that were going for double the amount. We are happy with the style, quality and comfort of this item. I have had great success with Overstock.com.", 
    "Beautiful! Just as described. It finishes off my sons room so nicely. I will order from overstock many times in the future. Shipping was fast as well.", 
    "very impressed with the product. Looks exactly as pictured.", 
    "Set was very nice and true to color. Wished a bed skirt was included.", 
    "I am happy with this purchase. The picture looks very much like it but the color name is deceiving. The taupe isn't what I thought taupe would be. It is a lot lighter than taupe. It is more of an off-white to very light tan. However, I am still happy with it and kept it. The material is smooth but not overly soft but that is what you get with polyester.", 
    "This comforter is very pretty. I love it. It creates a warm and inviting bedscape.", 
    "First things first, it's very pretty! its not a stark white but white enough to make the room look brighter. The spare bedroom has a real girlie look with curtains to match the pattern of the comforter set. (curtains are stark white, but the look paired well) As a suggestion, you may want to use a white pillow case cover before putting on shams to give it an even look. (had mint green pillow protector on and was able to see color) What makes this purchase an added bonus was the price. Really a great bargain.", 
    "This comforter set is plush, warm and cozy and looks great in my room. It is well made and I expect to have it for a long time.", 
    "This set is so cute! It looks the same as I expected based on the picture. It is long enough that the bed doesn't need a bed skirt, but it looks great with one, too. My only complaint is that the fabric feels a little cheap, but it looks great and so far it is holding up just fine.", 
    "This is a beautiful comforter. It is rather warm. I have to kick it off a lot during the night. I'm sure I'll appreciate it even more when the really cold weather comes. Great value.", 
    "Happy with the product. Looks beautiful and looks exactly Ikea it is pictured. Item got here when it was supposed to.", 
    "The picture made it look very very light gray, thought it would be perfect for a very very light gray/blue room; however, it is more steel gray. Still looks good but would have preferred it be lighter. Very cozy and nice quality.", 
    "I ordered this set because i've seen the look a lot at Houzz. This set is thin but looks good. Not sure if it will last a long time but it's a nice trend. I got the white which is true white.", 
    "Comforter was very pretty but very thin more like a bedspread.", 
    "This is a beautiful comforter. I have yet to launder it, so not sure of it will keep it's shape, but it's a beautiful comforter for the price. I do wisg it came with a bed skirt, but it's not. A hige deal. The throe pilloe was a nice bonus. The comforter is transitional and can be casual or formal.", 
    "I bought this for my teenaged daughter. She loves this comforter and will not outgrow it for a while.", 
    "The comforter looks as elegant in on the bed as in the photos. I always lean towards a heavy bedspread but I gave up the heaviness for the look. It is very light but seems well made. I went with the gray and the color is very true to the picture. I am considering buying another one in the ivory as I just can't get over how great this looks. I could have used a bed ruffle put it was easy to match one up as it does not show. I have a queen bed with a high mattress and could have easily used a king and avoided the bed skirt. If you have a queen bed with high mattresses order the king if you don't want a bed skirt.", 
    "Target has similar bedding at a higher cost, I found this on Overstock for less and was so impressed with the quality of the material. It\u0092s beautiful bedding and I am really happy with it.", 
    "THis comforter is fantastic. It is not too thick but just thick enough. THe color is really nice. The fabric holds up really well. I would reccommend this to anyone.", 
    "This set was a lot more then I expected. It is soft, the color was as indicated and it completed our master update perfectly! I would recommend this to everyone!", 
    "Looks more luxurious in the photo, but overall o.k. for the price and as an interim fix to the more expensive set I'm waiting to buy during the winter white sales.", 
    "Love this comforter set. Elegant and subtle. This was just what I was looking for. I jazzed it up with some teal sheets and throw pillows. Perfect. Love the material and color.", 
    "I shop O.com frequently and for the most part, I am happy with the purchases. The is the third of my purchases of 30 items I have bought in the past that has lived up to expectations. The comforter is pretty but the material is very thin for a comforter and one corner's material is shredded and not fixable. I am considering returning it but that is such a bother and I did not keep the paperwork as I did not see the damage until I returned the following weekend to my summer home. The set is pretty but I bought the king size and it does not fit the bed. It is short on the sides and doesn't cover the sheet. In order for it to hang as it appears in the picture, you would need two sewn together and the picture is therefore misleading- at least for the king size comforter. The color was true and I guess if you get one that fits and is not damaged, it might be a lovely look. Based upon my experience with this product, I could not recommend it.", 
    "I was so pleased with this It is so pretty and soft....I just love it!", 
    "No complaints. Fits and looks great !", 
    "It's very soft and comfy, it it's kinda crazy it lights up when I touch the comforter it lights up!! I know it's strange. Explain to me please;-)", 
    "Its just what i expectIt was good product for the price", 
    "This is a nice comforter for the price. It holds up well in the wash.", 
    "The picture looks better. Very poor quality. Some of the tucks have already come undone!", 
    "The set is beautiful! However you cannot wash it... So that's a definite problem. But it looks so nice and is comfy too.", 
    "The product appears to be a satin pearl like finish when in actuality, it looks like a wrinkled bed sheet... very disappointed :(", 
    "Although the comforter looks nice, it's quite thin and a little on the short side. I was expecting something more plush. It may be nice in a guest bedroom.", 
    "The picture looks like an almost grayish white color, the comforter I got was tan. Not bad I guess if you wanted a tan comforter", 
    "Not large enough to fit brand new queen size pillows! Help!"
