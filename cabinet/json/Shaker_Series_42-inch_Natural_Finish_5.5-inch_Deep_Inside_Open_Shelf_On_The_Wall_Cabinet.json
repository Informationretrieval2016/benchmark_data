    "I bought this cabinet to sit on my bathroom vanity and replace my medicine cabinet. Great size, very well made. I painted it an it look great in the the new bathroom", 
    "Very good cabinet, great size and decorative. We bought a beautiful gray vanity and mirror and couldn't find a nice matching gray cabinet. This was the best answer, we matched the paint and put nice trim on the top and it is perfect!"
