    "This is the really BAD sofa sleeper, that do not transform easily from to sofa position once used as a sleeper. If your considering buying this please pick it up from my house FOR FREE.", 
    "Queen size excellent. Went together in about 45 minutes all together. For a futon it moves easily. Queen size is well, Queen size. Nice for my daughter and son in law to sleep on when they visit. Drawers underneath good to store sheets and or pillows. I am very pleased. Looks lovely. The wood is very nice. Easy to open. Better quality than I have seen in stores and a better price.So nice to know I can rely on Overstock to eliminate the hassle of going to a store.", 
    "The futon is a good value for the price. However, the installation instructions were nearly unintelligible...and we have built cabinets, furniture, even houses, so it wasn't operator error. There were extra bolts that didn't go anywhere and not enough nuts for the bolts we did need. The parts list was not helpful to determine which size bolt should be used where. All that said, it is very comfortable and I think our guests will enjoy it.", 
    "I can't belive how nice this is compared to futons at over $1000 this is better. Directions no so clear but easy to get togeather.", 
    "The futon is well made and very sturdy. According to relatives who have been sleeping on it for a week, the mattress is very comfortable. The only issue we have is a damaged hinge on the left side. The futon still works it just sits uneven when it is in the bed position. I tried to contact the manufacturer at their email address listed on the futon instructions. The instructions say they respond within twenty four hours. I found this not to be the case and after two weeks and two emails without hearing anything I contacted overstock. They were very helpful and are shipping me another part. I would recommend this item as long as you are not expecting to get support from the manufacturer. I would have given this item a Good or Excellent rating if the support would have been better.", 
    "After I paid someone to put it together, since it had too many pieces and it was complicated. The mechanical is not working properly. The sofa will not stay in the Up/Sitting position. I have asked professional to take a look at it, but everyone says the same things it is a company defect. Please do not buy it. You may not find customer assistance from Overstock.Com company and/or the Insurance company, whom I paid extra for. Very Disappointed.", 
    "It was easier to set up than some of the reviews that I read...."
