    "Looks great but once assembled is very rickety. Set it up with books and it sways like a ship. :(", 
    "if you are planning on matching this with other walnut items get something else. this is sooo not the right color. does not match any of my walnut items. had to put this in the garage cause it doesn't match anything and I didn't want to mess with the hassle of returning it. the quality and look to it are not imprressive either. very cheap looking. get something else.", 
    "Went together in about 1/2 hour. I had to have my husband muscle one back brace because the pegs didn't align exactly with the predrilled holes, but some muscle and a little wiggling got it done. I like the stand a lot.", 
    "Paint is a flat black, I'll probably touch up with black gloss. It is wood, looks like plywood. The shelves are all solid wood, not compressed or particle board. It will support the weight of all my cookbooks without warping. Good solid piece at a lower end cost. Looks nice too. Easy to put together.", 
    "I like this bbokcase for my cookbooks just the right size. but the color is off said walnut. but really a red cherry. it will do.", 
    "This bookcase came with no instructions, no screws and pegs so off center that they would not fit in the holes provided. It was necessary for me to go out and purchase screws, cut the pegs off, sand them down the replace them.. I was unable to find covers to hide the screws. Fortunately, I am using it in my computer room to hold printer, so the public will not see it. I have purchased all of the furniture for this room from Overstock.com, and have been very pleased with my purchases.", 
    "For what it is, this is good. It's functional, solid and well-made but don't expect a fine piece of furniture.. It's IKEA-level quality.", 
    "I put together every piece of furniture ever bought in my family, and this was a disasterfrom start to finish. The instructions are poorly drawn and I needed to go back online to see the photo to judge whether I was placing the shelves properly. The top screw holes did not match up with those of the side pieces. When I attempted to finesse it, I ended up almost destroying the top completely. I finally had to leave one screw completely off of the piece, which will not help its durability. Even moving it from the living room into the bedroom had to be done with 2 people since we couldn't risk the top being torn off. If it wasn't such a hassle to have boxed it back up, I would've sent it back to Overstock.", 
    "Beautiful little bookshelf works perfect in our home office. Our office furniture is black and this matched exactly. It seems sturdy and was an easy assembly. Highly recommend this piece.", 
    "I like the size and it seems sturdy, but was not easy to assemble. About half of the screws didn't seem to fit. I ended up spraying WD40 into the holes and the screws were easier to tighten.", 
    "works well in our guest bathroom", 
    "Great bookcase, might order a second one.", 
    "Absolutely loved it. Gave it to a family member and it's still standing and looking like it did when I put it together.", 
    "Assembled quickly. Perfect for my needs", 
    "Great for my studio, warm colour, easy to follow instructions for assembly.", 
    "Pleasantly surprised by solid wood quality and it has held up nicely over time, relatively easy to assemble, hubby had it together in less than an hour. Ordered the walnut finish which looks beautiful. Definetely recommend!", 
    "Assembly was very easy and the end result is very sturdy.", 
    "I love this book case! Super stylish.", 
    "perfect for my books and knick knacks", 
    "I love this little bookcase - it was easy to assemble and fits in several places in my house - good quality. easy instructions", 
    "This product was a perfect size for a small area, i positioned it under a mirror. Color and texture of wood was a good fit with other pieces. It could have been a little heavier, but was fine for books and pictures in frames.", 
    "Just as described, easy to assemble and a good value for the price.", 
    "Very nice quality, incredibly easy to assemble. The shelves are quite tall, but that is written in the dimensions, so just consider that before you order.", 
    "I thought this would pretty flimsy for the price but needed something this size asap. It turned out to be really nice - the wood looks great and not cheap at all.", 
    "Needed something small so I can put my small stereo on it. (Yes I still have mine) It's sturdy. I love it.", 
    "It's really nice to have if you don't have a lot of books.", 
    "Well designed and constructed.", 
    "Solid, easy to assemble, attractive. Read other reviews and did not have any issues with misaligned screw holes or problems with the finish. Ours arrived in excellent condition and looks very nice, holds a good deal of weight.", 
    "This bookshelf is really a nice piece of furniture with it warm brown color and is taller than I expected. I was pleased the large number of books I could put in it. It was not too difficult to put together.", 
    "Sturdy and nice looking. Easy to assemble.", 
    "I bought this bookshelf for the exact measurements to fit at the end of my kitchen island. The color is a little off, but works well with my cabinets. It's very lightweight, but sturdy enough to hold my cookbooks which is exactly the purpose I had in mind. It shipped and was here early without any damage and I was able to put it together in less than 30 minutes. For the price this is a real winner.", 
    "A very good buy for the price", 
    "We needed a bookcase for a small corner of a guestroom and this fit the bill! It is decorative, matches our more expensive dark wood and is well made. Very pleased with it.", 
    "Good quality....although came with a couple scratches we had to cover up.", 
    "I have several of these. Good value for the price.", 
    "This bookcase needed to extra time to put together, because the holes were a bit off (as other reviews informed me before I purchased). So it took me an extra 1/2 hour to assemble. One put together I packed it LOTS of book immediately.It makes a great nightstand for a book lover ! Daily I admire the play of light on its surface as it is not a dense solid color, but lets the wood make its magical 'shine through a bit' to brighten a darker area when lamp light touches it. The shelves are well made, as after the 2 years now, nothing has sagged under PILES of books.", 
    "This bookshelf is beyond my expectations. It is very sturdy and looks great with the rest of our furniture. It does not look cheap at all! It was a little difficult to put together but worth it. I bought another to match I like it so well!", 
    "The description states solid wood, but this is particle board. Cheaply made, but is sturdy. I could have found similar quality locally, but made this purchase because I thought, based on the description, that it was a better product than Sauder and the like. I would not have purchased it if I had seen it first.", 
    "I purchased a lot of things for my redecoration of my house from Overstock. They were all amazing. Great value great products. Great prices!", 
    "I purchased this shelf so I could fill it with various sized framed family photos. It looks great in my living room! My collection of photos looks great on the shelves. I like that it is open so I can see the photos from the sides too. If the sides were solid, I wouldn't like it as much. Easily assembled.", 
    "Wood construction was good and it was easy to assemble. It works for what I needed.", 
    "Good value for the money. Finish is not perfect but since it will be mostly obscured by books, it isn't a factor. Good value for the money paid.", 
    "I followed the instructions as I've put ALOT of furniture together. Hubby still managed to put the shelves backward, but not that big of a deal. Its for a sunporch so it won't be seen daily, does what its supposed to.", 
    "This is perfect for a few books and cds in my bedroom. I like it a lot.", 
    "Fairly easy to assemble and works great as a book shelf on a console in my husband's office. Black filing cabinets under it make a nice looking functional set for storage.", 
    "Very nice piece of furniture. Excellent rich deep color.", 
    "They work as described and look ok", 
    "Easy to assemble & looks great!", 
    "The overview stated that this product is solid wood; however it does not look or feel like solid wood. Disappointed.", 
    "Great size. Easy to put together.", 
    "again another good product easy to assemble and wood quality/stain are just what I was looking for", 
    "Great price - Great quality - you will not be disappointed in this item. I purchased the 5 - tier bookcase a few months ago and love it so much that I had to have the 3 - tier", 
    "Very happy with the quality of this product. It's built fairly heavy and doesn't look cheap. Only complaint is that the wood cracked a bit on one of the shelves when I put two of the screws in. I'm not sure if it was my fault or if the pre drilled holes were not quite in the right spot.", 
    "Good quality, easy to assemble, I bought the large one and then decided to buy matching small one because I liked it so much .", 
    "Ordered two, the first one went together easily, the second is not sturdy. Had to place the poor one against a wall with little on it.", 
    "Disappointed with quality", 
    "just the right size and look for the office", 
    "a little disappointed with this product. a few things to discuss is the lack of sturdiness, when fully assembled the bookshelf's legs are uneven alittle plus the little round knobs were not complete, one was missing.", 
    "We got two for our office and love them. Very nice looking, sturdy, and a great size to fit in cubicles with limited floor space. Added bonus...color was almost a perfect match for the existing wood tones in each cubicle so they fit right into decor. Easy to put together.", 
    "Put it together no hassle -- nice piece if you're not going to use it to shelve super heavy things. Also maybe not in a big traffic area. I have this set on an off wall in a bedroom and it is just perfect for the space. Looks like it should have cost more --as always I was most happy with this purchase.", 
    "Nice bookshelf and a great deal for the price.", 
    "I purchased this shelf as well as a matching larger one. Great product for the money, elegant, light, easy to put together. Might purchase another one.", 
    "Quick shipping, easy to put together. Sturdy and exactly what I needed for my media room.", 
    "Very sturdy, nice looking. I put it together myself in less than a half hour.", 
    "So pleased I am ordering two more. Easy assembly.", 
    "I love everything about this bookcase. the size and quality are just what I was looking for. I' ve already recommended it to a friend and would certainly buy it again myself", 
    "Arrived within 2 days and in good condition. The assembly took less than 30 min. I like the design of the piece, however, it is not the walnut color as advertised. All four legs do not sit evenly on the floor.", 
    "We ordered three of these for a long hallway. One arrived with several scratches and nicks, one arrived without any hardware to put it together and one arrived ok. The one that arrived with all pieces and not damaged is fine. It looks good, was easy to put together and seems sturdy. However it was pretty disappointing that two of the three had issues. Rather than hassle with packing them up and shipping them back we took a discount to keep them.", 
    "This ist an attractive bookcase in my living room. It isn't necessarily built top quality, but pieces fit and, for the price, I'd say it's value is worth price. It did take some patience to put together, but that may be user inexperience as much as anything. Patience!", 
    "This is a very nice bookshelf and looks more expensive than it was. I like the height of the shelves and design.", 
    "Needed a small bookcase for a short wall in the dining room. Ordered this, and it's perfect. Assembly was quick and painless, and the bookcase is attractive and completely sturdy. The walnut wood-tone is just as pictured, matches our dining room furniture exactly, and looks great. We have the bottom shelf filled with books, and the top ('middle' shelf) has both books and a stack of three decorative storage boxes to catch and hide the kids' clutter (crayons, markers, etc). The top of the case has a few photos on it, which can be quickly cleared and the top used as extra serving space during gatherings. Very happy w/this sturdy, good-looking bookcase!", 
    "This bookcase is a great value! It arrived earlier than expected, was a breeze to assemble and looks great! I've seen this same bookcase at other retailers, and the price on Overstock cannot be beat!", 
    "Very pleased that the bookcases arrived promptly and in good condition. We had no problems in putting them together. They look great in our family room.", 
    "This piece is very good looking and an excellent value for the price. I would recommend it primarily because of its looks.", 
    "After reading other reviews on this item, I went ahead and ordered 2 bookcases for my home office. I was looking for a bookcase on a budget. That is exactly what this is - a budget bookcase. It fits my needs and it looks OK. If you are looking for a high end piece of furniture then you would want to keep looking. It was relatively easy to put together and had it completed in approx. 15 - 20 minutes.", 
    "Purchased to put a few books and frames in my master bedroom. Perfect little bookshelf. Looks great and was very easy to assemble. Looks sturdy and the color is very rich.", 
    "I got two of these for my living room. They are a great solution to organizing my daughter's coloring books and puzzles in bins and add a cool style. They are good weight so we can load them up. I've gotten so many compliments on how great they look! On a side note, Scandal is my favorite show and Kerry Washington's character has the larger sized version of this bookcase in her apartment!!! I knew there was a reason to love this design!!!", 
    "Bought two shelves to match in room. They are great. Holds 3 shelves of books easy. Sturdy and looks good.", 
    "They really are nice bookshelves for the value. Using them in my reading room", 
    "I am SO pleased with this bookcase, it is really great quality wood and very sturdy. I was a little concerned that it wouldn't be based on the price, but it really is! I have pictures, books, candles, vase on it all at once and it looks great in my living room. It was simple to build in about 20 minutes (my 12 year old helped me do it!) I very much recommend this piece!", 
    "It's ok, I like how it looks but some parts are a little weak", 
    "Precisely the shelves I wanted. Excellent price and service! Easy to assemble!", 
    "I was impressed with the durability of this product. It does not feel or look cheap. It holds a good amount of books. I was able to clear out two large boxes. It is also easy to assemble. I put it together in an hour which is record time for me. There are not too many tools. Everything you need is in the package.", 
    "Although these bookshelves are quite attractive the quality leaves a little to be desired. All holes didn't line up causing wood to split during construction and they are very light weight.", 
    "Very nice product and easy to put together. Very fast shipping to the door.", 
    "I needed some bookcases that would be easy to assemble, hold many books and looked elegant besides. This one looked like it would fit the bill, so I bought two. I was particularly pleased that they were not heavy and difficult to move, as some are. I am so happy with them that I am thinking of buying two more for my guestroom.", 
    "thank you it was the only Christmas present I ordered that there was no problem.", 
    "Purchased this bookshelf for my son who has a collection of books that he wants to display in his room. He was able to assemble this product easily and was very satisfied with how sturdy and roomy it was. This was the one present he asked for this Christmas and it was a big hit. This model was rather stylish which made it appealing to my son.", 
    "I purchased this book shelf to get some of my books off the floor. It looks great and seems structurally sound. I did have trouble fitting a piece into its predrilled holes for the dowels. I don't have tools to tweek these types of misalignments, so I used a screwdriver to enlarge the holes. Easy instructions.", 
    "It looks beautiful. Deep rich walnut color. I'll probably be ordering more for my game room. My only complaint is the packaging. It uses the soft Styrofoam sheets that crumple into small bits of Styrofoam. I spent more time wiping off and vacuuming up this mess than I did putting the bookshelf together.", 
    "This was exactly the style & size I needed for our front entry. Shipment came quickly, which was nice. Me and my carpenter husband put it together very securely, which was easy. The quality is really really poor. The 'X' details were loose, and the bookcase was very wobbly after we tightened it a second time. After putting it together, I don't want to return it, but I would NOT recommend this to anyone, very poor quality. I expected at least XXXXXX furniture quality, it doesn't even meet that standard. The finish was not done well either, and scratched in certain spots, although the packaging it came in seemed to be done well.", 
    "These shelves are beautiful for the price. We bought two to flank a low TV stand in the family room. They were relatively simple to put together. They are ideal for holding knickknacks and family photos. I would not recommend overloading them with hardback books since they're not that substantial. I would agree with other reviewers that there seems to be a little inconsistency with the color due to one looking more brown and the other having more red undertones. However, once assembled and put in place with decorative touches, it is not noticeable to anyone. All in all, they are very nice for the money. I have considered purchasing more for other places around the house.", 
    "This is just as pictured and described. Very easy to put together, very sturdy, also very nice looking. Great purchase.", 
    "They shelves are well made and easily assembled. The top is a bit rough in the finish, but overall a good value. They look very sturdy and are currently loaded with heavy books!", 
    "I put it together in about 20 minutes. Easy and beautiful. Color is a nice brown, a lot like the picture. Very sturdy, not wobbly at all and solid. I love it.", 
    "very easy to put together. exactly as described. No shipping issues as it was packaged securely.", 
    "I searched for something the perfect size and, after assembly, the actual height is 34 1/4 inches, which is 1/4\" too tall for the space I wanted to put it. The description says 33.5 inches and the additional 3/4\" ruined it for me.", 
    "Better than expected. Great for small hallway. I was very pleased.", 
    "These shelves are great and in theory, very easy to put together. The trouble is, the dowels they used on the cross bars in back are way too big and some of mine were oval instead of round to match the holes. I am having the same problem with both shelves, essentially having to shave off the area between dowels with scissors in order to get these to fit. The manufacturer should have uses either smaller dowels or found a way to space these more evenly. What could have been a twenty minute setup on each is turning into more than an hour per shelf. Happy with the product, but pretty dissatisfied with the assembly.", 
    "This would have been an excellent buy except: CONS: the holes didn't line up to insert the 2 back boards. I had to take a kitchen knife and make the holes a little wider to get them to fit; the very top board didn't have any kind of guide to let me know where to screw in the 2 connecting boards on the bottom of it. I had to measure myself and make sure the holes on the side lined up with the holes on the side of the top board PROS: After it was put together, which wasn't easy, it was a pretty good shelf. Didn't wobble, very sturdy. Not too big, nice size. I like the end-result. So except for the assembly, the shelf looks and holds pretty good!", 
    "While I would recommend this to a friend, it would be with the advice that the espresso color is NOT espresso. It is the old Bombay Company Cherry...which is a nice color, but is in no way a black-brown. If you want dark, order black. It's a simple, nice design and moderately easy to put together. The back braces can require some finagling to fit into the predrilled holes.", 
    "Perfect little all-wood bookcase for a smaller room; easy to assemble.", 
    "Great shelving unit. They shipped it one screw short. Usually there's a number to call and they ship the screw, but not on this one. How frustrating is it to either ship the entire unti back or go to the hardware store in hopes that you can find a screw that works.", 
    "This product was very nice. I am considering purchasing another.", 
    "It was easy to put together and it fit perfectly it looks very nice in the family room .", 
    "Very pleased with the whole process . Great bookcases . I brought two as bedside tables and they work perfectly with lots of extra storeage for books plus I get to display nice objects making a really nice feature in the bedroom.", 
    "Made in Vietnam but with precision, better than made in China. They are great for the value and can't beat it. All the parts fit perfect - laser cut.", 
    "I bought this as a tv stand in my bedroom. I have all black furniture and the last thing I wanted was another black piece of furniture in the room. This bookcase was perfect given that the color matches but it's open enough to not seem overbearing. Paired with a couple of wicker baskets it really tied everything together and was the perfect height for my small bedroom tv.", 
    "I sold my five-bedroom, three bathroom house in August of 2012 and moved into a two-bedroom apartment. I had a lot of things to get rid of, and the first to go were my bookcases that were pretty flimsy when I bought them. I was determined to get real wood cases, but most of them were way too expensive for the number I needed. When I found the Montegos, I was pleased that they came in two sizes...five shelves and three shelves. They were pretty easy to put together and are sturdy and very attractive. Since buying two five-shelf units and one three-shelf unit, I have ordered another three-shelf unit and I don't think I'm done yet!", 
    "The bookcase is great, just the right size for the space I had. It matches quite close 2 other similar bookcases that are full size that I purchased some place else. Assembly was quick, simple & the bookcase is quite sturdy. It's a great little addition to my art room.", 
    "I needed a tall thin book shelf and this fit the bill. It's quality is fine for what I needed it for.", 
    "I ordered this case and the larger case. Didn't find so much as a small scratch on the product. Beautiful. I'm 76 years old and had no problem putting the cases together by myself. I've been happy with all my Overstock products.", 
    "We assembled this prior to Christmas for a gift. Assembly was easy and all the parts were included. Seems sturdy but has not been used yet.", 
    "Like most things that must be assembled, it took a little longer than expected, but ultimately will be fine for a first apartment. Time will tell if it was worth the investment.", 
    "This is a great bookshelf if you don't have tons of space (floor and height).I put heavy things on the shelves and they do not bow!", 
    "this is a great bookshelf. the distance between the shelves allows larger books or items (like trophies, vases) to be displayed", 
    "I love the shelves. They were very easy to put together and I would recommend as well.", 
    "Nice sturdy shelves. Great for what I wanted.I was confused because I thought it was 3 three tier shelves.I didn't read it right. I still like it and will keep it."
