    "This bookshelf looked much better online. When I got it, it was smaller than I expected and the shelves are covered in what appears to be contact paper. It's not even a laminate shelf. I already scratched some of the paper off one of the shelves while I was putting it together. Would not recommend this product.", 
    "I read the dimensions and knew this would be small, but it was smaller than I expected. Hubby put it together with no problem & it is cute. Just put it in a small area..", 
    "This bookshelf fits the room it was designated for perfectly. It's a little smaller than your average bookshelf but great for smaller spaces/rooms. It's study and was easy to put together.", 
    "Fits great in small spaces. Works perfectly for a kitchen pantry with plenty of space above since they are not to high.", 
    "Quite study and elegant looking", 
    "I bought this bookshelf for my son's school books and video game collection. It was super easy to put together and fits nicely in the corner of his bedroom. It is very durable and stylish as well.", 
    "Sturdy and good-looking, though smaller than I pictured it. Easy and quick to assemble.", 
    "The bookshelf is perfect. It's shorter than I expected but still wonderful. Fits all my books great."
