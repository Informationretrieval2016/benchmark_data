    "I ordered this sofa for my office. The color is perfect - maybe just a tad darker than the picture. The linen fabric feels like good quality. It seems to be sturdy. My only two complaints are the height (almost sitting on the ground) and you cannot sit on the center of the sofa (it's all bar).", 
    "this is a beautiful sofa. works well. not too hard to assemble. beware it is low to the ground, which is fine for me. i have a different problem. when it's open as a bed, i can feel a metal piece in the middle area of the sofa. if you move to the side a little, the feeling goes away, but it is there. so, i'd warn guests and give them extra blankets/padding just in case. but all in all, it's a great piece and i'm happy i bought it.", 
    "the sofa has the clean modern look but small. It works for me as this use for the guest suit in the TV area and for kids to hang out. but not i would not recommend this for daily usage. the quality is so so but sturdy and the color is true to the photo. it can sleep one small adult/teen.", 
    "It's a little firm but comfy considering it's a futon. It's a medium beige linen color, looks slightly darker in person than in picture. Otherwise, perfect, we love it! Great price and took me about 30 min to assemble by myself.", 
    "Smaller scale than depicted on the photo but well packaged, solid construction, nice linen look to the upholstery, firm cushioning. Bonus discovery was that the two halves don't have to be joined which happens to work nicely for my purposes.", 
    "this sofa bed is the size of a twin once you open, I purchased twin memory foam and alternative down mattress pad, still hard , so last attempt , bought a 3\" memory foam for my full size bed, took it off and cut it to fit a twin, better now.", 
    "Nice color and quality,but not too sturdy", 
    "A little short for sleeping for anyone over 6 feet, but wide enough. Good fit for a small room, easy to put up and down and nice looking.", 
    "The color is much darker then the picture and the true pattern of this product isn't as visible in this picture. I ended up returning this product.", 
    "Love it, very nice product", 
    "I sleep on it every night, and it's super comfy. Generally easy to assemble. Make sure it's delivered to your door since it's pretty heavy to lift up stairs."
