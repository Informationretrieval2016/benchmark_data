    "color as adverized - material quality good - holes for putting together a little off - managed to get good fit. I'm 83 and managed to put it together.", 
    "This chair was extremely easy to put together, all you had to do was attach the seat to the back with a tool that's included in the shipment. I LOVE this chair, it is elegant, soft and comfortable. I bought two similar chairs from Target a few years ago and they aren't nearly as comfortable as these. Also they simply look nice and definitely look like expensive furniture!", 
    "I was very satisfied with these chairs. They were everything that I expected them to be. They are more blue than a grey,very easy to assemble,and quite comfortable.They are perfect! I am a very happy costumer!", 
    "Really pretty chair and was very solid once put together. I did notice that the back and sit don't line up perfectly. The material is soft and with a pretty texture.", 
    "This is a stylish little chair that looks really nice in my spare room. Easy to assemble (just attach legs) and the color is pretty neutral and easy to accessorize.", 
    "Great price for lovely chair that works very well in spare bedroom. Was easy to assemble and lovely fabric", 
    "Bought two. Nice comfortable chair and pretty color. Only thing is one leg is a tiny bit shorter than the other three so it teeters. Both chairs had the same leg issue but still nice chair for the price.", 
    "color is right on, really classy, looks good in the corner of my office, and perfect size. The price was just right!", 
    "Pros: The chair was easy to assemble. Cons: The stitching was miss-aligned on the top six inches of the chair and is fairly obvious. For the same price you can buy a similar chair at ****** and these details would not be a factor.", 
    "The chairs are exactly what I expected. They are great for the price. They are comfortable and work perfectly for side chairs", 
    "Great color: Mist Blue - it looks exactly as the picture, very nice fabric, great value."
