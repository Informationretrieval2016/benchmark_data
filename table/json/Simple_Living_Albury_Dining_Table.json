    "This table is very nice.. I am very pleased with the quality. It is quite heavy and sturdy- very simple but well made. I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "So this table looks actually a lot better in person than on the photo. I am glad I took a chance and got it. Its sturdy and looks beautiful. Easy to put together as well and it is well balanced.", 
    "Using this for my home office. I think it'll be a tight squeeze for 6 people but great for 4 if using as dining table.", 
    "Waist of money terrible quality.", 
    "This table is exactly what I wanted. It came very well packed and completely undamaged with all parts needed to assemble. I had it open, put it together & had it upright in less than 10 minutes. Once the screws are tightened it is a very sturdy table. The size is perfect - not so big that it takes up my whole dining room, just big enough for 4 chairs and a bench. (The chairs I got from Overstock have a 17.5\" seat height, and the bench I found at an antique store with a 17\" seat height.) The white is definitely a true white. I actually purchased this with plans to stain my own reclaimed wood & attach it to the top to make a farmhouse-style table. I'm still going to do this but the white top of this table is so nice it almost makes me not want to cover it up! All in all very pleased.", 
    "This worked out perfectly for where I needed it, and was as represented.", 
    "They legs are pretty bright white and but the tabletop is slightly yellowed/ off white. Looks like they painted a dark table white", 
    "I am really happy with this table. bought the chairs that go with and it's perfect in our breakfast book. Great finish, sturdy, pretty turned legs, I really do like it. Very fair price on the table, I used a coupon. free shipping. very pleased.", 
    "Ordered this table for our kitchen, I was going for a contemporary look and wanted a true white simple table to go with the 4 black chairs we already own and our white cabinets. It is not a heavy piece of furniture so I will be getting a rug to go under it to prevent it from shifting around with kids pushing against it. Nice size for a kitchen and can fit up to 6 chairs. Great price and easy to assemble.", 
    "Ordered this table as an extra workspace for my little art studio over the garage. Delivered quickly. Took my husband 20-30 minutes to unpackage and put together. It's a nice table, maybe too nice for my needs...but it's sturdy and level and attractive. Actually it's too nice for what I'll use it for.", 
    "Easy to put together. Solid. Comfortably seats six. Perfect for our rental ski house.", 
    "made well; real wood; sturdy;", 
    "Very good quality for the price, looks gorgeous and was so easy to put together. Very happy with this purchase!!", 
    "So easy to assemble. Seats 6 perfectly. Very plain", 
    "Pretty sturdy smaller than expected but it fits perfectly in the space.", 
    "perfect little table for my boutique", 
    "This table is to be used as a computer table/desk. It holds everything that I need around me, and it is strong and sturdy. I love the decorative legs. This was the perfect choice for my new Library/office. Many thanks.", 
    "We love our new table. It is good quality and seems very sturdy. Love the rounded corners for our very young great granddaughters. I would have given 5 stars if the table had come with the hardware to put it together.", 
    "You get more than you pay for with this table. It is sturdy, elegant, and assembles quickly and easily.", 
    "Very nice looking, solid, inexpensive table. I bought it for a dining table in a small space. It is nice and roomy to sit at for a smaller table- and it is a little more interesting to look at and more substantial feeling/looking than your average rectangle white table. But it is not so stylized, so it really looks good with most decor/styles. It was simple to put together. Very happy with it!", 
    "Bought this for a beach condo. Love it. Sturdy and good choice.", 
    "Actually bought this to use it as a desk in my office. Very sturdy and lots of space!"
