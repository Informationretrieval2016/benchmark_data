    "This is essentially two bookcases that slide together like Tetris blocks. There are two ways to take advantage of this design. First, since the bookcase is essentially one big hinge, it can be turned in on itself at a right angle, which is handy for utilizing corner space. Alternatively, if you keep it a straight unit, you can spread the shelves apart to a perfect width (from about 30-56 inches). So, why only a three-star review? One significant issue is that the screws that hold the individual shelves together will protrude from the boards after assembly, which means they can scrape the shelves they're in contact with whenever you slide the two halves together or apart. Probably should track down some stickers to cover them.Another thing to be aware of is this bookcase is not symmetrical either left-to-right or top-to-bottom. There is no top or bottom shelf on the left half, and it cannot stand on its own. The top and bottom shelves on the right half are not interchangeable, and the design specifically makes the bottom shelf load-bearing. So, you can't (or at least, shouldn't) flip the whole unit over to change which half is on the left and which is on the right.I thought this would make a nice small room divider that I could place a against and fold one side out. However, to divide a room effectively, a bookcase needs to have an open design (i.e. no backboard) so that the case is accessible from either side. What you might not be able to tell very well from looking at the images is that there is actually a partial backboard on each half that extends out to half the length of a shelf. So, this unit is more closed than open.The shelves are only 9\" deep, which is actually at least two inches too shallow to serve as a bookcase. Many books will protrude. This is better used as a shelf for display and storing small items in baskets. Assembly was no picnic, but it can be done by one person.", 
    "Interesting design. Takes some time to assemble, but no more than expected with the size of it. Exactly as pictured.", 
    "Sturdy and easy set up. Looks great. 2 different styles.", 
    "Very modern look, we put it in the corner and it adds a nice style to what was a very boring part of the room. Really happy with the color and rhe quality.", 
    "We received this while painting the room, so I didn't open it right away. The box was in good condition so I assumed it was not damaged. It wasn't, but it was white when I ordered black. This thing is very heavy, so I kept it. It is a complicated piece to put together, and I've put a LOT of shelving together. Nice once it's done and I don't mind the color at all.", 
    "this is by far the worst bookshelf i ever bought, came with scratches and when i put it together the corners continued scratching the all the shelves LOOK DISGUSTING NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN AND NOT RECOMMENDED", 
    "I love this shelf it holds everything and is beautiful.", 
    "came with marks. I got the white one so it shows.. pretty good quality", 
    "The bookcase came with an incorrect piece that had exposed particle board when put together. Overstock did nothing to remedy the mistake. The bookcase is also unstable and directions were not user-friendly. We assemble furniture regularly.", 
    "I bought this for my daughter. It was a tricky to put together but it is sooo nice. She just loves it.", 
    "Love the way it came together - however its very heavy and it definitely needs two to install it or the\"incredible hulk\"", 
    "We wanted it for my teenage daughter'so room. We have it set up in the corner in her bedroom. It was very easy to set up and if she ever moves she can have it along the wall or in a corner. Great buy.", 
    "Very versatile for spacing", 
    "A bit cheep but will keep", 
    "Looks great in our living room corner, very easy to build with the Letter and numbered stickers on each piece. about 45 minute build time by yourself. each piece is pretty heavy to stand up after finishing.", 
    "I am extremely pleased with this item. I put it together by myself in no time. It was so easy to put together. Moved it myself to the location it is to be in and set it up. The only thing I had a problem with is that the felt tabs that are on the part of the shelves that slide together came off on one of the shelves and the screw heads scratched the surface. I just used a permanent marker to blacken the scratch and you'd never see it. I have received many compliments on this piece. I am very happy with it.", 
    "Good packaging. Fast shipping. Matches the white furniture in our home office. Love it!", 
    "Love it and is so versatile.", 
    "I DON'T RECOMMEND BUYING THIS ITEM!", 
    "This shelving has a good look and for the price I was not surprised at the particle board set up. However, it was challenging to put the two pieces together and it still looks off kilter. Overall would buy again.", 
    "fits lots of things! It has a basic finishing, what I already expected by the price. Good quality.", 
    "What a great idea! I needed a bookcase to fit in a specific space and this one, being adjustable, was perfect. Sliding one side into the other allowed me to make cubbies and leave spaces in the back for wires. Assembled and anchored by me, 58 and female.", 
    "I ordered 7 of these for home and office. After building the first one the rest became easier and easier but they are a bit time consuming to put together and they are heavy. So beware it is better if a 2 person job. I love the versatility of having it be a corner shelf, since it is adjustable it fits in any corner ( and fills up a wasted space the builders left) perfectly.I made the mistake of hammering the plastic housing on the 4 cam joints too hard on the first one we built, which made them hard to turn and I thought we had made a big mistake in purchasing the units, but it turned out to be my error, and on the next 5 I did not hammer so hard and they went together easily. I also forgot to put the velvet covers on the bottom of one shelf and it scratched the other during assembly..so beware. All in all- Very nice shelves.", 
    "Fits space I wanted it for perfectly and is an interesting piece of furniture"
