    "These chairs are perfect! They are the perfect size for my small living room. They look nice and are very comfy.", 
    "I really like the look of the recliner. But it is not suited to any one over 120 lbs. It tips over easily because of its light weight. I sit down carefully and make sure to lower the foot section before I move. I would recommend for looks but not functionality.", 
    "Comfortable, stylish, not to heavy to move around, just the right size for me, but I agree with other reviews that this is not a chair for a big person.", 
    "This chair is terrible. If you're a tiny person, it's fine, but otherwise it's too narrow. It's staying because I don't feel like sending it back.", 
    "I thought I finally found a chair for my husband. He has wanted a recliner for such a long time. The chair arrived today and he hates it. Its uncomfortable! He works long hours so he deserves a comfy man chair. I tried to return it and the cost to return it is ridiculous!!!! Now I am stuck with this chair. I will never order from this site EVER AGAIN!!!!", 
    "Complete junk! Had this less than 3 months, threw it out and bought a Lazy boy.", 
    "This chair was perfect for my daughters purple and grey nursery. It reclines back to a nice laying down position. The only thing I don't like is that the arm rests are really low, but that is minimal.", 
    "This is a decent recliner for the price. It's just a little on the small side and I do have some concerns with how it will stand up to daily use...", 
    "I guess I just had higher hopes for this. I debated on this for awhile, style vs. comfort and this seemed to be a good mix of the two. The color is perfect and it fits in well with my decor which I am really happy about. However, It isn't as comfortable as I hoped. You get what you pay for. It feels a little hard, and the back could have used more padding. Don't expect this to be a chair to melt into. The armrests do not come up as high as pictured, making it feel like it doesn't have any at all. I can only hope that the seat will relax in time. It also is very light, making it easy to move. Not always a good thing as I can see older folks falling while getting up. I do wish it did have a bit more weight to it to make it more stable.This will serve its purpose for now. This was a replacement for a broken chair. It is a decent chair for the price, but I don't think I would purchase it again if I had to choose again. I would wait and spend the money to get something nicer. I will eventually want to replace it for something more comfortable.", 
    "The chair works good. Other only problem is that the chair doesn't go all the way back :-(", 
    "Very light weight chair;easy to tip over backward also rather difficult to push the leg piece back in.", 
    "Purchased this as a gift for my father and he loved it. Very soft and beautiful color.", 
    "Great Item comfy more than i excpected", 
    "Light weight, but very comfortable. Color was grayish blue and was a perfect addition to our guest room. Size was not as bulky as most of the recliners out there. My husband is 6'1 and he fit in it so comfortably and slept on it for hours sometimes as it was very comfortable. I would recommend it especially for the price.", 
    "This was a replacement for the previous I had which was defective but Overstock's customer service was exceptional in remedying the error. Fast shipment of item. Comfortable. Good for man cave. My husband loves it.", 
    "Good for the price and comfy enough to take a nap", 
    "Nice chair, very comfy, and for the price I am satisfied. It is a smaller recliner, around the size of the average upholstered accent chair; but it is good for me and anyone probably average height and weight or smaller. I've actually fell asleep in this chair quite a few times and after having it for prob 6 months or so it has held up well, I would order it again.", 
    "This is a pretty nice recliner for the money. It is shipped in pieces and requires some assembly, which seemed simple enough, but requires some muscle. The chair is narrow, so if you are a big body, it may be too small. Not the most comfortable chair for a nap, but fine for watching TV.", 
    "I love this chair. It is perfect for my bedroom. It's just right for a corner where it was placed. It's very comfortable & has class. I enjoy sitting in it or reclining while reading or watching TV.", 
    "Closing mechanism doesn't work. Small seat", 
    "For an occasional chair, does the job and seems solid enough. Price is right, and the free shipping sure helped. Some have complained about the arms being low: I think that's a product of the user, At 6'2\", I find the arms the perfect distance down, but I can see that they would be a problem for more diminutive users.", 
    "Comfortable and great for smaller spaces", 
    "Nice gray recliner - modern and perfect for petite or elderly folks. Our grandmother loves chillin in it.", 
    "Nice apartment size recliner. Easy to get upstairs. Looks good, color true to one on site.", 
    "After reading all of the Customer Reviews, I will not be buying this recliner for my husband.", 
    "Not bad. Small but comfy. Nice addition to a new apt", 
    "Definitely got my money's worth. Easy assembly, just two pieces.", 
    "recliner,very nice,was shipped in a timely manor,thumbs up!", 
    "It is LITERALLY a one step assembly. Top piece fits over bottom. Good value. One week in, so not sure about longer term durability but so far, so good.", 
    "is a good value for the price"
