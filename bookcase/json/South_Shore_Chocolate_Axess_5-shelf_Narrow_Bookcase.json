    "This is a great unit at a good price. It's sturdy and fits the space perfectly.", 
    "Love it looks great in my living room", 
    "This was fairly easy to put together. The directions stated to use two people but I completed it by myself and I am not a large woman. For the price, it is a very good deal. It's fairly heavy. The backing is very light which is not a problem since it rests against a wall. The problem was one of the finishing pieces was not completed. It did not have the holes drilled into it so the hardware could be used. Since it was only a finishing piece, I left it off. It does not look as nice as it should but it's functional for what I need to use it for in my office."
