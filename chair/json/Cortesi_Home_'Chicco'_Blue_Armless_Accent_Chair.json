    "came in good condition, super easy to put together, I like it!", 
    "Absolutely gorgeous! The picture doesn't do them justice. I bought 2 for my Ladies Tea area and I couldn't have picked better chairs. They arrived 2 days after I ordered them, and my husband easily put them together immediately. I love them!", 
    "This chair added just the right \"pop\" of color in a corner!", 
    "Lovely color blue ..sturdy chair and fast delivery!", 
    "Love the color. Perfect bedroom accent chair. Easy to put together.", 
    "Easy to assemble, comfortable and a beautiful addition to our bedroom! The sea breeze blue is perfect!", 
    "Beautiful color, as expected, the construction matches the price. Recommended for decorative and occasional use, not regular or heavy duty use unless you want it wrecked in 2 years\u2026..", 
    "LOVE LOVE THIS CHAIR IT IS PERFECT AND THE PERFECT COLOR OF PEACOCK BLUE. A GREAT FIT IN YOUR LIVING ROOM OR BEDROOM, IT WILL BRIGHTEN ANY SPOT.", 
    "I have this in the corner of my bedroom. Comfy seat to use to put on my shoes and socks. The color is very rich and creates a classic pop to the room.", 
    "Very beautiful and comfortable.", 
    "I had read the other reviews and realized that this chair would work better as an accent. Indeed, it doesn't seem to be built with lots of support under the seating area. However, I really like it, and for our purposes it finishes the room quite well.", 
    "This chair is perfect for what I wanted - to offset the heaviness of a large sectional couch, yet not look too small in comparison. The color is gorgeous and rich, the fabric is very soft and it is sturdy. It was fairly easy to put together, but the inside of the chair is hollow so it's not really a cushion. It is not a lounging chair, but it will be a comfortable spot for guests to have a seat instead of having to pull up a kitchen chair. I would recommend this if you need a decorative chair to add some depth to your living space!", 
    "Perfect for my purpose. I needed a low chair for accent purposes. If your a tall person it won't work.", 
    "It works well as a side chair in a guest room. Modest in size so good for smaller spaces.", 
    "Very pretty color. Great accent chairs. Not good for comfort.", 
    "Perfect for a side chair in bedroom.", 
    "Must admit I didn't notice that the fabric was like a crushed velvet look but the color and the style is what I wanted.", 
    "This chair is great. Easy to build, and it seems to be pretty good quality. It works perfect as an accent chair with minimal to moderate usage. I'm not sure how long it would last with heavy usage. The seat cushion doesn't have a whole lot of support. The color is bold. The blue really pops!"
