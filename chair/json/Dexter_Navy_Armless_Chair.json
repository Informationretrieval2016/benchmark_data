    "This is a beautiful chair. I could not be happier. It is exactly as it appears, and is an amazing value. It looks like a $1200 chair that *** would sell. It is a beautiful navy color that is really more of a rich indigo, which is really hot right now. The piping is ecru/light beige, not white, which was actually better for me...but in case you were expecting bright white, I wanted to point that out. I have it in my casual modern living room..paired with purples, greys and blacks--with furniture and decor from*** and the like. I also bought some indigo suede pillows from ** to put on the other furniture--perfect match in color and fabric. Also, my husband put this together in a couple of minutes (legs are in a hidden compartment in the bottom of the seat). This is lightweight but substantial in size. Good seat height and back height. Its not a plush chair--it's definitely firm--but I find it comfortable for fitting my proportions (5'6\") as well as those of my husband (6'2\"). I highly, highly recommend this chair--very on trend as well as classic at the same time.", 
    "I love navy or dark blue furniture. It makes a room and these chairs did not disappoint. They are true to the color online, very rich color and soft texture. I have not seen any other review mention that the pillows do come off which is great because you can sit even further back and put the pillow next to you and really relax in the chair. With the chair not having arms, this is great. I have a 3 year old so I have already discovered they clean easily as well. They are not really heavy chairs so I put them on a rug that has a rug pad on hardwood and they have stayed in place very well. I would definitely buy again.", 
    "This chair is such a good value- I've seen similar styles at high end furniture stores for 3 times the cost. Comfortable, beautiful and classic, this would look great in a lake house or a city apartment. I found the color online to be very true, it is a beautiful deep blue. I agree with other reviewers that the piping is more of an eggshell or ecru, but in reality it's better because it won't show dirt like bright white would. I find this chair to be very comfortable, although it is on the firm side- not something that you sink far into. I loved it so much, I bought another one!", 
    "These Dexter Navy Armless Chairs are beautiful to look at and comfortable to sit on. The styling gives them great presence in the room and the color is more than a pop; it's an explosion. The contrasting color of the piping adds to the beauty of the piece giving it a tailored look that I love. It is a high, firm sit which I prefer to squishy low chairs that you fall into and are hard to get out of. The packaging of the pieces insured that they would be delivered safely and unmarred. I also appreciated the free shipping.", 
    "The quality of the material on the chairs could be better. One of the chairs arrived with a broken leg. The screw housing was missing. I called O.co and told them about the issue. They asked if I could go to the hardware store and get the necessary piece to fix it and send them the receipt. The piece couldn't cost more than a dollar so I asked if I could just get a coupon toward a future purchase. They gave me a $$$ credit, which was more than fair. The credit appeared automatically on my next purchase, which was made 3 weeks later. While the chairs are just ok (cushion is hard as a rock and the fabric is cheap), the O.co customer service was excellent.", 
    "I am redoing my living room and needed a pair of chairs across from the sectional. These are a great size, not too small for adults to be comfortable. No arms means bigger seat but a small foot print, space wise. Screw on the legs and you're ready to sit. They are firm, which I like but have a nice pillow back. The piping is off white which other reviewers commented on, so I knew this ahead of time. Great price.", 
    "I love these chairs. They came today and I'm so glad that I purchased them. They came in a dust bag (which will be nice for when we move) and the legs were safely under the seat. The style of this chair is spot on. Reminds me of something you'd see in a beach house in the hamptons. I was searching for two chairs to complete our new living room. Our couch is pretty large and other chairs were dwarfed by it. But not these! Thanks Overstock!", 
    "I was suprised to see the chair was a lot large than I Imagined. I love the deep navy blue color. legs where a little fllimsy.. other than that, great product.", 
    "Great looking chair...but a little to firm for me. This is a large chair. Assembly was easy. You are getting what you pay for....but if comfort is more important than looks....move on. Fortunately this was purchased more as an accessory than a need. I'll keep it. Not a bad deal.", 
    "It goes well with my navy color themed bedroom. May get another one", 
    "Love this chair. Fits well to our coastal theme. High quality.", 
    "Nice, comfortable armchair for my bedroom. Online, the material looks more like linen, in reality it has a more velvety feel and look. True to the color shown online.", 
    "These chairs look so elegant and are comfy. The color is a deep Navy. Worth the money. I had to move so ended up giving them to my sister for her jam session room. The lack of arms is apparently great for guitar players.", 
    "I've had this chair for about 4 years now and it still looks great. Thinking about purchasing another.", 
    "This chair is relatively well made and comfortable. I have set it across from a designer sectional with the same type of contrast detailing, and it looks beautiful! :) I would say the picture is perfectly accurate.", 
    "Love these. Easy to clean. Comfortable to sit on. Very nice quality.", 
    "We love this new chair we bought for our living room. It's color is rich and bold and adds just the right pop of color to our otherwise quite neutral space. Good construction, decent comfort for an armless chair, beautiful style lines.", 
    "Comfortable and stylish. Gets lots of comments", 
    "This chair is very lightweight, not heavy and sturdy. The material is cheap looking. Not a chair that will withstand everyday use.", 
    "Poor quality construction. Legs very wobbly. Takes up more space than the dimensions suggest because of the design. I wouldn't purchase again.", 
    "The title says it all. This chair looks nice but not very comfortable.", 
    "I LOVE this chair. It is very comfortable. I would consider it medium firmness. The color is not quite as deep a Navy as I expected but still beautiful and very rich looking. These chairs also can be put together side by side to create a small loveseat. Works great and then I can separate them when I want to. I highly recommend this chair.", 
    "I bought these for ,my office, they are larger than I expected, but are awesome. They ar firm and color is spot on. Love them", 
    "I love this chair. Perfect for my living room, in fact, will probably order another one. I had read the reviews and agree completely that you can not get this quality chair for this price", 
    "Needed a comfy chair for the corner of main guest room...Perfect!!!Love the deep blue color which goes well with my \"coastal\" d\u00e9cor. Verycomfortable and my guests have loved it too. Good product for the price!", 
    "I purchase two of these chairs for my living room, They came sooner than I expected and in good condition. The color and style is excellent and they look great in my living room. I especially love the fact ,I bought them when they were on sale and know I got a great bargain. This chair(s) are an excellent buy ,full price or sale. I would recommend this chair .", 
    "The packaging was terrific! And I was thrilled when I opened the box to see the chair! The color is perfect...the trim is white. The legs were a cinch to put on and the zipper compartment under the seat is great to keep the shipping cover in just in case I need to cover up the chair for some reason. I could not ask for more...well, yes I can. I am ordering a second chair just like it! You cannot miss with this chair...you will love it just as I do! Even my husband commented that it was very good looking, and this from a man who does not like armless chairs!", 
    "Chair color is true to photo deep navy blue with beige piping. Box came battered but chair inside okay. Pouch under chair hiding legs nice touch. Easy screw on legs no hassle at all. Has pads on end of legs for wood floors. Nice. Looks gorgeous and soft but cushion is firm.", 
    "These chairs are gorgeous, comfortable, stylish and well made. They are nicer and less expensive than similar ones I saw at many stores", 
    "Chair arrived packaged decently, I think UPS was a little rough with it. It's a good value and not a piece you see everywhere so it's eye-catching. Pretty color and size-wise it's a full-size, real piece of furniture, not the smaller-than-normal chairs you might find at a comparable price in national chain stores. I highly recommend using the black plastic discs that come with it when screwing in the legs. It seems to help stabilize the frame, judging by the squeaky sound that disappeared when I went back and added the disc on one side. It's not super high-end, but it looks very nice, seems durable, and works well in a transitional style room.", 
    "Super fun and great looking chair. Great price. Quick assembly. Wider than I thought but fine. The blue is a nice bright navy. It is not heirloom quality by any means but I think they will serve my young family well for the next few years.", 
    "Great collour. Very durable and comfortable. Bought this as a bedroom chair and it really does enhance the room. The colour is rich and the trim is an off white, not white which again is perfect. Highly recommend this chair. The price was half of what I have paid on other sites.", 
    "THIS CHAIR IS A GREAT ADDITION TO ANY ROOM, ADDING COLOR AND ELEGANCE. IT LOOKS LIKE A MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE CHAIR WITH THE WHITE PIPING AND VELVET MATERIAL. IT ARRIVES WITH ONLY REQUIRING YOU TO HAND SCREW ON THE LEGS AND YOU'RE READY TO ENJOY.", 
    "This is a great chair for a small sitting area. I would not recommend it for everyday use. It is a pretty stiff cushion. Hopefully it will get softer with use. For the price it is a very nice chair.", 
    "I had this chair for over 3 moths, and it looking very nice. I was happy with the purchase. Our cat likes it too, she claimed it the moment i put it together.", 
    "This is a big chair and it needs some space- so pay attention to the dimensions. I have a tight living room and I had to find the right spot for this chair. It has a higher back and a squarish look but it sure is comfortable. The fabric is rich and soft, although it is sturdy high quality microfiber- it looks like cotton velvet. I bought this chair for it's large sturdy size, lack of arms and soft but firm seat. The back pillow is loose and can be removed or used on both side. The cushion pillow can come off but it is secured with velcro to the bottom- so you cannot flip it if it gets dirty. I plan to scotch guard it for durability.", 
    "This chair is exactly what I've been looking for. It matches my sofa perfectly. I am very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "This is a strikingly beautiful chair that can be used in transitional or modern settings. . It is well made with quality fabric and piping. My one reservation is that the seat might be too deep for some guests. It looks great and is fine for me to curl up in.", 
    "LOVE THE LOOK OF THIS CHAIR....My husband and I purchased 2 of theses chairs for our formal living room. They are beautiful. Very firm but lite to move aroud. The color is very exact with the trim being a light beige. Highly recommended.", 
    "So i absolutely stocked this chair for over a year before going in on it, AND I'M SO GLAD I FINALLY WENT FOR IT! The material is crazy soft almost velvety. The color is a deep lovely true navy. It is firm but i assume it will soften with time and use. They are super sturdy and over-sized which is fantastic. They look streamlined and stylish. They were definitely worth while.", 
    "Shipping was extremely quick and the chairs arrived in perfect condition. They are beautiful and very comfortable. Much better looking in person", 
    "The chair is perfect. I'm using it in our guest room. It's comfortable, sturdy and good looking . Color is true navy and plush. Packed well and shipped fast.", 
    "SO FAR ALL WELL. I DO LOVE THE RICH BLUE COLOR AND IT IS COMFORTABLE.", 
    "The chairs look very \"Hampton\". Amazing for a lake home!", 
    "I bought these chairs to sit in front of the fireplace of my new living room. They are a great chair to add to the eclectic look I have with modern and antique pieces. The chairs arrived in and were easy to put together. I did it in about 5 minutes. They look fantastic and are very comfy. They are large enough to curl up on and have a firm seat which I like. I would definitely recommend them for anyone looking for a larger accent chairs.", 
    "I've had this chair for about a month now and couldn't be happier. It is very large, but meets the dimensions listed in the description. Not the most comfortable chair in the world, but we love it. For the price it can't be beat!", 
    "great chair looks terrific in a bedroom would reccommend to all very strong and well built", 
    "LOVE this chair!!!! It's my new FAVOITE piece! The blue is very nautical and trendy looking! Couldn't be happier!!", 
    "We had to return a chair due to some problems and decided on this one and we are so glad we did...it is exactly what I wanted and it truly compliments our decor..", 
    "Chairs are a great addition to my living room. They are a bit larger than I originally anticipated, but still fit. Overall very high quality, no real assembly required (outside of attaching the legs).", 
    "Considering the low price of this chair, it's pretty darn good. I almost called Overstock to complain about not sending us the chair legs with the chair. I didn't notice the zippered compartment in the bottom of the chair that had the legs in it. Yes, the seat is a bit hard but I'm sure with regular use it'll soften up. Not sure how well the back cushion will stand up to the test of time though. It seems like it'll go flimsy pretty fast. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase. When I can afford to buy $1000 armchairs, I'll buy a nice one. Until then this one will do just fine.", 
    "Im in love with these chairs,I ordered 2 for my lake house because I was going for a hamptons beachy feel and I was so excited to find out I could use them in my bedroom or my living room,They are so versitile,They were much more substantial then I thought and so comfy!! I highly recommend these chiars..Buy 2!", 
    "The chairs are great blue color, true to the picture. Except for the white trim, it looked a little dingy baby blue color. But the chairs still look great, they are very high chairs, so definitely measure because it might be higher seating than the rest of your furniture.", 
    "The theme of my livingroom is white and navy blue. This chair along with the off white piping blends in so well. Great value for the money. Sturday and plush materiat. The only issue was the stitching which looks like it is too loose holding the off white trim.", 
    "I really like this chair! It was just what I was looking for and adds an updated style to our livingroom. It has a very firm seat and works great for tall, long legged people! So happy with my purchase! Will buy from Overstock,com again!", 
    "Chairs were expected as far as size and comfort. The cording detail is a dirty white or gray, not expected.", 
    "Love this chair. size, scale, color, shape. Perfect accent to any room!", 
    "We were delighted when these were delivered as they made a statement in our living room. The chairs (we ordered two) are comfortable and have a great presence. They have added life to a very neutral living room. And we can't believe how reasonably priced these are. Excellent choice for us.", 
    "This chair was the perfect size for my home office and the color matched the blue in my area rug. The contrasting piping adds a nice touch. It's not a chair to curl up in and is on the firm side but works for occasional seating. The back cushion can be removed and I will probably add another contrasting smaller pillow. Super easy to put together. The legs come in a zippered pouch that is part of the underside of the chair. (At first I thought they forgot to pack the legs)Overall nice looking chair."
