    "This bed is great, love the look of it. The drawers are deep enough to place extra blankets and sheets. The construction feels sturdy there are enough slats to not use a box spring. It's a great bed on the opposite side where there isn't drawers for larger storage boxes. Also added bonus open door in front of the bed for even more storage. I think you get the idea, lot's of storage and I really love my new bed.....", 
    "Bought this for my grandson. Cautious about purchasing bed over internet, but felt Overstock.com's reputation was worth the risk.. My grandson is extremely pleased and so am I. This should last him until he leaves for college.", 
    "great product and service", 
    "The only problem we had was the center support broke, but that was an easy fix. It is gorgeous!", 
    "My son is happy but I am disappointed in strength of bed. Support board broke down middle of bed. Also bed was scratched during delivery."
