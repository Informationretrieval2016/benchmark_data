    "It's nice but it has no back, meaning the design and fabric doesn't go all the way around. It needs to be placed on a wall not free standing. It has metal legs not wood. The color is more of a dark charcoal then a light grey.", 
    "Arrives packaged well, easy to put together on bed frame, can be done with one person:))", 
    "Ordered the wrong size but because it takes a while to get it just mounted it to the wall. It is a beautiful headboard. To bad it takes over a month to receive.", 
    "Bought 2 of these for a guest bedroom. They arrived in great shape and very nice fabric. very easy to put together. Highly recommend"
