    "This is a pretty bookcase but I had a few issues. The lattice was broken in two spots - I am going to try to glue it. The assembly was fairly simple but the top shelf is a problem. All of the other shelves had grooves, screws and it was very simple. The top shelf however had nothing - literally I had to just set it on top of the shelf with no reinforcement. The only thing I can do is get some long thin nails and nail it through the top. If these issues were not there, this would be a very cute shelf but I think those are serious problems.", 
    "This is a pretty low-quality bookcase--probably worth about $50-75. It arrived with several cracks on the decorative sides. They are not particularly noticeable, so I chose not to return it. The holes to screw in the shelves don't really match up and I think not all of the holes are deep enough, as not all of the screws can be screwed in to the point where you can cover them with the wooden plugs. Even if all the screws DID go in, most of the wooden plugs are too big for the holes so I have to shave off their sides with a knife. It's not very hard to put together, other than fighting with the screws that won't go in. Otherwise, it's holding my books and not sagging, so it seems sturdy enough to do its job. It looks nice, except for the uncovered screws.", 
    "I needed a bookcase that was well built and solid, as well as fit my PB&J sandwich budget. This was the perfect answer, I didn't have to settle for poor quality; the assembly was a breeze. I would have given it a 5 star, but one of the shelves was cracked. It seemed more of a hassle to send it back, especially since it's a solid heavy item.", 
    "This is basically a hex-screw and stick bookcase. It is lightweight but seems sturdy enough for most books, video games, dvds and various gewgaws. I wouldnt put an encyclopedia set on it or anything as heavy as that. The bookcase looks good, was easy enough to assemble and is a step up from milk crates. I got the black one and am happy with the color.", 
    "For the price, you can't get a prettier and more functional shelf. As it looks in the pic, it's really meant for a combination of books and decoration, which is how I use it. Everyone who sees it, loves it. For a bookshelf only meant to hold books,there may be better options, but as a combination piece it's fabulous. The price is great!", 
    "When I saw all the issues people listed in their reviews of this bookshelf I was hesitant to buy it, but this was the only bookshelf that came in the color/style I wanted and had the capacity I needed. I decided to give it a shot, figuring I could return it if it was unsatisfactory. I ordered the espresso one and am very happy with it.Others that reviewed that product mentioned receiving damaged parts. I received mine well-packaged and undamaged, with all the parts. The wood is very soft and easily scratched though, and I accidentally nicked one of the sides while putting it together. I am not at all a handy or DIY person, but I managed to put it together in about an hour. It is very sturdy. Though it comes with parts to attach it to a wall, it doesn't need to be. Mine sits on carpet and is level. I use it to hold all of my books (each shelf is full) and a few knicknacks.", 
    "I purchased two of these bookcases over a year ago to hold my office books and papers. I work in taxes, and have many heavy reference books and folders full of heavy paper. I have FILLED these shelves, and they are not warped or bending in the slightest! I am very impressed, because the shelf unit itself is not heavy at all. It looks fantastic, with the styling of the shelves, and was very easy to assemble. I have recently disassembled and moved them flat, and was able to reassable them easily after the move. I HIGHLY recommend these shelves!", 
    "I needed a place for my shoes so I purchased 2 for my dressing room If you are looking for the star Hollywood closet without the price theses book cases are a great start. PERFECT!!!!!! 20 pairs of shoes on each case. BEAUTIFUL. great if you have a shoes, boots, and bags. It didnt take hubby long to put them together", 
    "the only thing that was wrong was some of the screw were missing. I contacted overstock and they had the company send me the screw i need.", 
    "I had trouble finding a bookcase that I liked in an expresso finish to match some of my other furniture. This item matched perfectly. I was hesitant based on some of the reviews about sturdiness. I haven't had any problems and it holds most of my books.", 
    "Great shelves, purchased three (one smaller). They look great, solid, light, easy to put together... Might purchase two more... Will not be disappointed", 
    "Okay, so I bought it because it was under *** and I was looking for something super cheap to fill a void. Well, I got what I paid for, folks! This bookcase is one step up from balsa wood. I expect it will last no more than a year and am already looking for a replacement. It's nice looking and was easy to assemble. However, I would NOT recommend it to a friend. An enemy, maybe. But not a friend.", 
    "Not very good, unclear assembly instructions, and no mention in description that you need to tie this to the wall with brackets to prevent it from tipping over.", 
    "I like it so much that I am ordering another one. As, I said, there was a considerable nick in one of the shelves, but I am going to order a mate to the one I have.", 
    "It is a good bookcase. just what i needed. good color, sturdy... won't fall apart.", 
    "The first time I ordered this product, I received it within a week, but after I opened the box I couldn't put it together because not only was there no hardware included, there were no directions. My husband called and got them to send us a return shipping label and a new bookshelf. We received the label a couple days later and the second bookshelf within the week. We then returned the first one and I put together the second one. I mostly put it together myself and am happy with how the end product looks, however i had a few issues: 1. The decorative hole fillers weren't secured and I have had a couple fall out. Not a structural issue but a safety issue if you have little ones that pull on anything they can reach. 2. When adding the brackets so I could secure the shelf to the wall, the screws into the brackets refused to go in straight and so they wouldn't go in all the way. The bracket on one side was loose until I could get my husband to come with the drill and tighten it. 3. On the first bookshelf there was a chunk missing from one of the side panels and they hadn't touched it up with stain, even, 4. when attaching the bars across the bottom of the top shelf, i had a very hard time tightening the screws enough so that they were flush with the shelf. Overall, not a bad purchase, but not sure if I would pay that much for it again.", 
    "This bookcase is not as sturdy as the previous one I bought ( Mission bookcase) Also,, it has included brackets to hold it to a wall -- The description did not state this, and I would not have bought it if I had known. I cannot use the brackets, and I needed a bookcase that was freestanding/movable. I am usin it without the brackets, so it wobbles a bit.!!", 
    "Sturdier than I thought they would be and very nice bookcases for the buck.", 
    "Added this to our bathroom, which adds a nice touch to the space and is not too overwhelming that it takes up too much space, but gives us added areas for storage. Easy to assemble too!", 
    "Wonderful shelf. Looks good and easy to put together", 
    "Looks great in our living room!", 
    "I have a small bathroom that was in need of a fairly narrow set of shelves for towel storage and a few baskets to hold TP etc. This fit the bill perfectly.", 
    "I really liked these bookcases. Easy to assemble and it held all of my books and assorted stuff nicely. Really adds a nice line to the room. I ended up buying 2 to balance out the room.", 
    "Nice Bookcase for the money. I bought two and they look very nice together in our hearth room. Only drawback is that the assembly directions are not great. However, with a little common sense, you can get through it.", 
    "Simple to put together and looks great.", 
    "Purchased this bookcase for my husbands office. It complements his black office furniture very nicely. The quality is good and the frame is sturdy. Only problem we had was with the round inserts to cover the wholes. They were hard to put into the holes once we finished putting it together. Other than that, it was still and excellent buy!", 
    "While I did not return, have to say this item is overpriced from a quality-price ratio standpoint. The walnut finish is uneven and mottled and cracks appeared in wood in two places after tightening (but not over-tightening) screws. Not thrilled.", 
    "Don't waste your money. You barely touch this bookcase and it sways.", 
    "Great for retail. Looks nice and very light weight.", 
    "Beautiful bookshelf, but unfortunately panel be arrived with a crack in the lower support portion, so I was stuck half way putting my book shelf up. No I have to wait until this claim is reviewed and hope they send me a new panel B. ;-(", 
    "These are pretty nice, I'd say about average. They fit perfectly in the space we needed them for.", 
    "Love, love, love! I've had these for several years now and they look great and are very secure (I secured them to the wall)", 
    "Received quickly. One bookcase required a bit of glue work- reason for 4 rather than 5 stars- but otherwise still sturdy and looks good. The other two were in excellent condition. Easy to put together and attach to the wall and holds loads of books. Exactly what I needed for a rarely guest room that I didn't want to spend much money on.", 
    "This bookcase was everything I expected and more because it was not hard to put together at all. Mostly, it looks beautiful! I'm thinking of getting the smaller one, too.", 
    "I was very surprised about the quality of this shelf considering the price. A very good value. I did order a color I didn't love the first time, but sent it back and got the espresso color. Love it.", 
    "this item is very usefullexcellent", 
    "Awesome shelf. Really sturdy and looks like a quality piece.", 
    "It was missing over half of the bolts required for putting it together and had no contact info to contact and tell them!!", 
    "Good price, cute but some of the side x-cross pieces have tiny gaps", 
    "Walnut color is nice and warm. Assembly was easy. Although some of the parts did not perfectly match. Overall, very happy with the purchase.", 
    "So cheap. The pieces were hard to put together and the X''s in the side panels were barely hanging in there. Nails were sticking out in multiple places. Very cheap product. When I move it's going in the garbage.", 
    "Serves the purpose for which it was purchased. Fits perfectly in the corner of my bedroom", 
    "Prompt delivery. Easy to assemble. Exactly what I paid for.", 
    "My nephew put this together for me in less than an hour, and it's more elegant that I could have imagined by looking at the online image. I am very pleased with it.", 
    "Very classy bookcase. Allow about 30 minutes to put together. Overall happy with appearance and quality for the price.", 
    "Just as described, easy to assemble and a good value.", 
    "When I received the package, I was super excited to open it and put it together. Because of reading the other reviews, I was a bit nervous about some of the pieces being cracked , but nothing was! It is sturdy and beautiful! I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking to purchase an elegant and sturdy bookcase for a great price!", 
    "This bookcase arrived in pristine packaging, but inside the cross-members were not attached, nails were sticking out all over, pieces did not fit into their respective slots, and the finish is more purple than espresso. Further, the shipping manifest was on an ink jet printer without ink, so you can't read it to try to return. Don't waste your money. Shame on you overstock.com.", 
    "Bought this for my son's bedroom. Very nice shelving unit, sturdy, looks very nice with his d\u00e9cor. Took about 15 mins. to put together. Very well packaged. Will probably buy another one to put beside this one.", 
    "Bought for my twins college dorms; perfect size, sturdy, easy to assemble. Over six feet tall. Highly recommend!", 
    "My husband had no trouble putting these together; however, they were not as sturdy as a had hoped. They are great for display purposes but I would jot use them for heavy book storage.", 
    "Holds all my catalogs and samples. Very sturdy, yet very attractive!", 
    "Looks great, but substandard wood...all warped and the pegs to cover the screws are popping out and the color is coming off. My husband is bellowing from the next room. STOP USING CRAP PRODUCTS PLEASE! Made in USA is better than wherever you got this stuff!", 
    "Really good quality for the money. I would recommend.", 
    "Easy to put together. Looks nice.", 
    "This bookcase was great for the price. I've had it for a few months holding linens and it has held up great and looks nice.", 
    "This shelf is sturdy and handsome in our second bedroom/office. It's shorter than I expected, but holds a great deal. Perfect for nooks and goes very well with our espresso day bed. Would highly recommend. One downside is none of the pieces are marked, I wouldn't suggest this for a beginner.", 
    "I bought two of these to place on either side of my couch in the game room. The espresso finish and quality met my expectations. It's a nice accent to my room.", 
    "Love this. Looks great. Modern version of a classic.", 
    "some warp-age and some of cross bars on side nail came through the wood and some finish buttons to cover screws missing", 
    "really easy to put together, not vey heavy wood could be a little more stable but I love the look and I do like it a lot!", 
    "an ez to assemble bookcase. solid & well manufactured.", 
    "Very average bookcases. They look nice. Easy to assemble. Quality is average. I wouldn't move them around too much. Or, put too many books. Fair price.", 
    "I would have given this a full 5 stars had it been at least a foot taller. Of course, the measurements online don't mean squat until you get the thing in the mail, so I think it would have been perfect a little bigger. Overall quality is very nice, though. It's pretty and just what I was looking for stylewise. Just... need taller! I have a lot of books!", 
    "Well constructed, easy to put together. I bought this to match one similar in design to use in my den. The open sides and back don't close the room in the X's on the side are a nice touch. Good price, fast delivery.", 
    "Sturdy. Assembled quickly. Great product!!", 
    "Easy to put together and nice to look at. Very sturdy.", 
    "Smaller than it looks on line", 
    "This bookshelf is very inexpensive for the overall impression it will make in our Master bedroom. It was a little awkward to put to assemble, but once we figured out how best to fit it all together, it went very smooth. Great accent piece for my new bedroom!", 
    "I bought 2 of these bookcases and they went together pretty easily. They are sturdy and are very nice looking. I mixed them with some other bookcases I already had and they look very nice together.", 
    "This piece is really pretty.It is stronger that it looks but shelves are narrow.It is a perfect for placing your fine things for display.I bought 2,it was easy to put together.", 
    "Nice case. Better if two people assemble. Sturdy and a good addition for those extra books.", 
    "RElatively easy to put together. Looks nice and just the right size for me", 
    "Nice! Perfect for my spot!", 
    "Easy to put together, decent item.", 
    "Just what we where looking for", 
    "They are just what I wanted!", 
    "I bought 2 of these in espresso. Overall, these shelves look nice at a distance. However, once you take a good close look, you can see how the pieces don't quite fit together right. There are small gaps between pieces that should sit flush. They're also a little flimsy for solid wood shelves but then again they weren't very expensive. I was worried that they wouldn't hold our books but they seem to be holding up so far. I probably would have sent them back if it wouldn't have been such a pain to disassemble and ship.", 
    "This shelf looks very good but is not built the best. Colors are as shown.", 
    "Just the right size for my office/craft room. Shipping was really quick and the price was quite good.", 
    "Beautiful 5 shelf stand. Sturdy, easy to assemble.", 
    "very easy to assemble look much more expensive", 
    "I ordered three Bookcases for use in the Women's Center, a non-profit center. They arrived in fine condition and have been assembled and used in our library. They look great and we are very happy with this purchase.", 
    "The Montego bookcase is made from real wood instead of engineered wood, which I appreciate because the surface finish will last a lot longer and can be touched up with wood stain if it gets scratched. These bookcases are very stylish.", 
    "Even though the bookcase arrived with no screws or other parts, they cam eventually and I love the product. Looks great in my office.", 
    "not happy with this item. the second bookcase was broken and the bookcases are unsteady. Their was a bracket enclosed for attaching bookcases to the wall which you will definitely have to do", 
    "This is a pretty low-quality bookcase--probably worth about $$. The holes to screw in the shelves don't really match up. The bookcase is very weak for the books only for decorations.", 
    "Might last a month or two. Very light, very flimsy, cannot recommend.", 
    "Although the bookcase is sturdy and not bad looking, it wasn't what I needed. I should have paid more attention to the shelf dimensions. After assembling it, I realized that it is not the right thing for my paperbacks. I guess I'll have to use it for something else.", 
    "Very nice looking, easy to put together. Very well packed. Arrived quickly.", 
    "Just needed a bookcase for an extra bedroom and with the price and color it was a good choice. Easy to assemble.", 
    "This bookcase is very nice and made of real wood! It was easy to assemble and fits in nicely with our decor.", 
    "Cheap. Sorry I purchased this but will keep it in the basement for storage as long as it lasts.", 
    "These were fairly easy to put together (once I convinced my husband to not do it while they were standing up!). Well made and they hold quite a bit of books and stuff. I had no problems - they were delivered in pristine condition (we ordered 2), no nicks or dents, all holes were drilled. All in all very happy with the purchase and color of these.", 
    "this item is different than pictured. I have two others and this was supposed to be the same one, but it was smaller and not as stable.", 
    "Love this bookcase. Actually, I ended up ordering 2 of them. Sturdy, holds all my cookbooks. Well worth the money.", 
    "Looks nice for kids bedroom or office. Easy to put together and holds lots of books!", 
    "For the price this bookcase is great. It was not difficult to put together and seems sturdy.", 
    "My books and record collection never look better.Easy to assemble.", 
    "This product is not at all like it looks. Not sure about the other reviews being so good because what I received is not very good quality at all. The stain was marked up with fingerprints, missing in spots and is not walnut at all! The color is more of a cherry/mahogonay and very old fashion looking. When I opened the box the inside was full of sandy dust and the smell of stain was overwhelming! The unit is also much smaller than it is depicted in the pictures.", 
    "Great. exactly what I thought it would be", 
    "Took about 30 mins to put together and I love it! Beautiful black and perfect size, nice quality!", 
    "I was pleased to see this product is actually made of real wood! This is something we don't often see these days. The instructions were easy to follow and now that the bookcase is in place and full of books, it is very solid. It does help if you have an additional set of hands while screwing the shelves to the side supports. I highly recommend this bookcase.", 
    "I was so surprised how well it's built & ease to assemble. Just love it fits & matches the rest of furniture in my office.", 
    "Nice unit for the money and when secured to the wall with the provided hardware, a very sturdy and secure unit for our grandkids.", 
    "Love it perfect size not big at all but just right", 
    "It looks better online, but it is a very flimsy bookcase. As many others wrote in their reviews, the sides were cracked when they arrived. I have spent several weeks now trying to get replacement parts shipped. Several calls, chats and emails, still nothing. I am sorely disappointed and would not recommend this purchase.", 
    "Read through all the negative reviews and realized most were user error or not reviews about the product themselves. I assembled the product per instructions and it was fine aside from two things: If the holes were not drilled right, the shelf started to crack - happened to me on one shelf of the two cases that I ordered. I was not able to push in the caps over the screw holes. I am ordering two more to have wall to wall book cases. For the price would by again.", 
    "I read some of the reviews and my box came with all of the parts. The finish on the bookcase could have been better as it is kind of rough to the touch. Otherwise, it assembled together well and looks good. If you look closely you can see it is not of the highest quality but real wood is very expensive and this fits the bill for a bedroom.", 
    "I purchased two of these bookcases and they fit perfectly in their specified location. They look great filled with books.", 
    "I don't like Allen-key screws to begin with. Then when the hex key provided doesn't perfectly fit the holes in the screws, I really hate them. I struggled a lot with the first three screws, even stripping the hole in one trying to keep the key inserted. Finally I rummaged through my tools and found I had a good key of the proper size. The rest of the assembly process went much faster. But why not good old Phillips head? We like the shelves, though. Now that they're together, they look great in our living room.", 
    "The bookcases are sturdy and elegant. I would recommend them to a friend.", 
    "Nice-looking bookcase, Not too difficult to put together either. I wish it was a little taller, but it works for me. I like the clean lines and there is plenty of space on the shelves for most size books.", 
    "If you're looking for an attractive, low profile bookcase, this is a good option. I have a sizable library, so ended up needing six of these to hold all - well, most - of my books. I would have opted for a larger size had I known this beforehand, but that was my fault, not the product. The dark brown color is lovely, yet understated.", 
    "I found the bookcase easy to assemble and all holes were pre-drilled for fast assembly. The wood is very light weight , not heavy but perfect for books. I would have liked more colors to be available. Product was packaged well and wrapped in thin foam and paper. Instructions were easy to follow.", 
    "Really like the style but it is a little lightweight however we have a good amount of book on it and it seems fine for us. Price was right.", 
    "I purchased this in black and it was better priced on O vs. another decorator's site. I purchased this to organize and display my heels. It is easy to put together and took me about 30 minutes give or take a few. It was well packaged and I didn't find any scratches or dings on any of the parts. Everything seemed to line up but I did follow the instructions and not over tighten the screws. Once I got everything together I tightened up everything. I did not secure to the wall as I'm not using it for heavy items. It looks great in the room, it is not over sized and doesn't take up much space. All my shoes did not fit so I will be ordering a second bookcase soon. Overall I'm pleased and based on the fact I found this exact same bookcase for about 25% more on a different site made my day. Great value for a nice looking bookcase.", 
    "For the price, it's a good piece. Easy to put together but be careful not to over tighten the screws...the wood splits easily.", 
    "I wanted open shelves to let the painted walls show thru which kept the wall and room from being too dark. I bought two and have them flanking a TV stand with a 60\" TV. They look wonderful! And so easy to assemble! They were light weight and easy to maneuver after assembly. Wonderful design and a wonderful addition to my home. I may be purchasing another one for another room.", 
    "Good bookcase for the value. Using in my reading room", 
    "Well packed but did have some rub marks from the tight straps for packing. Went together easily and has wall anchors to secure them. The finish is not a smooth veneer type but slightly rough/rustic. I like the looks of them in my office area and put 2 side by side.", 
    "I have purchased similar product from other sources. The finish on the ones I received were shoddy, rough in many spots and scraped off in others. I had been planning a purchasing a few more but after assembling the ones I had received, I decided against that and will wait until I can find something local that I can actually inspect before purchasing. This was my first purchase with Overstock.com and my impression at this time is it's not overstock you are selling but product that has been rejected by the original purchaser of your 'overstock' supply.", 
    "Even though I'm a master assembler now that I've been buying from O for years, this one was a bit difficult to assemble alone, but I really enjoy the finished product. I bought the 3-tier bookshelf to go with it. Great little library now in the spare room. Recommended.", 
    "The bookshelves look great but the quality is not what I had hoped for. Light weight and cracked easily while putting together as holes were not lined properly.", 
    "Wood split several times when putting together, holes not pre-drilled properly. Very disappointed, over priced for quality, and then the shipping was just adding insult to injury. :(", 
    "This is a really nice bookcase and feels of high quality, but I had to send it back as it was damaged in shipping and I have to hope the second one doesn't have the same damage. The box has the two side panels running the length it with the shelves stacked at the left and right of the box. Any torqueing of the middle puts all the weight of the package on the middle of the two thin side panels. And guess what, they crack. Also, the packaging uses Styrofoam sheets that fall apart. It took a long time to remove all the little particles from the wood and vacuum them up off the carpet.", 
    "Easily assembled and very nice!! A great value! Love this bookcase!", 
    "Considering the price, this shelf offers you a beautiful piece for decorating a room. The quality is fair to poor, however. 1. The product is not very sturdy. The sides are made of soft wood. If you over tighten the shelves during assembly, the screws will over penetrate and start spinning freely. 2. The product will be damaged slightly in shipping. I bought two shelves and both had shipping-related damage. This amounted to cracks in the frame or shelves, which did not compromise the integrity of the structure but created a cosmetic flaw that needed to be covered up with stain. 3. The dowel holes do not align with the frame, making assembly a tricky.", 
    "I puchase this bookcase to place in a nursery. I needed something to hold small books, pictures and such. It works very well for that purpose. The esspresso stain color of the bookcase matched very well with the dresser and cribs already in the room. I inpart picked this bookcase because it has nice visual interest from a side-view, which is good for where I have it positioned in the room. The bookcase looks nice, is sturdy but not too heavy, and anchors to the wall snuggly with 2 small screws. All good attributes for a nursery bookcase. All the pieces where included and well packaged. No scuffs or scrapes on the wood. If you can turn and allen wrench and read on at least a 3rd grade level then you should have no problems putting this together in under an hour. It will help to have decent size, preferrably carpeted, area to work on when putting the case together. The case goes together lying on it's back before you can raise it. In all I'm happy with the purchase. It works very well for what I needed.", 
    "Recently moved and needed new bookshelving. We happened to get a giftcard as a housewarming, and happened upon these gorgeous bookshelves. We needed something that was not going to overwhelm a smaller space, and while these are sturdy bookshelves, you can see the wall decor through them that lends to the overall spaciousness of your place. I bought two..and eventually will have to buy several more. I would really reccommend highly.", 
    "These are nice bookcases for this price range. The finish is a nice color, and the construction, once assembled is fairly solid. I would say the color is slightly lighter than it appears in the photo, which is fine with me because I actually wanted a dark brown rather than black. I ordered three similar cases last year, and they are perfect for books for my son's room and lighter books my husband and I have. These come with brackets for fastening to the wall, which I recommend if using in a child's room or around smaller children, since they are pretty light and could easily tip over if pulled. All in all, these are attractive, functional, and an excellent value. Delivery time was STUNNING. I ordered them Sunday evening, got them Tuesday morning. I couldn't believe it.", 
    "Nice bookshelf. It is sturdy and well made. Only drawback was that the instructions showed that their should've been nail/screw holes in the top piece--and there were not. We had to measure and drill the holes in ourselves.", 
    "We purchased these shelves for my husband's game room. They are attractive and easy to put together and the pricetag didn't break the bank. We purchased 3 tall shelves and 1 short. The predrilled holes on one of the units were too small so my husband tried more force to make the fit and ended up cracking the wood in a few places. Nothing a little wood glue couldn't fix but this was a problem I felt it necessary to report. If you find this to be the case with your bookcase, don't force it just get a drill out and widen the holes.", 
    "Now that it's assembled, we're happy with the bookcase...a little difficulty inserting the dowels for the back pieces into the sides because the holes did not match up and some of the dowels seemed a little big for the holes.", 
    "goes together solid, nice look, nice finish, real wood.", 
    "This is a pretty little shelf unit. Really like the criss-cross sides. Very easy to assemble - and that is important to me. A few imperfections, but overall I am very pleased and am thinking about getting another one.", 
    "Looked just like the picture. Needed it for my daughters room. perfect size to fit her needs and make the almost teen room look classy.", 
    "What can you say about shelves, they hold the things I needed them to hold", 
    "These bookcases are very pretty and look expensive. I know that some have said the cases did not seem stable enough to hold books but I did not find this to be true. They seem quite solid and are handsome and of good quality. We had no problems putting them together.", 
    "Great shelf, great price. Received damaged but O was quick to look for parts and when parts were not available offer to take the item back or take a percentage off the price. Quick and easy refund.", 
    "The shelves were exactly what I was looking for. The quality was good and it is perfect for what I needed it for.", 
    "Sturdy bookshelves that met the description as per Overstock's website. Overstock should just be slightly more careful when packing items - they should check and re-check for any dings, chips and/or dents in the wood prior to shipping. Was very pleased with the prompt arrival of the items ordered.", 
    "This bookcase is fine for the money,,,however it is a little wobbly if you do not secure it against the wall. I chose not to secure it, but if I had small children I would recommend it. Looks very nice in my bedroom.", 
    "This open style book case was better than expected. It is real wood & easy to assemble! All holes are pre-tapped for easy assembly and the hardware is very heavy duty!! It cam with wall mounting hardware which secures this directly to the wall, preventing a small child from pulling it over if using it to pull themselves up with. I am very happy as the finish I expected to receive was perfect and matched my other wood furniture perfectly!! This went together quickly & was very sturdy when finished. Great product once again O.co!! Thank you!!", 
    "I purchased this for extra storage in a bathroom. I wasn't looking for a high quality piece of furniture--I just needed something to store towel on. I liked the design of the bookcase and thought if the finish looked really cheap when it arrived that I would paint/distress it. I was really impressed when we opened up the box! Real wood, nice finish (I ordered the espresso which turned out to be more a very dark mahogany or cherry to me, which was fine). My husband put it together in about 20 minutes. No glitches. We were both impressed with the quality--although I originally bought it for a bathroom, I wouldn't hesitate to put it in any area of the house. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "This bookshelf is a good looking piece but it is extremely short and does not fill up a room properly, especially if you have high ceilings, like I do. It gets swallowed up in my sitting room just because it isn't even taller than a normal height person. Disappointed in that important detail."
