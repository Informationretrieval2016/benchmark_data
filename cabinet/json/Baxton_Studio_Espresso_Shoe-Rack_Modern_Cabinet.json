    "Good for shoe storage but I also use it to store other items. Heavier than I though it would be, sturdy cabinet", 
    "This cabinet is beautiful and very sturdy. Even I could put it together. \ud83d\ude00Highly recommend", 
    "We bought two of these units to store or shoes in the garage. Or main driver to purchase wad that it had sliding doors so that shoes could be accessed even when the cars are payment inside, but be protected from dust.The units are particle board with wood - like veneer - you get what you pay for. For the cost, they look decent, assembled easily, clear picture instructions, all parts were present and decent quality.", 
    "We purchased this cabinet to clean up the shoes in our entryway, as we take off shoes at the door, Japan-style. The rack was easy to assemble and meets our needs. Importantly, it accommodates my size 11 men's shoes and the doors still close. It is certainly bigger than our previous solutions, but you're only going to get about 4 pair of men's shoes on a shelf, and that is with some angling. But, how many pair do I need to keep at the entrance, really. For us, there's a shelf for everyone and one for guests.", 
    "I got it for my fish tank. Easy to assemble and very sturdy!", 
    "I LOVE THE SHOE RACK AND IT'S EASY TO ASSEMBLE AND LOVE THE QUALITY!!"
