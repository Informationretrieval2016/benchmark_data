    "This is not a cozy sofa to begin with, but I was hoping it would at least provide with an extra sleeping space. It was the first time we needed to use this as a bed. the join in the middle not only looked uncomfortable, it was uncomfortable even after padding up with an old comforter.", 
    "I bought the cream colored futon and it looks beautiful. Very sturdysince it has wood legs and it's soft material and looks expensive.Sol happy with this purchase, very comfortable.", 
    "Great quality and style. Works perfect in the guest room/office. Highly recommend.", 
    "Nice for a futon. Legs are a little flimsy. Guests comment on how on how much they like it often.", 
    "Great sofa for the price. We ordered this sofa for a guest room and were pleasantly surprised at how nice it was eventho it's not real leather. It seems pretty sturdy and not hard to assemble. Our guests loved it too. I like the pull down cup holder very much, think it will be great for watching tv while sitting there and enjoying a drink or two. It shipped out fast and we received it almost 2 weeks to the day that we ordered it, just in time for our guests.", 
    "We ordered this futon in white and not only does it look fabulous in our office, but it is surprisingly comfortable. The shipping was fast and it didn't take long for my husband to assemble. We're extremely happy with this purchase!", 
    "This is nice futon that perfectly meets my needs and is a perfect fit for the room i have available for it.As a bed it serves its purpose, but in my case it won't be used as a bed very often.", 
    "First off the freight company that was used held the sofa bed for a week. This is not Overstocks fault by any means they even heped me track down the freight company and was very professional. I tracked it and called them and that is the only reason why I received it. It took over three weeks to receive this item. It is very nice and looks exactly like the picture. The reason I gave this a 4 star in stead of the 5 is simply because.. it is actually cream/ vanilla color and on the description it says white. It is much darker then my white leather office chair that I ordered from overstock.com. Other then that it is very long and hold decorative pillow well.. very easy to pull into a sofa bed. I am happy with my purchase for the most part :)", 
    "I purchased this item in white. Love the cup holder section. My son slept on it and said it was very comfortable.. Fits nicely in my spare room.", 
    "good color, sturdy and comfortable to sit on. It's a little short for sleeping, but certainly doable.", 
    "Excellent addition to children's game room. Easy to clean and very functional. The kids love it!", 
    "Delivery time was long but delivery truck and personal were professional. White glove delivery was a delightful surprise, thank-you. Sofa fits nicely in space and ever so comfy.Grey color just as I expected and tailoring of leather nicely done.", 
    "Nice product. Stylish, functional, and comfortable", 
    "Bought the white. Picture does not give it justice.", 
    "Son loves the cup holders on the futon, grandma says it sleeps great. A multi-generational winner!", 
    "Its not a high quality fabric, but saying that, its not at all poorly crafted for the materials used (vinyl). I'm not disappointed by any means- it is great for a spare room and gives you an extra bed in a pinch! The middle section that folds down with drink holders is really wonderful. That and the futon made this couch a logical purchase without having to spend a fortune!", 
    "It feels like an actual couch! Very comfortable, very study. It's also pretty light if you ever have to transport it from one location to another. I' totally satisfied!", 
    "This took a long time to have delivered. It came damaged - as in dirty on the corners. I was able to clean it off with a sponge. The adjustment from futon bed to couch is smooth but it makes a crunchy sound from the ball bearings. The bed is VERY hard, so if you want your temporary guest to leave in a few days they are sure to be uncomfortable.", 
    "Got this for our front room library. Very nice looking. Legs go on very easily. Delivered in a tall slender box. Just like the picture."
