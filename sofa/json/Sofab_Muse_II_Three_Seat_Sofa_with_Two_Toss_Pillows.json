    "I have had my \"smoke colored Muse Sofa\" for at least 2.5 yrs and it still looks great! The fabric is nice and soft and the cushions are firm. My son put it together quickly. Sofab customer service was great and I'm happy with my purchase! I didn't pay this price, I don't have $*** to spend on a sofa. I guess it was a previous model I purchased?Thank you to Sofab and Overstock :)Anne", 
    "I bought a year ago (and paid 1/2 the price). I was worried it might be junk but it is a great sofa, very comfortable - so much so I went back and bought the matching chair and ottoman.", 
    "Easy to assemble and very comfy. The fabric feels great to the touch. We fallen asleep a few times on it watching TV already.", 
    "very cheaply made, do not buy this stuff.", 
    "Not at all what I thought I was purchasing. Required total assembly and did not seem very good quality. Returned! Customer service was very helpful with the process and our disappointment.", 
    "I bought this as a gift for my daughter for her new apartment. She was able to set it up herself and Loves it!!! It looks so pretty in her apartment and it's so comfortable!!", 
    "I liked the style and comfort of the sofas (2) but both sofas had the Velcro sewn on backwards on one end and I had to use a staple gun to hold it in place.", 
    "I purchased the couch and love seat together. They are very soft and comfortable. The cushions are slightly different in color. I have moved them around but I can see a difference. They also are not firm at all. When you sit on the cushions they flatten to almost nothing. They're comfortable but I have to rearrange them everytime someone gets up because they flatten and shift so the couch looks frumpy."
