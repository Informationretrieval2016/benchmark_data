    "This product is a reasonably priced imitation of the Eames Molded Plastic Dowel Leg Side Chair. This is not an exact replica, but it's pretty good; especially at less than 25% of the cost of the originals. Most noticeable differences can be seen in the hardware in the base of the chair, as well as the type of wood used for the legs. The chairs are comfortable, and the plastic provides nice \"give\" when you lean back. Overall quality is good (though not up to the standards of the Eames chair). However, one of the six chairs I purchased came with a defective screw (four of which are used to attach the base to the seat). I contacted overstock.com's customer support, and requested a replacement. I'll post an update once the situation is resolved.", 
    "Love the look of these chairs but, as previous reviewers said, they do break. We bought 6 and 4 are already crooked and bent. The metal supports under the seat have actually bent so the seat pitches forward. On the two that aren't (yet) broken, they creak so much, we expect them to break any day. These are excellent looking replicas of Eames chairs but the quality is very poor.", 
    "If you're a fan of this iconic Eames chair, but not a fan of its $*00 price tag, these chairs work. Honestly you really can't beat the price. The build quality is about that of an IKEA chair, and is currently serving as a a suitable set of kitchen chairs in my smaller kitchen. They're good, not great. The white plastic seat had a few small blackened scuffs when I opened the packaging. A Mr. Clean Magic Erasure took care of them, but also made me realize how easily the seats could be damaged if you have pants with metal buttons or grommets on the pockets. The assembled chair is also not the most solid under you and has quite a bit of flex. Not recommended for people who are rough on their things, or like to rock back in their chair.", 
    "While the chairs look nice the quality of the chairs is terrible, within one week of using them the screws under the chair became loose and wobbly. We'd have to tighten them at least once a week-at this point we can't even tighten them fully and they are uneven and super uncomfortable to sit on not to mention how noisy they are when you sit on them.", 
    "I work for a private school in the midwest. They gave us a huge furniture budget this year so I invested in a classroom full of these chairs. I really see a difference in how the children behavior and do their work. They are more comfortable and stay on task. I recommended these chairs for their desks at home as well!", 
    "This is a great replica of a popular mid-century design. Unfortunately, due to shoddy constructions with bolts regularly becoming loose under the seat, this chair isn't even worth 1/2 the current price. We purchased 2 & the plastic seat cracked on one a few months after purchasing & we just threw the other one out. If you're going to plan on very rarely using this chair, it might be ok as a design element, but this didn't even hold up to an average sized person using it in their home office.", 
    "super easy to put together, stylish mid-cen chairs. comfortable, affordable and prooves there's no need to be the \"expensive version.\"", 
    "These are great and you really can't beat the price. I have a couple of authentic vintage eames fiberglass shell chair and looking at them side by side I can't tell the difference in shape. I think the mount holes are even the same or close enough to adapt to be interchangeable. Even Herman Miller uses molded plastic these days (instead of fiberglass) now, so I don't see any reason why you would buy one of theirs for $350. Compared to fiberglass, There is a little bit more flex in the back when you lean back, but it's actually kind of nice and doesn't feel flimsy. The only problem is lack of color options. White and black match everything I guess.", 
    "use these for tutoring studio. love them because they are easy to clean- just wipe them off when they get messy", 
    "I am so happy with these chairs. The quality is great, and the price was a steal! I totally got the \"Eames\" look I wanted, without paying a fortune. Also, I love the quick shipping that Overstock consistently has.", 
    "I encouraged my boyfriend to buy these chairs for his dining room. I'm sorry that I did. The chairs were fine at first, but they started to get really creaky after about a month or so. We have tightened the screws multiple times and they start creaking almost right away. They look good, but they are poor quality.", 
    "I'm disappointed in the sturdiness of these chairs; the molded plastic is very flimsy.", 
    "Very happy with the purchase of the chairs fits well in a smaller area.", 
    "these are great copies. If you need a good chair with some style, these work well. We love that they push all the way under the table. They clean easily and feel very sturdy.", 
    "Like this kind a chair for my home office. Got a few of these. Like the look of the legs.", 
    "Overall we are happy with the chairs. The are clearly a reproduction and a slightly cheap feel, but acceptable for office use. My biggest complaint is that is did not come with hardware to assemble them (ie; no screws or washers) so I had to spend additional time trying to find a metric screw and washer just to put them together.", 
    "I've been coveting the original Eames chairs from Design Within Reach for a while, and could not justify spending that kind of crazy money for them (I think they're about $600 apiece). These are really good knock-offs, and they blend wonderfully with our 1970's table and 1920s dining room. The white plastic shells are less shiny than the photo shows, and the seat height is a little lower than 17\", but neither is a problem. They're comfortable to boot! Arrived two days after we ordered them.", 
    "The (visible) bolts on the base of this chair are silver and look cheap. Other replica manufacturers have black bolts, which look a lot nicer.", 
    "Bought these chairs as a new lake house warming gift. Our friends have a unique modern style of design and these will look fabulous in their new place! These chairs were a great price...I've seen them on other sites for a lot more $. Can't wait to give them this gift!", 
    "These are very small chairs, no doubt, careful before ordering, they won't work with a taller table, very well suited for kids i would say. That said they look the part, and are worth the money, as they are quite low priced.", 
    "I bought 2 sets of these to use as dining chairs. They are great. Comfortable, well made, easy to assemble and look great. They are more sturdy than I expected. Excellent price for a well made Eames reproduction.", 
    "These chairs are a great price and are great replicas of the egg shell eames chairs. However, they are relatively small and the legs are a composite wood reminiscent of ikea furniture. Assembly was relatively easy. I'm pleased with them for what I paid for.", 
    "The chairs themselves aren't bad and are decent Eames knockoffs. My gripe is that they were poorly packed and one of the shells was significantly gouged and scratched. One of the nuts was also missing. Sending chairs back is a royal pain in the butt so I decided to just keep them. If they were authentic, then I would surely have had them replaced.", 
    "Quick shipping arrived just in time", 
    "Quality of material not the best.", 
    "i used these chairs in my sons room right next to a bookshelf , they look very nice in the little reading corner , happy with the look", 
    "I bought these for my new dining table and although the height is not high enough for the table, I think the quality is overall pretty good.", 
    "You get what you pay for, classic design. Plastic seats.", 
    "fell apart within 2 weeks", 
    "Nice chairs to complement a fair price/ nice looking decoration.", 
    "Like 'em; I bought four chairs and they look great.", 
    "These chairs are amazing at this price. After 18 months of hard wear, they have mostly stood up. I bought 10 and sometimes we have to tighten the hardware to the legs. One or two have a slight bend to them from someone heavy sitting in them, but at this price I'm not complaining too much. The seats are well made and very comfortable. Very attractive to look at!", 
    "Good price compared to designer brand. Durable and easy to clean especially with kids. Only downside is tighten up the screws every 5-7 times someone sits on the chair.", 
    "We liked dem. Yeahhhhnnhhjjjjj", 
    "Exactly as I thought they would be.", 
    "Obviously love the design of these chairs and these are a good alternative to the real ones. But not a good quality.", 
    "These chairs look so cool. I just expected them to be a little bigger than they are.", 
    "these look great and do the job for everyday kitchen chairs, HOWEVER beware that you will constantly be tightening these at least once a week otherwise the chair will feel wobbly and and unsecure!", 
    "Really disappointed. Was very excited but having it for 3 days will be returning it. Screws get loose every day and it's not possible to eat commode tablet on it or use as dining chair", 
    "Aesthetically pleasing, legs not very sturdy or durable.", 
    "love these chairs. Very stylish and goes well with my Austin home", 
    "I got them when they were on sale, so I'm not sure I'd have bought them at the current price. The price and looks got me interested to buy them as my temporary dinning room chairs while I look for something more permanent.", 
    "I've owned the chairs for two years now, and they are cute but they squeak. They actual resemble the noise of passing gas - so if you cannot laugh about it, don't buy the chairs.", 
    "Cute...easy to assemble multi purpose chairs.", 
    "chairs are sturdy and look amazing", 
    "These chairs are not white; they're ivory or light beige. They are trendy and they're comfortable! They were easy to assemble and they look great! I love them.", 
    "These chairs are awesome! They are very sturdy good quality chairs and the were heavier than we thought they would be!! LOVE them!!!", 
    "Stylish and good quality. However, the bolts come loose and have to be tightened often. Otherwise, I would give five stars.", 
    "super value and they are comfy too. nice knock off!", 
    "I had 2 existing knoll chairs exactly like these and they're a perfect match. Kinda makes me wish I had saved the money and just gone to O.com in the first place", 
    "i bought these with a little hesitancy after reading the reviews... i figured they'd be okay but not great and expected some issues right out of the box. but we needed chairs, liked these, and the price was right. my husband opened the boxes when they were delivered and i came home after he'd assembled three of the four chairs we'd ordered. i expected him to be irritated and disappointed... but he was pleasantly surprised. and, coming home to that, so was i.they assembled perfectly, he remarked that the hardware was high quality and there were absolutely no issues with any of the four chairs. they're clearly not originals and indeed, you get what you pay for \u2013 but these are great. they look good, they're comfortable and, with two young children at home, they're not so precious that we don't want to actually use them. glad we bought them!", 
    "Super stylish. Light and sturdy. Have bought two sets now.", 
    "i love the look of these but sitting in them is a little bit uncomfy. perfect for extra seating but not everyday use.", 
    "They were a really nice addition to our conant ball maple mid century table. At $*a chair, its hard to beat the style they offer. The upper plastic portion of the chair is good, the wooden portion of the legs are a little cheap. For the price though, they are absolutely worth buying.", 
    "Excellent quality, fast delivery!", 
    "These chairs were a perfect addition to the Beatrice Dining Table (http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Simple-Living-Beatrice-Dining-Table/9435601/product.html). Very simple to assemble and an elegant design.", 
    "The chairs were nice but I didn't feel they would stand the test of time. Decent replica.", 
    "The screws come loose very quickly, I feel like I have to tighten them every time I sit down and have already lost a couple.", 
    "Look nice, but the screws come loose constantly. Just recently (about 2 years old) the metal fixture that the screws screw into, snapped on one of the leg bases. I still use them despite the flaw, but they are a pain!", 
    "Pretty functional and comfortable, even in the University Condo, where they get lots of action!", 
    "good price but not as sturdy as i'd like.", 
    "Reproduction piece just like the original! great quality & durability - I have had them for about 2 years and love these still.", 
    "Comfortable but they do take awhile to assemble.", 
    "These chairs are stylish and comfortable. Unlike the ones you may have had in the 60's, the seats are made of plastic rather than fiberglass, so there is some \"give\" to them. This may or may not shorten their lifespan; the legs and hardware are plenty sturdy. I've had them for 3 months and they're as good as new.", 
    "Comfortable and easy to clean. Legs need frequent tightening.", 
    "Although the screws come loose from time to time, these are very nice copies of the original. We have had for 3 years and they have held up great at our kitchen table.", 
    "Screws become loose with use of chair, mines have fallen called completely off and the chair is in place with the one screw that is left. The chairs can no longer be used to sit in.", 
    "I get compliments on these chairs all the time. At my long oak trestle table overlooking horizontal striped curtains and the deck's navy and orange color theme, they even seem to take on a nautical flair.", 
    "The chairs are modern, elegant, sturdy, and easy to clean. It was absolutely the right choice.", 
    "We just went to an open house where they had the \"real\" version of these chairs and for the price you just can't beat the savings. They are a little lighter, but just perfect for us and give our kitchen a great modern feel.", 
    "They serve their purpose as chairs. Not the most reliable as the screws come loose easily (you have to tighten them up every so often) so I wouldn't recommend putting too much weight or standing on them. The legs are very obviously plastic when looking up close. Not bad for a budget knock off of the original.", 
    "I bought these chairs a while ago. Visually, they look like the Eames chairs, and are great to look at. However, the quality is extremely poor. screws just fall out, the part where the base is attached to the chair literally bends. Anyone who's on the heavier side probably shouldn't sit in these chairs.", 
    "I searched around for a while because there are a lot of different makers of these types of chairs and this was the best priced option I found and I was very happy that they were also high quality, easy to put together and exactly as they appear in the pictures. They are more comfortable than you would think for a plastic, simple chair", 
    "A little wobbly, but really nice and look more expensive than they are", 
    "I have had these for years and they have stood the test of time. They hold up very well. A little locktite on the screws might be good. After sitting on them, they start to come loose and need to be tightened.", 
    "I have similar chairs to these from Overstock in my dining room for a few years and love them. I ordered these for my breakfast room and so far, so good. They look fantastic and are comfortable. In my experience with these type of chairs, you do have to occasionally tighten the screws with the legs to prevent the legs from breaking. This is a great buy in my opinion.", 
    "For the price, they are great. I bought these for our country house paired with a restoration hardware rustic table. It looks great. Of course, the quality isn't great (you can see the screws in the legs) but it looks nice enough! I have young kids so I wanted something easy to wipe yet modern and sturdy enough. I like the gray better than the white chairs but it looks like they are out of stock in the gray.", 
    "These capture the look of the Herman Miller chairs, but when you sit, you definitely don't feel they are sturdy or well made. The plastic creaks and doesn't feel substantial. Maybe good for a kids room but not for a sophisticated living space.", 
    "Fast shipping. Will be ordering more in the future", 
    "The chairs are great. I would've liked to have instructions inside the box but we figured it out and have had no issues. Love the legs!", 
    "paired these with wood benches and they look great in the dining room", 
    "Love these chairs. Just as expected.", 
    "Great versions of the real thing! Easy to put together and look great!", 
    "These are beautiful, sturdy chairs, that are exactly as the pictures/description portrays them. Considering getting two more!", 
    "Nice Chairs, Packaging could be a improved a bit.", 
    "Legs seem kind of fragile but really nice chairs and good quality overall...We'll see with time...", 
    "These chairs were very easy to put together, and they look great with the Sacramento Mid-Century Solid Wood Dining Table.", 
    "Look nice. Screws are constantly coming loose and makes chairs creak and wobble. Look pretty but not sure they will last. This is why I gave 3 instead of 5. I have husband and kids so lots of use but I am sure the chairs would have Held up fine When I was single", 
    "in the pictures they look great, but the plastic seat is very cheap looking - felt like museum cafeteria chairs, sorry to say, not good enough for my dining table", 
    "Easy to assemble, good quality, easy to clean and beautiful. We bought 8!", 
    "Look good and to the job. Didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on chairs. I'm very happy with the price and quality of these.", 
    "Great repro at an incredible price. Solid craftsmanship", 
    "Good quality for the price and easy to assemble. Will order more", 
    "We're happy with these chairs. They look great, are fairly comfortable. We needed to tighten the bolts after a year of use, but that was easy with an Allen wrench", 
    "Aesthetically, they nail the mid century modern look I'm going for, are comfortable, and seem like they will hold up well to moderate use. Easy to assemble and a great deal overall in my opinion, if you're not willing or able to splurge on the originals!Service-wise: I purchased two sets of these chairs and one of the four came with scuff marks on it. Customer service promptly sent me a replacement. When the new one also came with scuff marks, they did it again and constantly checked in with me along the way. Yes, I had to wait a little longer till I had the fourth chair, but honestly the excellent customer service and attention to my satisfaction made it worthwhile.", 
    "Great look, comfortable, easy to assemble", 
    "I love these chairs! They're a cheaper version of the very expensive name brand style, but they look just as great! We bought 6 of these for our dining room table, one of them came scratched, but overstock sent me a new seat without hassle. I didn't even have to go through the work of returning the previous one. :)One downside, is that the bolts do get loose over time, but it doesn't take a lot to just tighten them up ever once and a while. Definitely worth the price for these high end replicas.", 
    "This style of chair is wildly popular at the moment and is available in several retail stores for about the same price (sometimes a bit higher) than advertised on Overstock. But don't be fooled! The quality of these chairs is much better than those I've seen and tested out in retails stores. The chairs from Overstock were delivered quickly, well packaged, and very easy to assemble. The chairs feel sturdy, wipe clean nicely, and look beautiful in my dining room. Definitely a great purchase!", 
    "These look cute, but are poorly constructed. The seat becomes loose from the base often due to the angle that the screw holes are drilled. We have had these for two years and have found that many of our guests are afraid to sit in them. We even had a guest fall out of one after the seat detached after he leaned back in the chair. Even with constant screw tightening, these chairs just can't seem to hold together. We will be replacing them.", 
    "I love these chairs for a modern dining room or even a small office. Easy to clean and great looking!", 
    "I just Love my chairs, great quality, love to seat on them, easy to assemble.", 
    "These are great, comfortable, and look expensive. I hoped the molded plastic seat would be closer to the resin Eames chair, but it is not as hard of a plastic, so I dropped a star off.", 
    "Couldn't afford the real thing but these chairs measure up. They look great and are pretty solid. I do have to occasionally tighten the nuts underneath but no biggie. They probably won't be comfortable with a very large person but for the average Joe, they'll work just fine.", 
    "Look great but not as sturdy as I'd hoped.", 
    "One of these chairs assembled in a snap, less than 10 minutes -- and the other had to be returned because the factory must have had it's drill slightly off. The hole was not wide enough to accommodate the thread of the bolt. So it was a 50/50 success rate on these guys.", 
    "No instructions for assembly but the hubs figured it out very quickly. Clearly a knock-off chair but they are surprisingly very very comfortable, have 4 in my breakfast nook that we use daily. Recommend purchase.", 
    "These chairs arrived without instructions for how to build them, but it wasn't too hard to figure it out. I love these chairs. They are comfortable and look great in my apartment.", 
    "Normal use causes them to loosen up quickly. Keep your allen tool handy.", 
    "I love my chairs they are fantastic", 
    "We're super happy with these chairs. They're sturdy and the design is great. Love them!", 
    "Beautiful. Love them. They make the office", 
    "These chairs are a great accent, wonderful quality at a great price.", 
    "Pedfect sturdy chairs. Pretty design.", 
    "These Chairs are great for a few reasons:1. Easy to clean.2. I have a cat and he can't ruin it ;)3. Artistic design.4. comfortable to sit in.Only Con:One chair I received had one loose screw.. Doesn't effect the stability and you can only see it if you flip the chair over", 
    "These chairs are awesome! Best deal around, very sturdy and cool look. Great way to mix the new and the old. Good quality!", 
    "Bought 6 of these chair for our new house and we love them! Very comfortable and easy to clean, which is important for us since we have two young kids.", 
    "I am pleasantly surprised how much I love these chairs. They look better than I expected. The white matches my white kitchen-so they aren't the bright bluish white-thank goodness-just a true basic white. The chair part itself feels a little flimsy when you set on it, but I think that is just how it is suppose to feel, being plastic. And, the plastic isn't the hard plastic, it's a little pliable. One of the legs was harder to put on than the others but my husband got his drill out and it worked fine. So, they were pretty easy to assemble. I really like being able to wipe them off - having lots of 12 year old boys (friends of my son) - is a better solution than having the chairs with chair pads I use to have, and secretly getting upset when they stained something.", 
    "Great chairs for the price. Love the clean contemporary look and easy to wipe down after use. Screws need to be retightened occasionally.", 
    "I ordered 4 chairs for my office. Two chairs come in each box. Easy to assemble. One set of chairs had been clearly open and used before because there were missing rubber feet and the seat was badly scratched. I contacted Customer service about it and they wanted to know details about the packaging. I didn't respond fast enough so they close the matter and it's not a huge priority in my life so I let it go. The chairs are nice but it would have been nice if they were 100% new and not damaged.", 
    "not sturdy. returned item", 
    "super modern and super affordable. we love these chairs!", 
    "Absolutely loved these chairs. Set up was very easy, and goes perfectly with my wooden dining table!", 
    "These came with no assembly instructions so I was confused as to how to put them together. There was the chair bottom and the base. However the screw holes were covered with a padding, and it was unclear if that was supposed to stay there or be taken off. (The adhesive was thick and the screws were flat bottomed, not sharp)The chairs were also really low, and my 6 foot 1 husband would have needed help getting out of them. Returned.", 
    "We have had these chairs for a couple months now and the screws seem to become loose again and again every time some one sits in them. The other major complaint with them is that they always groan and squeak when people sit in them, making the person sitting in it feel like the chair can not support their weight.", 
    "I ordered a set of these from OS over two years ago and they're still in great shape. When they get wobbly every six months or so, I just tighten the screws. They add a Manhattan loft vibe to any room they're in. Highly recommended.", 
    "The style is exactly what we were looking for but the chairs are very squeaky. About once a week we need to tighten the Allen screws and when they are loose is when we have the squeaking. The screws will need to be replaced soon as they are starting to strip from how often you need to tighten.", 
    "These chairs are great so far - I didnt have any assembly issues. It should be known though that the legs do seem like they might be a bit fragile for heavy usage, or for those of us that are on the 'larger' side (which is totally okay!). Leaning back on two legs is a definite no-no. I plan on buying another pair.", 
    "Quite happy with the set of chairs, look great and are quality made.", 
    "Nice looking, comfortable, easy to put together.", 
    "We bought a new home and needed to spend carefully on a few key items. These cool chairs fit the bill....and then some! We purchased four chairs and were (and remain) thrilled with their fun and funky 'aesthete' and durability! Two big thumbs up for this 'score!'", 
    "Very nice chairs. Surprisingly comfortable and easy to assemble. Well worth the money.", 
    "I purchased six of these and 2 of the metal base. The way these are made the connection between the base and seat is not sturdy. The metal base are wonderful and strong. I wish we would have gotten all metal.", 
    "The look of these chairs is great, and, they clean very easily which is great for those with little ones. However, we have regretted our purchase from the first week we used them. The seat easily detaches from the legs requiring re-tightening of the hardware at least twice a week! It is very frustrating and time consuming. At times the screws have fallen out altogether despite proper use of the \"locking washer\" which is a big safety hazard for those with babies/toddlers who can easily find the hardware pieces and ingest them! I truly regret the purchase and am Highly disappointed. DO NOT PURCHASE! I am going to take a chair to the hardware store and see if there is other hardware that will not come loose or fall out (more of my time-and money-spent on these chairs!). BTW, my husband and I are 180# and 120#'s respectively so it can not be due to the weight limit.", 
    "The screw came out from one already but perhaps I didn't tighten enough in the first place! Otherwise a good choice for dining chairs...", 
    "Design is great even if after assemblying the chair's legas are not even with the floor surface. But great price for this design!", 
    "This chair is a great buy! It's very stylish and goes great with a rustic table as well as a very modern table. Would buy again.", 
    "I love any and all eames chairs but didn't have it in my budget to buy the actual chairs. I found these two and they look fantastic!", 
    "I read all the reviews and was hesitant about buying these. Basically you'll get what you pay for. The price is great but even for the price, I expected better. I bought a set just to see for myself and 1 was ok and acceptable and the other was horrible. There is just no QC happening at the production level. The one that was ok, wasn't great, but for the price, I would have lived with it. The second chair - the wood on the legs where the screws are was all cracked and chipped. The screwed-in padding on the feet were off-set so it didn't sit flat. The chair itself had a large scuff across it. I returned them. If you are not picky I would recommend them - but buy more than you need so you can select the better of the bunch and return the rest.", 
    "These are staples in our home -- and this set of two is such a good deal! We love the midcentury design and durability of these chairs.", 
    "Plastic is of good quality and the wood looks nice. Very good for the price.", 
    "light weight...artsy looking", 
    "These are nicely designed and comfortable but came with two missing feet so have always been tippy.", 
    "These chairs are not only easy to assemble, they are perfect for my kitchen area. The price is amazing for TWO as well. About to order another set before they are sold out. Again...great quality. Well worth the money.", 
    "These chairs were a great buy at a fraction of the price they typically go for.", 
    "Not recommended. Returned and Overstock was great.", 
    "I bought these chairs for our office conference table. They are great: light weight, trendy, and a good value for a lot of style. They do scratch easily, but for the price, it does not bother me.", 
    "I love the way they look. However, one of the chairs is missing the same metal construction on the white seat, so it is not possible to put a screw inside it. This results in one of the chairs not being as stable and sturdy as the other chair. Also, the bag of parts came with 8 small silver loop parts (separate from the washers) that are not included in the assembly manual, and I am not sure what they are needed for...", 
    "I love this chair for it's modern design. However, it's not that sturdy (ie. not sure how much weight it can actually hold). The white part can get scuff or dirt marks on it very easily...but nothing a little elbow grease can't rub off.", 
    "I don't buy knock off handbags, why did I buy a knockoff chair?? Seat was scratched, hardware kept falling out, if anyone over 90 lbs sat in it the chair it would bend backward, it creaks and squeaks... Save your money and invest in the ***. You'll have it forever and your kids will fight over it when you die.", 
    "Bought these chairs in \"grey\", which looked more like brown on the pictures, and they do look brown. the color is nice though, so they are definitely a keep. Overstock has the best price on these chairs, and they are really comfortable.", 
    "easy to assemble, trendy & comfortable", 
    "The screws fall out of the chair leg constanly. Not made well at all.", 
    "After reading reviews I was a little nervous about purchasing this product. I ordered 4 chairs and have had them for about 2 months. This product has been updated since the negative reviews in my opinion because there were more parts included than in previous models. It seems to address the loose bolt issue. I haven't had any problems with it creaking so that is great. Other than that the product has been wonderful and I will probably order two more with arms.", 
    "Great product, quick shipping, really easy to put together, and sturdier than expected", 
    "I purchased two chairs originally and bought two more a week later. Nice thick plastic. They are sturdy and very easy to put together. My parents own actual Eames chairs and these are very comparable.", 
    "Was really pleased with the quality and looks of these chairs.", 
    "Although these came in the putty color instead of the white that I ordered, I am keeping them. It was sort of a fortunate mistake as I like them better than the white now that I have them in the kitchen. As for comfort, I'm short and can touch the floor with my feet sitting in them. That's a bonus. For dining however, I do need to use a pillow. Perfect for occasional seating.", 
    "Very good value for the price. We use them as desk chairs and they look & function wonderfully. Nice purchase.", 
    "nice chairs however the order did not come with any hardware. considering it was a Christmas gift I had no time for Overstock to send out what was left out of the order. would have given 5 stars if the order was complete.", 
    "I am mildly obsessed with early modern furniture and design. But I don't usually want to pay the high price that many stores claim is within reach (not for a teacher at least). These chairs are beautiful, comfortable, and stylish. Besides the time it took to put them together, they are just what I was looking for. And Overstock customer service is excellent. I am a very happy customer.", 
    "Chairs look nice and are easy to assemble. They are not as sturdy as I would have expected though. They are fairly light weight and can tip easily. Also the plastic chair bends and flexes quite a bit with an adult sitting in them. For the price, I would rate 3 1/2 stars. Good value overall and nice looking but not super durable.", 
    "poor quality, came in all dirty , scratch marks all over the surface of both chairs, had to return", 
    "I love these chairs. The design is nice to have in my art studio, but note* they're not the sturdiest chairs (neither are the original eames.) They make up for that in style and construction. These are a great buy.", 
    "I have these chairs paired with an old farm table and it looks awesome. Now, the quality is nowhere near as good as an original, but it is a replica from China so what do you expect. I think they are incredibly comfortable as does my husband. I have noticed the \"screws\" loosen on my husband's chair - he is a big guy and I think his movement, over time, causes this. I have solved this problem by keeping the allan wrench nearby. Problem solved.The last point I want to make is about the finish. The texture of the seat is sort of \"pebbled\", not smooth. This bummed me out at first, but getting a pair of awesome chairs for $*** helped me survive the disappointment &#128522;", 
    "This chair broke while somebody was sitting on it. She was not a heavy person. She was not leaning back. She was just working at the computer and it just broke. It was a front leg and it snapped where the bolt was located. Fortunately, she was not hurt.", 
    "These chairs are perfect for my dining room table. I wanted the Eames look but on a budget. They are pretty light and were easy to put together. They wipe clean very easily. I would recommend!", 
    "Good value for money. A cinch to assemble. Took forever to get them since the first shipment never arrived. As far as customer service goes, Overstock have a lot to learn from ''''''''. I will leave it at that.", 
    "I love these chairs! Lowest price I have found, sturdy and they look great!", 
    "I wanted Eames Eiffel chairs for a long time, but the price was far outside my budget. After some searching I found these. They look great, are lightweight, easy to clean and (the best part) easy to assemble. It took me longer to breakdown the boxes these were shipped in than it did to put one chair together. I posted pictures on Instagram of the final look in my made-over kitchen and had 2 friends ask where I purchased my chairs. I plan on getting the arm-chair version as well. (I ordered 2 sets of the standard version)", 
    "Well it's not the 'real thing' but it sure can pass as such. It looks great. And it's great value.", 
    "Overall a great buy. Easy to clean and they look good. We notice a clicking sound when you first sit in the seat.", 
    "Great chairs at a great price. Goes well with just about any d\u00e9cor.", 
    "The back of the chairs is a little higher than it looks but it's an affordable alternative to the eames. They are also really comfortable.", 
    "So far, I really love these chairs! They did seem a little flimsy when assembling but everything worked (although we ended up with some unnecessary nuts in each chair package). They look very stylish and feel great, too.", 
    "Best chairs I've purchased in a long time. They look great, they clean up great, and they are sturdy (unlike a different style of chair I originally purchased at *** that broke when our guest went to sit in it!) I'm very glad I bought them!", 
    "These chairs are cute and easy to put together. However, they don't feel very sturdy - do not lean back in them. I ordered two sets - one had to be exchanged because the screw would not go in. The exchange was an easy process. I would recommend these if you want this look at an affordable price and you don't plan on keeping these chairs for 10 years. I am happy with these because they are modern and I know in two years I'll probably want something else, so I did not want to spend a lot of money.", 
    "These chairs arrived and were slightly shorter/smaller than I was expecting but overall I really like them. They went together simply and look exactly like they do in the photos. For the price, I'm very happy with them although I can't speak to their long term quality as we've only had them for about a month.", 
    "I had these chairs sitting in my wishlist for a long time before finally putting them in my cart and buying them. Once they arrived and I assembled them (only took a few minutes per chair), I was wondering what took me so long! These chairs are stylish and comfortable, and for the price, can't be beat.My only complaint is that even though they're a pretty standard height, there's something about them that makes them feel just a tad shorter than your average dining chair.", 
    "Don't bother--the price is too good to be true. Missing hardware doesn't even matter, since the holes for the screws don't line up anyway.", 
    "I have a small area where I have a dark brown dining table and I use these two chairs facing the window seat with gray linen chairs at the end of the table and it's really cute. The chairs are comfortable and sturdy. I just wish the overall chair height was about 2\" taller the seat height is good though.", 
    "These chairs are the perfect addition to any table. They're comfortable, very stylish and are extremely easy to put together. I highly recommend these chairs, they're a great price and they shipped pretty quickly.", 
    "The look of these chairs is modern and clean. Easy to assemble and keep clean with two young kids. Great price for the design and aesthetic. Perfect for our breakfast nook!", 
    "It's quite good looking, but not the best quality. Still I got something nice given that what I paid for. Mine did arrive without any missing hardware or defects. I'm a smallish women, but it took less than 10min to put it together.", 
    "Very easy to put together, very comfortable! I use them as kitchen chairs and my friends are so jealous.", 
    "love these! they look great are comfy and really surpassed my expectations.I read the other reviews and didn't get my hopes up too high .. but I love them.they are not originals ..but they don't cost the same as originals so i like them MORE.I don't worry if they take a bit of abuse because of the value and because they are not originals!I still get the look and feel without the headache/worry! love love love! Highly recommend.j", 
    "The chairs look great and are really comfortable. We've noticed though small cracks in the wooden legs at the top where they are screwed in. After a month they're holding up well.", 
    "These chairs look great in our kitchen. wood legs match butcher block table. durable for kids and sturdy.", 
    "A year later, and I still love these chairs. My only comment is that the screws that adhere the chair legs to the base come loose with time and must be tightened periodically. That's common with any chair I've purchased that requires assembly.", 
    "Assembly was a bit tricky. You must loosen all parts to get the chair legs to line up with the holes in the bottom of the seat. I never would have guessed that you could loosen the top connectors, they just looked bent/busted to me. But my handy husband figured it out without the \"help\" of the useless instruction sheet. These chairs look exactly like the ****ones, only loads cheaper!", 
    "Bought two sets of these eames-inspired chairs for our dining table and they look fantastic. They're not super high quality by any means and took a little work to assemble, but they look great. One of the seats was defective and overstock replaced the whole chair right away. Great customer service.", 
    "Love it. Great for the price you pay. I wasn't expecting it to be highest quality because I didn't pay a high price. It is better than I imagine and I love it. It is sturdy and looks great in my kitchen.", 
    "I read some questionable reviews about this product and was nervous to order, but these chairs are GREAT! We've had them for months now and they have held up perfectly to daily use by our family of four. They clean up easily, are sturdy, and look fantastic. Highly recommend!", 
    "These chairs are a great value and look awesome with my wood table.", 
    "Love these chairs. So comfortable and stylish. They make a statement without needing to be the focus of the room.", 
    "we bought about 30 of these chairs for our conf rooms in my office....in less than 6 months we have 5 broken chairs and counting. absolutely worst chairs ever made. very cheap. the chair itself cracked and the legs continually break. is this is for everyday use then DO NOT BUY IT!!", 
    "The reproduction sure looks like the real one for much less. The caveat is that the assembly was not as painless as I expected because of the poor alignment of the legs with the seat. For the price I paid, I would say it is still a good deal.", 
    "Theses chairs are beautiful and comfortable. Very easy to clean.", 
    "Excellent value, they arrived quickly, easy to assemble, sturdy enough for my 205 lb. husband. If you can't afford Herman Miller, these are a GREAT alternative.", 
    "great bang for your buck. these are not glossy but matte. just FYI.", 
    "Eyed these chairs for a long time. After ordering four of them and waiting for an additional week for the hardware (like others, they shipped without any of the screws) The chairs look great but I can't imagine they will last more than a couple years. I would definitely not recommend these chairs if you or your family are on the heavy side. They look great but feel rather 'chintzy' underneath you. My two cents.", 
    "I've been waitng to get these chairs, but was disappointed. They are somewhat short, which I could have lived with, but did not consider how light they would be. A toddler sat in the chair and when they leaned forward to reach table, the chair tipped over. Might be ok if you don't have small children around. Really wanted them to work.", 
    "I love the imitation style of these chairs for the price. I haven't figured out how to tighten the screws to make the chair even on the floor though. They're wobbly. The chair back has a little bit of give. The chair texture is more matte and not slick/ smooth.", 
    "I love overstock and am very rarely unhappy with a purchase, but nonetheless am always a little nervous about buying furniture unseen. These chairs were exactly the look I was going for and when they arrived, I could not possibly have been any happier! They are a beautiful, sturdy chair and were a piece of cake to assemble. Thanks overstock, you did it again!", 
    "One of the two chairs had a manufacturing defect which prevented me from assembling it. One of the four screw holes on the seat was set to deep into the plastic and was partially filled with plastic. Therefore, I could not insert the screw. After reading the reviews more carefully, I decided to return them for store credit rather than replacement.", 
    "I loved these chairs when they arrived, but the metal brackets bend under the most basic of usage and then the seat pitches forward and makes it incredibly uncomfortable/awkward for sitting. Also they become very noisy.", 
    "Shoddy build quality but then again what do you expect from an XXXXXX knock off? Chairs started falling apart after 6 months of use. My fault for thinking they would last at $XX bucks a pop.", 
    "Love the style of these chairs and they hit my price point. And at this price point unfortunately you'll have to put them together (a breeze) and you'll see little screws fastening holes on the wood legs. The seat has a little give and for a hard seat I think it's actually comfortable. I have young kids and these are awesome for wiping clean! The color is a true white, legs honey tone, picture is true to what I received. There was a small dime size area that the plastic didn't form. Overstock customer service went above and beyond to make it right! Because of that experience I want to give them my business!", 
    "Perfect for the price! Of course, it is not the original but nor is the price. Bought 2 to start with and then another 6. Assembly however is a bit tricky especially in the absence of any instructions. Would buy again and certainly recommend", 
    "Love these chairs, they match perfectly to my dining room table. They are also very comfortable!", 
    "We ordered two of these chairs for our dining room and we like them so much we are ordering 2 more. They look great. Initially I thought that they felt a bit more flimsy than the real deal, but after we bought them I went to Room & Board where they have similar chairs for twice the price and they felt like exactly the same quality. Assembly was relatively easy although there were no directions included.", 
    "I wanted a mid-century look, but don't have the budget for originals... These chairs are great!! Love them. perfect!!", 
    "I would've given a 5 for quality, but the chairs came with some damage to the bases due to the shipping technique and one of the seats was scratched. These chairs are very comfortable and look great. They are easy to put together, although there were no instructions. But, I've assembled enough furniture, it was pretty self explanatory. As for the damage on the bases, it was caused because the bases are stacked during shipping and the screws on the top base, although covered, dug into the bottom base. I was able to camouflage it by rubbing on a little vegetable oil. Not a deal breaker for me. If I decide to return the scratched seat I will re-post about my experience. Overall, I really LOVE these chairs and am willing to live with a few small scratches to get such a good deal on them!", 
    "Bought two sets (four total) of these on sale to match a free table I found. Plastic seats are more comfortable that what I would expect, however if you are sitting for a long time cushions might not be a bad idea. Overall I would say a good value.", 
    "The lack of assembly instructions was annoying, but manageable. The chairs are comfortable and easy to clean (food, crayons), and we got them in white. They accommodate our kids' two different booster seats (BabySmart Cooshee Classic & Prince Lionheart Booster Pod). The chairs tuck nicely under the table, too. Good buy.", 
    "I LOVE THESE CHAIRS! they're affordable enough for a college student and add an extra touch of swanky to my place. I seriously could not be more pleased with this purchase. I always get compliments on them and they're really comfortable and easy to clean. I have these at my birch dining room table i got from ikea. the look is so clean and modern. in love. don't hesitate buying these.", 
    "These chairs are great quality, but I also have to point out how good customer care were. One of the chairs had a scratch on when they arrived unfortunately, but customer care were really great at replacing the damaged chair!", 
    "These chairs are just what we wanted! The modern look, the great price!", 
    "Not good quality, one chair was defective a part was missing. No instructions came with them to put them together. I would not buy them again.", 
    "Awesome price for the quality!! Don't even need to read the manual to install it, will definitely buy another set!", 
    "Chair quality is fine, but you can definitely tell it is a cheaper copy of the original classic. I am happy with it for the price and love the style. I also missed the instructions but just took of felt pads and screwed legs to the base.", 
    "We love these chairs! They match our decor/taste perfectly. They were the chairs we were looking for, and we didn't even know it!", 
    "I really like these chairs, great quality for the price. Super fast shipping as always. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "Love these chairs. I had to send a set of them back because the seat portion was scratched during transit. The seat rests upside down on the legs so the legs scratched the base as the traveled. Be sure to check for that, but otherwise I have thoroughly enjoyed them.", 
    "The overall quality is very reasonable for the price; these chairs are about 25% the cost of an original HM. They are just as comfortable and have the right amount of flex in the back support. On top of e reasonably priced alternative for an original, Overstock provided great customer support with my order. I received a seat pan with some scratches and received a replacement from Overstock within a few days.", 
    "These are not the real deal, so I didn't expect perfection. They've got the look of the originals, without the better quality materials and attention to detail. One of the legs has a large, long gash in it. Not super noticeable day to day, but it was there. One of the chairs looked obviously used as if overstock had gotten one returned, didn't clean it and sent it out again. There was dirt on the white shell (that i was able to clean off) but there were a couple of worn down spots as well. The base feet also looked as if they had been used as they were scratched a dirty. In the end, you don't even notice and for the price you can't beat this deal. Maybe when we have an extra $600 laying around we can get the real deal.", 
    "I bought these chair to replace ones I sent back (same chair, just with arms). After purchasing the first set, they started falling apart right after I put them together. I hesitantly bought these, knowing they were the same manufacturer, and am pleasantly surprised. They are holding up well, look great. Not prefect by any means, but you get what you pay for. I'm happy.", 
    "These are great chairs for the price! Easy to assemble and they look great!", 
    "These are quite nice, but they aren't put together with a lot of care. The plastic of the seat overruns the threads in the seat in many places, making it nearly impossible to screw the legs in. I had to scrape away plastic on all of our chairs to complete construction. They are very nice once put together, but just the manufacturing is sloppy.", 
    "Chairs are very comfortable and have a great modern feel.", 
    "for the price, they are a good buy. but they are kind cheap feeling in the material department. but for what they are, they're fine.", 
    "Read reviews extensively so had realistic expectations. The product is as good or better than I expected. I had read somewhere to keep the small felt pads in place when fixing the seat to the base. A small cut in the center of the pad to allow the screw through is all that is required. Good advice! Chair feels stable and no noise of parts rubbing or moving against each other when sitting on the chair. Very happy with my purchase!", 
    "I am a stager and I was kind of surprised by the color of the legs.... they are a light blonde color, in the picture they look darker. So I am going to be sanding them all down and staining them a darker color, to give it a richer feel. I need the wood to go with what I have going on in the rest of the house.", 
    "happy with chairs. the plastic has a texture to it but it's not bad", 
    "These chairs are great! I've seen similar chairs on other websites, and they are much more expensive. These chairs look fantastic, are easy to keep clean, and are very comfortable. They also are easy to put together. We've had these chairs for nearly a month now, and I have had to tighten the screws a couple of times. That's not a big deal to me, though. I love the look of them, and I would definitely recommend them to anyone considering purchasing them.", 
    "Was really happy to receive these chairs until I noticed the packaging showed all metal legs. I thought maybe it was a graphic glitch, but nope, opened the package and there it was... ALL metal legs. No wood. Currently in contact with Overstock about this. The customer service seems pretty good. However, since the chairs are currently out-of-stock I don't really know how this is going to turn out. So minus 2 stars for shipping me the wrong chair! ::frustrated::", 
    "nice design and good price but its not strong also can heared weird sound every single time when i sit down... also easy to dirty.. dont want to recommend white color...", 
    "These are a great buy if you want designy chairs, but can't afford to shell out for Eames originals. While the plastic may seem a little cheap at first glance, the chairs look great and are VERY comfortable. These chairs are an amazing deal. I'm so happy I bought them.", 
    "These chairs are super cute in my office. comfortable and stylish.", 
    "We bought 4 of these chair and 2 of the same chairs with arms. They were delivered in 3 boxes. One chair in each box was damaged on delivery as the packaging isn't suitable for shipment, so we got a refund. There are other reviews similar to this one. My advice: they aren't worth it.", 
    "Absolutely love them!! Would definitely buy again!", 
    "These chairs are a great deal for the price! They give you the mid century feel with the 20th century affordability.", 
    "Love these chairs. No complaints. Arrived in great condition, easy to assemble. They look great and are very comfortable.", 
    "Chairs look very good and modern. Quite comfortable too.", 
    "I just purchased a beautiful table from a second hand shop and found these amazing chairs on Overstock. I knew they will match perfectly so I ordered the chairs. The look is even better than expected, it is so unique and fresh. I ordered these chairs solely for display and I am glad I made such a great deal.", 
    "These chairs are some uniquely fresh pieces. I have never had plastic chairs in my life but these ones looked so amazing I had to order. They are surprisingly really comfortable and cozy and the look is beautiful. Uniquely constructed with the unusual material combination, they really worth the money I gave. Love you guys.", 
    "These chairs have a really funky and retro look just as expected. They look amazing in my living room, being the perfect decor additions and seating options whenever my friend comes over and we enjoy chat time. The quality is impeccable just as the professional service I received. Thank you.", 
    "I just got these a week ago, and they quickly became my favorite chairs in the house. We liked our first set so much that we bought two more the very next day. They were easy to put together, very sturdy, and they look very clean and modern. I really like the way the plastic back has a little bit of \"give\" to it so you can rock in them, and they are nice and lightweight so they are easy to move around. I saw these exact same chairs at a modern furniture store in San Francisco for more than twice the price here on Overstock. They were easy to put together, but make sure you tighten everything or they sometimes squeak when you first sit down. This was our first purchase from Overstock and overall we are extremely happy with the chairs and also with the shipping and service from Overstock.", 
    "I'm a huge Eames fan, but can't exactly afford $400 per chair. These chairs are great! The look the part at a fraction of the price! Very happy with them!", 
    "These are really great chairs on a unique design. I adore the wire wood base that makes the look more extravagant and eye catching. I have never had plastic pieces as I do not like them, but these chairs have a unique atmosphere and feeling that makes you buy. We can easily use them indoors and outdoors also, so whenever we have guests coming or family gatherings these chairs always provide comfortable seating.", 
    "When I saw these great chairs on Overstock I ordered three sets. they had such great look and design that I was hoping they would look just as fine in reality as shown on picture. The look is just as fine, even better, giving that retro freshness, simplicity and energy as needed. All top quality pieces that are really comfortable and easy to clean. Now I have to search for a matching table. Hope you have one.", 
    "These are really great and cozy chairs for everyday use. the frame and whole construction is way better than I expected for this affordable price. I am glad I ordered quite a few sets as now we have extra chairs for every occasion, outdoors and indoors also. Really durable pieces that are easy to clean.", 
    "Love the look of these chairs, however, after only two weeks of light use, they are rattling and the screws are loose. I'm afraid they are going to fall apart. It's too bad, because they look GREAT. Don't buy for everyday use!", 
    "Overstock was incredible! My products were damaged and guy I was emailing in customer service was just the best and the refunded my money. This was the first time I bought from overstock and now this is my go to store. I can't wait to buy a rug and finish my home through Overstock! Thank you", 
    "I just ordered a great looking dining chairs and was searching for some unique and lightweight chairs around it. These wooden legged white chairs seemed the perfect choice and they really are. All of them arrived in great quality and they look more then amazing. Simple, yet unique with the form and material combination, suiting my needs perfectly. All on a highly affordable price.", 
    "I was looking at these for long now finally I ordered them. I bought three sets for the show room and they look amazing there. All simple, light fresh and really natural with the wood legs. The shell form is really great and elegant, matching with the decor of the hall. Comfort and quality once again combined.", 
    "The chairs I ordered are perfect for my home. They are really unique and stylish with the wood legs and plastic seating, and also comfortable. Whenever I organize a family gathering or a party they suit me well and give everyone a comfortable spot. Light and easy to clean, given on a highly fair price and quality. Thank you.", 
    "These wood legged accent chairs are beautiful. I love to combine materials and colors in order to get the most unique look in my home, and with these chairs I received a great living design. The plastic is really solid and not at all cold or poor quality. Paired with the wooden legs they give a unique and stylish look for the room. Comfortable and easy to clean. Best price until now.", 
    "So simple, so elegant, so beautiful. This simplicity is what made me buy these chairs and made me buy 2 sets. It is just amazing how easy the assembly was, even 8 years old child can do it without any problems. As for the service, absolute professional approach, very quick, spot on service. Thanks", 
    "These chairs look great and the price is great but the quality is awful. We bought 6 and now have to spend $100 to ship them back. Don't make our mistake. They are too good to be true. Don't understand the other reviewers who said they use them with kids and in classrooms. I would give these chairs one day in a classroom. Very frustrated that we have to pay to ship these back when the quality is so poor. $100 in shipping fees makes this an expensive mistake. Go find something that looks as good as these but are better quality!", 
    "I bought 4 chairs and one was defective. It was missing the screw mount for the chair. This would have been a real inconvenience requiring me to return the chair. Luckily, I had friend ho was abe to fix it for me. Otherwise I'd have been furious.", 
    "These chairs are super cute and accurately represented. There's a little movement in the connection points and they need to be tightened periodically, but i think it's a fair trade-off for the price.", 
    "These chairs are a terrific value and actually much more comfortable than you would expect! Assembly wasn't too bad but goes better if you have a second person to help. They get a little wobbly sometimes but I assume that can be fixed with a little tightening. They are also very good looking and I have gotten lots of compliments. Highly recommend!", 
    "I bought a set of these accent chairs just for decoration purpose in our new age modern living room. I was the happiest man when I received the package at my doorstep, delivered in time and exactly as I ordered. I think this was the easiest and fastest process so far regarding the purchase of a product from an online store. Thanks overstock, you made my day.", 
    "Why buy sophisticated piece of furniture when you can achieve the same with simplicity and style. This is the main reason I bought 2 sets of these nice wooden leg chairs. For me less is more so when I look to my dining set I want to feel the comfort the elegance and the practicality of the things I have. And let us face it, where can you buy 2 chairs for this price except overstock?", 
    "These plastic chairs brought a refreshing look and change into our small weekend dining room. With the wood legs they go beyond simple and plain chairs, they become really stylish and great looking. I ordered a dining table that matches in color with the chair legs and the look is now balanced and complete. The chairs are really durable and solid, giving the everyday comfort. Love them.", 
    "These chairs were a little smaller and not quite the quality that I expected. I also didn't realize that the chairs had a little \"give\" to them when you lean back. But overall good chairs. These are probably the coolest looking chairs that I could have found for the price.", 
    "A friend has the much more expensive Design Within Reach version of these chairs and I can distinguish no difference in look, feel or comfort. One of the holes to affix the legs did not line up but the chair is sturdy nonetheless. There were 3 sticky pads included with each chair, I assume for the feet to prevent floor scratching, which means one foot of each chair is pad-free, oddly. Also the sticky pads are not the right size, so maybe they're not really supposed to be for protective the floor. In any case, they're perfect for my house, a great size, a great price, and are totally comfortable as dining chairs.", 
    "These chairs look good. When paired with the Saarinen tulip table (in fiberglass) they seem a little flimsy in comparison (the version with arms is a bit more sturdy). The dowels need occasional tightening. If placing these on a wood floor, felt pads on the feet are necessary.", 
    "I got the chairs and very happy with the quality and delivery service.", 
    "After finishing their pool section I wanted to buy the an opening present. This is why I ordered two sets of wooden leg plastic chairs. They not only look amazing and unique but are easy to clean and can be used easily outdoors. The look is great and the price was affordable. Great deal.", 
    "These accent chairs are amazing. i ordered two sets to place it on my backyard around the newly purchased table. We love sitting and eating out when the weather is fine and these chairs were perfect for outdoor use. It was easy and fast to assemble and they are great to use inside whenever needed. Although I am not a plastic fan these unique looking chairs with wooden legs caught my attention at first. Just love them.", 
    "So far I'm very happy with my chairs. I put them with an oak table and they look wonderful. they take up less room than my last chairs giving me more room in my dining room. the only thing that has happened is the screws that attach the legs to the seat have come loose and needed to be re-tightened.", 
    "I have never imagined I would buy plastic chairs, but these ones with the unique wooden legs look so amazing I had to put my order. The design is really simple and unique and I love that the chairs can be used indoor and outdoor also. They are really easy to move and to clean and are there whenever extra seating is needed. Top price and excellent quality.", 
    "These were very cheap looking. Don't get them if you are expecting something to go in a nice room. They would be good for a kids play room.", 
    "These are the perfect chairs for my small home. They are unique and lovely, easy to clean and the wood and plastic combination is made with the best precision. i can use them indoor and outdoors also when I have barbeque parties and when guests come over. The price was really fair for the four chairs I ordered and shipping fast. Thank you.", 
    "My wife bought 4 of these chairs. I wasn\u0092t too happy when I saw it but after a while I sad it was a good purchase. After all it\u0092s comfortable, looks stylish enough. The price was affordable and the chairs a re comfortable to use outdoor too.", 
    "I love these chairs. They are a great alternative to other, more expensive originals. Not as strong as a typical chair so I do get a little worried when larger guests come visit. Overall, a wonderful chair for the price.", 
    "These wood leg chairs look amazing. I ordered four to have a whole set for my family. Although I do not like plastic pieces of furniture these ones had such unique look and design I needed to buy them. The quality is really great and the seating comfortable. The best thing that it is easy to clean and move around, so I can even use them outdoors when we are having a grill party.", 
    "it's a simple assembly, but not clear which part goes first...I hope I did it right, but the chair is squeaky whenever you sit on it. OTher than that, it's a average quality I guess - the plastic seat has some marks of cheap manufacturing, but that's not so visible.", 
    "product looks great, assembles easily. Had one screw that wouldn't thread secure into the bottom of the seat. Plastic broke 1st time it was sat on. Waiting on a replacement. It can happen, otherwise seems fine", 
    "These chairs were a great price for what you get when I ordered them, but I only bought one set of two at first, just in case I didn't like them. Well I ended up liking them but when I went to order another set they were sold out! So I waited for them to come back in stock and once they did, they came back at an increased price!! I was very annoyed by this and still do not have a full set of chairs because of the new price. They were originally about $**per chair and now they are close to a ***!! I do not think they are worth that, but $** each was good with me. As for the Chairs themselves, they are good look-alikes of the original eames style chair. They are not very sturdy or durable, when you sit down they rattle and bend a bit but it's as if they are meant to be that way. They are comfortable, however and I haven't had problems with them breaking in the past few months that I've had them. I would certainly buy 2 more if the cost would go back down to the original price.", 
    "These are a great value for mid-century sleek design. I had to quickly and cheaply decorate a short-term apartment rental, and despite trying all the usual suspects -- CB2, West Elm, Craigslist -- could not find a greater value than these chairs to achieve a sleek MCM decor. The chairs are fairly sturdy and comfortable as dining room chairs, if too hard for anything else. When you're putting together the dowel legs, you'll notice that it's not the most precise construction, but for the price, hard to complain. Beware that the white shell is semi-matte, and although I have been able to wipe off water-based stains fairly easily, grease spots are a bit of an issue.", 
    "These chairs are light weight, modern and great for casual dining, office, extra chairs to have on hand for guests. Easy and quick to assemble and great for the price.", 
    "I love these chairs and for the price, they are worth it. Not as sturdy as you would want them to be but they provide a good knock off alternative to DWR's version.", 
    "These chairs look great! It is modern but goes good with a more traditional wood table. I love the look of my dining room! They are comfortable but a little bit low for me (I am very short). The assembly was very easy.", 
    "I really like the look and comfort of these chairs. Easy to put together & clean too. But, the screws holding them together are regularly coming lose. So, I have to tighten them every couple of weeks. Pretty annoying & not something I expect from a chair nearly $$$ each.", 
    "I love these chairs they are a good representation of the original for so much cheaper! With two people they were easy to assemble, could also be done alone you'd just have to get some leverage to line up the holes. Glad I went with these.", 
    "I love these chairs and so glad I decide to go for it. I have them in our kitchen with a claw footed antique table and love the modern look they bring (I love the look of antique w/modern) So glad I got them. They look great and are comfortable to sit in. I'm super happy with my purchase and love the price of these. Go for it!", 
    "I wanted an inexpensive yet stylish chair for my desk and these definitely fit the bill. They are comfortable to sit in and look great in my room. Assembly couldn't have been easier, you simply screw the base into the seat with the alan key that comes with the hardware. Took me 5 minutes tops. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "A great and affordable copy of a classic chair..perfect for folks who want the look of a \"KNOLL\" original..but don't want to spend the bucks. A great choice for a frugal design buff! Mid century lovers rejoice!", 
    "They are comfortable, easy to build, easy to clean and pretty. The backs flex a little bit when you lean back (of course), and I should have put some thread lock on the screws when I put them together. Because they have needed to be retightened. I put 6 of them with a light wood ikea table ($450), I also put 2 of the arm chairs at the heads to the table. I like these chairs, but I LOVE they arm chairs. These just fit at a table better. Also the arm chairs flex a little bit less b/c of the way they are shaped.", 
    "After receiving these chairs, I actually dropped by a DWR location and examined their licensed Eames chairs and found virtually no difference between the two modern reproductions. If you like the chairs available at your DWR, you would like these chairs. But the chairs arrived scuffed. In the end, I decided that nothing could beat the patina of a vintage fiberglass shell so I returned thanks to the great customer service at Overstock. I explained that they arrived scuffed, and they returned them free of charge. And I did this over chat, which is quite convenient.", 
    "Bought these with the matching arm chairs. The quality was pretty good, but these chairs have a higher quality finish than do the cheaper arm chairs. A couple of nicks on the wood legs. The seat height is a little low (about 1\" lower than a typical chair). All in all I would buy these again, still beats paying $600 for a real Eames dining chair.", 
    "I got 4 of these chairs. What a great deal. If you want to super-hyper critical, you can spend 4x the money and get the originals. More power to you. But if you want good chairs for a great price, these fit the bill nicely.", 
    "Beautiful chairs. A little low though. Very easy to assemble with just 4 screws each (legs come pre-assembled). Not the best quality with some defaults on the wooden legs, but still very nice looking. Get the modern look for a good price.", 
    "great for any decor or room. my wife and i used them in our office so bring together the room. real comfortable.", 
    "i purchased these chairs as soon as i saw them online. i just like the look of them, the combination of plastic and wood. i was not disappointed!", 
    "i love these chairs because they are so unique. dont look comfortable but they really are.", 
    "I love the combination of modern and traditional elements. The plastic chair with wooden legs is an unexpected mixture, but it really works.", 
    "no matter what your decorative style is, you should by these chairs - well made, beautiful, and comfortable!", 
    "great chairs. heavy duty. fits 300+ lbs every night. comfortable too.", 
    "Whoever skips on these chairs has no taste or style! I love these chairs!!! They are so modern and hip. They are what makes my dining room decor sucessful, forget everything else.", 
    "like these chairs cause they seem to combine the modern and traditional elements.", 
    "keep a few of these in my garage for when my boys have friends over. easy to clean and put away afterwards", 
    "Couldn't believe this \"find\". And the value. Designer chic at a fraction + the quality. Two chairs at such exceptional pricing. Can't wait to replace the dining chairs now.", 
    "I needed something easy to clean and move around into my kitchen. I ordered two sets from these simple, modern and amazing chairs on a great price. The chairs are unique with the design and material combination, really easy to clean and most of all easy to move around and store. Just as the whole family, our children love the chairs and drinking my morning coffee while sitting in them is a great way to start the day.", 
    "These new wood leg accent chairs look amazing in my winter garden. I have ordered two sets on an amazing price. The quality is great and the material and color combination is simply amazing. The chairs are comfortable, lightweight and easy to move around, so whenever guests arrive we can easily take them out even for inside use. Just great.", 
    "I have ordered two sets from this wood leg white accent chair collection to my backyard. The perfect combination I could find as they are easy to move around, but solid enough to last for a long time. The combination is modern, just as the style and design and these great white accent chairs look amazing under the trees in my yard. We can easily sit out during the warm weather and have fun with our guests and friends. Great quality, great design and great price.", 
    "Bummed to have to return them -- they are just as how they look on the photo and are virtually identical to the original ones. I bought them for my office, and they make a very scary \"crack\" sound each time one of us seat on it so most of our employees feel like they are going to brake the chairs -- not a good feeling to have!", 
    "I have ordered two sets of Wood Leg White Accent Chairs for my summer garden in the backyard of our house. These chairs are simple, lightweight, yet elegant and great looking. The accent chairs with wood legs give the perfect comfort, being easy to clean and move around and easy to store at the same time. The unique look of the shape and the style fit with the table and make my garden place look amazing.", 
    "These chairs are fine for light duty use, but are not well made. We had to buy special rubber washers ($1.00/each x 8 for each chair) because the hardware was very poor quality and didn't \"fit\" correctly. These aren't really even a very good Eames knock off. For the price, I'd reconsider.", 
    "We ordered the set of two arm chairs first and liked the quality Retro-classic White Accent Chairs (Set of 2) Then we then these and got four of these (2 packages) but they do not match. The legs are the same and they look the same in the photos but really these are shiny pearl and not a true mat white. They all had a few nicks on the legs due to packaging flaws but these nicks are simple to buffed out. My main gripe is because they did not match I have spent *** in postage. And I still need a chair to match the Retro-classic White Accent Chairs (Set of 2) armchairs.... Hope it helps", 
    "I got this set to have a side chairs to complement my home office space. They are durable, lightweight and are quite comfortable. They work perfectly for when I have guests or clients over and they add a nice modern feel without taking up too much space. There is a little assembly required, but it\u0092s not hard at all. I\u0092ve purchased other items from Overstock, and like the other times, the delivery was on time and the product arrived in perfect condition.", 
    "Don't let your overweight relatives/friends sit in this chair! It is beautiful but not sturdy at all. My 200+ lb. sister sat in it & moved to another chair because she thought it might break. Looks beautiful but not for anyone who is heavy. more an artwork piece & less a functional piece.", 
    "These are great chairs for the Eames look without the price tag. Shipping was very fast and everything arrived in good condition. The wooden bases are fully assembled and just need to be screwed onto the chair base. Took less than ten minutes to put both chairs together. They look great and I wish I had room for more.", 
    "Our chairs just arrived - 2 days after ordering online - on a Sunday! Super fast service. Nice quality, easy to assemble (no tools required) and very comfottable. The white base is a little more matte than expected and the wood base a little lighter than depicted in the picture, but overall, they look fantastic.", 
    "Love the look of the modern chair with our traditional table! NOT hard to assemble at all!", 
    "Very nice chairs - easy to put together and they look high quality. The only flaw I can find is already pointed out by another reviewer (the bolts are silver and not black and do stick out a bit). Other than that, I am very happy with these!", 
    "These chairs arrived in a few days and were easy to assemble. They are great looking and surprisingly comfortable. Very happy with purchase.", 
    "I've always loved the retro look\u0097so much so that I was devastated when my mother eventually redecorated her home! These stools are perfect, though, and are great replicas of the famous Eames style chairs. Better yet, they're incredibly simple to put together, and I can happily report no issues in the construction process. I love the zany plastic and wood look of these chairs, and they look great with some boldly patterned cushions. I've gone for orange and green at the moment, but animal patterns would look great, too.", 
    "I love these chairs. I ordered two to make sure they were nice, then ordered two more after owning one pair for a week-- they are comfortable enough and very chic.", 
    "I am so pleased with these chairs. They are great knock-offs of the Eames chair. Regarding the pebbly/matte plastic -- it seems this is what the 'authentic' chairs are made of as well (polypropylene) and that fiberglass is no longer done. They were quite simple to assemble and look great in our modern home! For my shipment, the packaging was pristine -- nothing was damaged, no missing parts, etc. In fact the shells had felt circles covering the spots where you afix the base to prevent them from scratching against one another, and there were pieces of plastic/rubber protecting metal joints on the bases as well.", 
    "I have to admit I was a bit afraid of the plastic and wood combination as I always hated it. But it is looking different at these Wood Leg White Accent Chairs. At first they look funny but matched into the room atmosphere together with other pieces of furniture they look amazing. I love the curved shape of the chairs and their comfort. The price is also affordable for the quality. Now I am glad I ordered these chairs.", 
    "I wasn't expecting much for this price, but for my surprise, they look very good. The wood is a little lighter than what I thought, but they look pretty good.", 
    "I really love my new chairs! I bought two sets. They look wonderful around my wood table. They were easy to assemble, once I realized I had to remove the little felt circles from the spots where the screws go in. (I thought maybe they were supposed to stay there for squeak prevention or something.) Anyway, they went together easily and are very comfortable to sit in. I like the way the back flexes a little bit. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is the chrome fasteners on the legs. They should be black, as they are on the real Eames chairs. The chrome looks a little cheesy. Still, for this price, I could buy one real Eames chair, or four of these. I don't perceive the color as slightly grayish, as another commenter did. Mine are a nice, slightly warm white. I'll be putting flat pillows on them in the winter - the plastic is a little bit cool to sit on. I'm thinking of making pillows from a light gray linen. I'm very pleased with these chairs, and recommend them highly.", 
    "These white accent chairs would work in a kitchen or living room or even on a back patio. They are molded plastic chairs with lovely wooden legs and interesting metal \u0091spokes\u0092 connecting the legs. They have a rather architectural look to them that is quite appealing to me, but actually go with almost any style of home furnishings. These are modern chairs with modern comfort, but they look really nice with my traditional furniture.", 
    "These chairs are sturdy and comfortable. They look great with the same set of chairs that have arm rests. We use them on a daily basis at a work table. One thing I have noticed about the chairs is that the screws that attach the legs to the seat base have come loose and need to be tightened.", 
    "super chairs for a good price, easy to assemble, not complicated at all...took me 5 min per chair...they are not fiberglass like the originals but the plastic is not too flimsy either..love them.", 
    "these chairs are great knock offs, they are comfortable and sturdy, they come with some slight imperfections, like a small scratch on the wood, but given the ridiculous price, and how good they look, the impression is perfect. we are using them in the office as conference chairs. highly recommend.", 
    "the pictures on overstock sometimes don't do the item justice and make it tough to decide whether to purchase or not. i bought these based on the numerous good reviews and am happy with them.more details - sturdy, comfortable plastic seat in white with a very very slight grey tinge - not shiny plastic, but matte plastic; the wooden legs are not as dark as they appear here - but are a color i'd call \"blond\" wood; shiny silver screws where legs attach to black criss-cross leg supports; nice detail of small black plastic \"foot\" at bottom of each leg", 
    "The four chairs arrived 2 days after I ordered. They were so easy to put together on my own. The design is beautiful. I had a light wood dining table and all the chairs I had looked at had dark wooden legs, until I saw these on Overstock. Overstock is the best! THANK YOU! Like a similar review the seat height is slightly lower than 17 inches.", 
    "These chairs gives a nice a refreshing look to our kitchen. Easy to clean even though they are white. The leg system is sturdy and robust. Not the easiest to assemble, I had to fight with some screws. Feels comfortable even after sitting for a long time.", 
    "These chairs are quite impressive, the photo does not do them justice. I bought 6 as dining room chairs as well as two of the arm chair versions. I love the wood base. The quality seems good, comfort is excellent, and the aesthetic is for me over the top.......seeing them from any angle is inspiring, I crave good design.", 
    "These chairs arrived 2 days after I ordered them. Like the last reviewer said, the finish is not as shiny as the picture shows - the texture is grainy, almost similar to a school child's chair (but nicer). I wish these chairs were cheaper, but for the price one can pay for a similar look, I can't really complain. They are pretty comfortable. My husband is 6'6\" and he says they are good enough for him (he prefers a high back). Assembly was very easy. I would give it 5 stars if the finish was shinier, like the photo.", 
    "Great quality, easy assembly, and fast delivery. This is an affordable alternative to the Eames fiberglass shell chair. This chair is molded plastic, very comfortable, and looks great.", 
    "I love these chairs! They look fantastic with the glass table I purchased from from West Elm. I am buying two more.", 
    "we are very happy with our purchase - we've got 8 of these and 2 with the armrest. we have a big table which we couldn't find anything to go with it, and we wanted something modern with wood accents. these are perfect and our dining room looks stunning!easy to assemble, and compare to same products by other brands, the price is just perfect.", 
    "Normally these chairs cost between $**-** at a store as well as most online retailers but luckily I found them on Overstock for less. Plus using the **% off e-mail coupon, they were a steal. The chairs are identical to the pricey Eiffel chairs you find in boutique modern shops but they're significantly less costly.", 
    "I was very disappointed with overstock and my recent purchase. It was my first time buying something on overstock and I was so excited to buy new chairs for our new home. I was at first impressed with their low prices and immediately bought these white plastic chairs. But to my disappointment, when they arrived, overstock had sent the wrong chairs and when I called to have them replaced, the original white chairs with wooden legs were no longer in stock. There was nothing they could do for me except for me to return the chairs. I wish that there was something more that I was offered for the inconvenience. I am skeptical to order from overstock now, wondering if I will actually get what I have ordered."
