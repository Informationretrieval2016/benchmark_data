    "Chair ste not as ORANGE as they appeared on picture. Other than that they wete a great buy. Very comfortable...", 
    "The chairs are great (especially for the price). The quality is probably not well suited to withstand heavy daily usage, but they look very nice as accent chairs in my office. They are also not as orange as they appear in the picture....more of a dull orange/rust color.", 
    "Bought these for my Daughters new apartment! They are just perfect!", 
    "these chairs were easy to put together and they were a great addition to my living room. they are super comfy and for the price you cant go wrong ."
