  "reviews": [
    "Sizes of sauce pans were disappointing and they are not as non-stick as expected. I researched many sets and saw this one had overall good value for money but I'm disappointed. Followed use and care instructions per packaging but they are just getting worse. Have to mail in the pans for review to get my warranty covered which could take upto 6 weeks.", 
    "I thoroughly enjoy this cookware. Beautiful non-stick finish, easy clean- up and did not weigh a lot like some anodized cookware. I love the lids because they are reinforced by steel around the edges, so if dropped they'd probably not break (don't know for sure, haven't dropped one). Outstanding cookware by the \"Rach'!", 
    "Wonderful pans, beautiful color, and they were even better than I thought they would be. Overstock.com site shopping was easy and fun!", 
    "My wife absolutely loves this cookware set!!! It cooks great and clean up is very easy.", 
    "Gave this for a wedding gift. They tell me how nice the pans are....nothings sicks!!! So easy to clean up. They can now add on to the set with additional pieces. Had it shipped to NC with no problem. Shipped for free ~ and you can't beat that!!!", 
    "Great pots and they are really non stick", 
    "This is a great set--had to buy a 4 quart at later date---these do heat up fast , easy to clean--don't need oil or very little. DW safe.", 
    "Excellent quality. Great product.", 
    "Excellent product and good price.", 
    "Have only used couple of pans so far. Handles and lids are sturdy and the orange color gives a nice contrast.", 
    "Excellent set. Nice weight and cooks even.", 
    "Definitely not the best but good enough for average household", 
    "I got my self a set last year, my daughter was at my house and loved the weight and feel of the pots and pans, so I got her a set for her birthday. She loves them.", 
    "These are the greatest. I have had one of these cookware pieces for over a year. It still looks brand new and I use it all the time. So I decided to buy the 10 piece set I am so happy.", 
    "I think its a great set but the pans need a little work.", 
    "Bought other pieces at *** to make a larger set. Orange not my color but its grown on us", 
    "Love this cookware set. Love the orange handles and the glass lids. Would recommend to a friend.", 
    "So far so good - time will tell", 
    "Love, love, love the set. Cooks awesome and cleans like a dream. Many recommendations", 
    "This is a very nice set that's super easy to clean up and the sizes are great. If they were a little heavier I would've gave them the fifth star easily.", 
    "seriously wish that they didn't stain as much! I don't recommend this item.", 
    "This set came to me and as soon as I opened the box I knew something was wrong. It wasn't packaged the way a new set of pots and pans usually is. I pulled out each piece and a couple of them had scratches inside the pots. I returned them for a refund and chose to order elsewhere.", 
    "these pans last a long time, don't use really high heat and leave it on the burner. it discolors the finish", 
    "Great pots. Even heating and durable.", 
    "Love my pots and pans. Priced right. Easy clean up.", 
    "I like this set quite a lot. Not the cheapest, but not terribly expensive either. The sauce pans are a little strange shaped, however, I've been using the set for over a year and have no complaints.", 
    "I love this cookware set!! I would say this set would be one of my favorite sets that I have bought!!", 
    "I love the non stick pans> I used them for the first time for our Christmas brunch for the family. made great omlet sizes out of the fry pans just wished it had a larger stir fry pan for larger family meals. otherwise love all the set.", 
    "I purchased this order for one of our engagement gifts to my wife and I. Our first Pots and Pans set. All of the pots and pans, knifes all are made out of very cheap materials. Our knife which we did not buy and loved the design chipped from cutting a carrot. All of our pans only washed with the recommended plastic cleaning products, stick more than they leave you with cooked product to eat. I wish this was a good buy and i wish i had something that would last. Both let me down.", 
    "Actually, we love the pots; really neat shape. Look really nice on the stove or on the table. Even tho they are dishwasher safe we have decided to hand wash for now.Non stick surfaces make clean up easy & have decreased the need for extra fat in our cooking.We did not comparison shop prior to purchase. After the set was received we found them a few dollars cheaper at a Walmart Store near us", 
    "I love this cookware set i have it for now 2 years and still looks great, I just wish it was not so much because i want to make my kitchen with al Rachael ray item my favorite is the orange color.", 
    "Love this cookware. It is everythig it was everything it was said to be and more.", 
    "Great pans I love them. I have had these pots for quite some time and they are very nice, the best part is the the non stick it is fantastic.", 
    "I was looking for a new set of pots I looked everywhere overstock gave me the best price, I love this pots so easy to clean ans light .. I would buy them again.", 
    "Very cute cooking set. Just got it last week so can't comment on how long it'll last or how it will withstand the test of time in the kitchen. Overall, I'm very pleased. It's a very nice addition to my kitchen. No hassle with the shipping at all.", 
    "I do like this cookware but the bottom outside scratches really easy. Nothing sticks to the inside and they are easy to clean but I have not used them often and the bottoms are already scratched up. I am not happy with these in that aspect. I think next time I will choose bobby flays cookware.", 
    "No hassle, no fuss, no complaints. The only problem was my error. Iwish I would have ordered the larger set instead of having to order an extra pan", 
    "I received this set pretty quickly. They are not as heavy as I expected, but they are very good quality. I like the fact that I can see through the top of the lid. Clean up is a snap!", 
    "Love these pans. Handles stay cool. Pans don't burn. easy clean up. Nice glass lids. All can go into dishwasher. Thank you Rachel Ray",

    "I've had these pans for 5 years now and use them everday and they are still as new as when I took them out of the box. I've never had food stick to them and I never have to scrub them when I wash them. Would definitely buy again or as a gift to someone", 
    "i love these pots. nothing sticks to them. they are easy to clean and they are dishwasher safe which is one of the reasons i bought them.",
