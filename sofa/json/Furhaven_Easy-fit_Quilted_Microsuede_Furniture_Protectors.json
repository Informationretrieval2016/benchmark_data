    "My husband spilled coffee on this cover and it didn't leak through. Not only good for pets but messy husbands too! Lol", 
    "I like them but they slide off the furniture. I may have to use double sided tape to keep them on.", 
    "I thought this would be a good fit for my couch and protect it from my cats and dog. But they just dug underneath and laid on the couch with this covering them. For small animals it is not a good protector.", 
    "The backing of this product is a thin sheet of plastic, so not only does it make a noise when you sit on it, it's slippery, so it won't stay in place. It's also a bit rigid, so it's hard to get a smooth surface.", 
    "I have 2 dogs and some cats. Cover works very well, washes great and dries very fast", 
    "These covers are ok but they don't stay put on the furniture and because the underside is so slick and they show hair and wetness too much. They also don't cover the arms as well as I needed.", 
    "These are nice for keeping the pets on the sofa, but they don't stay in place on my sofa.", 
    "Great furniture protector, best price online. Highly recommended!", 
    "Not happy with this at all. It does not fit well over the sofa to start with, then every time you move, the back fall down and you end up sitting on it. A huge waste of money. Used them for a whole 10 hours before purchasing something different.", 
    "There is no way to prevent the cover from sliding and they do not fit well at all.", 
    "great idea if you have pets", 
    "Didn't stay on sofa, moved around a lot. Ended up using something else. Looks nice just wish it stayed on the couch.", 
    "Fits my chair and a half very well. Washed well and looks great.", 
    "Do not buy!!!!! It sucks very miss leading! -10 not 1 star", 
    "I cannot tell you how much I hate this sofa protector. I purchased the 'Sage' option, which more or less, should be renamed to 'Hunter Green'. It's a lot darker than the image leads you to believe. Besides the dark color, I also have to listen to it. Yes, it sounds like a cheap blue tarp that covers boating equipment. The final issue is it will not stay in place. As soon as I sit down on the couch I find it loudly flopping over on top of me.I'd love to return this, but it's too much of a hassle with Overstock's return policy. Overstock...please take some notes from ****** :)", 
    "Really good for the RV love seat when camping!", 
    "The covers are too flimsy to stay in place. The quality is not what I expected either. Disappointed", 
    "I love it I use it for winter time only", 
    "I have purchased furniture covers from Overstock before. I've always been pleased. This one is not made of the same quality materials. It's also to skimpily made to fit. It does fit my oversized chair, however the photo in the ad should have been a red flag. Those animals are stuffed toys.", 
    "It looks good when you put it on but dogs nor humans can sit on it without it coming off and looking horrible. It is just no good. Only for looks\ud83d\ude20"
