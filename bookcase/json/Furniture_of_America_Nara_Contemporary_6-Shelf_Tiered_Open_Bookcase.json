    "Making an extra effort to emphasize the value and quality of this product. This rivals anything I looked at from Pottery Barn, Crate & Barrel, etc. but could not afford. Great product. Great quality. Great price. Couldn't be happier. I also bought the 4-shelf open bookshelf that matches to go with it. Perfect.", 
    "My wife ordered this bookcase and I assembled it. The box arrived a little beat up (including UPS having to throw it over our front gate), but all the pieces were intact. There is a good amount of foam padding inside to protect the pieces. I was able to assemble the entire thing in about 30 minutes. Could be done by just one person, but a second person was useful in the final steps that required laying the unit on its side to drill the bottom shelves. Very straightforward - follow the diagrams. All you need is an Allen wrench (provided) and a screwdriver (instructions indicate handheld, but I suggest electric).I only had two complaints - the wooden shelves do not have pre-drilled holes like the instructions indicate they should. After finishing I thought that it was actually a good thing because the holes would have to be very precise to align with the metal beams. Without holes I was able to place the shelves with a little more leeway, but it did require me to use an electric drill to get the screws through the wood. With only a hand held screwdriver I was not able to apply enough force to get the screw to pierce the wood. Second complaint is that the bookcase is not level. I think that I can adjust the rubber pieces on the bottom to correct the unevenness, but have not tried yet. If not, then some felt pads should do the trick pretty easily.My wife is happy with the way the piece looks and it fits great with our decor. We bought the champagne color.", 
    "after adding cute decor to the bookcase, its perfect in my bedroom. only issue was not have pre drilled holes in the wood. due to that I just have the shelves sitting there until I have time to drill the nails into place", 
    "I am super happy with my purchase. I had been waiting for the champagne color for months and it finally came back in stock. I was able to get it immediately and the packaging it came in was quite damaged but luckily none of the parts were damaged. My husband and I put it together and we've had so many compliments. I have a friend who got the chrome version similar to it from Z gallerie but mine is bigger and much cheaper. Super happy!", 
    "Very pleased with this purchase. I put it in my foyer to use instead of a foyer table. Assembly was very easy. Screws were numbered and packaged individually for easy access. Chrome was very clean and well polished. I have received many compliments about it. A beautiful, unique addition to our new home!", 
    "The only indication this is a lower end product are the screws/bolts that show. Higher end versions would be welded, but will cost you upwards of 2K...this is a nice-looking alternative!", 
    "Takes two to put together. Sturdy", 
    "This shelving unit gets a lot of comments in our apartment. It's pretty and fits well with our midcentury theme. It was easy to put together, and looks much more expensive than it was. Were I to have a complaint - it wouldn't have worked so easily without a drill. There were not pre-drilled holes in the shelves. Luckily I had one but those without will probably get annoyed fairly quickly in the assembly of this shelf.", 
    "Read directions, make sure holes to attach board is on correct side of shelf when putting together. When assembled, the unit is sturdy. Would purchase again", 
    "fair quality with reasonable price", 
    "Easy to instal and looks good, i ordered in gold and I received in silver, but I didn't want to change and waiter longer to organize my room.", 
    "easy to put together and seem well made so far", 
    "This bookshelf is really stunning. The picture is accurate and it's a very stylish, high-quality piece of furniture. Only complaint is that, as noted in a previous review, the wooden shelves did not have pre-drilled holes (although the manual seems to indicate that they're supposed to). An electric drill is necessary to get the screws into the shelves, but it's easy to do (even for a beginner). The end result is well worth it.", 
    "The piece looks amazing! The only problem was that there weren't pre drilled holes in the wood shelves so we had to make them ourselves", 
    "Found similar items for more than 4 times the price. Quality on this piece may not be as high, but it certainly looks high end and modern.", 
    "Full assembly required, easy to put together though. Wood boards are not pre drilled so having a power drill on hand would make it go faster.I got the champagne which isn't a true gold color but more bronze gold. Wood shelves are a grey/black/brown. The piece overall looks great and feels sturdy. Be aware that since you are putting this together completely that you can see the screw heads on the sides of the shelves, so it is not a smooth seamless look."
