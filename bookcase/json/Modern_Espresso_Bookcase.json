    "The shipping was very timely and a huge plus. I just moved into a new home and was anxious to get my new bookshelf assembled. It comes in 2 separate boxes that are about 50lbs each so you definitely want a 2nd hand in moving the boxes and assembling the furniture. The only issue that I have with this is that the description states that this is wood; in fact, it is that pressed particle board material. Granted that material has come a long ways over the years, it still isn't the quality of true wood. This is a very sturdy piece once assembly is complete; I say that because as you are assembling it tends to feel flimsy at times until all of the screws are tightened down. Overall, this is a very nice piece of furniture and a nice addition to my home; good value. Just beware that this is not true wood and as long as you know that going in you will not be dissapointed.", 
    "It arrived in two 70lb crates right on time. I assembled it by myself and it took a good 2 and1/2 hrs. All parts were included, and once I understood the directions it went rather smoothly. This is really a solid and beautiful piece of furniture. It is exactly what the picture shows and I would highly recommend it for the price."
