    "Came as expected, Heavy, sturdy, well-made. It was a little tough to hang by myself but I worked it out and it looks great. It wasn't cheap, but it was worth it's price.", 
    "These cabinets are fine if you like laminate. They are MDF(medium density fiberboard) with a zebrawood LAMINATE veneer, not wood veneer. That is, laminate material with a wood \"look.\" They are great quality: very heavy, nice hardware, wonderful soft close doors. BUT had I known they were laminate I would not have purchased. Be advised. I will either send them back or put them in my laundry room where laminate is fine. They were packed extremely well."
