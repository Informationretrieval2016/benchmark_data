    "The futon mattress was overall good, but there were a few things that were below our expectations. When you put the mattress on the frame in the upright position, it does bunch in the crease an awful lot. Also (and this is probably our mistake for not reading the description close enough) we thought the cover (we bought ours in khaki) was removable - more like a slip cover - but is actually comes sown on. And finally, where the cover is \"tied\" on (similar to where the buttons would be), it seems like it might not be the best quality, like the fabric may tear eventually around these spots. Only time will tell though. Overall though - great purchase at a great price (especially for what we are using it for - on our balcony/ porch).", 
    "I love this Futon Mattress. I'm actually using it as a mattress on our spare bed. It's very comfortable and hard enough so you don't sink in, and it's on a metal platform bed, but you'd never know it! I also love that there is a zip off cover on it. I'd definitely recommend it to another. However, that being said, I can see why some said that it was difficult to use it as a futon mattress, it's so solid and full, I can see where it'd take time for it to adjust to being creased so that it could be used on a futon. Still, it's a great mattress!", 
    "Ordered as a replacement mattress for a futon frame. I was nervous because I didnt have the frame to measure. Item fit frame exactly. Color was exactly as described. Item was delivered on schedule Good quality and would reccomend.", 
    "The cushion came sooner than what I expected, it was in great condition, a little dusty from packaging but I like it. I will definitely purchase again from this site.", 
    "I don't know how they got this futon to fold so nicely and stay in the photo. It was so thick that it kept on sliding off of my futon. It didn't work for us.", 
    "I'm disappointed with my mattress as the filling is different than what was in my older futon mattress this one was replacing. When I sit on it, I can feel the frame underneath and it's uncomfortable. It also causes my back to hurt after long periods of time sitting on it. I'm hoping to find a new one elsewhere and give this one away.", 
    "Very durable and comfortable", 
    "Great value on this futon. It is firm and hold its shape.", 
    "Just what we needed... Comfy! Comfy! Comfy!", 
    "I am happy with the mattress. it is comfortable!", 
    "Great mattress, fits perfectly on frame, quite comfortable", 
    "typical futon mattress, but very thick, did not feel metal bars through it from my futon", 
    "Got here quickly, seems to be made well, is being used in a spare bedroom.", 
    "For the price this is a good buy. It fits my needs and I am glad I bought this. I also bought a cover for it and it is perfect.", 
    "It's prefect for just sitting and occasional guest but I don't feel it's the most comfortable. It's basically just stuffed and not gone sturdiest", 
    "Bought this for my niece. She loves it! It is another bed when all the cousin come over and spent the night. Very comfortable too!", 
    "Very good for the price. I had a spring loaded mattress before which was very nice but extremely heavy. It was impossible to set up the Futon by oneself. With this mattress I can set the Futon by myself. Padding is just enough but wouldn't want any less.", 
    "We got this futon for our cottage camper to avoid the air mattresses. It worked really well and is super comfortable. This is a great futon. You will not be disappointed.", 
    "very comfy and a great value", 
    "Great value - fit my futon frame perfectly - I like the color (I got the dark blue) - would recommend", 
    "fit perfectly and is soft to sit or sleep", 
    "Super quality, quick shipping.", 
    "I purchased this mattress to use as a dog bed. Don't laugh. Works wonders for large breed dogs. The price that I paid through Overstock was less that an extra large dog bed!", 
    "Using it in the living room for a couch/ guest bed. it is very comfortable and although the smell was potent after opening it, it did not last very long. It came promptly in the mail and the package tracking feature was nice. Overall It is a pretty good product", 
    "I used this in a small apartment. This easily fits two people and gave me a nice option in a small space.", 
    "Very pleased with this mattress. It is very comfortable and fits the futon perfectly.", 
    "The comfort of the matteress is good! I would diffently recommend it.", 
    "EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR THE MONEY AND SPEEDY DELIVERY.", 
    "It's a classic futon-It takes the shape you give it. I ordered the \"full\" size which did not fit my full size futon frame. It was actually too big. Also, \"Ivory\" as a color option is far from the color I received. It was more like an off-white muted color, sadly. I ordered the Ivory having liked the actual white-white color of the product pictured. I've had it nearly two weeks and the smell of it is still as if it was taken out of box, not so much in best way. I would probably recommend it in another color but if you are looking for white, you'll get a yellow tone.", 
    "Love the color. Easier to fold than the 10 inch. Great for multi-kid game cave :)", 
    "Got this mattress for my son's room. The smell was not bad, as some reviewers said, but we let it air out for a day anyway.. Mattress puffed up in a day from tight packaging and has been soft and comfy ever since. My son loves it.", 
    "Great value! I was a little hesitant after reading some of these reviews, but I'm so glad I purchased this futon mattress. In addition to being on sale, I also had a 10 percent off coupon, which made the item about $$$. I honestly don't think I could ask for more, for that price.My futon is in a spare bedroom/study and, while I don't expect it to get much use, I wanted to have it available for extra guests. The item arrived on a Friday and I had a friend sleep on it Saturday night with no complaints. Several folks have talked about it being uncomfortable or having a strange smell. I haven't noticed either. Smells fine and the mattress immediately started perking up, despite coming what was essentially shrink wrap. Couple downsides: The company used white thread for the tufting on a navy mattress. Also, the zipper is pretty visible. I had planned to not buy a futon cover, just because I didn't think it would get much use. But those two things may prompt me to spring for one.", 
    "This mattress is extremely comfortable. The navy cover means it go with almost anything.", 
    "Mattress looks okay, and is the same as it looks in the picture. But I expected it to be soft and comfortable, as many of the reviews seem to say it is. Maybe it is just me, but I found it to be extremely uncomfortable. It is very firm and dense, but you still sink in a little bit, so you can still feel the futon frame underneath you- it's just terrible. My boyfriend and his mother both thought it was awful. We just moved to a one bedroom apartment, and we need a futon for guests to stay on. This definitely is not acceptable in my opinion. I expected it to be thick and plush. If you like firm mattresses, then it might be fine, but I didn't like it at all. Now I have to pay to ship this massive thing back, but next time I'll probably buy one in person so that I can tell what it actually feels like.", 
    "Shipping takes time but worth waiting. Really a good product.", 
    "My 16 yr old, 6'2\", size 13, son want to decor his friend his style, we purchased a Futon at a local store, heavy, strong, sturdy. We told them, we do not want the mattress!! Yes it came with it. I went to several places looking and no one satisfy my liking, until I came to OVERSTOCK, The mattress is firm, we love. The mattress is well sew together, thick, and my son is very comfortable. Thank you, OS", 
    "We have only had this for a short time. It was purchased as a replacement mattress. It is better than the one it came with. Time will tell if it is a good value but so far so good. Happy with purchase!", 
    "We needed a new mattress. We bought this one because the description sounded like it was just the thing we wanted. The mattress came within a week. The weight was much lighter than the one we replaced. We were really happy with the price, quality, and the speed in which it was delivered. Overstock has never let me down.", 
    "I absolutely love this mattress! It did have a slight smell that aired out very quickly. And it looks best with a mattress cover. But it's soooo comfortable! Several of my family members have futons in offices / small bedrooms for extra guests and they are not nearly as comfortable as this mattress. I'm very happy with this purchase!", 
    "Actually a layer of cardboard with a heavy quilt on top would be as good as this mattress.", 
    "Bough futon for son who visit a few days a week... Great comfort for the price. Cannot remove cover to wash so would need sheets when sleeping or futon cover...", 
    "Love this futon! Had to buy a replacement mattress for our futon since our cats decided the old one was a toilet. UGH! I was not looking forward to spending a lot of money to get a good mattress. This mattress had an excellent price. And contrary to other reviews I have read it did not have any chemical odor. I was amazed that it fit in such a small box when it arrived. But it fluffed up immediately and it sits and lays very comfortably. Love it!", 
    "I ordered the same product from a different Company on 7/28/13 waited a week was on back order, waited another week. Could NOT get their product. I ordered this one on 8/13/13 and received it on 8/19/13 that's 4 business days plus weekend. So very Happy Happy Happy!", 
    "I purchased the futon as an extra bed. It is comfortable and easy to move from room to room. I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "The mattress has been in place for 3 1/2 weeks. In that time, it was slept on 3 nights. It only puffed up to 4 1/2\", and the chemical smell is still there.", 
    "If this is going to be used for daily use I would go ahead and get a thicker mattress. It got me through 3 semesters but I really should of replaced it after two. Though I did enjoy it and it was a good product.", 
    "I bought this for a replacement mattress for the futon in my son's room. It appears to be a much better quality than the original one. It looks very nice and it is apparently very comfortable because he spends more nights sleeping on this than he does in his bed. I would recommend this product.", 
    "I bought this futon mattress to go on a futon frame I purchased last year from a local mattress store. The futon frame came with a mattress, but, the quality of their mattress was terrible. This futon mattress that I purchased from Overstock is so much better. I am very happy that I ordered it!", 
    "I looked at many and finally settled on this one and I am not sorry. I would buy again", 
    "Dnt know cuz I ended up having bed donated to my family after our house fire , so i sent them bak b4 I even opened them.", 
    "The futons arrived quickly and were vacuum-packed into a 1 foot thick package with the futon folded in four. They regained their 6-inch form in a few hours and are still thick and comfortable for both sitting and sleeping over a month later.", 
    "I bought this for my daughter's room at home, which is half office/half college student who only comes home a couple times a year room. It is definitely good quality, very heavy and thick. She slept on it a few times and said it was quite comfortable. I bought the dark green--very nice neutral color.", 
    "My girls fight over who gets to sleep on the extra bed. Bought this mattress to replace the one that came with the fouton (fifteen years ago) and love it! It didn't really have the bad smell that some others complained about. It took a couple of days to \"plump up\" but now it is very comfy and padded.", 
    "I am very satisfied with this matress, Got the 6 inch and am very glad with the thickness. Color is great. am using it without a cover as color is beautiful. I find it to be quite firm and comfortable. The first day or two there was a bit of a chemical smell so I aired it out on my balcony and not it is fine. This is a great matress and it's pretty amazing that the price is so low. I would for sure recommend it.", 
    "I purchased this mattress to be used over a full bed frame. It fits well and is acceptable. I used this configuration as my primary bed, after sleeping on an air mattress. Now, I can sleep well and I fell comfort.", 
    "The only drawback on this futon mattress is that once it is opened, it takes about 24 hours for it to decompress and it has a new smell order that can be described as chemically for days.", 
    "Very happy with this! Would recommend to a friend. Much larger and thicker than expected. Feels like other better quality futons. I am using this for every night sleeping and it definitely beats the air mattress!", 
    "We received this very quickly--within a couple days of ordering! This is a thinner cushion, but we use plywood underneath so you won't feel the slats of the futon. Slept on it after letting it \"fluff\" for a couple days--super comfortable. As a couch it works quite well, too. We were very impressed with the quality of the product as well as the price.", 
    "I am very happy with this purchase. It came within a week snd was in great condition. Like the other reviewers, I did notice a slight smell, but it was very slight and likely from manufacturing. The smell was gone within a day. This mattress is nice and firm. The color is a nice bright red. There are just strings where it looks like a button would be sown-- be careful one came loose and had to be tied back on (not easy). I've sat on it but haven't napped on it yet; it's comfy to sit on and I'm looking forward to a nap soon.", 
    "I was a little skeptical about ordering 2 full size mattresses and for $1 shipping. But I ordered them and was literally blown away. The arrived on time, well packaged, and were exactly what I wanted. We had built bunk beds and they fit to a tea. We have had guests sleep on them and they said they were very comfortable. I don't know what more I could ask for. Thank you very much.", 
    "Not bad futon.Should have upgraded to 8 in .but overall not bad.", 
    "What an easy way to purchase such an unexciting item to shop for. My first of many purchases from Overstock.", 
    "awesome product, was delivered on time and very easy to receive", 
    "I purchased a nice futon frame and ordered this futon mattress from overstock. And this is the most comfortable futon mattress i have ever slept on,and im 52 years old and i absolutely love it, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to sleep. It's not to firm and not to soft it is perfect. Thankyou overstock *****", 
    "Love the matress...but its about 2 inches short on a matress base we use on my sons play room that is also \"full size\"", 
    "I was extremely pleased with what I received for the cost1 One of the best purchases I have ever made online", 
    "It was shipped to my apartment and them I got upstairs because it came in a vacuum bag and as I placed on the futon it started to open up.", 
    "do not buy things from overstock....very difficult to return; in my case i couldn't at all. what a waste of *** bucks", 
    "bought this to replace 3 year old futon mattress, came shrink wrapped tightly, unwrapped laid on floor 24 hrs then flipped and let sit 24 hrs. filled out nicely with no detectable oder. fit old frame perfectly. this is used basicly as a bed in the rec room for my 18 yo daughter to crash on. had it about a month now and havent had any complaints yet.", 
    "color,size was wonderful and the price was even better.", 
    "Surprisingly comfortable for only being 6-inches thick. Nice rich red color. A bit overpriced but we got free shipping so that's great!", 
    "I bought this mattress to replace our previous mattress that was destroyed by a guest who wasn't actually potty trained! (Erg!) Although I was unhappy about the circumstances, I am SO GLAD we have this mattress now! It is thicker and more supportive than the original. I have slept on it many times and I sleep well and wake rested. (Sometimes hubby snores so I relocate-LOL!) My kids love to lounge on it to watch movies and often doze off and end up spending the night. Both kids have had guests who have slept on it as well. My niece didn't know we'd gotten a new mattress and when she stayed over she notice immediately that it felt different. Highly recommend!", 
    "I bought this for my 185 lb English Mastiff - this is a much better deal and half the price of dog beds his size. Well worth the money.", 
    "I used to use this, it was exactly the same. And I'm tiny woman but I could handle this myself, it was nice!", 
    "The mattress is superb. the color is what we asked for. Although the material stuffed in it is of good quality, its a bit heavy. It will be good for a futon with two flaps. i have a three flap futon so its kind of a bit difficult to fold the mattress into three flaps. Although as time progresses and the mattress looses its thickness it will be easy to handle for such futons. Overall its a very good deal for the money we paid.", 
    "Great product. Exactly as described .", 
    "I would recommend this to anyone, the price was good, the futon looks nice. I use it on my futon couch in the living room, it is the only couch in my house. It is very comfortable.", 
    "the mattress comes vacuum packed. the package states it can be 24 to 48 hours before it decompresses. we have had it three days, it still has not decompressed. it is too thin. should have ordered the 8 inch mattress", 
    "I was surprised at the price of the mattress and very inexpensive shipping. My only complaint would be the strong chemical smell but that seems to be dissipating now.", 
    "Delivered sooner than expected which was a plus! Good buy compared to other online sites. Mattress did have a funny manufactured smell at first but has faded.", 
    "This is a great mattress. It is more confortable than the mattress on my bed!", 
    "Product is very nice and comfortable. We are using it just for guests to sleep on for extra room. However the one thing that I noticed was that the mattress or the material in the mattress smells horrible. I have soaked it in febreze and still can not seem to get the smell out. I even let it sit outside for a couple days to try and air it out. This has been the downfall for me.", 
    "A nice mattress. Soft and well made. Easy to fold.", 
    "Initially, I was pleased with the futon, but my daughter was laying on the bed and began complaining of a headache. It has a petroleum-like odor. Tried airing it out and adding a protectve cover without success. Now, my daughter won't even go in the room.", 
    "The mattress arrived in a cardboard box that looked like it had been to iraq and back, the mattress was wrapped up and secured inside 2 seperate plastic bags one thicker than the other, upon opening the bags i discovered the mattress was taped with 2 inch clear extremely sticky tape 3 seperate wraps, upon removing the tape the glue residue remained on the mattress, i have yet to be able to remove it. The mattress has an odor of synthetic material, STILL 3 weeks later, the entire room smells of it. Would not order again!!!! The quality of mattress is good but the SMELL is not worth it.", 
    "Nice color , very full thick mattress , We got this for one of our guest rooms and the color is perfect! Anyone who sleeps on it will be very happy , it's thick and full !", 
    "This futon mattress is perfect for the price. We bought it to put on the bottom of a bunkbed for my son. The bunkbed frame has metal poles and I can barely feel them under the futon. We ordered black and it does show lint, but we bought a mattress cover and sheet to protect it. With free shipping, this deal can't be beat if you are in the market for a futon mattress. It arrived on the date stated.", 
    "The mattress arrived in a small box. The mattress had been packaged in a compressed plastic bag. After it was opened and left flat, it took about 3 days to puff up to the correct thickness. My only complaint is the \"chemical\" smell coming from the mattress.That took more than a week to get out. All in all I'm happy with it. It's to replace the futon mattress in the guest room. It folds into the sitting position fine and is comfortable to lay and sit on.", 
    "I love the quality of this futon. It is comfortable to sit and lay on.", 
    "Nice, cushiony futon mattress. The burgendy is more a brick red than maroon. The zippered cover is a nice addition.", 
    "I bought this for $$$ a few weeks ago. At that price, I'm completely satisfied with it; it fits nicely into a \"full-size\" futon frame and functions well both as a couch cushion and a mattress. It's particularly firm compared to most futon cushions.", 
    "No major complaints, except to agree with the other reviews that this arrives with a strong smell that takes some time to dissipate (as in over a week). Fine for occasional use as a couch and overnight guests.", 
    "The mattress is thick and quite comfortable. I think the filling is tufted cotton which is firmer than a foam filler. Overall It would provide comfortable sleeping for guests.", 
    "This futon mattress was well beyond my expectations! Very comfortable! I would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "Seem like it will be a good mattress. Unfortunately it has quite a chemical smell. I have been letting it air out in a room with windows open and it seems to be getting better but it is taking a while. I bought it for a guest room so I have the time to try to get rid of the odor otherwise I would be uphappy. Without the odor, I think this is a good buy and a good product.", 
    "I think your ad should be a bit more specific - like \"futon frame not included\". I thought I had really found a bargain with the whole thing. I am not unhappy with the mattress, though. A friend found a frame in great condition at a thrift store for $5 - issue turned out OK.", 
    "After laying the futon flat for 24 hours it fluffed out very nicely. It's a good mattress for the price. I would definitely recommend this for something looking for a good, affordable mattress.", 
    "A very comfortable mattress. Works well on my platform bed. I purchased a six inch futon mattress from a local retailer and it wasn't as comfortable this one, and it was more expensive.", 
    "I ordered the Ivory on a Thursday and had the mattress delivered the following Monday. It is very comfy and does not slide off frame or slouch. It is a little thinner looking than I thought it would be but it still is very comfy to sit on and lay on. The color is more of an off white than ivory.", 
    "Very comfortable and lovely blue. Had some hiccups in delivering the mattress on time, but other than that, very satisfied.", 
    "The mattress is stiff and firm, but that is what we wanted, so that it lasts longer. The color is great. The stitching looks good. It is a heavy mattress but just what was advertised. We let it lay open on the guest bed for a few days before placing it on the futon. It looks very nice. Overall we think it was a worthwhile product and would buy it again.", 
    "I did not have any back or neck pain after sleeping on the mattress. I slept soundly. This mattress will be ideal for my guests who come to stay in my home.", 
    "This is a great futon mattress. Very well made, quite heavy, comfortable", 
    "The only reason I had ordered this producte is because of the great reviews on this site. I orderd the color in Khaki and to my dissapointment overstock.com shipped me a black colored futon. There was no possible way for me to return the fution, due to needing a futon matress for guests that weekend. Also, to my dissapointement the cushion wasn't even that soft, i can still feel the futon frame under the futon matteress. I was very unsatisfed with my purchased and with the customer service that I recieved. This will be the last time I will order anything from overstock.com.", 
    "I am happy with this futon mattress. The color is light beige or cream. The cover is more sheer than I would like, you can see the stuffing on the inside through the cover. The buttons sewn on make the futon look much more expensive than it really is. I have only sat on it briefly and only plan to use it as a bed when guests need to sleep over. It seems comfortable to me. Fits full-size futon frame that I purchases separately. Great buy for only $$$ + SH. Overall, I was satisfied with the purchase and would recommend this futon mattress to anyone.", 
    "The quality of the mattress was what I had hoped for. I was emailed as soon as It shipped, and it arrived sooner than I expected.", 
    "Love it. It is worth to buy! Even through I have some difficulties with the shipment, at the end, I love the product.", 
    "Comfortable for the price. Nice color. Fast shipping. I am using it on the bottom bunk of the bunk beds.", 
    "Mattress was as described and meets my expectations. Actually delivered a day before expected. Great product! Great service!", 
    "The product was exactly what I expected however, it had a very strong chemical odor once I removed ot from the packaging. I have used 2 different fabric deoderizors and have a plug in type air freshener in the room but there is still a very distinct odor throughout my 1900 square foot home after 3 weeks.", 
    "I purchased this for my daughter, who wanted a futon to replace her bed. I have slept on it and to me it's not very comfortable, but my daughter loves it. My husband has also slept on it and he thought it was comfortable also. The mattress is a decent quality and I would recommend it.", 
    "this futon mattress is pretty comfortable, but I find myself changing position several times a night. I would probably buy a thicker mattress if I had to do it over. my husband had a severe allergic reaction after sleeping on it one night. we think it was treated with a fire-retardant chemical that he's allergic to. I used it for about a week before he tried it and was fine. the futon \"cover\" has a zipper, so you would think you'd be able to remove it to wash it, but the guts of the mattress aren't encased - so I don't know how you'd put it back together after the fact.", 
    "finally a mattress that can give you comfort. These are fantastic. Beautiful and economical for the price you pay.", 
    "The only thing is I was being careful so I would get the frame to. Oops not to careful No frame . That makes me mad I kept looking up Futons With frame and you get everything else but what you want. Be extra careful. That's how they get you to buy things then you have to send it back", 
    "hi i amlooking for klik klak matteress so this product only matteress or with bed price", 
    "All the advertising made it seem like it was the futon AND frame--it was just the mattress! I was very disappointed when it came. The caveat \"frame not included\" was there in the description in small print, but I go by the picture---felt cheated!"
