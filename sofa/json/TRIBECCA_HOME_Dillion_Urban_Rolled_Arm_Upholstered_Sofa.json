    "The sofa was super easy to put together. It seemed almost too easy initially, but it's holding up fine so far. I still really like the look of the sofa, but the seat cushions are very stiff. It's a little shallow with regards to sitting with your legs up at all, but it's nice that you can remove the back cushions for added room. Probably won't be the couch I would go to for a comfy night watching movies, but it has grown on me."
