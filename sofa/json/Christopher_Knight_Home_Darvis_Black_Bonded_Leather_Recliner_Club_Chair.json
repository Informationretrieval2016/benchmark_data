    "I actually went ahead and bought one chair just to make sure that it was something that I wanted to move forward with before investing in another one. When you usually read \"assembly\" on a product, it worries you that it is cheap roan Ikea type product. Upon the arrival of this chair, it was everything but. The assembly was simply putting the pack of the chair on (which probably cut down shipping costs) & it was ready for use. I am 6'2'', and I fit into the chair great. The seat of the chair is actually quite deep, and when I am fully reclined it is as comfortable as any other furniture that I have in my home. It is sturdy, and the leather has a much richer look than what the price of the chair actually was. I bought the 2nd matching chair after one week of use. I highly recommend.", 
    "Good quality, comfortable chair. Great size for a smaller room. Bought mine for the office, and I love having it. I get compliments from visitors and coworkers alike. Everyone says it is comfortable and stylish. Also, it's not obvious that it's a recliner in an office environment - it just looks like a nice club chair.", 
    "It took me 30 minutes to assemble and the instructions were very clear and easy to read. The chair looks great and is very comfortable so far, day 1. Has a chic look.", 
    "This chair is nice-looking and small in size. It is comfortable enough - not super comfy like big squishy recliners. It reclines waaay back, so you are almost in a lying position. So if you intend to take naps in it, perfect, as you'll be looking at the ceiling. If you want to read or watch TV, you'll need a pillow to prop up your head. My main issue is that after about a month of light use, the side of the chair caved in. My son mentioned that he'd heard a screw fall out previously. I've shoved it away in the guest room, for my husband to see if it's reparable, but have decided to get a nicer recliner for the den. I'll keep this one for a light-use area, like the guest room.", 
    "My 88 yr old mother loved this chair because it does not look like a lounge chair. That is where the love stopped. The chair does not have a handle on the side to lift up the leg portion. You have to push back with your arms on the arm rest. She did not have the power to do that. Also since she is short 5'2\" when she sat back against the back portion of the chair, her feet come off the floor and were sticking straight out in front of her. She kept slidding off the seat since it was so slippery. When put together the back portion of the chair was crooked. We sent it back and got a full refund because of the crooked back. Overstock was great about all the return process. If your strong and taller this is a good chair.", 
    "I am 5 ft 11 and in the recline position my head hangs off the top of the chair. So I would plan in lounging in this chair if you're anywhere near 5 ft 11 or taller. Outside of that, for $***, it's a pretty good value.", 
    "Fits well in my small guest room & comfortable enough for an afternoon nap.", 
    "Originally purchased for my young adult son's bedroom for him to use while gaming. I had it in my living room for a while and considered buying additional ones to keep there.", 
    "Lovely little chair perfect for a cozy corner reading area. I love it plain and simple, well made, wonderful price, if I had another cozy nook, I would buy another.", 
    "I needed a leather chair for my home office area. Something to use on an occasional basis. The chair arrived quickly and it was a breeze to assemble. Great value for what I needed.", 
    "I ordered this chair because I have severe back issues. It sits next to my bed so I can sleep in it when my back acts up. It's a perfect fit.", 
    "Nice small recliner, it has a longer seat and arm figuration that is strange looking. Have to have a pillow behind you when sitting in it, but ok when in the recline position. I have had this chair for near 8 months and it is used daily and has stood up to the use. Used by both husband and myself.", 
    "I was about to order two other chairs from a furniture store but then decided to take a look at my favorite place to shop for what suits my taste! I saw these club chairs with recliners with backs high enough to support my back. I wanted a green instead of black but I am glad I selected this one. Really nice!", 
    "Like the chair, A recliner but doesn't look like one", 
    "I am very pleased with my chair purchase. The leather is good quality, especially for the price. I put it together by myself in ten minutes. It blends in with our very expensive furniture well. this is the second Christoper Knight chair I have purchased this year. I like the design of his collections.", 
    "Please every one do not buy this chair. Not exactly what you see.", 
    "This broke after we sat in maybe three times. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. My husband had to put a nail in to fix it. Thumbs down on this product.", 
    "I bought two of these in Sept. '13 and by May of '15 one has broken in a way that cannot be repaired -- just from regular use. The seat caved down on one side, with the bottom support board popping out from its nails. The other one is doing just fine, but I wonder how long it will last. Getting only a year and a half with normal use doesn't feel like a good deal. (My 3-star review is the average of 1 star for the broken chair and 5 for the unbroken chair)", 
    "Item has falling apart at the seat what do you recommend.", 
    "Extremely easy to put together..stylish and looks great. Will purchase another.", 
    "Love love love this chair. Easy to put together, and reclines way back. First time I sat in it,I fell asleep. I call it \" the devil's chair\" because if I sit in it after work, that's it! I'm either going to sleep (unintentionally) or I'm just not getting up. Looks great too. Hate it. It's being propped up by books. I had earlier tried to reinforce it with longer bolts when I first noticed issues with it. Of course after some time, the particle board wood split. It's still darned comfortable, but the day is coming when I'm literally going to be on the floor. I bought two, the second for my son who is short and slight of frame. I just saw his was coming apart and he never reclines it and didn't even sit in it for about the first four months- so it's not nearly as used as mine but still,I just put some books under his. So I'm looking for another chair just a year later. The comfort and recline angle of this chair has totally ruined other recliners for me. I just wish this one was better built. I swear if I could super glue this thing I'd keep it.so sad.Love it. But I hate it too. So conflicted", 
    "I purchased 4 of these for my home theater room. They're great for the size of my theater which is approx. 15z20. The only thing that I can complain about is that when they are in the reclined position, there is little to no head support. So, you'll need to use a small pillow to support your head an neck if you wish to view the screen while reclined for any sustained length of time. Assembly was a breeze. It comes in 2 major pieces. The seat and the back rest. Assembly consists of attaching the back rest to the reclining apparatus (no tools required). And then screwing in the feet (no tools required). We're actually thinking about purchasing a couple of these chairs for our living room.", 
    "Best seat in the house. Comfortable recliner that looks slim and trim - has no relationship to Archie Bunker's chair.", 
    "no instructions were included, legs go on easy & it looked like the back just slides on, but it didn't lock in place & rattled, finally figured it out.got the back locked in tight, but tilts back while in the upright position. needs a pillow when reclining to watch tv. can't beat the price. seat &back are firm & the arms are low witch I like. the loose flap in the back has velcro on in but isn't long enough to reach the velcro on thebottom of the chair. still can't beat the price.", 
    "As stated by an earlier reviewer, this chair is somewhat unusual in that there is only one reclining position and that is rather sharp or further back than usual. However, it is nothing a throw pillow can't fix. Also this is not a wall away style and must be kept a distance from the wall to recline, which can be a problem if one does not want the chair that far from the wall when not reclining. Overall, it appears well made and is handsome, and I like the four independent legs rather than a \"runner\" or \"spider\" style leg. I also like the space saver appearance which is useful in a smaller space where a standard recliner would not look well.", 
    "The assembly was very easy and I like the style of the chair. It has however the most uncomfortable seat. I am not a large person(135lbs) but the seat already lost its shape and is too uncomfortable to sit in for any length of time. I will probably try to find a seat cushion so the chair won't be a total loss.", 
    "Relatively easy to put together for a 73 year old in good health. The back is slanted back in such a way that it is only really comfortable in the reclining position and not when trying to sit upright. Looks exactly like the picture but is smaller then I expected. Looks good but doesn't quite meet my needs in the den.", 
    "So far this has been an excellent buy - all that I could hope for.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Leather looks great. Sturdy.", 
    "Great chair for my apartment. Price was outstanding", 
    "Purchased for hubby to use in bedroom. Good price. He's satisfied with item", 
    "comfy, great for corner space. only negative is it is hard to keep it in the fully reclined position - pops back to medium recline unless you push hard and lay still. not a big problem. great for the price.", 
    "Using a 3rd. bedroom for a media room was my idea, purchasing the Christopher Knight recliners are perfect. I got a pair of two, and it completed the look that I wanted and I had the space to recline. The end result was a perfect home media room.", 
    "This came in a box and was easy to assemble. You drop the back on and screw in the legs. So EASY anyone can do it!!! LOVE MY NEW CHAIRS!!", 
    "Looks good. There is not a \"lock\" on the most reclined position making it hard for me to stay reclined. I'm a pretty average woman. Guess 128lbs isn't enough to keep it down.", 
    "This recliner is simply amazing. I love the streamline design and look. I ordered this for my husband and he loves it! It truly looks like all the other real leather furniture pieces in the room and compliments well. Extremely comfortable. It's design works well in limited space. It arrived packaged beautifully, and set up in a matter of minutes! We are EXTREMELY impressed with every facet of this recliner; especially with the price! A real bargain! Considering ordering more for a home theater; we are THAT satisfied! (This was my first Overstock experience and I am a very happy consumer.) I love their commitment to excellence. We had no idea what to expect as this is the first piece of furniture we have ordered online. Because of this experience, I will be ordering more. YOU CANT BEAT THIS PRICE!", 
    "I love the size and it arrived 2 days after I ordered it. Amazing. Great price, too (look for % off coupon online).", 
    "This chair offers good value for what it is. It is comfortable for me but it isn't large and a big or tall person (over 6') might not find it so easy to recline or sit in.The leather is attractive, has a nice, subtle sheen and is of pretty good quality. It is perfect for my office where I have a t.v. and watch programs often.", 
    "We were searching for a reclining chair that wasn't huge. This one fit right where we needed it! With 2 kids climbing on it, it seems to be well made and should hold up for quite a few years. This is currently in our living room, and used daily.", 
    "My clients love it say it's very comfortable and it doesn't take up a lot of room so a good score for me thx", 
    "I was surprised when the package came as it was so small, but once unpacked and put together it is just so perfect. Not a big chair which fit quite nicely in the space. Very comfortable albeit a bit stiff, but what a deal for the price. My husband is over 6 feet and he has already fallen asleep in this chair. Well done Overstock!", 
    "nice comfortable chair - great for small spaces - easy to assemble", 
    "I think it's comfortable for lounging and watching movies or for reading a book. It looks sleek and high end considering the price", 
    "This goes well with the other furniture in my bedroom. Great quality.", 
    "Not too big, fits well in the room. Beautiful leather, very sleek and stylish. Love it!", 
    "Bought for an accent chair in my office. Great for relaxing after hours", 
    "This chair is smaller than anticipated. Nice chair however.", 
    "Was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of this chair. Very compact and not overly large like most recliners. Well suited for our purposes!", 
    "Excellent product comfortable and fits well in room. Meets my expectations.", 
    "I have been looking for a leather recliner that would fit in a smaller space, with great quality and a good price for years. I saw this on overstock and gave it a try. It is everything I hoped for and more. Beautifully made, looks expensive, and fits perfectly in the space. love it. Highly recommend, in fact I got 2 of my friends to buy it too!", 
    "This is a great recliner. Very sleek so it goes well with my decor -- big and puffy just doesn't work for me. I love that it looks like a club chair when not reclined. It's very comfortable and the price was just right. Some might find the footrest too short but it's just perfect for me.", 
    "Good quality. It is small but comfortable. I would buy this product again.", 
    "Kind of small but otherwise nice", 
    "This all leather recliner is sleek and modern looking and does not take up a huge amount of space. Looks and feels like top quality and what a deal for $199!!! I don't write reviews very often but this was worth taking the time to share! I love it and in my smallish apartment is perfect! Could be a great home theater chair as well..love that modern look!", 
    "First thing is it won't to stay in full recline.The 2nd it it broke apart on the left side and it is only 2 months old.", 
    "Small apartment size but still a recliner. All the guys that come over love it and want one.", 
    "Purchased for my son in his room. He loves this chair. Easy to assembly.Looks good in his room. He's happy, I'm happy", 
    "Goth this for our basement comfortable. Will be getting another one", 
    "I would like to give it 4.5 stars taking a half star off because it's a little bit too deep for me so I find myself often slipping in it which can be annoying. The fix to that problem was putting a small decorative pillow behind me. It looks nice and fixes the slipping issue. The reason I went ahead with five stars is that for the money, I don't think I could find another chair that looks so nice and is as comfortable. This is a great chair for the money and I highly recommend it!", 
    "We got 2 of these chairs after reading other reviews & thought they'd go great in our office. They do look really nice for the space we have. I knew once reclined they would be kind of short to rest your head based on other reviews, but once I got them all set up that's really the only thing I was disappointed about. So I knew what I was getting, but now that they're all set up I really wished they were taller to relax back in! Oh well :) I just grab a pillow & it's just fine. It's just not lazy boy comfy! I would purchase these again!", 
    "This black leather recliner is a compact model. Just perfect for the smaller space that I had. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "Bought 2 chairs a few months ago. One of them, the arm has already broken already. They aren't the most comfortable chairs either. They are more for looks than anything if you aren't going to really sit in them and use them a lot.", 
    "Easy to put together. Look great in house. Little small for my husband but not for him anyway. My girlfriends and I love them they all think I should buy 2 more.", 
    "It's small which is good for tight spaces, but not very comfortable and the pleather is cheap.", 
    "Bought it for my mother but there's no handle. You grasp the arms, plant your feet, and use arms/abs/legs to push back. My mother is weak and short so she needs a spring mechanism. Hard to return after assisted living facility had opened and discarded box so she kept it. But she has to use it with help. Very disappointing. It Looks great and seems to be of decent quality.", 
    "too long for a short person, leather is very slick", 
    "Not solid, move side to side, not going to last long.", 
    "Easy assembly, quick shipment and really pulls the room together, Dude !", 
    "Didn't have much room so I thought this chair would fit the space. It works well in the living room and really matched my other furniture.", 
    "This was purchased for a bedroom, so the smaller size was preferred. It is comfortable enough to fall asleep in!", 
    "My son loves it space saver", 
    "Great for kids room. Great for adults though too. Put it in my sons room when redecorating it's perfect for Kleins great fits in tight spaces.", 
    "Nice chair. Came nicely packaged. No flaws in the product. Functions very nicely in my computer den.", 
    "amazingly well made for the price, we love them.", 
    "Loved these chairs for my TV room . I bought 2 !", 
    "Very comfortable, and a good deal. Love it!! Arrived on time and was an easy assembly.", 
    "Could not believe how impressive these were for the price. So easy to assemble. Extremely comfortable. Do not look like recliners, which worked for me as i did not want overstuffed chairs. These sre sleek. Look great in our library. I bought two.", 
    "Bought this for my 93 year old mother. She needed a new chair so I sent her photos of several and this is the one she picked. It is the style (narrow arms) and color (black) that she had been looking for but couldn't find in the stores near where she lives. She does wish there was a lever to recline the chair but her last chair was the same so it is only a minor complaint. She is very happy with the chair.", 
    "Very easy to assemble. Looks good, works well. Comfortable to recline in.", 
    "Bought this for my office for a great little snooze. Works and looks good", 
    "Super comfortable chair. Easy to fall asleep in. Would but again", 
    "Bought two. Very reasonably priced and look and feel way more expensive than I paid.", 
    "great size recliner for today's smaller habitats. comfortable, clean lines, good value.", 
    "But for short people. The back only comes to my neck and I'm 5'4\",", 
    "OK these are pretty small recliners and don't know how they will stand the test of time. I would say a 200lb person is about all they would accommodate comfortably. But they fit my space well and look good!", 
    "I had to replace a slipper chair I purchased 10 years ago from Overstock. My boyfriend asked me to get a chair with arms, as never liked my old chair (I loved it, but it was time to replace it). This is perfect in my little loft. There is no unsightly handle on the side - it moves just by body weight. Love it! Looks good and the scale is perfect.", 
    "It looks far more expensive then it was. The delivery was very fast. I'm really impressed", 
    "I thought the chair was very comfortable, easy to assemble, and nice looking. We ordered two.", 
    "I broke my leg and needed a horizontal recliner for my office. It's a business office so no overstuffed. I am 6' tall so my feet hang over the bottom about 5 inches, but that is really not a problem - you might need something bigger if you are taller. I was suspicious at first because the chair seems almost compact, but if you need a simple good looking recliner (I got black) without a lot of space available, this might just fit the bill. Price/performance is very good.", 
    "I am very pleased with this little chair. Its comfortable for me and its was a great price", 
    "I honestly couldn't be happier with this fantastic chair. It is stylish and comfortable. It was so nice to find a recliner that didn't take up so much space. And for the price? WHAT A DEAL! I have taken many naps in this chair already, and always wake up feeling quite rested. Also, the assembly was very easy.", 
    "I enjoy this chair so much it's very stylish and comfortable", 
    "Not as wide as I would like it but comfortable just the same. Not a great sleeper though", 
    "This chair fits perfectly in our bedroom, good purchase for the money we spent, you may need a pillow or two for your neck when you recline. My husband is tall, and he enjoys sitting in the chair.", 
    "My husband LOVES recliners and I find most of them not to be very stylish, but, this one is perfect! Does not look like a recliner, just looks like a very cool club-chair! Goes perfectly with our decor and you can not beat the price, it is good quality also! Love it!!!", 
    "this club chair size black leather recliner is perfect for a small room . i is very well made and attractive . it is quite comfortable while sitting up or reclining and inexpensive .", 
    "it does look good....but it is not comfortable. I knew it would be small and glad it is, but the quality and craftmanshiip are lacking.", 
    "The chair was delivered in good time. It was simple to assemble. It is comfortable when in reclining position. Don't like the look of the leather back hanging out when in reclining position. Luckily we are able to have it in a area where it's back is to the wall. It looks fine when in upright position. It is a good value for the price. It's not the highest quality but was not expecting it to be for the price.", 
    "I bought a pair of them, instead of a matching love seat to go with my new contemporary grey upholstered sofa....It looks amazing and we actually fight over who gets to sit in them. They are perfect.....comfortable, priced well and very stylish. They are not the normal bulky, unattractive recliners. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them!!!!", 
    "What a dynamite chair! This chair fits perfectly in a small room. My son is 6'4, 220 lb, and I bought it for a gaming chair for his small bedroom that has a king sized bed, night stand and large chest of drawers. The leather is fantastic. The recline position is perfect to relax and recline back to view and interact playing games, watch television, or reading. This chair has all the comfort of full size recliners that is why I mentioned his size. It isn't bulky as fullsize recliners and has the comfort. The arms are low so you can rest elbows and extend your arms. It was a very wise purchase. The only thing you had to do was to screw on the feet of the chair.", 
    "A little on the small size but I knew that due to description. Just hoped someone had measured wrong. lol But wonderful.", 
    "Nice small recliner, it has a longer seat and arm figuration that is strange looking. Have to have a pillow behind you when sitting in it, but ok when in the recline position. I have had this chair for near one month. I needed a small chair for my office and this fits perfectly. A great buy for the price.", 
    "This recliner fit perfectly in our family room. Its easy to move around for cleaning underneath and its very sleek looking and comfortable might consider ordering another one", 
    "This chair is compact, comfy and exceeds my expectations for the price paid.", 
    "The chairs arrived and were simply to put together. They are lovely I have a small office and they fit perfectly. They are firm in case anyone is needing that information. Some may need a lumbar pillow due to the firmness.", 
    "I got it for a friend who is 6'4\" and he couldn't recline because his head was above the headrest area. For me the chair is fine for reclining but I always feel like I am sliding forward because the seat seems tilted to the front just a slight amount. However when reclined the chair is fine. I recommend this chair to a young family just starting out because of the value .", 
    "This is a good chair for me to watch TV but not for full recline. I had to get a couple of 18x18 inch pillows to prop up my back and head in the semi-recline position. I am average height 5'4\" senior woman. I replaced an oversized recliner with this chair because I was having trouble getting in and out of it and this smaller size discourages ALL my dogs from joining me to watch TV lol.", 
    "I would still recommend this product to someone, but looks most be precedent to comfort. The chairs are a bit firm and there is no lumber support. However the chairs are functional and look great.", 
    "Very nice chair for the money. Fits perfect in the smaller bedroom and is great for relaxing.", 
    "The chair was very easy to assemble. The style is clean and versatile. It's great with a pillow at your back if you're on the shorter side as the seat is a little on the deep side. The reclining mechanism is smooth. The chair is rich looking. I love it!", 
    "This is a very good value for the price. It isn't butter soft Italian leather but again it doesn't cost over *** either. It is very comfortable and just the right size for my smallish den. I needed a recliner with a small footprint. It has become my favorite spot in the house.", 
    "I received this chair yesterday and had it assembled in a matter of minutes with no tools--just had to screw on the legs and jam on the back. This chair looks incredibly fancy for a great price, and it's a great size! The seat is a little bit \"long\" in that I ended up sticking a pillow behind my back when I was sitting upright, but by the end of the night I had kicked back and was slouching like a happy couch potato. I can't believe this chair was so cheap! My roommates had guessed it must have cost at least twice as much as it actually did. Highly recommended!", 
    "I would highly recommend this recliner, as it is not only very comfortable but a beautiful piece of furniture.", 
    "Recommended with caution. The quality of the chair is pretty decent for the price, but as stated in other reviews...it is SMALLER is scale than average. It looks very nice from the front and reclines nicely. It is also fairly easy to assemble, but you need two people. One cosmetic drawback is that there is a flap of fabric/leather hanging from the back so that it looks rather cheap if you have it exposed. CAUTION: Make sure you read description carefully or have an alternate plan to resell in case you change your mind. Returning it will cost almost as much as the price of one chair.", 
    "Nice chair for the price. My dogs wont sit in it but so far they are working out well.", 
    "Two minutes to assemble .. Let's Go Mets ! J E T S JETS JETS JETS !"
