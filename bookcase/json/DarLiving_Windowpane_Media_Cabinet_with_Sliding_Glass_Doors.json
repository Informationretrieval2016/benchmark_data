    "It took 4 people to put this together, had to wood glue every piece, then nail and glue again. It is very poorly made. Will neverbuy from that company again. I bought 3 and gave two away to Good Will.", 
    "This cabinet has lots of shelves and everything is viewable and easily accessible. Good sturdy construction and fits any decor.", 
    "OK quality especially for the price but I wouldn't get too excited about it...", 
    "CABINET WAS WELL PACKAGED WHEN WE RECEIVED IT..NO CRACKS OR SCRATCHES..WENT TOGETHER WITH NO PROBLEMS..JUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS..I WILL BE GETTING ANOTHER ONE WHEN I'M DONE UNPACKING FROM MY MOVE. VERY GOOD PRICE ON THIS CABINET...", 
    "Upon building you will soon find out in is very cheaply made. Even the hardware does not lock and hold pieces and be very careful with the assembly of the product. The shelf looks great, but don't try to move it once assembled. Liquid nails will be your best friend when trying to put this together. Save your money *** and buy a better quality product.", 
    "Product was has described and went together easily. left side sliding door did not close all the way but after I added our DVD's and we did some leveling all is well.", 
    "Gave it away horrible..It was very small for the price.The depth of it was only meant for small nic nacs.And it was top heavy.I had to tell my Grandkids to not go near it.Cause it would tip over.", 
    "The color is more of a birch color (no gold tones as shown in the photo) and the quality, or lack there of, reminds me of \"furniture\" families on a tight budget bought forty years ago - the exterior is a vinyl picture of wood grain and was peeling on some edges. It goes together fairly well, but the screws with which one attaches the back panel (Which provides most of the stability to keep it upright) are hard to start - not pre-drilled on the back of the cabinet, and are much too short. I used 1\" finishing or wire nails, which made it much more solid feeling. I almost did not assemble it since it looked so cheap, but the trouble to return it made me decide to do so. It is okay, but could be so much better.", 
    "We had a couple pieces break while we were putting the cabinet together. We had to use glue to put the pieces back together. The cabinet does not feel very sturdy. Not worth the price in my opinion.", 
    "This media cabinet is not worth the money the doors are heavy and if you don't have it on a even floor such as wood it will lean forward unless you use the wall mounting kit.The one I recieved isn't even close to the color in the picture it is much darker. Also when you put it together you will need 2 people because until you attache the back it's not sturdy. Also the caster holes pre-drilled didn't all line up and had to be re-drilled before screwing them in place.I don't recommend it.", 
    "Fairly good quality. Looks nice after put together.", 
    "I use mine for a catch all in the hall. I have two of them now. I know if I put something in there I know it is small and needs to be put away properly soon. Because it is so slim ( sticks out just 10 ins) I can put a candle on it under the smoke detector and will be safe. Doors slide very easily and you can see what you need without open so much for everyone to see. The color is a light soft wood that goes with anything I love both of them. Such a valuable piece of furniture for a good price. I waited for a sale.", 
    "I was looking for a light colored media cabinet to match the rest of the furniture in my den and found this one. It was easy to put together, matches everything great and there was tons of room for all my media. A great purchase!", 
    "perfect cabinet bought 2 for my sister, assembly was spot on with directions. great price!", 
    "This cabinet blended in very well with our furniture and was very easy to put together. We are amazed at the storage capacity and the ability to view the DVD/CD titles clearly through the window panes. Perfect item.", 
    "Very happy with this product . It was exactly what I needed to keep all my disk and tapes in .", 
    "outer strip of board pealing off", 
    "This is a nice looking cabinet that doesn't take up a lot of room, but has lots of storage. I was pleasantly surprised at the color, as it matched the beige color in my Tuscan floor. The quality is perfect for its intended use, but I think you could quite easily use it for extra pantry space if the need arose. Assembly is very fast, with little to no difficulties"
