    "I received this sofa bed / couch few weeks ago and its worked perfectly for me! The love the look and overall feel of the style, and I think the actual product looks even better than in the pictures. there is anumber of things I want to share with all of you who read this review: 1. The price is perfect for a sofa bed, lets face it, you don't want to pay so much for a \"sofa bed\", but at the same time you don't want a junk that makes you upset ever time you see it. 2. I don't know about you, but I love fast services, and I receiv this item within a week I order it. For people who really need it urgent, ordering this sofa bed will centainly help. You will receiv your sofa fast with out needing to pay for additional shipping chaarges to make it faster. 3. Hustle free delivery, UPS delivered the sofa bed / couch within a week of my order, and it arrived in good condition, more importantly, its easy to receive and handle by one person. And you don't have to deal and wait for the big truck delivery guy to call you and with all the complicated delivery procedures. 4. Setup and assembly was a breeze, I belive this is the biggest advantage of buying this item. The sofa was contained in a box that is only half the size of an usual sofa bed box, this is due to its clever design of souble folding the sofa bed. Usually they are the size of a mattress, but this one can be half fold, so its very easy to move the box around and enter the doorways and so on. It was then easy to set up the sofa bed by attaching the legs. 5. It's a little firm, but still conmfortable and should soften after a while. more importantly, the frame is well-covered, so nothing sticks out and hurt you body anywhere, unlike most of the sofa beds. It's comfortable to sit or sleep on for any one smaller and 6 feet. It's might be a little low or short for people taller than that. 6. Again, the size and quality is good for a sofa bed and its fits weel in all rooms. And it looks just like the photo which is modern and good looking. Overall, if you need a small sofa bed / couch and wanted to pay for a fair price and want something that's simple with good quality, in my opinion, there is no better choice than this one!", 
    "I have to say this sofa bed is a super bargain. The quality is really good when considering the price. Although not genuine leather, but certainly was using a higher standard PU, so the fabric has very nice feel and looks great. I can also tell the material is durable, so this time it should last me a while. One other thing, I think this is the best looking contemporary sofa bed that Overstock offers, so I just brought it. No regret!", 
    "This sofa bed / futon is a winner! Great looking and funtional. The quality is top notch, especially when consider the price. No sofa bed I have ever tried is really soft, when they soft, they are clumsy. This sofa bed is still at the firm side initially, but not bad. The material is not real leather, but its a really nice PU. Lets face it, how can you get real leather for the price we paid for, also, the real leather is difficult to maintain, and is just not practical for a sofa bed. So all you want is a sofa bed with good PU, and luckily this one does come with a comparatively good PU that is softer, tougher and better looking. The material used for this sofa bed felt so wonderful and expensive. The overall quality is excellent, I love it.", 
    "I just moved into my new home and have not purchased a bed yet. I figured that I would use this sofa bed futo for the time being because the price is reasonable and its looks good. I use it both as bed and couch for a few weeks now and I guess I am not in a hurry to get the bed any more. This sofa bed is really comfortable and awesom durable. Now I can take my time to look for a bed. No matter what, I am definitely keeping this sofa bed! I also like the fact that this sofa bed doesn't sit too low off the ground as the common problem for the sofa beds. It was very easy to assemble, only takes 5 minutes to attach the legs. I am very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "On a bed like this there is nowhere to tuck any bedding in except possibly the wall so i was delighted to discover that while it is slightly shorter and wider than a twin bed, twin sheets still fit it quite well. our guest was 5'7\" and stayed for 4 nights. she was also quite tired each night so when i asked her about her sleep she commented that she noticed the seam but fell asleep almost instantly. the seam in question is the indention where the bottom and back of the couch meet that exists on all couches like this. It did not bother our guest but if you are a little paranoid, like me, about the comfort of your guests you might consider picking up a twin mattress pad. i am exceedingly happy with this purchase", 
    "I was in the market for a sofa bed for my son's bedroom but wanted a product that could move with him for years to come. I found this on Overstock, but I was leery of buying furniture here. I read, reread and finally pulled the trigger and COULD NOT BE MORE PLEASED! Even if it's a MADE IN CHINA item, it is perfect! My long-legged son will lounge perfectly on this for many, many years!!! It does sit low to the ground, but VERY COMFORTABLE to sit on. EASY assembly and very light. My husband put the legs on in under 15 minutes and it was ready to go. My son begged for a futon from Walmart but they looked so darn cheap. I waited and purchased this with a 10% off coupon and it arrived in days! TA DA!! Happy costumer!!!", 
    "This is a very comfortable sofa bed. I mean, used both as a sofa or bed. The design is very strong and the base is very very stable. I like the fact there are 6 legs to provide good support. And also the modern look matches well to my other contemporary furniture. Good value for money.", 
    "I hastily bought this to try and furnish my new condo, as I have family and friends visiting from out of state in a few weeks. The price, and mostly positive reviews attracted me to this style sofa bed. I've always been leery about buying furniture online, but I don't really regret this purchase. The item was well packaged upon delivery. As always, do be careful about opening up the box especially. The sofa basically comes out of the box and all you have to do is screw in the legs with two L-wrenches (provided). It is a little low to the ground, but that doesn't matter much to me. I must admit I only laid on it once to test it out and it seemed fine. I have a memory foam pad that I can always throw on there for guests and it will be fine. Taller people will have their feet dangle though. Anyway, the only negative I can say about this, is that I did notice a small defect in the leatherette on one side of the back rest (top left). It wasn't a snag or a tear, it was just a defect in the leatherette where it looked like it folded over a little or maybe even melted a little. I promptly called Overstock the same day and we worked out a resolution that I was happy with.", 
    "Do not waste your money on this futon. The backs do not line up it sits at a weird angle and bows a little in the middle (when no one is sitting on it). I guess it would be OK for a kids room if you don't love them, as it is very uncomfortable to sit on for any amount of time and I sit on a metal work bench stool all day at work. So buy at your own risk as it. looks like I'll have to spend XX dollars to return this abomination of a futon to overstock.I will rethink about buying from overstock after this.", 
    "I like every thing about this couch but mostly the look of it. Great for smaller area, so I put in my den to sitting and watch tv. Used it once for my guest, they like it. I was surprised when I receive the item, because its was folded into a smaller item and put in a big box, that makes transportation and moving this item much easier. More surprise how good the quality of the fabric it has for the price. And again, the look is great. So many good surprised that made me a happy customer!", 
    "I was very happy when I received the couch. It was easy to put up, I only needed some help flipping it on the feet after I assembled it.I need something that can be changed into a futon so visiting friends can use it at night. After two weeks of only using it at night for sleeping, a huge (1/4 of one seat) has sunken into the bottom. Since the couch can not be detached, there is no easy way to \"refill\" the empty spot. My friend was 130lb and her weight was not on a single spot on the couch when she sleeps (obviously). This is a very disappointing experience.", 
    "I replace the sofa bed in my apartment at least once a year, because they never last long, but that is the nature of this type of furniture. I had this sofa bed for almost a year now, and its still going strong, I and happy and surprised. I has some futon, the type that you have a frame and mattress separately, they never works well for me, and they never look good. This one works much better and looks great. So if you are looking for a big proper sofa, don't get this item, otherwise if you are looking for a good sofa bed, I assure you this is one of the best I ever owned.", 
    "This is a great piece of furniture. Sleek look with clean lines, yet does not feel cheap at all. The fabric quality is really good and the cushion is fairly comfortable. As a gift, it goes perfectly in my son's new apartment home, he loves it. Just need to be aware that this sofa bed is more of a loveseat than a full size sofa, so its kind of like in between. But it just fits us perfectly. The bottom line is it looks great, and its comfortable. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "Got one in white too and both broke :(", 
    "I was looking for a decent futon/couch for my new, but small studio apartment; this was the answer. Great price and quality! Free shipping through Overstock(Awesome Sauce!) I have lower back issues and the firmness of this couch is just what the doctor ordered. When converted to a bed; it fits full size sheets. A little small for your friends 6' and over. Overall great product.", 
    "Good quality, great low price, comfy compare to other sofa bed or futon I had before, and nice modern style. I am happy with what I got, and definitely would buy it again.", 
    "I agreed to the good reviews, this sofa bed is a great bargain. The quality is really good for the price. For example, the upholstery is not real leather, but it's a higher graded PU that looks and feels like real leather. And I am glad the look of the actual sofa is exactly as shown in the pictures. This is a real deal and I am very pleased.", 
    "My son sleeps on this when he comes home from college on the weekends. He said it is comfortable. He said he sleeps very good on it. Had to replace another couch that was infested with bed bugs. Got this because it has no where for the bed bugs to get on.", 
    "This is not the product as shown on the picture. The center leg is not round, cheap fabrics, and cushions wear out very quickly (had it for we few weeks and already the middle is drooping in). But for the price you can't expect that much. Only good thing was the fact that it came very fast.", 
    "Love it for the money it was great and easy to put together.", 
    "Looks fairly nice. Assembly is quick and painless. Wears down quickly with a decent amount of use, unfortunately. Too low to the ground, but still not bad to sit on. However, very uncomfortable sleeping on. I guess overall it's a fair buy for the price and for short term use. But if you are hoping for something as your main couch, and/or sleeping option, I'd go another route.", 
    "This came fast. Easy to put together. Not comfortable to sit on and impossible to sleep on. Overpriced for the quality.", 
    "Love my couch and so my guests when they sleep over , It's firm, comfortable, easy to set it up and back down, so easy, love the color, love the look, very modern and sturdy , great deal , highly recommend it \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb", 
    "Only issue is that it doesn't have as much cushion as you may think.", 
    "Based on the reviews, we decided to try it and it's worked perfectly in our guest bedroom slash yoga room which is the smallest room in our house. It's got really clean lines, exceptionally easy to set up (just attaching the legs -- the hardest part was getting it out of the box by myself). It's very firm and my friend spent ten days on it and loved it. I also followed other reviews which said that twin sheets fit -- which they do and I got a twin mattress pad and it fit well. She said she couldn't feel the seam. It is quite short -- so if you have tall (over say 5' 9\") folks, they'd have to curl up, but for the average woman, it's just fine.", 
    "I've had this sofa for less than 2 years , it's barely been used and one of the seat cushions sagged completely so now it's useless. For the same price there are much better sofas out there, don't buy this one.", 
    "Bad quality product. Waste of money. It is uncomfortable and foam sinked in almost immediately. I feel like I trew money away on this item", 
    "It was smaller than we expected. It is more of a loveseat size. Also, the cushion collapsed in the middle so we have a hole there. It is the size of our pet daschund.", 
    "Very nice looking sofa. Had a friend from Germany visiting and she said that the sofa was comfortable. Stylish and contemporary and the big plus easy to assemble. Half the time you need a Phd and a language interpreter to figure out how to assemble.......very easy even for an instructionally challenged person like me. Fast delivery. Clearly this is good for guests. Not sure I would use this as a regular bedding option. Looks great", 
    "Bought this for our breakroom. Our employees love it and it is wearing very well.", 
    "This is a good bed for kids, but my night on it was uncomfortable. I think it just needs more padding underneath the sheet.", 
    "Bought this for my son's college apartment. It is very comfortable, the back goes down easily and is attractive. He said not comfortable to sleep on, so we bought a mattress topper to put on it if he has to have someone sleep on it. The crack in the middle is noticeable when laying down, but not with the topper.", 
    "Excellent quality and price. Looks more expensive than it is. Took about 20 minutes to put the two pieces together. Comfortable enough to lounge or sleep up, great for guests!", 
    "Feels really cheap and hard. Also, the sitting area is quite short and uncomfortable.", 
    "Great sofa for a tiny place, but kinda small for even not too tall people, otherwise - good looking, sturdy sofa", 
    "The Futon arrived in a timely fashion and was so easy to put together. It fits perfectly in my family room, not too big or small. It was a great buy for the price!", 
    "Looks like the picture, well built, easy to keep clean.", 
    "This Futon will look good in to corner but you will only want to use it for a last resort. This thing is horrible to sit in, but a nights sleep has had my friends opting for the floor rather than this thing. If you need filler furniture it will work but at the price you are better off looking somewhere else.", 
    "this did not fold up well", 
    "Purchased this for my daughter for her massage studio and she is very happy with it. In between clients, she uses it to take power naps!", 
    "The sofa arrived super quick and took only about 20 minutes to put together. My husband & sin were able to carry it up to the attack. My granddaughter slept on it for 4 nites and said it was comfortable, just felt the split in the middle which I padded for her. It's comfy as a sofa to sit & read just a little low but great fir kids. I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "This works perfectly for my home studio. Great space saver and I assembled it in minutes!", 
    "It is exactly what I was looking for. It is small but not too small.", 
    "It was a very easy set up. Just install the legs, lift the back and its all together. I haven't let it back down yet to use as a sofa bed but hopefully its easy too.", 
    "Beautiful and chic style. The soft leather make this sofa worth every penny we spent. The silver legs added value to the look. I like the cushion, they are supple and sustainable. This sofa is great for people who are looking for modern look and good value.", 
    "I like this piece! Pricing is decent when shipping is factored in. It is low, I use it in a kids rec room, vinyl holds up to the dogs nails. I have slept on it when the better half was sick... It's an average futon of comfort. The adjustable back is gimmicky, up or down... Tilt is awkward. Paired with a low ottoman, the kids play video games with the feet up.", 
    "Looks modern cheek. Quality feel and true black color is a pleasure to look at. Fast delivery and very easy to handle as sofa beds suppose to be. Great value and works the best for small space!", 
    "My husband and I love this couch. It is exceptional for the price. It looks chic and feels a lot more expensive than it is. The black leather and silver legs can never be out of style. This futon sofa bed was the perfect addition for us!", 
    "Thumbs up for this great sofa bed. Great quality and decent size to fit into my small room. The only reason I choose \"average comfort\" is because a sofa bed can never be as comfortable as real bed, so the best a sofa bed can do is it can only be average comfort. But that doesn't no refrain me from saying this is a great sofa bed, because it is! I love the black finish with chrome legs, modern and chic. Love it!", 
    "Nice sofa bed, I have long legs so the sofa was actually too low to the floor so I purchased steel bed risers from amazon to put underneath the legs adding 5 inches, an extra $** dollars and now it sits at the height of a regular couch.", 
    "The size is perfect for my apartment living room. I love the three different adjustments. The material is excellent and the support is excellent.", 
    "This is my second times to order from overstock.com. I 'm happy with my purchase.", 
    "Cheap price, high end look, sturdy construction, soft material, supportive cushion, easy set up, fast delivery.. these are some of the good point I found, just to name a few. Get this futon sofa bed unless you want some thing less... good luck with search.", 
    "What you see is what you get, the picture look exactly the same as the actual product. Very modern, very sleek look. No need to say, black color goes with every thing, and pu keeps things clean and new. This is a decent size sofa bed, but still compact as all sofa beds are, so it may not suit the very tall person. Otherwise, this sofa bed provides good comfortable seating and is useful as a temporary sleeping solution. Great product.", 
    "My wife and I love this sofa bed. It is exceptionally good for the price, and has the expensive look to it. It's very comfortable and looks chic in our new apartment home. Perfect couch for every one!", 
    "The couch is very well made and with handsome look. Consider the price, this couch offers plenty of value. It is a little compact, but that's how a modern sofa bed / futon is supposed to be. The cushions provides firm support to both back and the sitting area. I would of like the cushion to be a little more softer, but I know in fact his would soften over time. The packaging design is genius on how they manage to make this sofa bed to be converted to a much smaller size and made transport easy. Very satisfied and would get it again when I have a chance.", 
    "I was worried this would be too small and too low and I was right. It has a very stylish look to it. That means it would still be fine if you just need basically a love seat to tuck away somewhere. I wish I had put my money toward a normal size sofa.", 
    "It's a great modern couch for a great price. It is about a month old and still comfortable for lounging around. Comfortably seats two - three people without issue. A friend slept on it as a bed for the weekend and rated the comfort average. Unfortunately as a bed, the length is not ideal for guests taller than 5'7.", 
    "I highly recommend this sofa bed, because I think its perfect and designed the way a sofe bed should be: Its compact in size for conveniency, its has the modern look which suit most of the homes or apartment these days, comfortable cushion is a must, its easily to convert between bed and sofa to make it hassle fee, and the black leatherrete is easy to maintain. So what more do I need to say? I love this sofa bed and would like to share with evey one!", 
    "Love the pricy look with not so pricy cost combination. The sofa bed is compact, so may not be good if you are very tall, but I guess that's the trade off for the great convenience to use and to move this sofa. Besides that, every thing about this sofa bed is great, and dont' getme wrong, this sofa bed offers good size, so its not a \"kid/child sofa\". The sofa fabric, good look, and good quality earns this sofa bed a big thumbs up!", 
    "WeI love this couch. It offers great value for the price. And it look lot more expensive than it is. The couch is very comfortable and looks chic in our apartment. Its a little firm, but is still very comfortable for my guest. But I would add a some matress topper next time to make sure its 100%. Very happy overall.", 
    "I really like this sofa. I bought it to use in my home office, and I love the functionality ii provides. With limited space available, I will be able to use this furniture either as sofa or temp.bed without having to move the furniture or trying to creat more spaces when the guest is here. On top of that, this sofa is very stylish and modern. So I am very pleased!", 
    "Love the modern style and nice sof leatherette. Black is the way to go and both the color and the fabric make this sofa bed eays to maintain and clean. The size is compact but adequate for an average size person like me, it a tad small er than i would of like, but again this is good size for a sofa bed. For the price, this is the best quality and look you can get, so I am very happy with my new sofa.", 
    "Like many others here, I've bought this as a first bed in a new apartment and it did the job admirably: arrived fast and took 10 minutes to assemble. However, I am quite annoyed about how the two halves of the sofa's back set to different positions, about 5-10 degrees off (though not annoyed enough to go to the inconvenience of returning it as I won't have anything to sleep on). The click-clack mechanism feels flimsy: I guess it's the price you have to pay for ease of transportation and assembly, as each half of the back is held only on one side. Still, it's inexpensive, reasonably comfortable, and upholstery is high quality, so as long as your unit doesn't have the same defect as mine and you don't plan on folding and unfolding it very often, it can be worth its price.", 
    "This sofa looks great in my living room and the price point was pretty solid. I would highly recommend it if you don't need the side arm rests.", 
    "This sofa bed is perfect as it has everything a sofe bed is supposed to provided. Compact size, beautiful modern look, comfortable cushion, and easily to convert between bed and sofa. So easy to set up, and the delivery was so fast. I love this sofa bed. Eevry one should get one. Awesome!", 
    "I bought this sofa bed for my kids playroon. I wanted something that is durable and easy to maintain and this works very well. Its surprisingly nice in both the look and the quality, I mean at this price range, I didn't expect much from a sofa bed. So I really feel I get a good deal. Also, it folds into a bed with one click, super comvenient for my kids when they felt sleep on it. If I need to use it as a bed for visitors, I will probably use a mattress topper to make it even more comfortable for sleeping. Again, what a great deal I get here..", 
    "I highly recommend this futon sofa bed. Its sturdy and well made, aslo nice to look at. It arrived very quickly and considerably compact box, so I was able to move it myself and attached the legs easily. I was amazed how easy it was to assemble. The allen key were included in the assemly package, so no other tools required, and not special skill required. It is well worth the price spent for something so versatile and nice looking.", 
    "This sofa is pretty cheap looking and not very comfortable, but it was fine enough, I had to replace a battered old sofa and didn't have funds for something better. Seemed to do the trick. Though a spring quickly went out of whack, making a funky spot to sit on. And then one leg broke off, then a second. I ended up taking off all the legs and sitting the thing on the floor. It's destined for the sidewalk soon. I've bought tons of furniture from Overstock, and know what to expect. At $*** this was not the best deal by any means. Wouldn't recommend it unless you tread through your home *very lightly.", 
    "This product is the nicest click clack futon I could find anywhere online. It's nice and solid, and has three elevation settings for each side of the futon. Upright, reclined and flat. I didn't think I'd ever use the reclined, but I ended up using it when I wanted to lounge a bit. The split back is also more useful than I thought it would be. If I want to adjust it, I don't worry about disturbing my boyfriend. Pros: Solid construction Easy set up Easy to clean Flexible settings Comfortable Cons: A bit short for most people to sleep comfortably (but it's better than the floor) The middle seam on the seat is a bit uncomfortable to sit on", 
    "Have had my futon for quite a while now, and I LOVE it! I have a bad lower back and need firm support which this futon provides quite well. All the hardware needed is included, and It's easy to assemble - I'm 62 y/o and rather arthritic; so if I can do it, just about anyone should be able to handle the job. A twin-size mattress pad and fitted sheet (deep pockets) fit it perfectly and make it just that much more comfy. It's easy to adjust the back to any of the 3 positions. I really like that with the back upright, it doesn't look like a futon, but rather a sleek couch. Of course, it's easy to change it's appearance with throws, comforters, spreads, etc., to match any d\u00e9cor.", 
    "Great product - compact, easy to assemble, and folds back nicely. Feels very durable. The product ships folded in half at the middle, which makes it very compact - which should make it really easy to move. While the seating itself is comfortable, I found the back a little bit awkward, so it would be worth getting some pillows for. As a bed, it can comfortably sleep one, or two if people are willing to get cozy. At under 6 feet long, it's a little bit short, so tall friends might find it a bit awkward to sleep on. I am very happy with this purchase, and would buy it again in a heartbeat.", 
    "The futon is sturdy and nice looking. It is not comfortable if one sleeps in the center. I had to purchase an egg crate for my guest. On another note, I love that it reclines. Other than it being a little low, it is a good looking piece of furniture. Very easy to put together. Buy a box cutter ahead of time to throw the boxes away; but, don't use box cutter to open package.", 
    "This Sofabed comes in one box and goes together in a snap. There is even a storage compartment for the legs should you wish to transport it in the future. You can simply remove the legs and the structure of the couch folds up into a cube.", 
    "I am not a guy who likes to write some reviews after purchase, and I didn't buy this sofa bed, my wife did. Its a great pruchase and I really like it, so I decide to spend some time to do some recommendations here. I love the modern look of the sofa bed and its the way to go, because I personally think that is how a sofa bed should liooke like. With the trendy chrome legs, its like adding some chrome wheels to my car, Nice! The size is right for a sofa bed futon, not overwhelmingly big and not tiny like the one we some times get that is only suitable for kids. Cushion is firm but not hard, which I think is good for a sofa bed. I also like the idea of being able to fold the sofa bed so easy to move around my house. More importatly, he price for this sofa bed is so good for the quality we gets. Really has nothing to complain about.", 
    "It was a great purchase with great value, I was lookeing for something modern, simple, and fit the budget. This futon sofa bed is ideal for small space. It's comfortable and well built. At this price range, I could not find any thing better!", 
    "We didn't want to spend a lot of money on a sofa bed that we were only going to use for one year, so this seemed like a good bargain. It is easy to assemble, really easy to change from sofa to sofabed, and looks pretty nice - reason for the 2 stars not 1. However, it is the most UNCOMFORTABLE sofa we've ever sat in. You can feel all of the springs, some parts go in more than others, and some parts of the frame are not well-padded so you can really hurt yourself. It is in our main seating area and friends/family have complained many times about how uncomfortable the sofa is. We've considered tossing it out every day since the purchase. Save yourself the trouble and get a different sofabed.", 
    "I got this futon for my modern apartment and unfortunately was dissappointed. It is VERY uncomfortable. You can't sit in the middle of the couch because a metal rod will be poking you. It's not even long enough for someone to sleep on it as a futon. I would only recommend this sofa to people looking for furniture for a waiting room or where there isn't a lot of living going on.", 
    "It was a great buy. Pretty good good quality and is comfortable", 
    "I love this sofa bed and very happy we with the purchase. It been about 9 months since we brought it, it look as good as when it first arrived. It strong and surable, and easy to maintain. The good look certainly help too. The fabric material used has very good quality, and the black finish is timeless and will never go out of fashion. Although not real leather, but it comes with good quality and feel. Its great to have a sofa that has comfort and style!", 
    "I highly recommend this futon sofa bed for its quality, look, and functionality. Its such a great solution for small room or if you have limited space in a room. Not only is it sturdy and well made but nice to look at. It arrived very compact due to clever design, its similar to the size of a very large ottoman, so I was able to move it myself into the house and into the room easily. I was amazed how easy it was to assemble. The 2 allen keys required were also included. It is well worth the price spent for something so versatile.", 
    "I love the quality and look of this sofa bed. I think this sofa bed offers one of the best value for money you can get these days. We brought a couple of other sofa beds in the past years, and they were just okay and not as good. Overall quality and the fabric material suggest this sofa bed should last longer. It is also very comfortable, which I enjoyed sleep on it from time to time. Very happy with this sofa bed as it's looks good and very functional.", 
    "We bought this for our 8 years old daughter's bedroom and she loved it. It looks exactly as pictured and was very easy to put together. It contemporary style looks way more expensive then it cost. It is definitely a futon so it is low to the ground but if you are familiar with this you will not be surprised. Since we love it so much, I just had to let you know how great this is, you will not be disappointed!", 
    "This nice futon sofa bed has met all my expectations. Great quality, great built, great value for the money!", 
    "This futon was easy to assemble. It is just as described. We are very happy with our purchase and the great service from Overstock.", 
    "Great quality, modern good look, soft fabric, supportive cushion, trendy chrome legs, convert in seconds, black color goes with any thing. Perfect sofa bed for the best price I can ever hope for. Full marks.", 
    "I agreed to some of the other reviews this sofa bed is a super bargain. The quality is really good, especially considering the price. Although not genuine leather, but the material used was a higher graded PU, so the fabric has very nice feel and looks great. Its also much easier to maintain compare to leather. I can pretty much tell that the material is durable. Most importat thing is, this is the best looking contemporary sofa bed that I found, so i am very proud to have this sofa bed at home.", 
    "Highly recommended! I love the modern look and the chrome legs. The size is perfect for a sofa bed futon, and its enough for an average adult to sleep comfortably. Cushion is firm but not hard, which is good for a sofa bed. I really like the idea of being able to fold the sofa bed into a big ottoman and it also make it easy to move the item. Pricewise, its definitely a bargain.", 
    "The sofa bed is well made and good looking. The sofa bed has a very good value.This sofa bed provides firm support to both back and the sitting area. I prefer the cushion to be a little bit softer, but I know the firmmer cushion will make this sofa last longer. You can actually fold it into a small rectangular cube and use it as an ottoman, that is genius. This also made moving them around easy. I am very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "Every thing about this sofa bed is perfect. I love the contemporary look yet does not look cheap like others. Black color is the way to go, it goes with every thing. Love the chrome legs too. Perfect sofa sleeper!", 
    "This couch is comfortable and wears well, especially for the price! There are three issues I have but I have accommodated them (mostly with the judicious use of pillows) and am happy with my purchase. For reference I'm a tall skinny girl, about 5'7. 1. It is a low couch, so those with long legs will feel a bit awkward and grasshopper-ish. This is especially true when trying to work on a computer on one's lap. 2. The couch seat is most firm on the front and back edges, which means there's a tendency to 'sink' into the middle, necessitating a pillow behind one's back to be comfortable. 3. The couch back, as has been mentioned, is low: it reaches just to my shoulder blades. I have it up against a wall so that watching TV is comfortable as long as there's a pillow behind my head (on the top of the seat back, against the wall).", 
    "The sofa bed has a ver modern look; it is exactly what I was looking for. The size is perfect. The quality is very good. I highly recommend to anyone. You will not be disappointed. Note: They have 4 colors (white, black, brow, and orenge). I got the black one.", 
    "Meets all expectations and was useful. Wish the length of the couch was a little longer.", 
    "My husband and I love this couch. It is exceptional for the price. It looks a lot more expensive than it is. It's very comfortable and looks chic in our apartment. The bed is also very comfortable. My only complaint is that it gets dirty quite easily.", 
    "We wanted something black leather and silver for the Man Cave with the ability to sleep guests. This futon sofa bed was the perfect addition. Looks great, easy to assemble, nice price!", 
    "This is a very comfortable and great looking sofa bed. Very comfy to both sit or sleep on. I personally think this type of sofa bed looks much better than a futon and also has better value than the futon. It has very strong structure and sturdy base. The fabric is beautifulI and easy to take care of, and I think the actual color finish appears even more attractive than in the pictures. We are very pleased with this furniture, I would recommend to any one who is liooking for good sofa bed at good price.", 
    "This was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something simple but doesn't look cheap, I love the clean lines and a rich dark color finish. It has a high quality pu leatherette and doesn't look artificial and fits very well in my living room. It amazing how this sofa bed made my living room look completely different, and I mean in a good way, of course. It's also very comfortabe and very good for the limited floor space. The picture is very accurate, what you see is what you get. Great buy!", 
    "I love this sofa bed. It been about 6 months since we received it, it look as good as when it first arrived. I think it very strong and maintained the good look due to it's simple modern design and the material it used. Although not real leather, but it comes with good quality and feel. Its great to have a sofa that has comfort, style and durable. Great buy!", 
    "This sofa bed is perfect as it has everything I needed, great modern look, really comfortable cushion, and easily to convert into a bed for my visitors. Very easy to set up, delivery was fast. I love this piece of furniture. Perfect for my apartment. Awesome!", 
    "I ordered this futon for my kids' playroom -- mostly for playing video games and watching TV. Occassionally, we may use it as a bed if we have an extra guest. It's not very long, but it will work for a night or two. The seat is very comfortable and I love the sleek look with the chrome legs. Great quality for a great price!", 
    "I bought this sofa bed for my toddlers playroon. I wanted something that looked good but was also durable. It was super easy to put together and looks great. I love it and the value can't be beat. It folds into a bed with one click. If I need to use it as a bed I will use a mattress topper to make it more comfortable for sleeping. Home run with this item.", 
    "I recommend this futon sofa bed very highly. Not only is it sturdy and well made but nice to look at. It arrived very compact (the size of a very large footstool), so I was able to move it myself into the house and into the office easily. I was amazed how easy it was to assemble. The 2 screw tighteners were included in the assemly package. It is well worth the price spent for something so versatile.", 
    "We purchased this sofa for our son his senior year of college. It is very useful and sturdy. We did have to pick it up at UPS and assembly is required. It did not take long to assemble and is working well", 
    "This is a great piece of furniture. Sleek and clean with minimal lines and goes perfectly in my husband's man cave. It's more of a love seat than a couch but it fits us perfectly, looks great, and is actually pretty comfortable!", 
    "I do like the couch but mostly for the look of it. I don't like sleeping on it. It's ok for sitting and watching television. I'm comparing the couch to an old one that i had with oversized cushions. So, my comparison may not be fair. For a futon, it is pretty good.", 
    "I really like this sofa. I bought it to use in my photography studio, and I love the functionality is provides by being a futon in addition to a sofa. I will likely not only use it for client meetings, but I will also lay it flat to use for some photo shoots. So far, no complaints.", 
    "I got this sofa bed in black faux leather. It looks good, feels sturdy and is super easy to assemble.", 
    "Strongly recommended! I love the modern look of the sofa bed and the trendy chrome legs. The size is right for a sofa bed futon, and its enough for an adult to sleep well on it. Cushion is firm but not hard, which I think is good for a sofa bed. I also like the idea of being able to fold the sofa bed into a big ottoman and that made it easy to move around my house. Best of all, the price for this sofa bed is such a bargain. At this price range, I am pretty sure nothing else can beat it in terms of quality and design. Could not asked for more!", 
    "I have gone through many sofa beds/futon before, this is one of the best I have ever purchased, period. The quality is super when considering how much I paid for this sof abe with shipping charges. And product looks exactly the same as showing in the pictures. The style of this sofa bed is modern and comes with nice stitches in the ritght place. Confortable to sit and sleep on. And most inportantly, this is the right size for a sofa bed futon, not too big and not too small.... Very happy with the purchase, glsd I found the great bargain.", 
    "It was a great purchase, especially for something modern, simple, and fit the budget. This futon sofa bed is ideal for small space. One minor compliant is it appeared smaller than the picture when folded out. Overall, it's comfortable and sturdy. Luckily my brother assembled this, because there was no way I could have done it.", 
    "Nice looking and easy to put together. Shipping was right on time. Fits perfect in a small room", 
    "This is an OK product for the price. The fabric is noticably not leather but synthetic. Solidly made.", 
    "We have had this sofa bed for few weeks now and I just love it. It's as good as I expected and the price for this sofa bed is just unbeatable. It looks as good as in the photos. The sofa bed is really sturdy due to the fact it has center support legs where some of the others does not have. The material quality is good and very durable. Sitting on this sofa bed feels just as a good as on a couch, just a little firmer though. The price is very good for what you get. It's a really good bargain for sure!", 
    "The sofa bed is well made and good looking. The sofa bed has a very good value when considering the price it cost. I had a number of sofa beds before at this price range, and non of them were as good as this one. This sofa bed provides firm support to both back and the sitting area, and although they are firm, but they are comfortable to sit on. I prefer the cushion to be a little softer, but I guess firmmer seating will probabaly last longer, this is good as I go though them fairly quickly. From past experience, it will soften a bit after used for a while. The special feature I found and LOVE about this sofa bed is you can actually fold it into a relatively small rectangular cube and use it as a big ottoman, its about one quater of the original size compare to when convert into a sofa. This also made transportation much easier, what a clever design! I am very satisfied with this purchase and really love the simple and contemporary look.", 
    "This was easy to build. It has a chic, modern look - and looks more expensive than it actually costs. It is very comfortable to sleep on, too!", 
    "Love the dark pure black color, look expensive. Quality is good, and the comfort level is above par. Quick delivery and surprisingly easy to handle. When used as a sleeper, I have put a memory foam on top to make it perfect for sleep.", 
    "Very happy with this purchase. It's very sleek and modern, good quality and actually more comfortable than I expected for a sofa bed.", 
    "Very fast delivery! Receive it the same week I order it! The sofa was easy to set up, looks really nice and the upholstery is soft. Easily converted between bed and sofa. I will recommend to any one who is looking for a great contemporary sofa bed.", 
    "For the price, it's has great value, so this was a good choice for my apartment. I needed either a loveseat or 2 chairs in contemporary, easy to maintain black leatherette, and liked the simple style. I couldn't find anything contemporary that looked better than this, and luckily it also fairly comfortable. I couldn't be happier.", 
    "Brilliant futon sofa bed, too good for the money! Quality material + Modern style = Great sofa bed. Fast delivery, easy set up, effortless. It sits low just like other sofa beds, and is comfy and functional. highly recommended!", 
    "Love it! Good quality and sleek design. Ideal for a small room or studio, comfortable and easy to handle. Thumbs up!", 
    "Maximum amount of value per dollar! This is the best sofa bed I have ever seen for the low range price. I have been looking for a reasonable price sofa bed, and can never be satisfied with what I found until I see this one. So get this sofa bed unless you can afford (and wanted) a high end sofa bed at 3 times the price.", 
    "I like it and this is how a sofa bed is supposed to be. It is easy to manipulate between sofa and bed position, Easy to move and easy to use. Compact in size, but with adequate seating. Black upholstery is easy to work with other furniture and easy to maintain. Any one who needs a sofa bed should get this, no doubt.", 
    "This is a comfortable and nice looking sofa bed. I personally think this type of sofa bed looks much better than a futon and also has better value. The price of this sofa bed is amazingly reasonable. The fabric leather is beautiful and matches the pictures perfectly. We are very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "This is a very stylish futon sofa bed. We needed an extra sleeping option for a small office space. This piece is perfect for our needs. It fits nicely in the space, is comfortable to sit on, and looks great as a sofa, which is how we will use it most of the time. It is a little firm, which I like and find more comfortable. It was easy to assemble and makes into a bed easily. I've stretched out on it, but haven't slept on it for a night. To make it more comfortable for guests--so that the fold in the middle is less noticeable--we bought a fairly thick mattress pad, which we think will work well. We checked other options and this seemed like a very good value. We are not disappointed. I read the reviews carefully and the ones about this sofa-futon were all very positive. Now that we have one, I agree entirely with the good reviews and am pleased to add my own.", 
    "Brought two of these sofa beds for our offices. I recommend this futon sofa bed too every one. Not only is it sturdy and well made but also look very elegant and expensive. It arrived quickly and were in the very compact form, almost like the size of a large ottoman, so we were able to move it into the location we wanted with ease. Its was also amazingly easy to assemble, just attach the legs and done. The simple tool required was an allenkey, and it was included in the legs box. Definitely a great buy for us!", 
    "Looks great and very lovable! The black is rich and beautiful, doesn't look cheap at all. Black leatherette with modern style is the way to go! Very happy and highly recommended!", 
    "This couch came fully assembled and the quality exceeds my expectations. The color matches exactly what you see online, so it's very accurate. Since I do want to use this as a sofa bed, the length of the bed is shorter than stated in the description. It will only sleep comfortably a 5'9'' person or shorter. A little disappointing and does not meet my requirement of a sofa bed. However, because the quality and the color was so good, I decided to keep it.", 
    "Got this sofa bed not long ago and really think this is such a good deal. Its well made and good looking. I had a number of sofa beds before and non of them were as good. This sofa bed provides firm support to both back and seat, at the same tiem they are still comfortable to sit on. The special feature I enjoyed about this sofa bed is you can actually fold it into a rectangular ottoman, its about one quater of the original sofa size. This also made transportation easy, as I move place from time to time due to work, such a nice clever design! I am very satisfied with this purchase and every one love the contemporary look.", 
    "The description and specs are accurate, but this looks way better in the picture than in my room. For one, it is WAY too small. It sits so close to the ground that it is uncomfortable to get in and out of. Because it ships folded in half (yes, seriously), the center of the sofa has a hinge in it which makes it very uncomfortable for sitting there. The seats so shallow that you feel like you're going to fall off of the thing. I think that it looks very inviting in the photo only because it's not shown juxtaposed with any legitimate-sized furniture. If you are buying this for a dorm room, go for it, but if you want it for your home, look further.", 
    "It looks nice but this thing is the opposite of comfortable. It might work alright for a bed if you're laying on top of sheets or a blanket. Don't buy this if you want to put it in front of a T.V. or somewhere you want lounge or you will probably wish you hadn't bought it. I'll end up putting this somewhere else in the house and buy a more comfortable couch.", 
    "This sofa bed is a great product at great price. The quality of the fabric and built is very good. More importantly, the actual look and functionality is beyond expectations. I love the fact that they pay attention to the details, one can tell from the stitches as well as the well desgin chrome legs. It's sits perfectly in my apartment and I am very happy with this purchase!", 
    "It took me around 1 hour to finally assemble the legs on this futon and pretty dissapointed. I expected much better leather, even for a faux. It is a cheap rubber feel. Also, the sitting is pretty low and not comfortable. Its a shame because the picture looked enticing. I could see this being sold for $150-$200 at the max. 2 stars only because it was delivered within a week."
