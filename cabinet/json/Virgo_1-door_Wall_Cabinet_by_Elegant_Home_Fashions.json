    "Took us 3 months to finally open the box and put it together. I was dreading it based on the other reviews, now I'm guessing those people have never bought anything from Ikea or any other \"do-it-yourself\" furniture. Nothing tricky here folks, really, they don't even make you use alan wrenches! It had THE best instruction manual I've seen, very well labeled parts and the pictures were decipherable. I'd been wanting one of these for our bathroom and this was one of the few attractive ones in my price range. We've got it loaded up with stuff in an apartment bathroom and so far it works great. Looks really nice too - very classy! Beware when you're actually hanging it that the door might want to swing open and hit you in the face, the magnet works once it's hung, but not so much in transit. Also, I'm a lady and the boyfriend helped me put this together, which was quite helpful. You can do almost all of it yourself, but this is the second item I've put together that had hinges and I could't imagine getting those put on solo. It gets pretty heavy when you're holding it to do the hanging too, so if your upper body strength is lacking, have someone on hand to help you!", 
    "This cabinet came packaged securely, quality materials and marked appropriately. The assembly directions were in picture form only. Had some trouble figuring out top & bottom panels - pictures weren't very specific. Parts included wooden pegs as well as metal lock-in screws. Once assembled, it's very sturdy, and everything lined up perfect. Very pleased. Use caution when taking off the labeled pieces - the glue can take off some of the white paint.", 
    "Overall I'd recommend it. I have seen it for a fairly higher price on other sites without free or inexpensive shipping like O.co. This cabinet is nice looking, even adds a little classy look to our powder room, with a shiny white finish. I like that it has both hidden storage and open storage. The material is MDF as most ready-to-assemble furniture is. Fittings are solid if you use the glue. It should be able to take regular use. Putting it together is no problem if you follow the instructions and the pieces are well labeled to help you match them up to the diagrams. Be sure to hang it securely to the wall either into a stud or using drywall hangers as it has some weight and will need to take movement as you use it.", 
    "I ordered 2 others in another style also,however didn't pay attention to the dimensions...I figured it would be the same size as it looked like a set..this one is a little larger..but it was going above the toilet so you really don't notice the difference. Assembly was easy except I had trouble getting the hinges on correctly..assembled in 60-90min. in front of TV program. You can use a power drill driver, just take it easy when attaching,and omit glueing the dowels,messy, waste of time as the cams really hold it together.Also use cups or similar container to keep your nuts and bolts together..there are no extras if you lose them in the rug. I am a 62 yr. lady", 
    "Looks beautiful in my schabby chic bathroom and was very easy to hang.", 
    "A nice little extra cabinet for a small bathroom. Holds extra washcloths, handtowels on outside shelves for convenience and other personal items items not in use regularly behind closed door.", 
    "I love these cabinets. This is the second one (a different style this time) of these cabinets that I have purchased to update my bathrooms and add storage. They are easy to assemble; the doors line up and close perfectly and they are beautiful. I would definitely buy again and would recommend to a friend.", 
    "If you are looking for some storage space, this is the cabinet. Very sturdy, my husband put together in approx 30 min. everything was labled making assembly smooth. I like having the versatility of having open display shelves and then a door for personal items.", 
    "Cabinet arrived in well packed box. It was easy to assemble. The cabinet looks just like the advertized picture and my mother-in-law is very happy with its appearance. Of course, it's not real wood (only reason for 4 stars instead of 5), but for the money, looks and space requirements, it is a great cabinet.", 
    "I had this cabinet for about 3 weeks when the area around the detail over the glass started to crack. I do not know how far it will go before it quits, but this is the first time I have had a problem with an overstock.com item.", 
    "looked around for a good value of durability and price. This was it. Purchased several pieces of the line.", 
    "Nice cabinet'I just expected to be low because of what it was", 
    "Bought this little cabinet for my half bathroom. It was the perfect size and the side with the door and shelves gave me room to store extra toilet paper and a few other essentials I did not want out in the open. The exposed shelves provided a place to showcase special decorative items. I found the cabinet to be easy to assemble, durable, and of good quality, but the best feature is that it looks so charming.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for over the toilet of one of our upstairs baths. Pretty cabinet! I bought another one for the other upstairs bath. They are easy to assemble (I'm a 64 year old grandmother ). I did need an extra set of hands to help hold while I fastened screws to wall.)", 
    "Love this little cabinet for my small master bath. It is not the top quality of high end items, but it looks good and does the job. Only problem was that it wasn't sized to hang on the studs, and the screws with the plastic supports pulled right out of the drywall. So we had to go to hardware store and purchase heavy duty anchor supports to hold it in the drywall. Once we did that, it was perfect.", 
    "The quality was less than what I expected. It was impossible to put together. I read previous reviews, and my experience with the directions and attempting to put the cabinet together was not expected! I would NOT buy this again. I will say that the customer service rep I worked with to return the product, Ashton, was very good and helpful.", 
    "Not the best quality and very thin wood. But looks nice enough for small bathroom. cupboard is quite slim. Doesn't hold 2 toilet paper rolls next to each other.", 
    "This is of course pressed board laminated. Hard to put together.. instructions not real explicit. It is very pretty. Not very sturdy.", 
    "assembly took 90 minutes, but instructions were good and parts well labeled. Template for hanging is very helpful. Need two people to hang due to weight of cabinet", 
    "Very nice. easy assembly. One piece came broken so we have the glass piece broken on door, but we needed it so couldnt go through returning it :(", 
    "I wish I would of bought the double door cabinet now that I have it and have mounted the cabinet. However, good quality for the price, cheaper than any of the big box stores after a thorough search", 
    "Assembly was easy enough but the door as been problematic. It doesn't want to hang exactly straight. Decided to keep it as it is still functional.", 
    "I really wanted this to match the Virgo 2-door floor cabinet I had purchased at least two years earlier. This is offers storage to hide items you don't want your guests to see but has the shelving to display other items. I found it did not have a chemical order like some other reviewers had indicated. Follow the instructions for easy assembly.", 
    "This is definitely not a high quality cabinet, but one should not expect it to be for the price. It was very easy to assemble; it's all MDF construction. Trim on the door had some gaps, but a little white caulk solved this problem. It works great as a cabinet in the powder room over the toilet to store a few toiletries.", 
    "Did not like this at all. Since it had to be assembled, the pieces did not match up. Cheap materials.", 
    "Great cabinet.i bought 3 little baskets for cubby and I made an extra shelf for inside. it only had one adjustable shelf.", 
    "This was the perfect piece for a small powder room. It was easy to assemble and the template provided made it super easy to hang on wall. Highly recommend for small space.", 
    "No fault of the product, the shelves are very narrow and not at all practical for the purpose I ordered it for. It is, however, cute and has clean lines.", 
    "Overstock.com furnished satisfaction! This is the latest in a long line of furniture items I've purchased from Overstock.com during the past decade. All have arrived in remarkably fast time, packaged amazingly well with instruction to easily assemble in an hour or two at most. Tremendous savings and everything is designed to last for years and years. The variety of selections on the website allowed us to select this cabinet which met our needs and dimensional requirements perfectly.", 
    "Love the product & when I broke the nut things that hold it all together, loved the customer service I received", 
    "I was able to put it together by myself and hung it on the wall in my rental bathroom. I added etra screws for mounting since template screws that came with it didn't get into the wall stud", 
    "This cabinet was the perfect solution to our condo in Florida. One bathroom lacked a cabinet and this was a great buy and it fit the bill.", 
    "This was easy to put together. It did make a slight split when screwing into one area but very minute. I knew this was not top quality when I purchased it but it is definitely worth what I paid for it.", 
    "Perfect fit above the toilet in a small bathroom with more storage than you'd think.", 
    "We have this in our half bath, and it's a perfect fit. It holds quite a bit for a tiny cabinet", 
    "The cabinet is well made and much heavier than I expected. It took my husband a couple of hours to put it together, as there were lots of different parts. But the end result was well worth it.", 
    "Wall cabinet and all instructions were delivered promptly. Looks nice and does my job just fine.", 
    "I have hung this on the wall in a small bathroom that needed extra storage and it is working well. Some of my products are visible on the shelves, but others of the less attractive stuff is hidden behind the door. The door closes with a magnet catch which works well. It was easy to assemble and no missing parts. I would probably order it again.", 
    "The cabinet adds a lovely decorative touch to our guest half bath. My husband said it was easy to assemble. Would recommend white screws over the silver.", 
    "Has only one door and return will cost you $17.00. Some how looks like for demo purose other door is not shown.", 
    "i didnt take it out of the box-why because template for hanging shows 12 1/2 inches between hanging brakets. US studding 16 inches on center. Why would you try and sell?", 
    "I needed a cabinet for various stuff in my bathroom as I have a pedestal sink and no vanity. This cabinet works well because it has both open and closed storage. It was not difficult to put together or to mount on the wall. I did it with no help in about an hour and one half. It did require the ability to carefully follow directions! I am happy with this item.", 
    "This is a easily assembled cabinet. Only one shelf inside...could use another. Instructions were good, but I was missing the screw necessary to put the knob on. I called the indicated 800 number to request a replacement...and received no reply. Overall I would recommend this cabinet...it is attractive and the display shelves nicely display items.", 
    "I have been very satisfied with everything I'v ordered from overstock", 
    "Great cabinet for the price! Fit the space and was easy to assemble.", 
    "I ordered this and the Virgo 2-door unit as well. Unit is fine for the price. Not high quality. The other unit ordered is still missing the inside shelf. Matter has been ongoing for over a month. Just called again today as it is still not yet resolved. Called when unit was received, 2+ weeks later they sent the top of the cabinet instead of the inside shelf. Called again. Next day I receive email that piece is sent with UPS tracking. When I check, the tracking was for the incorrect piece received the previous day. Called again and was told, it would be sent ASAP. Still waiting. Called again today and was told they will send out ASAP.", 
    "This cabinet was pre-drilled to be attached to wall studs. In this country wall studs are invariably 16\" apart. This product was pre-drilled to hang on wall studs 12\" apart! It is incredibly dumb to sell a product in the US that is made specifically for 12\" spacing between wall studs.", 
    "Looks really nice on the wall but a little smaller than I thought it was.", 
    "This cabinet looks nice and is a good size. I was disappointed to discover that I had to assemble every part of it and it's made from the same material as my 9 cube closet maid shelf that's more than twice the size but was less than half the cost. The backing is flimsy and feels like thick cardboard. The door is the only part of this cabinet that seems like higher quality so my guess is you're paying more for the door. If this cabinet was $30 cheaper I'd give it more stars but it's over priced at $60.", 
    "I've been using this cabinet for my new apartment for about a month now. Before receiving, I wasn't sure how much I'd like the asymmetry of this unit, with 1 side being open shelves and the other having a door. Upon receipt, I felt the unit looked better than I had anticipated and felt I made a great choice-- it looks fantastic. Unit went together relatively smoothly, with the exception of one of the lock washers stripping. Unit comes with what appears to be a white-out marker, ostensibly to cover any future scratches-- a worrisome sign of its paint quality, though thusfar, I have been taking care of it and there are no scratches. Overall, I'm glad I chose this unit. It was one of the most affordable I've seen online and seems to be a very good value.", 
    "This is a nice medicine cabinet. It wasn't hard to put together (the instructions were great), but it did take awhile.", 
    "We needed extra storage and in the local Lowes and Home Depot cabinets were well over $60. This was perfect. Instructions were good, easy to hang, looks great.", 
    "We have a small bathroom and needed storage beside tub. Quality wood that won't warp/retain water and swell. This was just the right size to fit between tub and door. Like the open shelves where we can get to things we use each shower and closed storage for other stuff. The magnetice doors open/close easily - not like some we've had. Added a double towel rack to bottom of cabinet so everything for the shower is within reach. Only drawback is the open shelves are not adjustable - however, the shelves behind door are. Open shelves too short to hold large shampoo containers, but, just right size for regular size bottles, etc.", 
    "Small cabinet was exactly what I expected. Very easy to put together and to put on the wall. I used one extra mounting screw when attaching it to the wall to ensure that I was attaching it to a stud for stability. Had to drill that hole myself but that was no big deal.", 
    "The cabinet was a perfect addition to my newly remodeled bathroom. Since the room is small and I already had a tri-fold mirror over the sink, I didn't want another cabinet to overwhelm the space. This was a perfect fit. There are some scratches on the cabinet, although I don't know if they were there when I received it or while I was putting it together. A little touch up with some white paint will take care of that. My only disappointment is that it only came with one shelf, and it could easily use two. I am going to fashion another small shelf with a piece of scrap wood & paint it to match. It was pretty easy to assemble, is solid and looks great. For peace of mind, we also used self-drilling anchors to attach it to the wall, instead of the small ones provided.", 
    "this cabinet was just as pictured. There is ample storage behind the door and shelves for holding small items like perfume. The directions were pretty easy to follow as long as you make sure all the pieces are facing in the right direction.", 
    "This cabinet is very cheaply constructed. It is made in China, comes in a lot of different pieces, not easy to put together and the hardware is extremely cheap. The screws are not even made out of real metal, luckily we only stripped one putting it together. Had to take one screw off the back to replace the stripped screw as there were no extra's. Although once it is put together it looks really nice, it is not worth the $** at all.", 
    "well packed..no damage..easy assembly. Looks lovely in my newly redone master bath.", 
    "Arrived quickly, easy to assemble. Packed well, received without any damage. Great deal, would highly recommend!", 
    "I ordered this cabinet to go above the toilet in our kids' newly remodeled bathroom, and it is perfect. It was easy to assemble, which is saying something for me - I've messed up basic bookcases before. The instructions were great, and all the parts were labeled. The only drawback is that it has pre-drilled holes for mounting, which is great IF those holes line up with a stud. But the hardware that came with it to mount it are good quality. I really have no complaints. There is only one shelf inside the cabinet, so it's best used for tall things, or stacked toilet paper rolls (which fit perfectly). All around, I am quite satisfied, and the kids love their new bathroom!", 
    "Love this cabinet! It's in my kids' bathroom and allows easy access of washcloths, baby bath towels, and t.p. We plan to get the 2 door cabinet for our master bath soon!", 
    "I received the cabinet very quickly. Only negative is that once you screw it into the wall you can see the screw at the top shelf and inside the cabinet. Should include some plastic covers. Shelf is sturdy enough and I really like the look of it. It is definitely better quality and better looking than something from the department stores.", 
    "This is perfect in my bathroom. I had a great time (really) putting it together. I like the open shelves to use for decorating and closed cupboard to hide the mess. The price was darn good too. Quality item.", 
    "Looks great! Easy to put together and hang! Just the right size for our little half bath.", 
    "This is a nice cabinet that I put together without the hubby's help!", 
    "This is a nice piece and not that difficult to put together. It is heavy and seems sturdy. However, as others have indicated there is an awful chemical smell that after 3 weeks, it is still there.", 
    "I've been looking for a while for a cabinet for my bathroom. This one is perfect. I found baskets that fit in the 3 shelves on the left. I put all my hair products and lotions on the shelves hidden by the door. It's the right size and very sturdy. I've used it for a month now and I'm glad everyday that I bought it.", 
    "It was easy to put together and it looks great . Fast shipping and a great buy", 
    "Very small compared to most cabinets but perfect for my small condo. Love it!", 
    "Great little cabinet for a good price. I tried to find something in the stores but they were all too big and too expensive. This fits nicely in a small bathroom and looks great.", 
    "appreciate the quick delivery.instructions were clear and each piece was labeled. was quite easy to assemble, took about 30 minutes.i hung the cabinet in the bathroom for extra storage. it wouldnt hurt if there were an extra shelf behind the door but otherwise the item is great.", 
    "I did not realize that such a complete construction was required, but the instructions were quite clear and well illustrated and I was able (at an advanced age) with just a littl help, to put the cabinet together. We are pleased with the result"
