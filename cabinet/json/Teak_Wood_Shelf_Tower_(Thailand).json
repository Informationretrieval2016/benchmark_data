    "Nothing cheap looking about this piece. It's a handsome addition for a small space and works beautifully in my new bathroom.", 
    "This piece fit perfecty next to the tub. Great for rolled up towels, candle, bath salts. I'm very happy with it.", 
    "Very happy with the construction- very sturdy solid, simple design. Real wood not some mdf or veneer material.", 
    "This is a unique and well made piece of furniture. Very solid and heavy, looks great.", 
    "I got this to fit in a tight spot beside a narrow vanity. There are a lot of different wood species in my bathroom and I wanted/needed something eclectic that wouldn't scream \"new\" and I wanted to be able to turn it sideways so you can't see the shelves and I wanted it to not stick out beyond the depth of my vanity. So I had specific measurements I needed. The sides of this shelf are so beautiful. Out of the box, I cleaned it using lemon oil spray (you could use mineral oil) and it made the grain come alive. I also drilled some holes in the bottom 4 feet and hammered in some feet so ensure it would scratch my glass tile floor. It's sturdy, heavy, exactly what I was looking for and everyone asks me where I got it.", 
    "This shelf is so unique, sturdy and fits perfectly in a half bath. The quality is great and the shelf is super heavy. It will match with any d\u00e9cor.", 
    "A little smaller then the picture lends you to beleive, but nice quality and very sturdy.", 
    "I have beautiful Copenhagen bedroom furniture and have been looking for a small shelf to fit in a slim space between a set of windows & a balcony door. This natural teak little tower is perfect. What surprised me was the wonderful craftsmanship and how heavy it is. It's perfect for a few books, photos, and mementos and adds some rustic flair.", 
    "For a long time, I've searched for a small, slightly rustic, solid wood shelf for a corner of our living room, finally found this one. This is for books, not towels. It's perfect, the only one I have found that exactly fits the little space. Solid wood (no MDF!), well made, well priced, very heavy!! Thanks.", 
    "Perfect, compact shelving for a tight space in my guest bathroom. Thanks again Overstock for great products and delivery!", 
    "This is a really beautiful piece of furniture: I love the look of natural teakwood and I love buying from Thailand and from Thai manufacturers. It is very solidly made and Thai artisans are the best!!!!"
