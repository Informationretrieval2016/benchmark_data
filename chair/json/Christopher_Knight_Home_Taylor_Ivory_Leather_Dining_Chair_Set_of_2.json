    "Love these chairs. I've ordered the other model by Christopher knight, gentry parsons and they were too small and too short for my dining table. Had to return them and received great customer service from Overstock. These chairs are the perfect size/ height (for a 30\" high table) and had the same great material as the previous chair. The material and design make it feel like I paid twice the price. The color is more off white than full Irovy. Loved the fact that it's bonded leather and not leatherette that I was close to buying but glad I waited for this new release. Had to assembly these which required screws and nuts. Took about 10-15 mins each chair. Some screws were alittle hard to screw, I used a real screw driver vs the included L tool. Hope this review helps.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for, really nice, do not look cheap, nicely built dining chairs. I love them!! Did not put five stars because I like chairs to be puffy in lumbar area, to give lumbar support, besides that, it is an amazing product and excellent price!!", 
    "The only reason this chair did not get 5 stars from me is because the backs of the chairs are ever so slightly off in height. My husband noticed it. I have a chair at either end of my rectangle kitchen table, with some other chairs I ordered from Overstock at each side of the table. I didn't even notice the height difference, but my husband's eagle eyes noticed it right away. It really isn't noticeable to most people, and as a matter of a fact, I just ordered two more for my formal dining room that I just redecorated. These chairs are sturdy, and look much more expensive than what they are. I just bought some other chairs at a different store, and my husband and I were just commenting on how they were so much more expensive than the Christopher Knight chairs, yet the Christopher Knight chairs \"look\" much more expensive, and \"feel\" much more expensive. They arrived pretty quickly, and everything was well packaged. My husband and I had them out together in no time. I can honestly say that if you buy these chairs, you'll love your decision. By the way, these chairs are not stark white. They have just a hint of almond to them. This, to me, is good because the chairs are still white for your d\u00e9cor, but the little touch of almond gives them a richer look than a stark white chair would look.", 
    "These chairs arrived quickly and are nicely packaged - usually a good indicator of the time and effort put into the product. Assembly is required, but it is not difficult -- takes about 15-20 minutes per chair. I have put together other furniture and repaired my previous chairs, so I have seen how they were built. These chairs appear to be well made with good hardware and should be sturdy over time. The color is a nice ivory. The chairs are a little narrow so maybe not the right product for everyone. The seat cushion is quite firm so not for you if you want something to sink into, They are bonded leather which is a step up from vinyl, but not a true leather. (If you are looking for quality leather, you need to pay a lot more!) So far, I am pleased with these chairs. I have always had great experiences with overstock.com and so i would recommend this website and these chairs.", 
    "Chairs have a nice quality off white leather but one leg is shorter on one of the chairs. It is due to the body of the chair being warped. I like shopping at overstock, but returning large items is such a pain. Luckily return shipping will be free.", 
    "Chairs are beautiful and go well with our newly purchased table (Emerson Reclaimed Wood Table & Bench from ****). We also got 2 matching counter-height stools in the same ivory color. The color is definitely ivory and overall, the chairs are well-made, minus a few scuffs and nicks from transportation/delivery. The only big issue is when assembling, the holes don't necessarily match up and took us about 3 hours to put together 4 chairs and 2 stools. The assembly instructions are pretty crappy - poorly written and screws are tied up in bunches that don't make sense. So, don't fully tighten the screws, leave them just a little loose so you can readjust/tighten once you've done the wobble check. The wobble check is what really took the longest since you have to adjust the screws, adjust the legs a little, adjust the tightness of the screws, recheck wobble and repeat. Chairs and stools are definitely super comfy and not too heavy either.Christopher Knight Home Tate Tufted Leather Counter Stools - http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Christopher-Knight-Home-Tate-Tufted-Leather-Counter-Stools-Set-of-2/8774804/product.html", 
    "I was very happy when I saw these chairs in person! They are beautiful & comfortable.", 
    "Love these chairs! Great quality and easy to put together.", 
    "Light and sturdy!!! easy to assemble", 
    "They are very nice chairs I receive a lot of compliments and when I mentioned the price no one can believe it, they look much nicer for the price", 
    "Love these chairs, easy to assemble and quality is excellent for price. Would definitely repurchase!", 
    "I love the chairs,and they have held up pretty nicely, this will make a year since I got them and they still look the same as the day I got them", 
    "Ordered 4 of these to stage our eat in kitchen for our home to go on the market. Easy to put together, easy to clean with kids around too! Thought we would use them as extras after the move, but they replaced our original oak chairs because they are so nice. No complaints here.", 
    "I love these chairs! Stylish and comfortable with the transitional look that I hoped for. My husband had no problem assembling them. I have received so many compliments. I have purchased 8 (4 sets) and am looking to purchase another set before Christmas.", 
    "Chairs look nice and elegant. They are easy to clean with a damp cloth. Upon arrival I had to attach the back to the bottom of the chairs, which was a bit tricky. The back has to be aligned perfectly to the seat, or the (black) lining of the seat is visible (not attractive). Also, after a while the chairs became wobbly and the bolts holding the back and the seat together have to be retightened.", 
    "Ordered these to go with a traditional mahogany dining table. It updates the whole look beautifully, and the chairs look amazing with the tufted detailing. Bought the matching bar stools for the kitchen to tie the rooms together. Easy to put together. Very durable.", 
    "The chairs look nice and the leather is good quality. But they're extremely uncomfortable because the backs are fixed at a backward-leaning angle. I had to return them.", 
    "Arrived in great condition very well packed. Like other reviewers I found the first one a little hard to assemble. But once that one was done the others went together quickly and smoothly. Love the chairs and they look great in my kitchen!", 
    "These chairs are so plush and comfortable. Really well built. Everyone who comes over thinks They are very expensive leather chairs. To the contrary , they were priced right enough for me to buy 2 sets.Love them.Christopher Knight makes a great product. My wife and i both love his products.", 
    "Very nice chairs and well made. The leather is very smooth and soft. Love them so much", 
    "Absolutely love these dining room chairs. Legs were easy to put on and they look so classy.", 
    "Very good quality and easy to put together. I ordered 6 chairs and only one wobbled a bit.", 
    "These matched perfectly with a dining room table that I also purchased from Overstock! Quality was as expected! Hopefully they will last a loooong time!", 
    "Some spacing between the buttons and the upholstery which looks a little weird, but only on one of the chairs. They are very hard to assemble!! In fact, I need to take one apart again because the screw holes DO NOT LINE UP. I will have to figure out how to drill a different angled hole in the wood without wrecking the chair. I would have sent them back if I had kept the box. I wish I had bought something in a store. There are plenty of chairs in stores for the same amount of money that are already assembled.", 
    "We first ordered the other Christopher McKnight chairs... Which came already assembled and were SO much nicer, but too short. So we exchanged for these chairs, which required assembly (even though they were more expensive). Although they look nice, they aren't as nice as the cheaper version, and the area under the chair us stapled and looks cheaply put together because some of it hangs down.", 
    "I bought these chairs, and I luv the way it looks with my contemporary brown table. Easy to install. I first bought some for kinda of pricy and got some discounts from overstock, but that's because I didn't know the chairs were gonna get cheaper. But the last pair I bought I got a good price on it.", 
    "For the price you can't beat these chairs. They go great with my design. They are easy to assemble. We're very happy with the purchase.", 
    "We are very impressed with the over-all quality of these chairs. The style and especially the workmanship exceeded our expectations for the price we paid. This was our first time using Over-Stock.com, but so far, so good!", 
    "Very happy with my purchase. This is my first purchase from overstock and I am quite impressed. The modern look and feel of the chairs is just what I was looking for to add to my dining set. Would highly recommend it.", 
    "Nice chairs. Just as pictured. For the money, an excellent value. Thumbs up."
