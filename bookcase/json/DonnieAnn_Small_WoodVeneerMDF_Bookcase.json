    "I don't know how a company can make a bookshelf so complicated to assemble. The screws didn't fit. The holes didn't line up. We broke it trying to assemble it.", 
    "The book shelf is smaller than I expected, but it is good size for kid. I encountered problem when assemble it. In general it is a ok product.", 
    "The description of the product was misleading, it is not made of wood, it should say composite wood. Only four frame sticks are wood the rest is presswood, veneers. And the shelves are the worst construction-just presswood, brittle that will crumb as soon as some weight would be applied.", 
    "Was nervous at first putting it together, it seemed wobbly. But after tacking the back on and completing the process, it is exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend to anyone looking for a sturdy bookshelf without the price of 100% wood."
