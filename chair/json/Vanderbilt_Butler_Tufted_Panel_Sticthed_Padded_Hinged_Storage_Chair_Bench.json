    "Receieved very quickly. Almost put it together by myself - the interior storage hinge on the bottom had to be completed by my husband. We are using it in our living room beside our dark brown leather sectional, near the front door. We leave our shoes by the door so, not only is it the perfect hiding place for our tennies & boots, but it also provides extra seating for 2 people. AWESOME! Better then any other pice of storage furniture we own - AND the hinge holds the top open until you close it even with pillows/laundry on top.", 
    "We were hoping for the bench to be used in our breakfast nook, on two sides of a table and just under the picture window ledge-NOT an appropriate use for this product. This is more of a small storage bench for an entry or corner of a bedroom- way to small to sit at the average table. Bummer because I loved the upholstery and really don't want to pay the $$ for the \"Coventry\" seating elsewhere.", 
    "This bench was to be used in the kitchen the description says the seat is 18\", not , actually more like 14-15\"., so I have to purchase additional legs and hope they fit. Other than that it is a very cute little bench, made well and keeping my fingers crossed that I can make it work.", 
    "The chair arrived several days prior to the estimated date given upon ordering. However, I was aware of this early arrival because of the tracking provided. The box seems way too small when I first saw it, but the chair disassembled is packed very tightly. The instructions were simple. The chair assembled quickly. It is a good chair; it is slightly closer to the floor than I prefer and it is fairly wide. Two adults can easily sit together, not relax, but sit. I do wish there was some type of retaining mechanism for the back bolster, it comes off rather easily when moving the chair, but not when it is stationary. There is storage under the hinged seat for a blanket or whatever else you would wish to store. Overall, the chair does what it needs to do.", 
    "My husband and I were looking for a pair of chairs for our tiny living room and the two benches we bought are just perfect for our space that can't accommodate full size armchairs. For a put-it-together piece, this seems really sturdy and long lasting, even the hinges. Super easy to assemble, too! It definitely feels like a bench seat... a cushy bench seat, but a bench nonetheless. It is compact yet roomy for the sitter and at a good height. The storage is a wonderful bonus for toys, throw blankets or shoes. And the faux leather looks more expensive than it is.", 
    "Ultimately I was very happy with the chair. It is sturdy, big, comfortable even for two people, and the storage is amazing!", 
    "We bought these for our bedroom instead of two chairs. I liked the storage underneath the seats. There were instructions but they are HORRIBLE. Basically, \"put legs on and attach the hinges for the seat to lift\". They didn't show HOW to attach the hinges. So, just be ready for that. Once assembled, they look great. They are NOT comfortable at all. Very stiff. We wont really be sitting in them (mostly for decoration) so we don't really care how uncomfortable they are. But, if you are looking for comfort I would say look elsewhere.", 
    "THE BUTLER STORAGE BENCH IS MADE VERY POORLY AND I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED IT IF I HAD SEEN IT. THE OVERALL SIZES ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN DESCRIBED. IT IS A TOY MADE FOR A KID'S ROOM. IT IS LOWER TO THE GROUND, AND SMALLER OVERALL. IT IS NOT TRUE MICROFIBER BUT A CHEAPER VERSION. I SENT IT BACK AND $22. WAS DEDUCTED FOR SHIPPING. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM. BUYER BEWARE.", 
    "I was so excited to get my chairs the reviews all said how great the chair was. The chair is not that great, the idea is great but the chair is not. They go together really easy but you have a fifty fifty chance that you won't have the same gap I had on one of my chairs due to the screw holes being slightly off. The quality is a little less than I expected as well as the comfort. The legs are made of black plastic and look extremely cheap. Just over all I would purchase these again or recommend to anyone to purchase them, extremely disappointed DO NOT BUY", 
    "Very disappointed in the quality and finish, I definitely would not buy it if I first saw it in a furniture store.", 
    "I like the idea of this storage chair but was disappointed that the cushion needs some type of support installed. It looks great and is very useful but be prepared to make a little adaption to the cushion.", 
    "easy to put together but not comfortable at all. I had to put a cushion just to sit on it comfortably. Very disappointed in this, it looked really comfy but looks were deceiving on this one. It will probably go in the bedroom for my husband to lay his clothes on.", 
    "Product was poor quality and small parts were in torn old plastic ripped bags that scattered throughout box. The backrest didn't align with ottoman base therefore unable to assemble. The worst part was trying to contact overstock to return product. Phone number inoperable and emails no reply. Fortunately, I had Google trust protection and they took care of everything. Overstock promptly contacted me and email UPS return label and we boxed and shipped bench back and immediately got credited the refund.", 
    "While this is a cute little storage bench to hold my son's toys, the dark brown in the picture is ridiculously dark or I was sent the black in error. I bought the dark brown leather look but I really believe this bench was sent in black. It doesn't even closely match our existing dark brown furniture however, it does match a black leather sofa we have in another room. I spoke with customer service and that was not helpful. I was told they show I was sent the dark brown. I know what I have and it's not dark brown. For the price, I should have received the correct color but like the style and function so, I'll make it work. Just be prepared to receive someone else's interpretation of dark brown.", 
    "Overall the chair bench as expected. However the feet maker the bench sit too low. So I purchased some wood 4.5 inch sofa feet from ebay and now it is perfect. The feet that come with it are plastic and cheap. I expexted I would have to replace the feet of the bench. Worked out great. The Bench was not hard to put together. I did it myself and I am 68 years old", 
    "I knew buying it that it was just a faux leather seat for the entryway. It is not the quality I would like but I also know it will hardly be used so I didn't need the quality. Serves it's purpose. Easy to assemble and looks like it's pictured.", 
    "Shipping was fast. The chair was well wrapped and protected. The instructions are clear and the chair is very easy to put together. The chair is very sturdy, solid, and most comfortable. I recommend the chair.", 
    "The chair is not too comfortable and thus the low rating. Easy to assemble. The first chair that came in was defective, and Overstock made it super simple to return the item and replaced it before i even had a chance to return the defective one. Great cutover service. Chair is nice looking and suits the place that i purchased it for.", 
    "Easy to assemble, very cute. Not very comfortable for long sitting.", 
    "There is a gap of about 2 inches at the base/bottom of the back rest. And the seat pretrudes about 1.5 inches from the base. The seat and the base are not aligned.", 
    "We have the beige against the wall in the living room and it stores extra pillows plus the overflow seating if needed. Finish is nice", 
    "Will be grabbing more .............\ud83d\udc4c", 
    "i bought this for the entry way of my home for people to take off and put on their shoes (no shoes in my house). i store socks and slippers for my guests in the storage section. it's really comfy and the perfect size. the sage color accents the rug and living room furniture. perfect little chair. a bit pricey, but i still like it.", 
    "Ordered 2 of these as extra seating in our family room since the dogs take up the whole sectional couch we have. The brown leather look is perfect and matches our couch almost perfect. I'm a female and put both of these together by myself in 45min. The only down side is the one chair came with wrong screws so I had to use a screw driver instead of the Allen wrench it came with. The other chair had 1 out of 8 screws that was completely different, so the one chair only has 3 screws in one of the latches (each latch takes 4 screws). I'm not too worried about it since I won't be using them much for storage just seating.", 
    "This is good for storage of blankets. Not deep. I wouldn't sit on it for any length of time. Maybe to tie your shoe.", 
    "We have this placed along the wall near the door to the large walk-in closet. While it's not an expensive piece of investment furniture, it serves our purpose and was easily assembled. The extra storage space is nice for bulky bed linens.", 
    "So nicely made. Storage hinge stays open until you close it so it doesn't shut on your hand", 
    "I ordered this chair because I needed something small for a small room but also had storage. The box was all beat up and a little knick on one of the base stands but it all turned out fine. I am very tempted to order one more this color and one larger for my bed room. All in all, I loved it", 
    "It seems sturdy and simple to assemble. Though they provided an \"allen key\" and it required a phillips screw driver to assemble.", 
    "This item has excellent storage and extra seating when you need it.", 
    "It was exactly as pictured, arrived when I was told. Very easy to assemble and is used in my son's room as a game chair and then he is able to store extra games and remotes in the storage seat. perfect!!!", 
    "We got a burgundy chair for our RV and it fit perfectly where it had to go and gave us a lot of extra storage. Any spots wipe off easily with water or upholstery cleaner. We loved it but sold it with the RV.", 
    "I was pleased with this hair. It adds storage for all the comfy blankets I have collected.", 
    "Comfy Seat and Great place to stow away toys. Nice plush feel and great little piece. Great rich color. I love this piece!! It was perfect!", 
    "It serves it's purpose. I like the storage it provides.", 
    "Comfortable to sit on and great storage. I had to convince the kinds not to hide in them for hide and seek.", 
    "This is just right to store my granddaughters' toys for when they come to visit. I bought the grey one and looks great with the d\u00e9cor.", 
    "It looks better than it sits but I still love it. The size and look are perfect for our living room. Ever so easy to assemble!", 
    "I had a pretty small space that was not being utilized and I found this chair and it fits perfect! Great quality glad I got it!", 
    "It was smaller than what I expected. Good enough to add some extra seating. But, don't expect someone to sit for long periods.", 
    "If you plan on using this for seating for a long period of time i do not recomended. It feels like you are seating on a box. Its also very small even the largest one is very small it's not meant for 2 people to seat comfortably.", 
    "It was poorly/cheaply made. Waste of money and time.", 
    "This chair came packaged very ni ely and putting it together was quick and easy. I was suprised at the amount of stuff I was able to fit in the storage area. It's not the most comfortable chair, but for the price it is well worth it.", 
    "There is no support in teh bench. We returned it.", 
    "The chair was easy to put together and is very attractive. It is also very comfortable. I was notified that the chair had been delivered but did not receive it from FedEx. I notified overstock and they tracked it down quickly.", 
    "The piece is not quality. Bottom of the storage unit is not even attached. Terrible material, overall very cheap", 
    "Love the seat, but the very first time I opened the lid, one of the hinges broke and cannot be repaired. Seeking help from the manufacturer for replacement hinges.", 
    "Great ottoman/chair with lots of storage for a narrow area.", 
    "Size perfect....nice amount of storage...faux leather color for brown is very dark chocolate brown. Still have not figured how to put hinges on as there are no clear directions as to which way they are to be placed. Arrived with 14\" x 5\" oil stain on the seating area. Too big to send back.", 
    "great chair for the price", 
    "I brought this chair in gray the color is nice and the storage is a bonus. The negative thing about this chair is it's a little hard not the most comfortable chair.", 
    "Chair not very sturdy, and although children shouldn't be leaping upon it, it was almost immediately broken after it had arrived. No support under seat.", 
    "Holds a lot. Using it in home office. Works great", 
    "i just received my storage bench and i am really disappointing, it looks really old, the color and everything. Legs are plastic and poor quality. I guess it was my mistake to believe that i would received something really good for that price.", 
    "This chair is easily put together out of the box, but the seat itself is very flimsy. You can feel the framework through the minimal cushioning. It feels like it will sag and dent in a short time if used by an adult. I would recommend that this be used only as storage or the occasional seat for a child.", 
    "I got two in brown for my camper dinette area, they are perfect!! Ample storage underneath.", 
    "This is good storage but it is not very attractive. It looks like a bench seat in a car. Mine is a brown vinyl. It has held up well, though", 
    "Very useful, especially with the storage beneath the seat.", 
    "My grandson likes this storage chair for his bedroom. Stores all of his chargers and adapters.", 
    "This bench was easy to assemble, took me about 20 minutes. Looks even better in person, great value.", 
    "Fantastic item! Plus the storage area makes it so practical. I have it in my music room near the piano. Love it!", 
    "This fabric is sturdy and I believe it will stand the test of time by my 10 year old. The added storage feature is a huge plus to store away games and magazines. Purchased in the 24\", which is durable; however I should have opted for a little bigger! Love it!!!!!!", 
    "I use this in my living room to hide the kids toys. It works great in this otherwise adult space.", 
    "Arrived in excellent condition. I found that the screw on chair legs were too wide for the bottom of the chair and stuck out on all 4 sides. Called the company and they sent me a new narrower set of legs which are perfect. Thank you!", 
    "I bought four of our family ministry center. Just like the matching ottoman, the benches are holding up really well in the midst of lots of use. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the are a bit too low.", 
    "I think this chair/bench is a good piece of furniture for any room that needs a place to put anything down or to sit when putting your shoes on.", 
    "I wasn't expecting anything great but this is the worst... Very cheap and extremely uncomfortable!!", 
    "bought for extra seating in my living room. nice addition. don't know how sturdy it is. looks good and matches my couch well", 
    "I ordered this bench for a small living room space. Upon opening the box I was pleased at how well and compact it was sent out for shipping. I purchased the Leather Look Brown. It was easy to assemble, even with the instructions for placing the hinges missing. I was done with assembly in 10 minutes. The leather look of the material and construction leaves a little more to be desired considering the price. The piece should be half of what overstock is selling it for. Not uncomfortable to sit on but defiantly gives you that ottoman feeling. Overall a cute piece and quick solution. If the price was marked closer to the look of the foundation then it would be a hit.", 
    "Back needs more support; seat needs more cushion you can feel the wood when you sit on it. I bought different legs to use with dining table and added cushion to make it more comfortable. For price it was a good buy.", 
    "7 min 46 sec.....From box to display....thats how long it took me to put this together. That is my kind of furniture. All I can say is wow!! I truly feel I got an awesome deal. Color is great. Size is perfect. The storage is just another added bonus to the deal!", 
    "This is perfect for our toddler son's room!! We got the blue which is a lighter navy shade but darker than pictured. It's a nice color. The height is great, he can climb up on it and it's large enough for one of us to sit on and read with him. The storage is an added bonus!! Very simple/basic assembly. It's not very comfortable but meets our needs. Definitely would recommend for a child's room or entry/hallway but not necessarily as living room furniture.", 
    "I had hoped this piece would be larger than it was, but had a hard time imagining sizing when I bought it. I wanted extra seating in my living room, so this gives it without taking up too much room, but it does sit closer to the ground than the rest of my furniture. I do still use it, and I find the storage area very convenient for extra sheets and pillows when someone stays the night. But if I had to do it over again, I might not buy it.", 
    "Very fast shipping and arrival. Excellent quality. Additional tools not necessary to assemble. Reuires three hands (or four) to get hinges on and aligned well but very straightforward with no tricks. Looks great. Serves our purpose as a storage/dressing chair in my wife's California Closet. Highly recommended.", 
    "This is the cheapest piece of furniture I have ever seen. Bought it and shipped to my son for a spare bedroom. He just laughed when he sent me a picture and said it looks like a piece of poorly made kids furniture!! I didn't get to see it in person before he threw the packing away or it would have been shipped directly back to Overstock!!!", 
    "I needed a storage bench for a small area and this fit the bill. I had read the other reviews and agree that it is not very soft. It had a good sized storage area and it opens and closes easily and conveniently. Good value for the pirce", 
    "Great for a kids room.. storage is great to have for their on special things..", 
    "This item is very easy to put together. The faux leather is soft and the color is bold. The only thing I would change is the overall height. If you have a bench with a back it needs to me taller.", 
    "The product is great for storage or utility use. This bench is not for casual lounging. Bought it to use as reading chair but it's not that comfortable. It would be great for an entry way. The style is great and it looks good once assembled.", 
    "It is a nice bench for an entry way to store winter accessories, hats, mittens, scarves, etc. and to sit while you remove your boots, shoes or the rest your tired feet. I use it to store CDs, DVDs and as a rest stop in my Foyer.....great seating/storing idea.", 
    "Pretty good storage bench. I ordered the black leather one and it is nice. It came pretty quick. The only downside is the instructions. The images looked like they were not copied well, so you can barely make out what you need to do. I had to come back on here and look at the bench opened to see where to put the hinges. Also, the instructions said there were 4 bolts on each side, only included 6 total, so 3 on each side. If you make it through that, it is worth it. Plenty of storage for a bench. Great for a small office.", 
    "Nice chair for my need in the bedroom. Used for storage mostly. Easy to put together. Not very comfortable as a chair, too hard but it looks nice.", 
    "This product looks much cheaper than it does in the picture. It is also extremely small and looks like something that belongs in a children's bedroom or video game room. It definitely does not look like a high quality item, even for the fairly low price. The assembly instructions are not clear, although it is a basic assembly and is still fairly easy to assemble. One positive thing I will say is that I received it very fast (less than 48 hours after placing my order, even though I selected the standard shipping of 5-8 business days). Would not recommend this item for anything other than a game room/kid's bedroom.", 
    "Not as heavy-duty as I originally expected, but serves my need. The storage space is very nice.", 
    "Small, simple and compact. The storage area is roomy. It is short and not extremely comfortable. But a good value for small spacing, extra storage, simple design.", 
    "The color was much more of a navy grey blue than a bright cobalt which we were seeking. The item arrived quickly, and was well packaged. However, the seat dimensions were quite off. The seat was close to three inches lower than listed, and much lower than one could get in and out of comfortably, let alone someone with bad knees. I was also disappointed in the quality of the craftsmanship, and materials. Just because it was inexpensive doesn't mean that it had to be cheap.", 
    "My kids love it. It is a little smaller than I expected it to be. However it works and for the price I think it is reasonable.", 
    "We got the \"leather\" in dark brown (looks almost black). It looks leather-ish, there's enough room for two people to sit on it, and there's lots of space inside. It might not quite be sturdy enough to sit on all day everyday (since the interior is hollow), but overall it is well-made, not flimsy, and a good company seat. Also, my 3-year-old daughter had decided she likes to nap on it, so it serves multiple purposes (just like I wanted).", 
    "Very cute and the right size. I love the storage area it waa more than enough. Very study too", 
    "I thought it would be much softer to sit on but the construction and function just doesn't allow it. I probably would have not purchased if I knew it was going to be so stiff to sit on.", 
    "Easy to put together, not so soft however, but it fits the purpose.", 
    "assembly is a breeze.nice designg,suited for small spaces.not so much cushion on the seat and backrest.ample storage under the seat.", 
    "has a nice look. reminded me of a futon I had once with storage. but not a seat I can use comfortably a little extra padding in backrest and in seat (\"lid\") would have gone a long way to improve the design.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised when I received this chair. The color was perfect and so was the size!", 
    "Needed seating in my small living space and the great thing about this chair is the storage. Already have stuff hidden. It's not the best and most comfy chair, but the color options were outstanding and doing the most with the space that I have was key. Just wonder how the hollowed out chair bottom will do over time of people sitting on them....hmmm.", 
    "My daughter has an area in her living room she wanted a bookcase and a seat with storage. This bench was perfect because she didn't want either piece to dominate the area. The color, fabric and size is perfect for what she wanted .", 
    "This Butler Chair with storage fits perfectly in my bedroom. It was easy to assemble with all the tools included. The storage area under the seat is large. It looks like real leather. Adds a classy look to my bedroom!", 
    "This is wonderful and for the price. What I was really please with was the many colors it comes in. I plan to purchse another one or two.", 
    "I liked this so well I ordered a second. They are in my guest room. They work well for storage and for sitting, should my guests need to sit to dress or to watch TV. They are close to the ground. Some reviewers have purchased longer legs. Not necessary for me to do so. They work very well for my needs.", 
    "Good product, good size (I wanted). Styel is good.", 
    "Nice chair to complement a couch also purchased and fits in their tiniy tiny apt", 
    "When my three year old granddaughter comes to visit, which is often, she wants me to be with her in the \"play room\" which is our smallest bedroom. I was using a beanbag chair to sit in so I didn't have to sit on the floor which gets uncomfortable on old bones after awhile. However, one time she jumped in the beanbag and slung her head back and hit her head on the windowsill pretty hard. So I wanted to find a bench to serve several purposes: go in front of the window to protect her head, storage for some of the toys, and a place for me to sit. I looked at quite a number of storage benches, and was trying to decide between a few when I saw this upholstered one with a back. Quite a selection of colors as well. Am I ever glad I found this bench. I thought the cushion seemed a little stiff at first and was worried it wouldn't be comfy, but it is very comfortable. I can sit back and relax which is great. I sat in it a lot over the last two days and am extremely happy with this purchase. Very sturdy as my 225 lb. husband any my 145 lb. self sat on it at the same time and it didn't groan at all under the weight. Since the room is rather tiny, it also made it look so much less cluttered without the toy bins and beanbag (which actually took up more space than I realized). Any my granddaughter thinks it's her little couch and loves it as well. I am so super, super pleased with this purchase. Color was great and true to the picture. Very easy to assemble. Lid of bench opens and closes easily. It also stays up and doesn't try to fall shut until you shut it. Highly recommend this product.", 
    "This product is very small. I believe it would be great to use in a child's room for storage and seating, but that is it. It sits maybe 1.5 feet off the ground and it hard as a rock. The storage compartment is s decent size, and would be usable if you could get passed the smallness.", 
    "Just as described in the ad. It is easy to assemble.", 
    "This product was defective and dirty from the box. One screw would not go in, but the top still opens. It has a hard back,not so comfortable. Even my 9 year old son said its not so comfortable. I read the reviews before purchasing, I am wondering what the others were thinking!!! It is a seat, it does have storage. It is not too nice to look at and it is definately not comfortable to sit on or lean on. I am planning to buy a pillow or something to help it out. ***BUYER BEWARE*** SAVE YOUR MONEY.", 
    "Good overall quality. A little difficult to assemble, but good instructions were in the box. The shipping boxes were well designed to protect the product.", 
    "This is a nice little storage bench. We bought it for our den and it fits the spot perfectly. It would also be a nice piece for a child's room as it is short and low to the floor with the added benefit of the storage under the seat. It is also comfortable to sit on. Our kitty loves to sit on it too and it is easy to clean off her hair due to the microfiber covering. It came well packaged with no damage. It was also very easy to put together, only took about 30 minutes. Would recommend this nice bench for extra seating in a small space and some extra storage. The storage compartment is quite generous.", 
    "I ordered a brown and a black storage bench. The brown one looks just like the black one. It would have been nice if it was the same shade as shown on your site. It has amazing storage space. It assembled very easily and did not take alot of time.", 
    "The chair is like a small odd shaped chair and not a love seat. It is very low to the ground (too low) which makes it look so odd in a room. We bought it for a living room, but we had to move it to a child's room since it looks like children's furniture --very low to the ground and odd shaped like a large seat with a small back.", 
    "I order frequently from Overstock.com and love most of their products...this is the exception. I got this to put in a home office for extra seating and bonus storage...The unit is extremely uncomfortable to sit on for any length of time... Hardly any cushioning. Material is very thin and structure is cheaply made. I am keeping the unit to avoid return shipping charges...but I would not recommend purchasing this unit if you have any intentions of using it to sit on...only for storage. Also, very small...looks much bigger on site.", 
    "Comfortable little bench with a good amount of storage. Likes it so much I ordered a second one.", 
    "It was smaller then expected. For this price I could have found something better.", 
    "We bought two of these to replace the 4 dinette chairs in our RV. It makes a cozy eating nook now with the 2 benches and the existing table!! We do need to order higher legs for the benches.", 
    "i really like this product perfect for what i intended to use it for", 
    "Prior to purchasing this item I was going to buy something very similar on another site. It's bench had the same weight and dimensions however it was also more expensive. I got the same item, same dimensions for less than half and I'm please with it. It has great storage and two people can sit on it. It's sturdy and just what I needed. I'm pleased. It works for me.", 
    "This product was quite a bit smaller than the specified measurements as we measured specifically for one certain area of our home. It still serves the basic purpose of our intended purchase; however, the difference in the size was a little disappointing.", 
    "It was very easy to build and the storage area is perfect- more space than I thought it would be- great for entry way or under window -", 
    "It's a bit cheap looking. Would not have bought it if I saw it in the store.", 
    "Great product and easy to put together. They look great on either side of the fireplace and the extra storage is wonderful. My only complaint is the funky, mothball-like odor (we got the leather-look). It is quite strong and after a week, it hasn't decreased a bit. Since they are the leather-look type, I don't think there is anything to use to deodorize them (any suggestions?).", 
    "Love the color and everything else about it. Glad we bought it. We just received it yesterday & put it together a few hours ago.", 
    "Very easy to assemble, the color of fabric closely mathed that which was pictured. The storage portion isn't that big, but enough to keep things organized. Big enough for two average sized people to sit on and sturdy enough that it did't feel it was going to collapse.", 
    "I am very pleased... received today... put together myself before my husband even got home from work... Nice peice of extra furniture for my living room. If you want a reasonable, nice and easy to put together furniture... I STRONGLY recommend.", 
    "Great chair with lots of storage space. Filled a wine room with these and they look great. Perfect size, very comfortable.", 
    "Light weight enough to put together alone Xmas Eve after Midnight. Great storage and functional. Comfortable for its size and is a great item in our Man Cave. I LOVE the storage in bench combo. It goes well with the mini square footstool/end table storage combo.", 
    "The chair was exactly what I needed. Great price. Great color. Comfortable and easy to assemble.", 
    "THIS BENCH WAS NOT IST QUALITY, BUT OVERALL LOOKS GOOD. THERE WHERE NAILS POCKING THRU THE INSIDE OF STORAGE AND NO SCREWS TO PUT THE HINGES ON. MY HUSBAND FIXED THE PIECE AND WE DID KEEP IT - BUT WAS NOT FIRST QUALITY.", 
    "OK product for the the cost. Nothing much to it. Price was good for what it is."
