    "The sleeper sofa is modern, sleek and comfortable (for small frame people). For $340, this sofa is exceeding my expectation. Be sure to pay attention to the cleanliness of your hands, it can leave marks on it easily. It did when my husband was assembling it.", 
    "I ut received my futon sleeper sofa bed. I love the contemporary style, size, and weight. I also love that it took me less than 20 minutes to attach the legs. It's a perfect size for an apartment living room or office. I didn't give it 5 stars because the white bonded leather material is thin and picks up dirt from hands and it's not so easy to clean with water and cloth. I hope they'd make the material a little thicker.", 
    "This piece is more of a looker, than a useful piece of furniture. Don't get me wrong, someone can sleep on it, but not very comfortably. I had to buy a mattress pad for it, because I was too embarrassed to let my guest sleep on this hard futon. I don't get many guests, so it's okay in case of an unexpected one here and there. Otherwise, its a pretty piece to look at, and does a fair job as a couch."
