    "As I said in the title\u2026we look and look and then look some more and could not find something we liked that could fit our budget. You know, you like many things but when you look at the price tag, the entire paycheck will go to pay for the table. The table we chose from Overstock seemed really pretty so we took a chance. we have a large family and a nice area to display and purchased the 96\". Table arrived yesterday and it is absolutely beautiful. I can tell you it is 100% solid wood, there are no tricks here. The base is made in metal and well done and well finish. There was a tiny area that had a chip from shipping but it was way up and I know our kids are going to scratch the heck out of this table in just a few months so we are ok with it. Our plan was to fit 10 people and that will be easily accomplished.We love our new table!!", 
    "Don't have words to describe how beautiful this table is. We ordered the brown finish I think it is called cognac but not sure. The finish is well done and the live edge is very subtle but looks great.The base is the main reason why we purchased the table. The way this table is built you can move the base on your own and re-drill the base to accommodate your chairs so that you get the right number on the side. We were able to get 8 chairs on the 72 inch table by moving the legs closer together.All in all we are super happy and thankful the table made it before Christmas!!"
