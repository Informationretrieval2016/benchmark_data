    "This couch was very easy to assemble, and looks great. It's very sleek, and the back is easy to fold down in order to use the couch as a bed. I would definitely recommend it.", 
    "This futon is the best I have seen in quality for the price... Pleasantly surprised by the color as well..... Great Buy!", 
    "This is a pretty decent couch for what you pay for it. Great to convert to the bed for guests (good reviews on that so far from them) and good for sitting on to relax. Only thing that is not so great are the arms...we attached them as tightly as possible and they seem kind of loose still, but they hold up fine when you lean up against them. Overall a great couch.", 
    "This is not super comfortable but futon option is great and looks nice.", 
    "The leg broke on the couch in less than a month. My husband was sitting on it reading and that side of the couch collapsed. Don't buy this product.", 
    "Like the futon. I wish it were taller.", 
    "If I could go back in time, I wouldn't purchase this particular futon...while it looks nice, it isn't really comfortable and certainly isn't comfortable to sleep on. I live in a studio and was hoping this could serve as a bed as well as a couch and it's one of the worst things to sleep on and now have to think about whether to give this away or purchase another bed. I can't see this futon lasting particularly long either...I'd recommend looking at other options.", 
    "looks just like the pic, and easy to put together...did it with my 15 year old daughter in less than an hour. but its very uncomfortable to sit on, and no one could ever sleep on this. hoping it softens up over time.", 
    "The first thing I was disappointed about after setting this couch up was that the back is not upholstered like the front. It just has the basic black fabric you see on the bottoms of furniture. Since I bought this to go in the middle of my living room (not against a wall), I had to find a blanket to go on the back to cover it. Probably my fault for not looking closely at the pictures.The couch is not overly comfy. It's pretty hard and obviously cheaply made (you get what you pay for).One thing I do like is that it folds down so easily, and that it also folds up in the middle to make moving easy, which is nice if you're a renter.As far as the futon part, don't expect to sleep more than one person or anyone over 6' on it.", 
    "worth the money good quality for the price"
