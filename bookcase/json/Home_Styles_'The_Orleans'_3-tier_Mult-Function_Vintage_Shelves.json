    "I purchased this piece to serve as a media console in our master bedroom sitting area, and it's perfect for this purpose. The top is deep enough to provide a solid base for our 32\" flat screen television. The build itself is quite sturdy, and the lower shelves, though not as deep, provide just enough space to house the DVR/cable box, our Blu-Ray player, some DVD/Blu-Ray cases, books and knick-knacks. Standing roughly counter height, the top of the unit is situated perfectly to see the television from our bed in the neighboring master bedroom. Putting the unit together was simple and took about one hour. I've read that some people had a hard time lining up holes with the crossbars, but I was able to easily make this work by putting pressure on one leg with my body and lining up the other crossbar and leg by pushing with my arms. This is one of the best ready-to-assemble pieces of furniture I've ever purchased, primarily because it doesn't look like an RTA piece. I give it four stars because there were some dents and dings in the materials, but they were all in places that would not be visible when the piece was assembled. I would absolutely recommend this unit to anyone who needs elegant looking storage.", 
    "I purchased this shelf for my children's media room to store DVDs, books etc. The shelf is very large and sturdy, it was very easy to put together. I put it together without any help and it didn't take a very long time. The shelves are stable and the unit is very sturdy.", 
    "This is a very well made set of shelves.", 
    "I bought this to go with the kitchen island. It looks great next to it. The finish is a touch darker but it really blends well. This is sturdy and holds a lot!", 
    "Great purchase, very sturdy and easy to put together.", 
    "Luv them great quality. Easily assembled", 
    "I didn't really know what to expect so I thought I'd give it a try. The bookshelves are pretty sturdy for the price and they are also astheticaly pleasing. They weren't that difficult to put together and are easy to move. The four out of five stars are because they aren't the best quality but they are much better than I expected for the price. I would recommend them.",
