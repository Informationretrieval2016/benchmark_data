    "I searched for months for the right chair to place in my master bedroom reading nook. This chair is just as beautiful in person as it is portrayed online. It does have a very low back, so make sure you pay attention to the dimensions. The seat is deep and perfect for curling up in to read. I know it's called Beige, however I found it to be more of a Greige color, very neutral and would go well with warm or cool colors. The tracking process could be better, I wasn't ever aware it had been shipped (the tracking link never worked) until I received a phone call from the local warehouse asking for a date/time to deliver it. It's very heavy and the quality is fantastic. The supplied throw pillow is rather small and not supportive, so I will be replacing it with something more substantial. Other than that, a great purchase! One final note, the velvet pile is very low and not quite as plush as I had thought it would be...the upside to that is there are no marks to indicate where you have been sitting once you get up. Love, love, love this chair.", 
    "I purchased two of these armchairs with the matching sofa. Overall I like the quality of material used. Fabric is very soft and feels very nice however since it is velvet it looks different depending on where you are looking at it and the lightening. Under daylight it is close to the color in the pictures however still quite darker than those. At nights it is really close to a grey tone. I didn't really mind the color being a bit different, that is typical with online purchases. However, I wouldn't recommend for someone who would expect what they see on the pictures. Overall, they are very comfortable and compared to the similar ******* **** ones, they are easily half the price."
