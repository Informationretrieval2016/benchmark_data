    "This is the most beautiful couch ever and I get compliments by everyone who sees it. It is a solid well built large piece with soft microfiber upholstery and completely elevates the den we put it in I looked at multiple furniture stores for months and couldn't find anything like it and am very happy with this couch. That being said my issue comes from the seat within one week vertical stripes started to develop on the seat cushion like the foam inside is breaking down. For the price Im disappointed that the seat doesn't seem to be holding up. We've only had this couch for a month and barely use the couch in the room it's in and the seat has permanent vertical indentations like it's been used for years if I would have found this couch in a store I would have bought it but I could have called them to come look at the seat cushion within days of buying to see what it was doing unfortunately no one to look at seat when buying online and now I've bought a second new couch that hasn't arrived yet and I'm nervous about spending all this money on online furniture that I don't have any recourse with issues.", 
    "The couch is beautiful. However it is not SILVER as it says in the description. This couch is clearly BEIGE. I was so disappointed when it was delivered because it does not match my decor at all. The couch is very soft and comfortable. It is just not the right color.", 
    "I bought this sofa in November 2014. I sat down on it right after Xmas to read a book and I just heard the frame cracking. When i looked down i could see where it cracked and I was impressed by how week is the wood frame just by touching it. I called Overstock and I was told this product has no warranty so if you want to go through an nightmare, Furniture of America is your option - go for it!", 
    "I love the sofa, just as pictured. only problem very hard to get packing that is nailed to frame off, pliers and strong man will come in handy.looks awesome in my spare bedroom. Yes I would recommend this sofa, the purple is very pretty and the throw pillows are great quality and pretty good size.", 
    "Its a great piece. Pls look at the dimentions as its quite large piece of furniture. But looks elegant in a large living. Its also quite wide in depth. So you gotto have coustions at back to sit comfortably.", 
    "The color has heavy tones of gray, not a bright ivory as it appears in the picture. But it's lovely and very comfortable.", 
    "The chair is a show piece, I don't want anyone sitting on my fabulous chair. I purchased the purple color which is rich and royal in texture and tone.", 
    "I ordered this sofa and loved it. The style, fabric, and workmanship is excellent and it has bling on it! The fabric is very soft and the tufting is gorgeous. The couch was delivered without any problems and looks great in the room. The color is very nice, however, it does have grey undertones like the reviews say. It is not a true ivory but nevertheless it is beautiful! I loved it so much I ordered the loveseat as well.", 
    "Didn't realize the couch has bling on it. I guess I'm used to it now I have fallen in love with it. It is very comfortable"
