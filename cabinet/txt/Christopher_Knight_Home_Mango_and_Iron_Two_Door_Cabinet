Finished in a striking contrast of Deesa Natural and Dark Mango, this cabinet is a bold blend of rustic and contemporary elements. The one-piece U-shaped legs, oversized bar pull hardware, and circle-diamond patterned door panels are all smart complements to the straight lines and natural wood frame. Inside, two full shelves maximize storage space.
