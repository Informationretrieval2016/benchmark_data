    "The legs were stored inside the bottom of the seat which threw me for a loop initially. Instructions led me there! Easy to assemble. Looks great. The color is brownish gray which was fine with me. Price was right. Overstock employees very helpful.", 
    "Beautiful and clever packing, to begin with. It is exactly how I pictured it, fits perfectly my office, perfect fabric and right \"not too soft\" cushion for the office. Not giving it 5 stars because the middle section is sagging a little, I'm not going to fuss about it and I have no idea how to fix it except by putting some piece of cardboard under that middle leg. But I got to see this crooked line all the time! And the slightly widening crack between the pillows is hidden behind the coffee table on the picture. I could debate the leg design, but I already knew it when placing the order. Other than that, looks expensive, love it.", 
    "Feels like a park bench. It's not falsely advertised at all. Looks exactly how it is but you get what you pay for. The inclination settings are awkward, there's a position between 90 degrees and its first locking angle that's perfect but it doesn't lock there. You're either sitting with a straight back or leaned like a cholo. My advice, buy a couch in a store where you can try it like I'm about to do.", 
    "We needed a smaller piece of furniture that doubled as a bed and fit our budget. This works! It's stiff for sleeping, but comfortable as a couch. I would not recommend for all the time sleeping, but as a guest bed it serves.", 
    "very hard, uncomfortable, not for sleeping and barely sitting for longer than short intervals. this is not made for lounging.", 
    "Just what we wanted. It is perfect. A little tricky to put together but all went well in the end.", 
    "This futon was extremely easy to assemble but the cushions are not soft and comfortable. I was not happy with that aspect of the futon so I returned it.", 
    "Everything that unexpected. I sleep well on it.", 
    "I wanted a futon for one of the spare bedrooms/office in our house so while my husband was on the computer I could go in there and have somewhere to sit while I bug him, lol. It's MUCH nicer than a regular futon, so we ended up putting it in our family room (since we still needed to buy a couch for there anyway). It is a little firm, but I've noticed firm couches/mattresses/chairs tend to last longer, so I'm totally fine with it. Plus, we're not the type of people to just sit and watch T.V. for hours. It looks great and is really nice on the eyes!"
