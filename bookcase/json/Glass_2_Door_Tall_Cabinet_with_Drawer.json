    "The box & contents within appear intimidating. However once I set out all the pieces & followed the directions carefully, I was very happy! Nice piece for the money. If you don't like fancy furniture prices, & if you can provide a little elbow grease on your behalf, this may be for you! If you build the cabinet all alone, expect to spend a couple hours, but the time and effort pays off in a really nice piece! :)"
