    "Very easy to assemble, and I'm a 65 yr old woman...It took 90 minutes to do it by myself. I really Love this bookcase.", 
    "This is working out great in my son's room. It fits nicely between his desk and the closet. The color is awesome.", 
    "this little bookcase was easy to put together ( although you do need two people ) and it looks great ... I love it !!! it is solid & sturdy !!!", 
    "Fairly easy assembly and sturdy enough for heavy books", 
    "assembly was simple, but the instructions could have provided a few more details about some of the fasteners.", 
    "I bought 2 other furniture pieces from Overstock which I assembled by myself, no problem. This bookcase challenged both my husband & myself. Finally assembled, it's unstable; the shelves will fall down if we put books on them. What a disaster! Now I guess I go through the process of returning them (I bought 2). So disgusted.", 
    "I expected the color to be a little lighter. ....more like the picture", 
    "This is a beautiful mission style bookcase in a warm wood color--excellent instructions make it as easy to put together as a Lego set.", 
    "Purchase this bookcase for a gift for grandson for his college books.It is made well and easy to put together", 
    "This shelf was the perfect size for what I needed! I was so excited because the color in the picture was also the perfect match. However, the finish was much darker than pictured. That was disappointing but I decided the piece was of good quality so I kept it. Perhaps a more accurate picture should be shown. Overall I was happy with my purchase.", 
    "A nice bookcase for our bedroom wall. It was very easy to assemble.I believe there were only nine pieces total. The back was most time consuming as they used small screws instead of small nails. A very nice addition to our house.Were pleased.", 
    "The only reason I gave this 4 rather than 5 stars is because the directions are not stellar...easy to make a mistake when putting it together.", 
    "Easy to assemble, took about twenty minutes. The bookcase sits nicely and looks far more expensive than it was. A good addition to my arts and crafts style living room.", 
    "It is well-made, sturdy and only took my husband about an hour to put together. Just what we were looking for!", 
    "Nice book case. Easy assembly. Color is a bit darker than it looks in the images.", 
    "Excellent addition to my study corner.", 
    "This bookshelf was easy to assemble and took about 45 minutes. All the pieces fit together well. It is stained darker than the picture but works well where I have placed it. It is sturdy and well made. I am pleased with this purchase.", 
    "It's difficult to find decent bookcases anymore. Surprisingly, the assembly instructions were accurate. This is a good value, and I may purchase another one.", 
    "Assembly was impossible and inaccurate - we sent it back. It looks great in the picture and cheap in person. Don't buy!", 
    "I ordered this bookcase and received it within two days. I had to put it together, but the instructions and packaging made it very easy. It looks wonderful and the quality is great. I couldn't be happier."
