    "This set looks sharp and is easy to assemble. Sitting in it is very uncomfortable. Short leg support and seating is very upright. Not recommeded.", 
    "The set is on the small side.. Great for tight spaces. Have a power drill bit or plan on spending 2-21/2 hours with the tool given. Well packed. Nor well suited for larger than average body types .", 
    "The wicker furniture is beautiful and the quality is excellent. You do need two people to assembly however it is very easy. Love looking at the set on my deck!!", 
    "Unfortunately, the cushions stained after the first light rain. These are supposed to be waterproof.The resin wicker does not align/match with sides/nack.", 
    "okay quality cushions very thin and not comfortable", 
    "Good value for the price!\\.", 
    "I didn't know out doors furniture couldn't be in direct sun. After putting it together we notice how VERY short the seat was from back to knee and not very high in the back to rest against. Looks nice but that's about all.", 
    "These took a bit of time to assemble, but once put together, they are comfortable and look great next to the CK Toscana loungers. Plus they are easy to push together and cover during inclement weather.", 
    "I was very happy with the quick service and quality of the furniture I purchased, there only suggestion I would add is when putting together use a screwdriver Allen wrench, it speeds the time up.", 
    "It isn't as comfy I expected but it fits perfectly in the spot that I have it in.", 
    "Great value for the money and looks incredible on my small patio.", 
    "cushions are not very comfy. nice set chairs but don't like sitting in them for very long.", 
    "Not to hard to put together. Looks good and more expensive than it is.", 
    "Absolutely love this set! It was perfect for our small deck. The seats are comfy, too. The only negative I have to say is that if it's sitting in the blistering sun for too long, the wicker gets HOT! So just watch out. This arrived when my boyfriend was out of town. I was able to drag the box to the back patio and put it all together myself. It was fairly easy. It just took me about 3 hours because I was the only one doing it...with those pesky allen wrenches.", 
    "Fairly easy to assemble...it all fit together...seems substantial..."
