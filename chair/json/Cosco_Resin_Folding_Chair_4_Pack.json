    "Flimsy and it feels like you are going to fall out of them. We bought them for around the poker table and wish we would have spent more for a better product. You get what you pay for so if you are looking for a cheap chair, these are good.", 
    "This is a great lightweight folding chair. It is sturdy and solid white in color - this is a great deal", 
    "Great light folding chairs. I needed these for an outdoor party, price was right and chairs were perfect. Comfortable seating for guests.", 
    "Inexpensive chairs, easy to store away. Now I can finally have dinner parties!", 
    "Lightweight. Nice looking chairs. Work perfectly with Cosco folding table. Good value.", 
    "These were great for the price. Nice and white. Good sturdy chair. Perfect to have around for extra seating.", 
    "Not as sturdy as I thought, but good for the price", 
    "These chairs are lightweight and easy to move and store. Not particularly sturdy, best for occasional events. We bought 2 of the (4 packs). Very happy with them.", 
    "Good chairs. Only recommend @200lbs", 
    "I bought these chairs for two pool birthday parties I hosted last summer so all the kids would have somewhere to sit & eat pizza & cake. Several parents stayed & sat in the chairs visiting/watching their kids swim. They worked well. Held up fine for both adults & children. Wiped clean very easily. No issues.", 
    "For the price, they can't be beat!", 
    "These are great. Lightweight, stack easily against a wall. Take up much less space than my traditional cardtable chairs. Only concern is how much weight they will support. Seem a little less sturdy than I hoped.", 
    "these chars are wonderful! Lightweight easy to store and great price!", 
    "As described, not fancy but functional.", 
    "Chairs were as described and were exactly what I needed. Thanks!", 
    "At five bucks each I didn't expect much. The plastic isn't super heavy duty but they are fine for occasional use. Not heavy which is a bonus.", 
    "purchased for cheap deck chairs. working out great.", 
    "Even without cushions, chair is extremely comfortable- Great for indoor/outdoor use... And the best part it's a bargain!", 
    "Got 20 of these chairs for my studio, and am disappointed as the back is uncomfortable & the seat is too small, which pushes you forward out of the chair when you sit. I asked for information about these chairs, but got no reply. So for anyone who needs to know, they weigh 6 lbs. a piece, and they do not stack. It would cost me nearly $*** to send them all back, one-third the price I paid, so for now I'm stuck with them. Go ahead and pay a few dollars more, and get something comfortable. Other than that, they seem fairly sturdy.", 
    "The chairs is sturdy. However a little uncomfortable to sit at the table.", 
    "good price but not so sturdy, best used for small people and kids.", 
    "If you're looking for inexpensive, light weight folding chairs, you simply cannot go wrong with these. There is no lower price anywhere for folding chairs and they do what you need them to do. Perhaps not to be used as an every day chair (they are light) or for heavy weight people, but for the average occasional use you can't go wrong with these. Everyone can use extra chairs at times, why spend more than you have to?", 
    "The Chairs are light weight and easy to handle. Good when company comes over . I will soon order few more.", 
    "These \"occasional\" chairs are PERFECT. Light weight, easy to set up and plenty sturdy for the average person. Spiffy too!", 
    "I looked and looked for some of these chairs and Overstock had the best price. I had initially bought chairs like these at Costco. They are identical and just as sturdy. I'm happy to add to my collection of chairs for parties or events.", 
    "Great folding chairs for the price. Excellent for those times when you need extra seating. Very compact so storage is a breeze as they don't take up a lot of closet space. Will probably order another set. Oh, and they look good as well.", 
    "These chairs are light weight, easy to stack, although the seats are a bit small and low. These chairs suit our purposes (to be put away in a tight space, and to serve when temporary seating is required), although I suspect they aren't comfortable for long sitting. Satisfied with them.", 
    "Good, sturdy chairs. Fold up easily and take up very little space."
