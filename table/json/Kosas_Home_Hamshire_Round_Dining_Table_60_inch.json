    "I was nervous spending this much money for a piece of furniture I had not seen in person, but I took the leap because I had had such good experience with Overstock's customer service in the past. The table arrived with a large crack in the top, but Overstock took care of it and had another sent out. The next table arrived undamaged. It is beautiful! The tabletop is not as rough and uneven as it appears in the close up picture, but still has that \"reclaimed wood\" look anyway. Do not expect absolute perfection, as the it has been made to look distressed and there are very small, but perfectly acceptable, cracks around the edge of the top... You have to like the casual distressed look. It also quite sturdy (and heavy!); this will be a piece that lasts! I couldn't be happier with this purchase!", 
    "I love the size of this table. It was just what I was looking for. I'm very pleased with its color. It looks great in ou kitchen.", 
    "Great Color. Nice Stable Table!", 
    "exactly what we were looking for.", 
    "The table is beautiful and sturdy. The finish is as described. We are very happy with the table. The chairs are lower quality. The fabric is not treated and picks up everything on people's hands. Since it is a dining table this is not ideal. The batting inside has broken down substantially in just a few months, so I will likely have to have them re-done much earlier than I would have expected.", 
    "I love combining new with old! This table was perfect for that! It's extremely solid and has a cool look that we get tons of complements on. It was easy to assemble and will hold up very well. Seats 8 people comfortably with regular size dining chairs.", 
    "I love my table, I've been using it for a couple of years now and I'm still in love. The table top is quite rustic, little pits and imperfections and there is even a slight waviness to it but not enough to interfere with dish and stemware placement.", 
    "Beautifully finished rustic look with a surprisingly smooth surface ... a tad darker in color than pictured (less white... more wood colored)... Exquisite piece. Couldn't be happier with it. (And we were delighted to discover that the top doesn't water mark!). Quicker delivery than stated (arrived within just a couple of weeks from the purchase date). Delivery people were phenomenal!", 
    "We purchased this table for our kitchen. We put modern leather cream colored chairs around it to give it a Modern Rustic look. The table is very smooth on top and has color variations from the acacia wood. A very unique piece, which we like.", 
    "Firstly, it took 2 months to get the product delivered.(1 month to ship to US, another month juggle with the delivery company) Secondly, the delivery left it at the door without waiting for us to inspect it. Thrid, The table is splitting in the middle with 4-5mm cracks. Since we didn't inspect it, we can't send it back. See the catch 22 here? Fourth, the table stunk/stinks of stink bugs. Stay away from this table and Overstock.com", 
    "The table itself is great from a style perspective. It's very heavy and easy to assemble. The only problem/concern is we received the table, set it up and within 3-4 days there were significant cracks in the table. Yes, this is a rustic style table, but the cracks are really bad. I saw this same table in a home the other day (I'm a Realtor) and the table had an even larger crack running down the middle of the table. So, needless to say, I'm a little concerned that it's a flaw in the material. Overstock was great to address the issue with a replacement and we'll hopefully have better luck with table #2.My only other thought on the cracking was the change in temperature/humidity. The table arrived when temperatures were in the teens - could the change in temperature be causing the cracking? I'm letting the second table \"acclimate\" to the house before assembling it to see if it helps.", 
    "This table is very heavy, true to size, and for the most part, matched the picture. It was very easy to assemble and overall is very sturdy. Our table does wobble a bit because the pieces are rough cut and do not fit precisely together. I had to fix the table by inserting a felt pad in the table leg joint to stop it from wobbling. It was an easy fix but still needed to be done. Our table's finish is much more white-washed than the pictures on the Overstock website. The table surface is very rough as can be seen by the picture."
