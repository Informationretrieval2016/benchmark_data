    "Got these chairs and absolutely fell in love with them. The styling is so modern and they are very comfortable...especially for people with bad backs. I have only one thing negative to say about these chairs- online it states that they are assembled but they are not. It really is no big deal but just heads up to people who do not have someone to help them as I did. It only takes about 1/2 hour to put together. Other than that ....just enjoy !!!", 
    "Bought this 'accent' chair for my computer desk chair because I wanted something that didn't look like office furniture. It sits low and the seat is deep so it's unlikely that you'd be sitting all the way back while working but that's not an issue for me. When not at the computer desk it's a lovely accent chair in the bedroom. Very easy to put together and once you get the screws in and then tighten them all down it is sturdy.", 
    "Great for the office space. A bit lower than expected, but will work fine", 
    "I love,love,love this chair!! It is so comfortable I have it in our casual dinning room and no matter what I'm doing I am sitting comfortable reading, eating, or just talking on the phone. Highly recommend this chair. If I had room I would get another.", 
    "Love the chair, very satisfied", 
    "Chair is nice for small area, only drawback is all short. If tall need a running start to get up.", 
    "I love, love, love this chair. Such a great addition to my living room.", 
    "Shorter than I thought it would be, but I like it.", 
    "Love my new chairs, I purchased 2. Very easy to assemble!", 
    "Nice chair, as pictured. But, very difficult to assemble...must attach back to seat and legs. Took my boyfriend about 2 hours. Otherwise, a nice accent piece.", 
    "The chair is short , theHate it", 
    "My son moved into his new place about a year ago. He needed something in room to sit on. He loves the chair", 
    "Easy assemble. Great quality", 
    "The one thing I do love about this chair is the fabric. It is very true to what you see online. The biggest disappointment for me was the legs. Though they are described as espresso and look very dark online, they aren't. They are more medium brown - dark brown. To me espresso is dark brown - black. The proportions of the chair are a little weird. The back of the chair is actually shorter that the seat, which is very deep and a little strange to sit in. I wouldn't sit in it for a long period of time, as it isn't very comfortable. Luckily this is just being used to take up space and will rarely be sat in. For that purpose, I have decided to keep it and gel stain the legs to get the color I am looking for.", 
    "Elegant... easy to assemble. Right size. Ideal for living room or bedroom. It's gonna fit in many different environments because colors are harmonious", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks excellent in my home.", 
    "This chair is a great addition to any room", 
    "These are great chairs. They look great, they are comfortable, the assembled easily, and they have held up well for the last year.", 
    "My chair arrived today and I'm very pleased. Easy to assemble and goes perfectly with my sofa and area rug.", 
    "The material is pulling apart on a large area on the top of the back. The chair is definitely smaller than it appears in the pic. The back is low. I bought it for an accent piece and that's all this chair would be good for. However, mine goes in the trash and I won't order another one!", 
    "They look good but when you sit down they are so far back, I had to buy a pillow to lean back on and they don't look as great with the pillow.", 
    "I bought two of these chairs for accents. they are very versatile.", 
    "This chair was easy to assemble and makes a great accent piece. It isn't very comfortable, but I'm using it as more of a place filler, rather than a main piece of furniture. It was a great deal and seems really sturdy!", 
    "Added personality to my guest bedroom. Functional and comfortable.", 
    "We purchased these to go in an office as additional seating. They were easy to put together and are comfortable for people of all shapes and sizes. We ended up getting the accent pillows because they were too deep for some of our more height deprived people but other than that we love them.", 
    "I ordered two of these. They came promptly and look just like the picture. I took one star away because they are pretty low to the ground. Otherwise I am very happy with them. *Don't buy the Raja Spa pillows to go with them as they do not match at all.", 
    "I purchased these chairs as accents for my living room. They are great. My only issue was when I was putting the legs on the chair one of the legs were very difficult to get into the precut holes. It took my almost 30 minutes to get the leg into the chair. However, once I did the chairs were everything that I wanted. Would recommend especially for the price.", 
    "Very cute, easy to put together, not as sturdy as hoped", 
    "I ordered 2 of these chairs for my family room. They are low to the ground and very comfortable.", 
    "Great chair, great quality. I placed it in my bedroom as a accent chair, love it. I'm pleased with my first purchase on this website.", 
    "Some assemble was required but very easily accomplished. Love the chairs.", 
    "GREAT price this chair is a great conversational piece", 
    "The wood that makes up the frame is very soft. No matter what I do, the back won't tighten up to the chair. When someone leans hard on the back, you can hear the wood splintering. The chair is too deep for most of my average sized friends to be able to use the backrest and also put their feet on the ground, and yet not quite deep enough to sit on cross-legged. The fabric is much more gold/beige than you would think from the photo. This did not work out well with my color scheme. After I settle into the new house, I will move this chair to a guest room and find something locally that works better. On the plus side, the legs are sturdy, the fabric is quite nice, and the price was not bad for a furniture piece that mostly just sits there adding some pattern and color to my otherwise bland living room.", 
    "Ordered 2 chairs, both came in perfect condition. BUT, the seat is way too deep to be able to sit in, need to use a pillow behind back to sit in the chair, and the back is slanted backward and very hard. Kept them, went well with decor and they are just extra seating for a crowd.", 
    "My husband and I purchases these to brighten up the room having recently purchased a dark brown leather sectional. These chairs were very easy to assemble (so my husband says). They are very comfortable! VERY pleased!", 
    "This chair is beautiful, sturdy and would have cost twice as much at any local furniture store.", 
    "Assembly does take some time, but its a nice chair..Great to add an extra seat, and fill up space", 
    "Don't buy this. the slot for one leg was smaller than the leg.", 
    "Was a little skeptical about buying chairs online and not sitting in them first. They are firm but comfortable. Colors are perfect and quality is great for the price.", 
    "The chair takes about 30-45 minutes to assemble, which wasn't terrible. I actually ordered 1 chair just to see how I would like it and ended up ordering a 2nd one. They aren't the most \"comfortable,\" but for my purposes, it will mainly be decorative. Great value.", 
    "I was looking for a small accent chair to provide additional seating in the living room. Chair is the perfect size for what I needed. Seat cushion is wide and is padded well. Colors are complimentary to my decor.", 
    "Delivered timely and in good condition.EZ to assembleWould purchase these chairs again.", 
    "Nice chair for the money. Nice fabric and design..................................."
