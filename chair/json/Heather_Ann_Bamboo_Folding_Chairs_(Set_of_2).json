    "I have had these chairs for several months and they have held up very well, indoors and out. We have them for casual seating, outdoors at our winery.", 
    "Good compliment to the Kosas Vita dining room chairs I purchased. Fits nicely in my beachside apartment and will do double duty on the terrace. I'm thrilled that this chair blends with the dining room chairs and is perfect for entertaining.", 
    "WOW! These far exceeded my expectation. I got 4 for my rustic cabin picnic table and they fit right in like they've been here all along."
