    "Hard to see the color on a mobile device, the name isn't displayed with the product. I selected \"Beige\" based on the one image and it's clearly closer to mocha or taupe. Definitely did not meet expectations on the color as pictured. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is very hard and the weaving of the cotton is loose and you can see the white muslin sack with holds the stuffing.", 
    "I was looking for a small ottoman that would not interfere with a large leather ottoman in my living room seating group that includes an oversized chair, a small side chair and a large sofa. The ottoman is easy to move as needed as it is incredibly lightweight and it is just the right size for me to prop up my feet. I've not used it as extra seating, but it seems that it would hold up well under the weight of an adult. The measurements listed must have be taken before anything came in contact with the pouf as it does give under feet and become closer to 13 inches tall when used. It arrives nearly spherical in shape but after a few uses becomes more disc-shaped (the expected shape for a pouf in my mind). I bought the tan pouf and it has a bit of an olive tinge to it, but still a beautiful rich tone. If you are looking for an ottoman that is the same height as your seating I'd look for a more rigid ottoman/pouf. If you want something to prop up your feet about a foot high that is incredibly soft under your feet, this is one to buy.", 
    "This is an attractive pouf. The only drawback is that the inner cover is orange and the outer cover is purple. I wish both covers were the same because the inner cover can be seen through the outer cover a bit, mostly just up close, though. It doesn't affect the look of it from a distance.", 
    "Love love love it! We put this in our little mans nursery and it works perfectly in there", 
    "White balls started coming out of pouf after one month!", 
    "Small in size had I seen this in person I would not have bought it. I will probably get a lot of use though.", 
    "I was dissipoibted in the quality of this item. They are light and flimsy and the material feels cheap. They are not expensive so as we all know. You get what you pay for !! I need to learn that lesson. They look nicer In the picture", 
    "The cotton pouf does wonder to my room, I want to use it as an ottoman for guests who sit on my couch and wanted to relax, but even without it be used, it a jazzy addition, thank you.", 
    "I wish I could give this product no stars! I hadn't had this pouf for a month before the inside netting with all the balls tore! I hate that I paid as much as I did for that thing! I don't think I will be ordering from Overstock again! If you are considering purchasing this product-don't! You will end up with little white styrofoam balls everywhere. And this could be concerning especially with small children and pets!!", 
    "This pillow is adorable le and fun. It is perfect as a foot cushion. You can see a tiny bit of the material on the bottom but for this price it is just fine I am waiting and hoping the ivory will be restocked", 
    "I purchased the turquoise pouf. The color is spot on, but the size is much smaller than what I expected. Good for a small space or child's room but not the customary size of a pouf.", 
    "Doesn't feel as good quality as I hoped for but nevertheless, it does the job and looks nice.", 
    "I am so glad that I ordered this pouf for my living room, very comfortable and just the right height, it goes with anything. Thank you and will consider ordering another one in the future. Nancy", 
    "It feels a bit cheap than other poufs I have seen. Plus I requested ivory and was shipped the tan. Returned item", 
    "I needed a foot rest in front of my wicker rocking chair. Its just the right size, actually larger than I expected. The grand-kids love to sit and lay on it, play and watch TV. It's been a great product and would purchase them again in more colors.", 
    "just after a month - little white balls started to come out - return policy was not a full return so I just set it aside. - probably will throw it out.", 
    "Comphy leg lift while on the couch!", 
    "I had hoped I'd love this. But it's falling apart. I don't sit on it. I'm in my mid-60s and of medium size. I only use it to put up my feet. I've got little white, foam beads all over the place. They're so static they can't be picked up by hand. They just stick. They vacuum easily enough but it seems a waste of time to keep cleaning up after something I dare not put my feet on. I suppose I could send it back but I didn't think it keep the box. What a mess. What a waste of money.", 
    "This item arrived exactly as I thought it would. The color was spot on, and it is a good quality product. I'm using it as an ottoman in our nursury, and so far the shape is holding up nicely, but it isn't so stiff that it doesn't provide nice cushioning for your feet. I was hoping to find a pouf for a lower price, but after searching many many sights and retail stores, this price really is on target.", 
    "Cute little thing but way too flimsy. We wanted something we could use an an ottoman - this isn't it. Too small and definitely can't handly feet propping.", 
    "Looks nice and seems to be well made. I am disappointed in that it is a little smaller than I was expecting. Barely large enough to use as an ottoman, but think it will be OK. Had I seen the other reviews about it being small I might not have ordered it.", 
    "These poofs are supposed to be 18x18x16. They're more 15\" high by 16\" wide. Not quite what I thought but I think they'll be ok.", 
    "Smaller than expected and darker than pictured but it does the job. Seems pricey for the product, though.", 
    "We needed a small foot stool for a small space and this really fit the bill. Got a good price and quick delivery.", 
    "great quality perfect addition to any d\u00e9cor and fits just about any where", 
    "These Poufs are really cute! I needed a small tuffett for my small sunroom and this just fits my decor, in a simple, but cutesy way.", 
    "We bought one of these to put infront of our side table to hide all of the wires from view. Everyone who walks in comments on it. We bought the burgundy pouf and it is a true wine color."
