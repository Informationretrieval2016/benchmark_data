    "My husband had these out of the box and the legs screwed on in less than twenty minutes. The upholstery was flawless, the welted edges are a very nice finish. The seat cushion is attached and very firm. These are not huge chairs, they fit very nicely in my small living room. I couldn't be happier with these chairs!", 
    "I bought this chair for my home office. Looks really nice! Arrived quickly. You only have to attach the legs. I liked the fact that it has no separate cushion, that it is all one piece. It does sit hard but that's what I wanted. I didn't want this to be sunken into. I wish there was an ottoman. Other chairs I've have looked at that were similar were around the $400.00 price. Love the color!", 
    "I ordered these chairs for my living room for when I need more seating than what can fit on my couch. The design is lively, although the colors are a bit darker than the picture provided. The yellow dots are really a gold, and the green is more brown green. The legs are slightly wobbly but I think if I tighten them they should be fine. The onyl assembly is screwing the four legs into the pre-drilled holes. No tools needed. The green fabric is velour type fabric, the colored dots are more satin like. My only complaint is that both chairs I ordered had minor flaws in teh material. One chair had a pull in it, that I was mostly able to push back through, but the other chair had a run that was about 3 inches long through one of the dots. Because the chair is kind of busy and I needed the chairs two days later, I eneded up keeping them.", 
    "This chair was much nicer than I expected. It fit my living room perfectly, as if I customed ordered the fabric ( which is quite durable ). I wish it had a matching ottoman ....I would order it in an instant!", 
    "Beautiful transitional piece. Good quality fabric. Had to send one chair back because of wobbly leg. This would be a high-end chair if it had a sturdier frame. I would be nervous letting one of my larger friends sit on this chair. Not a lounge chair, but functions well for the space and for conversation area.", 
    "Just screw the legs in and it is ready to go. Packaged well - box is large and heavy. It is not \"soft\" so you don't sink in, but it is comfortable. Fast shipping, received in less than a week.", 
    "I got the chair and it was exactly as expected. My husband inboxes it and put it together in 5 minutes. It's a little firm( the base seat cushion) but it will last a long time. Very pleased, and I do love that green and brown pattern.", 
    "love my chair! it was what i needed the colors and the price loved it as well.", 
    "My chair actually shipped ahead of schedule, and arrived ahead of schedule as well!!! When does that ever happen??? The chair has clean lines, and would go with many different room styles. The colors on the fabric are just as they look in the picture. I am very happy with my new chair, and would definitely shop overstock again for furniture.", 
    "The chairs are not very sturdy, the legs seem to be the small for the chair, I love the fabric and color but if you're over 200 pounds you're probably not safe setting on it", 
    "Really cute, up-to-date chairs. I bought 2 of the chairs and have them in a sitting room with nesting table in between. The background color is sage green upholstery and the dots are brown, darker sage, burnt orange and gold silky-looking fabric with embroidery stitching. They arrived via UPS and I just had to unload them and screw in the legs. I did it all by myself!", 
    "A little flimsier than I wanted but nothing major. Love my chairs!", 
    "I got 2 of these and there perfect for my use. Form get comfortable. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the legs aren't totally lev l when assembled. You have to use the leveling screws on the bottom of th chaos even when it's in a level floor.", 
    "I love this chair! Used it in my office waiting room. Comfortable, classy, and received many compliments from everyone who entered the room. Chair is firm, which I like. I would definitely buy this chair again.", 
    "Nice chair, but I had to send it back because it was smaller and the green showed differently when I received it.", 
    "I thought this chair was green background, its more of a yellow green, more yellow than green. I like the looks of the chair, but its not comfortable at all", 
    "Beautiful chair, I get compliments on this chair all of the time.", 
    "Beautiful and comfortable!", 
    "I love this chair. I'm a therapist and have it in m office for my clients to sit it. It's comfortable, attractive and sturdy. I am thinking of buying a second one.", 
    "I love these chairs. The design adds fun to my living room and the colors go with my other earthy furniture and rug. The only thing that I don't like about the chairs is that the legs are added on instead of continuous.", 
    "Looks elegant and due to mix of few colors can match with any set of furinutre", 
    "I love the look of this chair. I would not describe it as comfortable, but it adds a nice decorative touch to my living room. I gave it 4 stars because I think they could step up the quality on the legs. I think the tolerance on the threads is loose enough that one of the chair legs looks crooked. My guess is for a lighter traveled area it'll last ok, but if you have a really high traffic area this may not be your chair.", 
    "After having this chair for a couple of months, the fabric covering the back of the chair is stretching and rippling. I am not happy about this. Looks awful! Before this, I loved the chair.", 
    "Only issue I have with this chair is keeping the legs screwed tight . The chair itself is quite comfortable", 
    "look nice but not too comfortable", 
    "I loved this print,nothing you see elsewhere. Colors blend with many other colors,comfortable.", 
    "Like the look of the chair, matches my rug perfectly but the fabric on the back of the chair (where your back rests) has some vertical lines as if there isn't enough padding behind it, nothing major, I actually ordered another chair, will see how that one looks.", 
    "Love the color and pattern, however the chair is not that comfortable. We are rarely in the room, so it works.", 
    "The legs on this chair were uneven in length and where they screw into the bottom of the chair. I returned it.", 
    "Easy to put together and looks nice. Don't think I would use for everyday use, but it is just was I was looking for to create a casual living room. Whimsicle pattern is subtle yet fun.", 
    "loved the color just the right size for my livingroom", 
    "This chair is exactly as described and very comfy. Needed a nice sized chair for the guest bedroom that could also serve as a quiet reading spot and this fits the bill.", 
    "I am very pleased with my purchase. I love the size and style of this chair, and the color is exactly as shown on my monitor. It was easy to put together, taking only five minutes to screw on the legs. The chair was packed well for shipping and the chair itself arrived without damage. Two of the legs were scratched, however, but a call to customer service has two replacement legs on the way.", 
    "came well packed -as attractive as I expected. Very comfortable and a great relaxing chair for my retreat. Recommend", 
    "Love these chairs. They look just like the picture and are easy to assemble, just screw in the legs.", 
    "Overall a nice accent chair. Center cushion is a little puffy in the middle. Our cat loves it as a napping place. Material is of good quality and color was true to those in the ad.", 
    "Just what I thought it would be like. It gives some character to our family room.", 
    "These were not as nice in person. One had a run down the back cushion. The main thing was that they just seemed more muted in person and didn't brighten the room at all. Were comfortable, however.", 
    "Nice looking but not very comfortable to sit on .", 
    "comfortable, goes perfectly in my living room", 
    "Very stylish chair - super fabric, just the right size!", 
    "The size is smaller than I thought it would be. And it's not very comfortable. Also, the fabric is a weird shade of green.", 
    "If you like a nice firm chair and you are taller than 5'1\" then this just might be the chair for you. I bought it as an occasional chair for the corner of the living room. I already had a brown micro suede covered ottoman so it went well with that. I added a brown plush lumbar pillow and now I can sit comfortably and put my feet up. But I wouldn't sit in it for long periods reading or watching TV. It's cute but VERY stiff!", 
    "great chair - wish is was the color was not such a bright yellow green. My computer shows the chair as more for a soft green-sage. I'd send it back but the cost is not worth it. Nice quality fabric. Seat size is roomy -a real plus!", 
    "Just received my chair, very nice chair looks sharp in my living room and was well priced. I first saw this chair in a furniture store near my house (got to try it out) and it was selling for over $600. Delivery time was a few days, you can't beat it. I have ordered another one.", 
    "I ordered it on a Saturday, it said it would arrive on the following Wednesday, and to my delight it came on that Wednesday. It arrived in excellent condition, attaching the legs was simple. It's sturdy and comfortable. The fabric is a good quality.", 
    "i wouldnt say this is a high end product, but the upholstery looks nice, seems durable, and the chair is reasonably comfortable too. assembly was easy. There was a problem with shipping but that was the fault of the shipping company and not Overstock. I'd recommend this... good product and value and comfort for the price.", 
    "I love this chair, it is not overly large so it fits well in our room. It looks great and for a very reasonable price. It is not a soft, squishy chair, but rather a very firm chair.", 
    "This is the second chair that I have purchased as I wanted a pair once I determined that it's so easy to put together (just put the feet on!), feels great when you're sitting it in and this green color goes with so many other items in my living room. I have already received compliments from my friends who have visited me and liked to sit in this chair as it stays in shape when you're sitting in it, no flaws in the fabric and a good price for this upbeat looking chair!", 
    "The chair is very nice looking and it is semi-comfortable to sit in, but I didn't buy it to sit in; I bought it for its looks. It was easy to put together (just screw the legs in). It fits with our living room furniture and I really like the way it looks. A worthwhile purchase.", 
    "Very beautiful chair but a little uncomfortable when sitting for longer time periods.", 
    "Very happy with my purchase. Looks great in my family room!", 
    "The Tiburon Grasshopper Green Arm Chair matched the photo exactly. The chair arrived very well packaged to prevent damage in shipping. It was super easy to assemble. There was one little snag in the fabric but I kind of expected some sort of fabric flaw based on the other reviews I'd read before I purchased it. I felt the price of the chair was a good value for the product so the small snag didn't bother me. I was very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "The bottom seat is rounded up - not flat. When you sit in it, the seat goes way down. I am not sure if there is enough support under the bottom seat for the seat to hold up over time. The colors are great. A good size chair. Not too small , not too large/ All you have to do is screw on the legs. I am already receiving compliments on it. The fabric is excellent quality. Comfortable to sit in.", 
    "Received within a week and a half or ordering. It was pouring when I got home from work to see these huge boxes on my patio. Everything was dry inside of the boxes! Easy assembly, just attach the legs and you are done.The fabric is exactly like the picture. The chair seat is deep, I would've liked an ottoman to go with it as I am barely over 5' tall so I tend to sit closer to the front. I bought two and paired it with the Tribeca Home table also sold here at Overstock. The squareness of the table compliments the circular fabric design quite well to creat a nice balance. It looks great in my living room with my bookshelves.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised but the quality and comfort of this chair. I put it in our guest bedroom. It matched perfectly! I would recommend this chair to anyone!", 
    "These ship very quickly - had them within a week. Screw the legs on and you're ready to go. Design is pretty - upholstery is done well - comfortable enough - seat back leans back a bit - wish they had an ottoman. The only thing is that you can tell their structure isn't top grade - they are a bit wobbly. Not that they'll fall apart or anything but you can sit in them and feel the loose-ness of the frame. But for the price, they make a pretty accent chair.", 
    "The style is good but not as soft as a coach. We bought two and used them as accent chairs in living room. Happy with the purchase", 
    "This is a really great chair...and a really great buy. My 6' 3\" son unpacked the chair for me (great packing!), put it together (took about 10 minutes) and proceeded to sit in the chair for the rest of the evening. Even though it is not a large chair, he was extremely comfortable and agreed that it was well worth the money. I loved the pattern - not too overpowering...just subtle enough...and the colors were exactly as posted. Overstock.com is my go-to website when I'm shopping for furniture and rugs. Can't beat the deals on this site!", 
    "Very comfortable, stylish, and a great value for you money!would recommend to all my friends! Love the style.", 
    "I have 2 of these chairs in my family room. Love the color and how they compliment the rest of the d\u00e9cor.", 
    "I ordered this chair to add to my family room with medium brown leather sofa and chair. The chair is in front of a fielstone wall and the color and style are perfect for the space. I just need to get a lumbar pillow to add comfort to rest your back against. I only needed to screw in the legs. The fabric weave is so much more beautiful than imagined. The circles are satiny liking so nice with the basic fabric of the chair. Color of the chair matches the picture. I highly recommend this chair.", 
    "This chair is extremely comfortable. It is well made and very chic, classy. My 275 - 6'6\" son sits in it all the time and it fits him well. It is not to say it is a big chair rather to emphasis the comfort and sturdiness of it. I love the design and it is versatile. It looks great with my industrial look but could fit into any design with no problem. It is a classic. Can't say enough good things about it. It is high end and I would not have been able to afford it if it had not been for O. Thanks O, keep up the good work!", 
    "Easy to put together colors are exact and everyone that sees it just loves it. Very Very happy with this Chair", 
    "We needed a chair to match our dark console and dark leather sofa and love seat. The colors are perfect and also accent our dark olive kitchen as well. Good quality !!!! Thanks overstock. Put legs on in 5 minutes.", 
    "Looking for a neat chair without the big bucks this is a buy. Overstock gave the correct dimensions, just wish it was higher than actual product.", 
    "I love this chair! It fits perfectly in my office. Very chic looking and comfortable too. It's just the compliment piece I was looking for.", 
    "great chair for the price, Not for kids to jump on of course! Glad we purchased so far", 
    "This was my first purchase on overstock and it will not be the last. Great chair, great quality, great price!", 
    "Overall a nice piece of furniture for the money...", 
    "Very nice chair. A bit smaller than I thought but still looks great."
