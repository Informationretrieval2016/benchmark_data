    "This darling table is a wonderful antique turquoise and was a cinch to assemble. It is even better than advertised and I highly recommend it!", 
    "So cute. Color is dark and subtle. Simple assembly. Just right for a small entryway.", 
    "Perfect size, very stylish and quality! I'm very pleased with the purchase", 
    "The color is a dark teal. You might not be able to tell how dark the finish is until you see it in person. I love the finish, it has an antique look to it. It is an attractive piece. My favorite part is that it took me like ten minutes to put it together, and that includes the time it took to get it out of the box. No tools necessary. Yay!", 
    "I ordered this table for the entryway to my office. It was extremely easy to assemble and very sturdy. Great little table for the price!", 
    "But just know that if you order the teal, it is waaaay more blue than the picture indicates. The picture looks more like a seafoam green and this badboy is definitely teal, so don't go by the picture!! I did, but it's all gravy now!!", 
    "I purchased this table for a small area in our entry. Could not be happier!! It was super easy to put together and looks like a high end piece of furniture! Love it!!"
