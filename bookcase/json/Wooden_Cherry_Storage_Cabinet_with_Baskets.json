    "I bought this because i needed storage in my liv room for my granddaughters toys and books. The baskets are not make for heavy items like the books. the sides of the baskets sag and bulge out. Also, the baskets are hard to slide all the way in. The wood is nice and it was easy to assemble. If you are not putting heaving items in the baskets it will be a nice piece.", 
    "I really like this product to put in my family room to hold all of my baby's stuff - diapers, toys, etc. It looks contemporary and the dark wood and dark bins fit well in my decor. What I didn't realize was that the shelving unit is not one solid shelf that the bins sit on; it is more of a framework, and the bins fit in it. It still looks good, but just know that it's not a solid piece of furniture that can be used without the bins. Also, the bins are just made of cardboard, and I know I need to be careful when taking them in/out or the handle-part will quickly break. Perfect for our needs though!", 
    "I like this piece, and we use it for storage in our playroom. It looks much classier than typical toy storage units. It fits enough things into the baskets, which are fully collapsible, but not very sturdy. The wooden frame itself is weak--make sure your kids won't climb on it or pull on it! I was surprised that with minimal use it already requires tightening. It does serve a good purpose, but make sure you're not looking for something that is very strong to hold up to a lot of wear and tear.", 
    "Accurate description. Attractive. Perfect for storing winter gloves and scarves.", 
    "I love this storage unit. I needed storage for my daughters toys and was considering purchasing a kids chest but then saw this storage unit. When we received it and put it together, it was the perfect size for her and matches our living room furniture perfectly. I love that it has seperate containers and that it is made of soft material. She is 1 year old and can go to the drawer with her books or the drawer with her toys and pull them out herself, easily. I would definitley recommend this unit to anyone who wants a small storage (but it actually fits alot in those little drarwers) and if you are trying to still have it look like a part of the furniture already in the room.", 
    "This is truly a frame, with no base. The \"baskets\" (which some other reviews described as wicker) are only cloth with no solid bottom. More like card board in the bottom. The bottom of the basket immediately sags, causing the baskets not to want to push all the way back in the frame. I'd love to tear apart and return! This is MAYBE a $** item, and could be used for winter scarves, hats and mittens. Nothing of any weight.", 
    "Arrived well packaged, was easy to assemble and looks better then the picture. I am using it in the hallway, just outside of the bathroom, I store extra supplies for the bathroom. It holds a lot of items and is very sturdy. I think it is a really nice storage cabinet well worth the cost.", 
    "I purchased this piece to store small items such as beads, bags and fabric. It is PERFECT perfect for my needs however I understand some reviewers concerns on storing larger, heavier items such as books. It was incredibly easy to assemble and it looks great!", 
    "This piece was difficult to put together - not everything aligned. Also, because the inner area is not fully lined with wood, the drawers do not push back in easily (because they sink down into the cut-outs below them). However, it looks nice.", 
    "The size is exactly what the dimensions said it was! Would have been nice to find one a bit bigger but this one looks great in my living room with all of my sons toys. the bins are nice, flimsy when you take the bottom out! My 3 year old knows where to put away his toys and now they are not in ugly totes. Putting it together didn't take long but...not all the holes were predrilled in the right places. The pieces were not labeled like they were in the instructions.", 
    "Baskets not very sturdy and when slidding back into space needed to lift back side of draw to get in correctly.", 
    "These are user friendly and great for storing toys and loose items.", 
    "Nice easy to set up.my grandson loves it.", 
    "The color is true to the picture. I use this for extra storage in my bedroom closet for socks and the like. Easy to assemble.", 
    "this was smaller than i thought kina disappointed in it", 
    "Need extra storage Great for that", 
    "Great product, sturdy and looks good! Perfect for storing crafts, cards, etc.", 
    "Not what I expected but have made it work as a TV Stand . \"Baskets\" don't stay in place .", 
    "Was exatily as tbey said fots perfect", 
    "This item appears larger in the picture and stands very low. However, it was easy to assemble and in no time. It is also sturdy.", 
    "I liked the compartments which we use for our grandchildren with this product. It is built to last but could have had platforms to keep the bins from sinking in the middle; the end of each bin support the front and back of the bins but if you put heavy toys or items thee is a sag in the middle which makes putting the two lower bins in a task. Luckily I had plywood platforms that fit perfectly to support the three rows above.", 
    "I used this in a closet at my Mother's to hold papers and \"junk\" that needed to be out of the way, and it fits great for a walk in closet for storage...the drawers are a little flimsy so you can't put anything heavy in them but they hold up well and are great for miscellaneous light storage. Looks nice, but a piece of the top/ veneer chipped off soon after I got it.", 
    "Cute and comfortable thing. Very satisfied.", 
    "Baskets are smaller than what they say. 10x10.5. It's a nice looking piece but false advertising for size of basket. Was very disappointed bc u can't fit a standard size piece of paper into in (laying flat). Already have it put together so I guess I will have to fold the bottom of the paper. Not sure I will buy much again since u can't trust their measurements.", 
    "Out of 5 I would give it a 5 product is great for what I need it for", 
    "I purchased this cabinet as a toy box for my grandkids because I thought it would look nicer in the living room than a traditional toy box. Nice quality and easy to put together. Love it! Thank you Overstock.", 
    "Fits perfectly in the small space I got it for. Only thing I don't like is you have to put the bins in just right or They fall inside and don't sit right.", 
    "much smaller than i thought it was going to be and the drawers are very flimsy. I would not buy it again except for maybe a kids room, and for about half the price.", 
    "Very easy to put together, it's sturdy, it looks great (not cheap) and it really does hold so much. I'm sorry that I didn't order the bigger one, but this one is working out great for me. Highly recommend.", 
    "Ok, not idea for heavy items", 
    "This cabinet was extremely easy to assemble. It looks great and provides a place to put my husband's small amp (as well as some always welcome storage space in the drawers. The drawers are small (as described) but will hold lots of little things you never know what to do with! Nice place for keeping gloves, scarves and caps in the winter, too. I believe it was a good value for the money.", 
    "Best if used for storing light weight items. Shelf unit is not solid under each basket. Will buckle if too much weight is stored in these cloth baskets. Easy to assemble.", 
    "I usually have my husband assemble things, but this was so easy I was able to do it on my own in less than 10 minutes. Looks exactly like the picture and is very sturdy. I highly recommend this piece.", 
    "I love this! Not only was it super easy to put together, holds all my bathroom \"stuff\", but also looks fantastic in my bathroom.", 
    "Using it for grandchildren toy storage. It was a little warped on one end but got it together. Nothing fancy but very functional", 
    "Storage cabinet looks good and assembly was easy. Very small storage drawers and unable to store other than socks, caps, gloves and few shirts.", 
    "Very happy with this product.", 
    "Arrived on time and used to store all my 18 months toys. I know moved and I have cabinets for toy storage and use binds. This is great for winter accessories when you come inside such as scarves, hats and gloves.", 
    "Perfect size for a smaller living room... Great for hiding Mail before you go through it. Was easy to assemble.. Shipped in perfect condition", 
    "Very nice for kids toys. Baskets are a nice size and fits good up against the wall.", 
    "The description of \"cherry\" is inaccurate; this product looked almost painted red in person!", 
    "I bought it for my grand baby room it looks great. it makes his room look nice and modern", 
    "Bought this cabinet to sit near our front door for when we take our shoes off. Fits in the space perfectly, was easy to put together, holds many pairs of shoes, and is attractive. I've gotten many compliments on how nice it looks!", 
    "The cherry finish is very nice and works well with the other furniture in our home that is made of real cherry wood. The storage bins are not as nice as some that we bought at ****** for another storage unit that we use in another room for all my kid's toys. But, they are adequate for light things. If I align the fabric bins just right, they look nice. If not, they do have a little bit of wrinkles in the fabric. I am storing misc. crafting materials and it helped clean up our space greatly. I like all the different storage bins because we had so many different little items to store. The bins are not for heavy items but light to medium weight things work well. Overall, I am very happy with this storage cabinet! It fits in the space that was cluttered with piles of crafting stuff and now it looks so much better and my kids can find things when we work on projects.", 
    "Very sturdy design and extremely easy to put together. Perfect for the kids toys!", 
    "For a $XXX, these are super poor quality storage cabinets. They are tiny and cheap and they stink. Horribly disappointed in them. I am sending one back, not even opened from the box. The other one isn't worth disassembling and returning. BIG WASTE OF MONEY. I would not recommend at all.", 
    "The product is good with one exception, it doesn't have any solid board except the top. This means that you have to lift up on the bins to get them to slide all the way in instead of just having a smooth slide. So they are good just not quite what they should be.", 
    "this is a great size catch all, holds more than you expect, so handy for all the small stuff you need but no place to stash it..", 
    "I purchased this organizer for my dogs items so they would be handy but not visible for our mud room. Love it! It looks nice and functions pefect for our needs.", 
    "We are down sizing to a two bedroom apartment of 1650 sq ft after living in a 2800 sq ft house and I'm looking for all sorts of space saving idea. This piece of furniture will be a great behind the couch and will give me lots and lots of storage in the basket as well as a nice surface to display some of my knick knacks.", 
    "The storage cabinet looks good in a bedroom to hold small, garments and accessories. The baskets have cardboard bottoms and do hold their shape, but they are not in tracks so pulling and pushing them open and closed requires two hands, and if pulled too quickly they will fall out of the cabinet, not the best design but for the price, I guess it is OK. I would not really call it a quality piece on close inspection but it serves a functional purpose so if that is all you are looking for, go for it. Easy assembly, no issues with lining up screws, etc.", 
    "We bought this to put at the foot of a full size bed in our nursery/guest bedroom. It fits perfectly, and actually stores a lot of stuff in it. As another reviewer mentioned, this piece is not a cabinet with shelves that the basket sit on (i.e. that you could use as a bookcase without the baskets) rather it is just a framework with supports for the baskets - I am pretty sure that is how the quality is so good for the price, there is not really that much wood. We looked at comparable units, and honestly the price was what we would have paid just for baskets. Overall I am really pleased with it and would consider buying this again if I had a similar need elsewhere in the house. It is very easy to assemble (took about 20 minutes). I would definitely recommend this to a friend.", 
    "i bought this to store my grandson's tous and books. it works very well in the space i wanted it for.", 
    "I bought this is to have storage for my toddlers toys but a nice piece of furniture to look at. This was not cheap but I did not want to spend a ton of money either. The item came and the box was completely beat up. When I opened it, all the puffy packaging material that should have air in them were flat. The wood was scratched in several spots from rubbing on each other. needless to say I never built it and sent it right back. Pain in the BUTT!!!", 
    "This product looks a lot more sturdy than it actually is. If you plan to have young (5 yrs) children use it, it poses a lot of difficulty. 'Opening' and 'closing' the drawers is quite difficult. I would have likely returned it if it wasn't a hassle to dissamble it and place it back in the container.", 
    "I ordered this unit to organize my grandson's toys that find their way to the main living space. It is just the right size for him and holds a lot. The unit was easy to put together and looks great - a nice piece of furniture rather than a piece of children's furniture. I like that the containers are canvas rather than a basket.", 
    "When I found this product I was so excited as it was just what I had been searching for. Now that we have it and are using it my excitement has worn off. It definitely looks nicer in the picture than it really is. It does not have solid shelves but rather cut outs so it's not really possible to slide the bins back into place easily. I do not think this product was worth the $100 that I paid for it. If I had seen it in person I would have only expected it to cost between $40 - $50 and if I would have paid $40-$50 I would be a lot more satisfied with this product. The bins do have a lot of storage space and I am able to fit a lot of toys in each bin so thankfully there is a positive.", 
    "This is being used for my kids toys. The drawers are soft but the frame sturdy yet it looks great in the room! Much better than a toy box. It was very easy to assemble. Love it!", 
    "I was looking for a storage solution to hold shoes, books and small clothing near the front door. The photo made the unit look like a solid piece that would fit the need. When I opened the box, my first reaction was, \u0093is this all there is.\u0094 The wood was thin, the baskets were flimsy and the item was much smaller then I expected. With items in the baskets, the wood is bowing in the middle. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this product. The quality is substandard.", 
    "I'm very happy with this product. I ordered one, and it really does hold a good amount of toys. I immediately ordered a 2nd one for the playroom...it's so great to have the toys organized & it's very nice looking & easy for kids to open etc.", 
    "I would not buy from overstock.com again. I was very disappointed in the product. It was not as it appeared. The quality is poor. I expected better.", 
    "I bought this storage unit thinking it will be big enough to store extra clothes, NOT. Each drawer can MAYBE hold 1 pair of pants or socks. This was not at all what I expected. This is not even big enough for an infants room. DO NOT BUY!!"
