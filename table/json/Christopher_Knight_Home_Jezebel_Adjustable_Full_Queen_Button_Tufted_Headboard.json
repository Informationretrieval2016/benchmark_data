    "I was hesitant to order this headboard online because I wanted to see the quality of the fabric used. I was very surprised to open the box and find a perfectly expensive looking headboard for a fraction of the price of \"designer\" headboards! I've been told by people at expensive boutique furniture stores that the \"amount of buttons\" or tufting, was what caused these headboards to skyrocket in price. This headboard fits the bill perfectly. The padding is very soft, the fabric is the perfect neutral color (I ordered Sand), and when attached to a metal bed frame, it's just perfect!", 
    "It's a beautiful design and the leather is very nice quality but the hardware is not very sturdy and unless you are putting it against a wall it is very wobbly. If you extend the headboard to full height the hardware shows and doesn't look very good.", 
    "I love this headboard! I can't believe it's leather. Overstock estimated its arrival on Tuesday of the next week, but it came early right on Valentine's Day! I was surprised at how quickly Overstock delivers! Now, about the headboard. It's very stylish and complements my bedroom well. I did have an issue with putting it together. Living alone, I had to assemble this by myself, though the instructions recommended two people. They were right; I should have had another person holding the board steady while I attached it to my bed. One flaw I need to mention is the hardware that attaches to the headboard. On the front side, the bolt side, there's a washer, but on the nut side, no washer. When I tightened the hardware, the nut went through the adjustable opening. Once assembled, I went to the hardware store and picked up four washers for the attachment hardware and reattached it (no big deal). Now, it's secure. Despite the hardware issue, my bed looks like a million bucks!", 
    "The feet on this bad boy fall off, especially on carpet. They're just rubber ends/caps on the metal braces. Once attached to the frame though and put in place, they're not going anywhere. But for the money, this is definitely a steal! Looks very high end, and was easy to put together.", 
    "This tufted headboard totally exceeded my expectations. It was very easy to put together (one person only) and was a great finishing touch for my guest room.", 
    "I just received my headboard, and I Love it!! It's beyond what I expected ..... very stylish, good quality and well worth the price, I would recommend this to anyone", 
    "My mouth dropped when I saw the quality of this headboard. The leather is thick and soft and the piece arrived beautifully packaged. It looks like it should cost 3x the price. Everyone loves how it looks. I was a little hesitant mixing the ivory with my pale gray, white and navy room but it looks spectacular! You will love it and not be disappointed.", 
    "I love the look of the Christopher Knight Tufted Headboard in ivory leather, and my spare bedroom looks wonderful!The only issue I had was the nuts and bolts that came with the piece that attach the headboard to my bed frame where to big and I had to got out any buy smaller ones. Overall easy to assemble once I had the correct nuts & bolts.", 
    "Love the headboard and price but the sand color I ordered looks more like the beige picture you display. But not about to send it back!", 
    "I love this headboard. It is perfect and exactly what I wanted! I can't wait to buy more 'stuff' from Overstock.I have never been disappointed with anything I have bought. Prices are reasonable, Delivery is great and the products are good quality.", 
    "I was very skeptical about ordering a headboard like this without even seeing it, but after reading other reviews, I decided to purchase it. I am really pleased with the quality and look of the headboard. There are no flaws and I love the ivory color. Assembly said it was a two person job, but I was able to do it myself and I'm an older female. Attaching to a standard bedframe was pretty easy too!", 
    "Don't get freaked out when it comes, the box seems way too small.....it's not. Then when you open it, you think the tufting should be larger.......it's the same as the photog. The picture on the site does not give the texture of the cloth fabric justice. I can tell you I have hardcore Champagne taste on a serious Beer budget. Once you get it set up (Easy) you will die how amazing it looks for the stinking Beer price!!! I was in doubt.......dont be, go for it!!", 
    "After drooling over the tufted headboards in Restoration hardware and other high end sellers, I decided to buy this headboard in white leather hoping it would repel some stains that fabric would not. It was just installed by professional handyman today and looks great and was comfortable when I rested my head against it. It's not as elegant as the more expensive headboards, but it's much cheaper. Now I have glamour and comfort at affordable price. If it gets ruined, it was cheap enough not to cry about.", 
    "It looks so nice....looks way more expensive than it was...really like it!", 
    "My daughter wanted a tufted headboard for Christmas. I looked at all the other options on Overstock and chose this one because of the reviews. I paid extra for it to be delivered Christmas Eve. Unfortunately, it did not arrive. I contacted Overstock and they quickly refunded the extra shipping fee. Just as the other reviews, the lower screws were too large for the bed frame. I got some at Home Depot and all was well.I purchased the Ivory, which is leather. My daughter loves it!", 
    "Product came earlier than expected. Delivery took a couple days. Was very happy with the quality of the headboard. Looks classy. Only downside is washers were too big to fit my queen bed frame, will have to buy smaller washers. Otherwise, great buy for the price.", 
    "I love this headboard. It was more than I anticipated it would be. Love it... I have received many compliments on it!!!", 
    "This is a great piece! Well worth the little money they are asking. Great quality, easy to put up and I just love it! We have the ivory leather.", 
    "The headboard was exactly what I wanted for my guest room. Now to choose just the right bedding for the room!", 
    "The headboard is as pictured. Quality is good, but it really is not working for me. It's lightweight and considering the price, it's a good value. If you want a sturdy piece, I would save and wait for something else. You get what you pay for.", 
    "The only critique that I would have regarding this headboard is that it did not come with the proper screws / bolts - those had to be purchases separately - other than that , I love this headboard!", 
    "It really adds texture to an otherwise bland bedroom wall. I spiced it up with pops of color with my throw pillows. You will not be disappointed with this purchase!", 
    "I was a little apprehensive ordering this headboard online, sight unseen, as it was quite inexpensive against others I've seen. I ordered it in a the sand color and I love it. it is well made and looks high end in my navy and white bedroom....", 
    "Tan Color doesn't flare too red or green - its a good neutral that would go with anything.", 
    "I love my new headboard!!!!!!", 
    "This is a beautiful headboard, well made and easy to assemble. I purchased this headboard for a temporary full size bed knowing I will be upgrading in the future. I love it!", 
    "This headboard looks great in our guest room. Would recommend it for a bed that isn't used every day.", 
    "Was very hesitant to place an order with Overstock. Have read several reviews about being having good quality but missing parts. Order process was a breeze, delivered on time (nicely packaged too!) and all parts present! Granted, there wasn't a lot required to assemble but I don't want to get in the middle of something and have to quit to go buy parts. The headboard is beautiful! Great quality and I would recommend this product. I have since placed an order for a light fixture and will be ordering a bed for myself next. I'm sold on Overstock!", 
    "The product came well packaged together with no damage. Follow opening instructions so you don't damage the headboard. I have to say, it's as beautiful as everyone described previously. I had no trouble with the assembly but had another person to help lift it. Instead of attaching it to the bed frame we place it next to the wall and shoved the bed up to it. It stays perfectly still and really makes the newly painted room with dark bamboo floors look nice! I love it.", 
    "I like this headboard, but it actually sits lower that what the picture shows", 
    "It was very easy to put together, I did it myself. It looks good and I'm very happy with it.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised. I came very well packaged for shipment and was everything I hoped for. It looks more expensive than I had paid on Overstock. Good JOB O!", 
    "love the headboard, but......where the bolts should fit into the headboard, they don't. the bolts are also too big to fit the bed frame i have. It is a beautiful piece, but i have to get new bolts and also figure out how to get the bolt into the headboard on one side.", 
    "Looks high quality and is super cute.", 
    "One of my BEST purchases! Met the right price parameter, looks requirement and comfort level - changes the whole look of the Master Bedroom from \"blah\" to \"sharp\" - vanilla color encourages use of different multi-colored comforters or quilts, etc. - improves bed-reading comfort immeasurably!", 
    "I think this may be the first product review I have ever written but I cannot express how pleasantly surprised I was to take this headboard out of the box! It looks like headboards I have been looking at for nearly 4x the price! The only complaint I have is that it came with virtually no directions and I have yet to figure out how to make it fit onto my bed frame...but...it's being held up by the mattress and box springs and for now...it will do! It truly looks beautiful. So excited!", 
    "Pretty much looks just like the picture online. I would prefer it to be a little less shiny but it's good looking and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it.", 
    "The instructions came along with the bed was not very good. The size of hole on our bed frame is smaller than the screw and we couldn't fasten the bottom of the board to the bed frame. We had to find other smaller screws and did some workaround. After we finish the installation, the bed was still somewhat unstable and wobbly. We had to lean the bed against the wall to make it more stable", 
    "Placed this in the guest room and everyone likes it. Color and size are spot on.", 
    "This is an attractive tufted headboard compared to a custom headboard. However, it is not very tall.", 
    "This headboard is exceptional. The quality is unbelievable for the price, it's so sturdy and easy to assemble. I love the neutral color as it matched really well with my bed linen.", 
    "I love this headboard with my new bed however the screws tha are sent to attach to frame are too wide and cannot attach. I have it up against the wall until I can find screws that fit. Otherwise I love it", 
    "The bed required a little technical skills to assemble. It looked very good and durable. Good quality material.", 
    "Good but plasticy looking. I recovered it with Fabric. Easy to install.", 
    "This is soooooo cute! When I first opened it I thought it would drown in my master bedroom but it was a perfect fit! You could assemble with your eyes closed!", 
    "I am in love with this headboard. I ordered the Ivory Leather and it looks stunning. It makes the bed look elegant and modern. It is of great quality and was easy to install. I highly recommend.", 
    "Looks as pictured. Nice feel. Good quality. The framing doesn't fit a full size bed perfectly as the details suggest. But this isn't a major problem and there are multiple ways to secure the headboard.", 
    "Easy to install. Color as pictured. Love this item", 
    "Was pleased with delivered item. Sturdy & practical, yet, sophisticated. Throughly pleased. It seemed like it took 4eva 2 reach (approximately 10 days) but was worth the wait", 
    "The bed looks like I paid hundreds of dollars for it. the packaging was amazing it came wrapped up in a mesh bag. the faux leather looks amazing. all I can say is run don't walk, the value is outstanding.", 
    "For the price it's a good headboard. My one complaint is its not as sturdy as I would like it to be. Other than that, I like the color and will be able to decorate the room to match it. This is cute for a guest bedroom in my opinion. Overall I like it.", 
    "The headboard is beautiful and very well made. It was packed very securely and protected well in a cardboard box so it came undamaged. Unfortunately the assembly instructions are a little bit confusing to follow because the photos of the parts do not match the actual small parts you receive- you can probably figure out how to put it together on your own with just trial and error. The head board is high but my bed is very high so there was no space gap between the top of the mattress and the bottom of the headboard. One note: It is a matte white color (not the beige color in the photo) and is smooth surfaced like vinyl but is very soft to the touch like leather and doesn't feel like vinyl . Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and think that the price was very good for what I got. I would definitely purchase this headboard again.", 
    "We installed this headboard on the wall, and it looks amazing .", 
    "WE shopped around a bit for a tufted headboard...kind of surprised at the price range. I took a chance on this one, just took it out of the box, has not been attached to the bed yet, but we are wonderfully surprised at the quality of the tufting. We are happy!", 
    "I absolutely love this headboard....it's very sturdy and fits perfectly with my room.", 
    "Sometimes the headboard makes the bed. This tufted headboard dresses the bed and makes it more welcoming for a restful sleep", 
    "The headboard is exactly as described and so reasonably priced compared to others I looked at. Using in a guest room....comfortable for reading in bed. Assembly is a 2 person job.", 
    "Don't get me wrong... I love this headboard, I just wish it was higher. I envisioned less legs and more tuft. Overall, it's a good purchase for the cost.", 
    "This item is great is as shown on picture except a tiny bit darker in person could be the lighting in picture or in my room who knows either way I purchased the Sand Fabric Headboard Queen size and looks great in my room. This was a great deal and I'm very happy I got it in time. Would recommend to others.", 
    "Just as it looks and high quality! Amazing bargain for the price! makes my bedroom look beautiful!", 
    "This headboard is very attractive....we really love it...great value!!", 
    "I absolutely recommend purchasing this headboard! !! It is just what I've wanted...and it was extremely reasonable as far the price goes. I got it in the ivory leather...i put it up by myself...while my 18 month helped...lol wish i could post a picture so you can see it....you won't be disappointed unless your just not easily satisfied.", 
    "Purchased this for a guest bedroom. The headboard is heavy and well made. Looks more expensive than it is. Attached to bed frame with no problems. I ordered the sand color and it is a bit darker than I expected. Would recommend.", 
    "I was looking to update my bedroom and I have been searching for an upholstered headboard for a long time. I found this one and between President's Day and a coupon I purchased it for a great price and free shipping. The headboard is extremely well made and the color is exactly as it looks on the website. It was easy to put together and has that WOW factor that I was looking for. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.", 
    "Packaged very well and arrived earlier than originally promised. Very easy to put together - it took my husband and I about 20 minutes. It looks great and I like that you can adjust the height of the headboard very easily. Great price, found a similar one in a discount home store that cost XX% more!", 
    "Purchased this for our guest room. Great quality and value", 
    "We really like our headboard. The color and workmanship are spot on.", 
    "Perfect.... fits great love it", 
    "Looks wonderful. Better than I really imagined.", 
    "the material was what I expected except the color was miss-leading in the picture. As noted by previous reports the framing attachment to bed frame weak and bolts not adequate!", 
    "Great deal, just as described and looks like the picture!", 
    "This headboard came in very secure packaging. It even has a cloth cover for storage. It is a beautiful piece.", 
    "Nice quality and workmanship. Looks as good or better than many I've seen in stores selling at higher prices. I am totally satisfied. Assembly was easy.", 
    "I love the look and quality of this headboard. The color is true to the pic as well and goes great with any decor. It's worth the price and more.", 
    "Very pleased with the quality and look of this headboard. Would recommend!", 
    "Seems I've lost the installation instructions. Is there a way to get another copy?", 
    "It looks as I expected, the color is similar to what's pictured.", 
    "I bought this not knowing how I would like it. Well I love it. My husband put it together in a short amount of time and it looks beautiful. Worth every penny.", 
    "The headboard looked even better than the picture. Love it.", 
    "It was easy to install but doesn't have the look I wanted. We are using it though.", 
    "The packaging was wonderful. So easy to store if we decide we no longer need it but want to put it away for a while. My only wish is that it was a little bigger. Otherwise I love it and it has been a great addition to our guest room!", 
    "This headboard was the exact piece I needed for my bedroom. I recently revamped the bedroom to make it a more relaxing room with soft colors. I got the sand color a dig is exactly as seen in he picture. Good quality and price!", 
    "Easy to assemble comes with the right tools very well wrapped and my daughter is happy \ud83d\ude0a", 
    "Headboard is much leaner and smaller than I expected", 
    "This headboard was super easy to put together and attach to my frame. It looks just like the picture so that's great.", 
    "This headboard has made my bedroom come together 100%. It adds a classy touch to the bed. And it was sold at a great price!", 
    "Nice headboard, exactly as pictured. The slots for the bed frame to headboard connection are kind of large so I could not secure it as much as I would prefer but overall it is a good buy.", 
    "This is a nice sturdy headboard....really worth it..", 
    "My daughter loves it. No Problems so far.", 
    "Not enough height above bed, when pillow pillows are place upright. Note in picture they are shown flat. Igt went back quickly. Also note that description does not note height of upholstered headboard. Dimensions include legs.", 
    "VERY NICE headboard for price. Many tufts indicate expensive apholstery. Easy to attach to frame. Fits both double & queen.", 
    "The quality and fabric is good and it looks great on my bed. The reason I put 4 stars is that, there was one metal part missing to get the srew in to assembly, I have one side with only just one screw instead of 2 like the other side. I think it'll be ok. I don't have time to return it and wait for another.", 
    "Beautiful headboard, looks great in my room", 
    "Exactly as the picture shows. Great quality. Only downside is it did not fit our bed frame (adjustable bed frame) - so just sits up against the wall.", 
    "I used it in my guest room, it looks much nicer in person!", 
    "This isn't as sturdy as I thought but good for the price. The material has held up and it looks good", 
    "looks expensive.i love it", 
    "I am very happy with the headboard, the look is sophisticated and the quality is quite nice. Assembly was easy and parts were all satisfactory, it is a bit wobbly, that said, nearly any headboard which is attached to a metal frame has little support. Overall a very good value for the cost.", 
    "It is just what I was looking for-simple and easy toAttach to frame.", 
    "For this price this is great! I was shocked that it came in only two days. It is very lightweight and it does seem a tiny bit flimsy but it looks so gorgeous. I like to ball on a budget and this is perfect, I'm even going to add my own crystals on it!", 
    "Great deal for the price. Looks great and minutes to the bed easily.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of my new headboard. It fit nicely onto my existing bed frame. Nice deep tufted pattern that makes a sophisticated statement and turns my bedroom into a beautiful restful place.", 
    "This is a worth while purchase nice piece to polish off a room", 
    "Easy to assemble and high quality. Exactly what I was looking for!", 
    "I love it...so beautiful and elegant...Totally recomended!", 
    "It's getting more difficult to find just a headboard. Most furniture showrooms have the complete bed -- headboard, footboard, side rails -- which are more expensive. We wanted a simple upholstered headboard for a guest bedroom. We had a metal bed frame. This button tufted headboard fit our needs perfectly. All we had to do is attach the metal legs to the headboard and then attach our bed frame to the legs. It looks great and more expensive than it is.", 
    "I ordered this headboard last month and i just love it . Product is better than what i expected. My bedroom looks rich.", 
    "Very pleased with this headboard. For the money, it's a good buy. Fabric is a blend, not 100% linen but looks very nice.", 
    "Looks great! Easy installation and made well.", 
    "We love it!!!!!! Packed safely and easy to install. Beautiful.", 
    "It looks as pictured. My only issue is that it is bolted to the bottom of the bed frame, so there isn't a tremendous amount of support behind it. You wouldn't want to lean on it without some sort of supplemental support near the top.", 
    "Easy to put together, even for just one person. The Ivory color has a bit of a bluefish tint to it, but all in all happy with the product for a guest room.", 
    "For the price, you can't beat this! It is well made And looks way more expensive than it is!", 
    "This is a good headboard and accent the room as expected.", 
    "You can totally put this together by yourself! The directions are very easy to follow. My room is Red (accent wall), black and white. I purchased this in Ivory and it blends amazingly well. The only reason it's not a 5 star rating is because it is a bit (just a bit) wobbly when fully assembled and against the wall. But I'm sure I can figure out how to hang it on the wall!", 
    "Very pleased with this product! Easy to assemble, looks wonderful in the master bedroom!", 
    "Really nice. Looks great. Works well for Hollywood regency style.", 
    "Love, love, love this headboard! Really made the room come together! Well made, beautiful color, and very comfortable!", 
    "We really love this headboard. It is the right size for our queen bed in the guest room. It gives an elegant touch to the room and you sure can't beat the price!", 
    "Looks beautiful. If it feels shaky stick some fabric behind it. Works great for me!", 
    "Beautiful headboard - matched my room", 
    "No scratches on the leather everything in tack", 
    "Very nice headboard. Good value for the money.", 
    "Beautiful headboard, excellent sale price. It is slightly darker than pictured.", 
    "I love my headboard! It is exactly what I expected. I would recommend it to everyone.", 
    "Bought this for my daughters room. Easy to put up, and looks great. We have had it for over a year now and no complaints. It is good quality and looks high end, at a great price", 
    "was smaller than appeared", 
    "We Love this headboard! Good quality and adjustable to our bed height!", 
    "Love the look but you should show and sell the bed frame that it can easily be attached to.", 
    "Good quality material. I'm excited about all the different designs and styles this headboard accents. Very versatile. Color can seem a little dull depending on what your looking for. Great purchase!", 
    "this headboard is reasonably priced and looks like an expensive piece", 
    "Great delivery time! Very nice looking headboard. It really dress up my spare room.", 
    "Great quality. Great price. Looks expensive", 
    "I ordered this headboard in sand and was worried about what the shade would look like in person. After reading several reviews I chose sand over light beige and I was glad I did! The sand color is more of a grey beige and it looks really nice up. I think the light beige would have been more of a yellow beige. The quality of the fabric seems like it'll last a long time. I had to tuck some padding behind the headboard because it would hit the wall every time I moved when sitting up in bed. The height of it is also just right. Great headboard and would highly recommend it. I got a great deal on it which makes it cheaper to buy than make myself.", 
    "This headboard looks great in one of my guest bedrooms.", 
    "I love my headboard ! In addition to loving it I appreciate the service from overstock .. We made a mistake while filling the delivery address ,it was our fault , and overstock sent us another headboard at no additional shipping charges ... How wonderful for us great company .", 
    "Exactly as pictured, looks great", 
    "I got this for my daughters room. She is growing up and I thought this would be a nice transition from little girls room to adolescent girls room. It looks great and she loves it. It was easy to assemble for my son and I. Just needed to add bumpers on the back so it wouldn't keep hitting the wall when she was moving around on the bed.", 
    "I was nervous about buying a headboard online, but the results were perfect. My only issue is that the bolts it came with were too big to fit my bed frame. I picked up bolts and nuts the size down and it fit fine. No issues since.", 
    "The headboard was smaller than the picture shows. I thought it would be thicker but it's flimsy. I wish I knew. that's why I usually shop in stores. I thought I may give it a try on line but I WILL GO BACK TO THE STORE to see the items in person :(", 
    "I think this headboard is great for the price. It would be improved in the supports that tie to the bed frame were also upholstered, but overall it's a very nice piece", 
    "Product is as stated...little darker than pictured, but overall, very happy. I bought it for my daughter...she loves it!", 
    "There is absolutely no way you can beat the price for the beautiful looks & quality of this headboard. Am planning to buy another one in a different color! Shipped safe and free.", 
    "Very nice for the price...well made and has the linen look. I purchased the light beige and it is true to web pic.Was shipped very quickly.", 
    "I loved the head board! And I've gotten already 5 friends to buy it. It looks expensive and it was really good deal!", 
    "Look nice we received so quick", 
    "Arrived quickly, set up easily and looks great!", 
    "Bought for my son's room, he has a queen bed and it fits perfectly, height & width. He didn't even bother attaching it to the bedframe, it rests against the wall and works just fine, looks good too.", 
    "Lovely... definately a timeless piece", 
    "Great headboard! Easy to assemble on a box spring and looks very expensive!", 
    "easy to put together. a great value. love it. bought another in a different color", 
    "the SAND color is very dark, almost a grey beware!! i dont know what beach they named this sand after. Maybe Coney Island. However quality is excellent. The legs are very easy to put on, although they are black metal and they will show on the side view fyi.", 
    "Easy to assemble. And I like the ruffled design. It could have been taller and thicker regardless it's a nice and modern look.", 
    "Met all expectations! On time delivery as well.", 
    "Very happy with my purchase. Would buy again", 
    "Very chic and great value!", 
    "Worth the money, good quality product & easy to assemble. Would definitely tell anyone on a budget but looking for this look to purchase this tufted headboard!", 
    "As most commenters have mentioned, this headboard does not stand strong, even when against a wall. There is a slight wobble and it squeaks with any small movement, which is really irritating when you are trying to sleep and your partner moves at all. We have it against a wall and stuffed a spare pillow behind for now and that helps. Love the look though and it has solved our problem of needing more space as our old sleigh bed took up too much room in our new bed. This is much more streamlined.", 
    "I got this for a song and it looks great. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because it had a couple of pulls in the fabric when i opened the package. I just cut the strings off because it was not bad enough to warrant returning for a new one.", 
    "Love this head board definerly has an expensive feel and look.", 
    "Easy to install. Easy directions. Nicely made product. I like that the legs are metal and not wood", 
    "Great headboard! So pretty and such a great price.", 
    "Got this for my 11 year old daughters room, and she loves it. Very reasonable price for the excellent quality. Easy assembly. Very pleased!! Thanks", 
    "Looked all over for good looks, value and good support. Steel supports won us over, very solid head support", 
    "Elegant! bright up my room!", 
    "Looks and seems to be reasonably luxurious. Not difficult for two of us to install. Transforms the bedroom.", 
    "I was quite delighted with the quality of this product. It looks very nice and was a bargain for the price.", 
    "Nice quality headboard for value price. Quick delivery. Fits our queen bed very well. We bought the wheat-colored cloth style. It goes good with several colors of bedding.", 
    "This product was such a great price I didn't expect I would love it as much as I do. Great price great product.", 
    "Looks much more expensive than it is. Note: When assembling, remeber you have the headboard backward, so \"left\" means when it it upright and reversed. I had to re-do it once I tried to attach the headboard to the bed frame,", 
    "I just put this together this morning, and it really looks great! The directions are a bit lacking, but once I figured out exactly which way the legs went (from the illustrations), the rest was easy. I did it myself but agree it would be much easier with another person. The quality of the material, the tufting, and the sturdiness are all EXCELLENT - seriously, looks way more expensive than it was. I used a few felt pads on the back of the legs, so it wouldn't scuff the wall too. Great purchase overall - highly recommend.", 
    "Purchased for my daughter for Christmas. Looks better than the picture very heavy and well made.", 
    "Easy to assemble and much better than anticipated. Looks great and more expensive than expected. Shipping was fast. My wife is very picky, and this passed her test too.", 
    "I ordered the ivory colored headboard for the holidays to redecorate my room. I receive my order sooner than what I expected, but only to have my feelings hurt a little when I notice one of the leg stands was bent in . But I didn't cry spilled milk, overall I love my new headboard !", 
    "I am completely satisfied with this purchase. it is the bed I always dreamed of for myself. it has a classic glamous and elegant look. I love to decorate but it's not too feminine for my partner. I would recommend using a platform instead of railings for this bed. it can add extra height to give that more elegant look to your bedroom. I am a very satisfied customer.", 
    "Lovely touch for an elegant bedroom !", 
    "Not easy to setup, missing some pre-drill holes. And a bit difficult to line up with bedframe. We expected some problems for this price. And it looks fantastic and is holding up well.", 
    "Beautiful, love the tufting, good quality, great price!", 
    "Perfect addition to my guest room and easy to assemble. The instructions say it's a 2-person job, but I did it alone.", 
    "It was very simple to put together, did it by myself. Not too heavy or bulky. Did not need to adjust the height once it was assembled. However had to buy smaller bolts because the ones that came with the headboard would not fit my bed frame.I love how my bedroom looks! Thank you Overstock!", 
    "I ordered this piece in ivory leather and am very pleased. It looks just like the pictures online and is just beautiful. This headboard is superior quality for what I paid. It actually looks expensive and elegant. So glad I took a chance on this piece. It looks great in my new bedroom. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "Great quality and affordable. It came in the mail a week later. I'm very pleased with my purchase", 
    "Fantasic quality and very low price , product is a tufted leather got mine in the ivory absolutely love it !!", 
    "The board is great and well made. Installation was very easy as well. For the money is great. !", 
    "Got it within a week from purchase date. Easy instructions. Looks beautiful.", 
    "This is a great looking headboard. Great value!!", 
    "Love this headboard! Have had lots of compliments, only negative is it was difficult to put together as the bolts did not fit well and required a special drill bit not included.", 
    "Love it Looks great in my new house sturdy color is nice ... Can't beat the price !", 
    "Nice quality. Perfect for a smaller room with no need for a footboard.", 
    "For the price, I wasn't sure what to expect. The package arrived and it was beautiful! The beige is a light creamy tan with thin ivory pattern throughout. This little change makes my room feel so much more luxurious. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.", 
    "I received this headboard way faster than expected and when I opened everything up I was pleasantly surprised to find what great quality this headboard was!! It's well made, solid, looks expensive, easy to assemble, even had a holder in the back for the legs which would make it easy if you ever transport it or move in the future. Absolutely love it. Great purchase!!!", 
    "Love how good this head board looks for the price. Instructions were a bit vague so I had to play around with the positioning of the legs, as one picture on the instructions shows the holes on one side and the following picture it shows the holes in the opposite side of the first picture. One I figured that out it was a piece of cake. I ordered the sand color and it really a beach sand color- imagine wet beach sand... that's what it looks like to me ... It really does look great. Quality is very good too - again, for the price. Another thing worth mentioning, I put on a full size bed, the sides to stick out a little showing the legs on each side, my hubby thinks it's odd, I keep saying for the price, it's fine...", 
    "Need a headboard never expected it to be as nice as it is. Great quality so happy I made the decision to purchase from overstock", 
    "This is leather and though it has a shine to it, it really made my bedroom look more modern in a good way. It appears to be a thick leather, and the quality is very good. The photo shows it darker than it is. It's a medium Ivory. It's a bold look, but it looks fine with traditional furniture. This is my first upholstered headboard. I like the sturdiness, but it's also comfortable on my head when I set up in bed. Stick some foam to the back of the headboard to keep it from moving toward wall (by itself it's a little wobbly - the nature of heavy type headboards anyway. Legs are black metal and can fit full or queen. I have a queen bed and it works very well. Reminder - it's heavily built with a shine, so if you are looking for a soft upholstery, it's not this one.", 
    "Better that expected for the price", 
    "You need two people to put this headboard on properly. It is very nice and helps to make the bedroom's center. Easy to remove stains.", 
    "This purchase was a request from many husband who wanted a padded headboard. We are both so pleased with not only how comfortable to lean on it is but for how beautiful it is especially for the price. Very happy with many purchase and if the rest of Christopher Knights designs are as sturdy and elegant as this, i will be an avid supporter.", 
    "I just received my headboard and I am absolutely happy with the purchase it is not cheaply built and looks amazing. Definitely worth the money", 
    "I just assembled this lovely headboard and had no problems whatsoever. It was chimp simple and easy to do by myself. It looks great and the quality is there especially for the price. I would not hesitate to buy this headboard. The fabric is a greyish beige versus a golden beige with white threads throughout. It looks very classy and I have expensive taste. I'm very pleased.", 
    "The quality is good, but I wish it was a bit taller in height.", 
    "Nice headboard, great price", 
    "This was for my mother in law. She really wanted a soft ivory pleated leather headboard and this fit the bill perfectly. She loves it. The only down fall was with shipping. I was expecting it in 6-8 business days, but it took over 2 weeks for me to receive it--I started worrying. At least I got it before Christmas.", 
    "Nice quality item and has an expensive look to it. Love it.", 
    "Thank you for the product as it came on time and looked good.", 
    "I was kind of skeptical about getting the leather Headboard, but I was wrong it's very beautiful and easy to clean", 
    "We assembled the headboard a couple weeks ago and love it. It looks and feels just as I expected it would. Giving 4 stars because assembling it could be made easier. One of the holes for the bolts had a nail in the middle of it popping through from the upholstered side. I was afraid we would have to return it since the bolt would initially not go in. However, with some creativity and a few extra tools, we were able to figure it out.", 
    "Beautiful Item, easy to assemble. Just love it for the price.", 
    "I ordered this headboard by mistake, but it turned out great. I gave it to my mom and she loves it. The only downfall is the slats and holes for the screws dont line up directly so you have to be patient and play with it. It gives her room flare I would purchase again.", 
    "Great headboard, for a great value. Would recommend to anyone, delivery did come in a day late but no complaints other then that.", 
    "best headboard installed our room look so amazing thanks for great price and great product.", 
    "Looks more like a rough linen in person and the color was off - sold it and used money to get a different bed", 
    "Great quality. Great price. Love it", 
    "nice headboard well made. the beige linen is like a flax color and white thread running through if that makes sense.. it gives it a texture.i like it. at this moment though it is NOT lining up with the metal bedframe to be able to fasten it soo... it is leaning against wall. thats why i gave it four stars.great instructions and it came with extra hardware.", 
    "Adds warmth and a finished look, concerned that it might be a tad squeecky", 
    "This item adds some fashion to bedroom decoration", 
    "luv it ,arrived on time, good material looks nice.", 
    "Love it! A little tricky to put together but it looks great in our bedroom.", 
    "Beautiful headboard but does not match upTo the holes on my mattress frame. So it has to lean against wall with some pipe insulation behind it to prevent it from scratching wall &!to keep it quiet.", 
    "better than picture,looks great", 
    "I was impressed at how well made this is for an upholstered headboard. Very sturdy. My only disappointment was it went on sale 2 days after I purchased!", 
    "The headboard is durable, high quality construction. The legs came neatly tuck in the back of the headboard so it is easy toassembled or relocate! The design is fabulous!!! Best price on great quality!", 
    "Mom loved her early Christmas present. What a nice headboard for a great price!", 
    "Wonderful quality! It's above and beyond my expectations. I haven't assembled it yet, but it looks fairly easy to assemble. Love it, love it ,love it!!!!", 
    "Well made although on the light side, under 40 lbs. also not that tall. Perfect for a guest bedroom.", 
    "easy to install! wonderful condition and quality. beautiful addition to a guest bedroom.", 
    "I got the queen in Sand fabric and I love the look. The color is spot on and it looks a lot more expensive than it is. Putting it together was a bit challenging because of the very poor construction and obstructed screw holes. I had to rip some of the fabric at the back to uncover the screw but it turned out great overall. On the downside, the headboard is a bit wobbly unless you place fully against the wall and it is even more wobbly is use the adjustable feature. Overall, I am pleased with the quality and quality of the headboard for the price I paid", 
    "Great quality for the price. Looks just as great in person as it does in the picture.", 
    "This headboard is support by 'tin' the brackets that are supplied to attach the headboard to the bed frame are very poor quality. The tool kit supplied was not sufficient. We needed to find 4 additional washers to fasten the headboard properly.", 
    "Great product. Easy to put together and the fabric is beautiful. It was an excellent value. I would highly recommend it.", 
    "The look was just what I expected. Thought it would take some time to get used to but it is great", 
    "This item is a steal. It's expensive looking, easy to assemble, and looks very elegant in person. The color is exactly as shown in the photo. The height of the headboard can be adjusted, there is plenty of hardware that comes with it. I would have given it 5 stars, but one of the pre drilled holes in the headboard won't hold the screw, so I will have use some glue or something to fix it. Other than that, no complaints.", 
    "I was a little hesitant with some of the reviews but decided to order it because it was one of the Black Friday deal. Packaged arrived on time and was very easy to put together. I was very impressed by this head board. It looks great in the guest room! I recommend buying this at a great price of $109.99", 
    "Love this tufted headboard! Nice shade, thick, beautiful fabric. Another Overstock gem!", 
    "I've been waiting for the right deal on this style of headboard....it is just what I wanted! Easy setup, sturdy and it is beautiful!!", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks great.", 
    "Arrived promptly. The color was as pictured, it was not difficult to put together and the quality is great for the price! I did take the time to Scotch Guard, however, as the color I chose is a light color. Very happy with purchase and Overstock! =)", 
    "This is a beautiful headboard and looks like a full bed when attached. It is in my spare room and I feel wonderful every time I walk in. Super well made, thanks Overstock!!!", 
    "Looks beautiful in place, pretty easy to install. great quality.", 
    "This headboard looks like I paid so much more for it than I really did. Great find!", 
    "This came exactly as pictured and looks fantastic. Easy to assemble, don't worry the box looks small when it arrives but it's cleverly packaged.", 
    "Good headboard for the price!", 
    "Bought this for a guest room that isn't used much. It looks fantastic, much nicer than the price we paid.", 
    "this headboard is beautiful. it compliments my bedroom decor perfectly. my only complaint is how it attaches to the bed frame. weak and wobbly :-/", 
    "Gorgeous!!! This is so nicer than I thought it was going to be!!! Love!", 
    "Very pretty only thing is my mattress and box spring is deep so it hits a lil high into headboard. I would have liked mattress to fit a lil below headboard, but I can adjust it any lower. So be aware of this. My mattress sits long at the bottom.", 
    "This headboard looks good and the color is what I hoped for. We did have some trouble attaching it to the bed; the screws that come with it didn't fit the slots in our bed frame but we managed to find some around the house that worked. Wasn't as high as I would have liked even with adjusting it to the highest height. If you have Euro shams, not a lot of headboard shows.", 
    "I ordered this headboard in the ivory leather. I love it. The leather is a good quality and will elevate any room d\u00e9cor. I plan to use it in my quest room, which should last a long time. The pricing is really good considering its leather. I would expect this price for a fabric headboard.", 
    "For the price, I was happily surprised when I received this headboard. The sand color is really a linen color. Made my guest room go from pretty to very pretty!", 
    "I was very pleased with the headboard, it was easy to install and the color was exactly as it showed on the computer. It looks great.The price was less than others I looked at.I was very happy with the whole experience, it was the first time that I ordered a large item online and it was a very good experience also.Thank you for making it so easy.", 
    "Moved to a new house and needed to update the guest room ASAP as company was coming! I ordered this because it was not very expensive, was the color palate and look i was going for. It arrived promptly and was simple to assemble!", 
    "Really nice quality headboard.m after purchased went on sale further by about $** after 2 weeks", 
    "This is a beautiful headboard. Great quality, easy to put together. I'm very happy with the purchase. Of note, if using the enclosed legs, the headboard height is adjustable. Not a lot, but frankly it was perfect for me. You could also easily hang it on the wall (just like a picture by adding heavy wire) if you need a more custom height adjustment.", 
    "I bought this for my bedroom and I love the look of it! The headboard was easy to assemble, and I did it all by myself.", 
    "Perfect for our queen size bed. Have waited a long time to find one this nice.", 
    "I love the look of this headboard! For the price it actually looks more expensive.The only thing that made me give it such a poor review was putting it together. I should have listened to the other reviews that said the screws were too thick. The time and hassle I had to spend by going to Home Depot wasn't really worth it. Even now with smaller screws I don't feel the bed is secured enough to the frame. And one more thing - when Overstock \"suggests\" a bed frame that is frequently bought together I expect it to work!", 
    "I had been searching for a headboard like this for some time. It seemed that they were all over $$$ until I found this one. It looks great in my bedroom. I think it is well made and it is beautiful for the money! I like the height- tall enough to make a statement but not too tall. I read about issues about the bolts not fitting the bed frame and people have to go buy different bolts. Mine is just propped behind the frame and mattress so I am not sure if I will have the problem. I am just thrilled that it is so pretty!", 
    "Love this headboard! Very classic and elegant. Everyone that sees it compliments it. Great sturdy fine materials.", 
    "Love this new headboard. It installed easily and looks great with my bedding. I can't believe a leather headboard for this price. It wipes easily for cleaning and am so glad I purchased this headboard from Overstock.", 
    "Beautiful headboard, color and material is exactly what I expected and very easy to assemble. Love it!", 
    "Looks just like the picture. Very nice with the buttons. The color is an oatmeal color. Very easy to put together.", 
    "This headboard is really a very good purchase for this price. the fabric is exactly what I wanted and it went together very easily. My only suggestion is to put felt pads on the metal verticals to avoid damaging your walls. The uprights will probably have to be tightened after moving the bed a few times so keep the tools provided", 
    "Thought the 'Sand' would be slightly more grey... It's just beige. It's a bit rickety when attached moves a bit back and forth. Could very well be user error on the instructions \ud83d\ude09", 
    "Beautiful to look at and can't beat the price!", 
    "Easy assembly. Great price. I would have given 5 stars but the color I ordered was nothing like in the picture. Light beige is more of a grayish sand color too, but this is a risk when ordering on-line. I was hoping for a warmer beige but this cold sand, at least to me.", 
    "We were excited to find the design and color as promised on the website. The price was very good as well. The only problem is the hardware and assembly was a bit tricky. The steps of assembly were easy the problem was holes not quite in the right place or washers bent and not flat. We did get it to work with a little extra work.", 
    "Great service, price and delivery! Headboard was 1/2 the cost of a similar headboard at***** **** and good quality.", 
    "Very nice for the price. Mixs well with any color. I bought the Sand it blends in with my yellows and green accents great.", 
    "Easy to put the legs on the headboard. Looks beautiful and classy.", 
    "Love this!!! Great quality", 
    "My full/queen size Ivory leather headboard arrived at 2:30 p.m. and I had it attached and up by 3:30. The instructions were written extremely well with great graphics. I could not be happier with the look, quality and price. Love, love, love this headboard. You won't regret buying the Ivory leather! It's just beautiful! My mattress rails were fairly new so these headboard legs slipped right into the slots on each side, therefore, I did not need to attach with bolts and screws. Pushed it against the wall and it holds completely sturdy as is. Can't say enough about the price and quality. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "I was a little hesitant due to the price in comparison to other headboards out there, but I'm so happy I made the right choice. The fabric is nice, easy to assemble is nice and sturdy. I recommend it", 
    "Looks very modern \\ contemporary and well made.", 
    "Material is nice and looks great. It is exactly what I wanted.", 
    "Well constructed and sturdy. Nice fabric with careful details. Shipped in wrap to keep it clean, and very sturdy packaging. Great price - I'd been looking for several years!", 
    "Quality is good, just wish material was softer", 
    "Great looking headboard at a great price! It looks expensive and very chic.", 
    "Everyone compliments me it looks expensive and luxurious love it!", 
    "This headboard exceeded my expectations. It is so pretty and is well made. I have gotten many compliments it.", 
    "It looks expensive, finishes the room, and always brings compliments. Everyone wants to know where to get one! Easy to attach by myself. I just love it !", 
    "Elegant,well made,best directions ever ! Have been looking for a replacement headboard and am so pleased with this purchase.It is sturdy,well made,and looks expensive in the off white leather style I ordered.", 
    "I bought the ivory leather headboard and couldn't be more pleased. This looks great at the had of my bed and I got an excellent deal.", 
    "Really nice for the money. Easy to set up.", 
    "Overall good price and design but as received, fabric has a small \"pull\". We will try to fix it.", 
    "This headboard is really the finishing touch in my bedroom. It looks really classy and is high quality. The material is leather (surprise!!). I purchased the ivory and it compliments my blue and ivory master bedroom. Recommend highly.", 
    "I Purchase this headboard for my guest room I couldn't believe the quality amazing price I highly recommend purchasing headboards From overstock.com it is my second one. For the price Quality it is a great purchase.", 
    "This headboard has a comfortable, casual look and was relatively easy to install after procuring longer bolts. Disappointed as it wasn't what I had wanted as to fabric finish and color, which are admittedly hard to convey on a computer monitor. Internet buyer, beware.", 
    "This came on time, easy to set up and immediately pulled the room together . This headboard is PERFECT!!", 
    "Still great design, and came super quick. just needed to put some lighter stuff around it (like a white and flowery painting above and clear lamps with white shades on them on side tables) so not too dull in room. but think with white sheets and covers so lots of contrast will be nice overall!", 
    "very comfortable while sitting up to read, high quality and easy to assemble.", 
    "It's a beautiful design and the fabric and upholstery is very nice quality. I agree with the prior reviewer who said the the hardware is not very sturdy and unless you are putting it against a wall it is very wobbly. Also, if you extend the headboard to full height the hardware shows on the sides (this is cleverly disguised by the headboards in the photos of the product). We find it unacceptable, so it's going back. If it weren't for the hardware showing, we would certainly have kept it.", 
    "I love the way this headboard looks in my room. It was super easy put together by myself. I am very happy with the quality of the product, delivery and the price. I will be sure to use Overstock again!", 
    "Shorter than I expected, but still comfortable.", 
    "This headboard looks amazing.. we were very happy with the quick delivery and great quality of this product. Very easy to put together too.", 
    "Love it!!! It was very easy to assemble. It's very sturdy, and beautiful. You see the same thing in furniture stores for $$$ and up. I definitely feel like I got a great deal. The shipment was very easy to track I knew exactly when it was coming. It took my bedroom from shabby that chic with just one item. Everyone that sees it thinks it's beautiful and I paid a lot more than I did for it. It will be our little secret overstock.com. I definitely will be doing a lot more shopping here. I recommend this to anyone that wants a little class to their bedroom. You definitely get way more than what you paid for. Thanks overstock!", 
    "Very simple and classy :)", 
    "I bought two of these to replace old headboards I had, they are just perfect and the set up took about 15 minutes .the look just fabulous and I have gotten quite a few comment about how expensive the look. Great price.", 
    "The headboard itself seems well made but I was disappointed with the color. I have bought many other Christopher Knight pieces of furniture through Overstock & expected the beige linen color to be the same 'beige linen color' as the other C/Knight chairs etc I've bought through O/S. It isn't & is a kinda dirty light speckled tan color hence the 3 stars. Like others too, I had to purchase other hardware to fit the headboard to the bed.", 
    "This one of the best purchases I have made for the bedroom maker this headboard is handsome and elegant it dresses up any bedroom well made so glad that I went with the sand color its a perfect fit! Fast delivery too!", 
    "The headboard was easy to assemble, and it adjusts for either a queen or full size bed. It also adjusts height wise. I have it set on the lowest height, and it was still high but perfect for my needs. I have a standard full size bed frame, a foundation, and an eight inch mattress. In other words, this headboard would probably be too high for a platform bed with only a mattress. Also, the quality is excellent. I cannot believe that it was such a low price. Way to go Overstock!", 
    "I am sure it's only \"leather-like\" or manmade leather, however it is very well made and a high quality piece. I didn't have any issues with sturdiness but I have it attached to the metal, platform bed frame found here on Overstock and used the metal corner brackets that are matched to that frame. Beautiful, ivory tufted headboard!", 
    "easy to assemble, looks nice, really pulled together the look in the guest room. the legs on the headboard are metal and due to height of mattress and box spring, they do not touch the floor, which is fine", 
    "The headboard is beautiful. Especially for the cost. It is soft, high quality and looks great.", 
    "Very pretty. No flaws found. Easy to attach to bed frame.", 
    "Material is great. Does not look cheap at all. Goes well with yellow and grey walls.", 
    "The head board arrived quickly and was easy to set up, took me about 10 minutes. That included attaching the legs to the headboard and then to the bed. It is very well made and the fabric is beautiful.", 
    "Great bang for the buck! Color is true.", 
    "I am an avid do-it-yourself-er and have been wanting to create a tufted headboard for years but am very particular about how it would look and function. I saw this headboard and fell in love first with the price and decided to go for it. It was cheaper than what it would cost to make it - but I had my doubts until it arrived. Simply amazing. It was easy to install and went up in about 10 minutes as I held it while my husband aligned the screws. The tufts are great and there are no flaws in the sewing or fabric. 5 stars", 
    "Color was darker than described, why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. It's more of a taupe/grey.", 
    "This headboard looks way more expensive than the Overstock price. It is neutral in color and is a great height if you have vaulted ceilings.", 
    "I am pleasantly surprised at how well made this head board is for the price. It's gorgeous in my bedroom.", 
    "I purchased the headboard for our second guest room, which is used mainly during holidays. The headboard was easy to attach. It looks great and was actually nicer than I expected.", 
    "I just received my Jezebel headboard and was very pleasantly surprised by who expensive it looks. This is my first purchase on Overstock so I wasn't sure when to expect. It was easy to put together and fits my Queen bed perfectly. Very happy with my purchase and will purchase from Overstock again.", 
    "Color is a little unusual, not a neutral ivory, but it's ok.", 
    "Super excited for this shipment! I am moving and preparing for my new home.....the headboard came in perfect condition and looks beautiful! I haven't installed it yet since I haven't moved yet so I can't speak to the ease of installation or performance after it's installed but so far, so good!", 
    "The headboard is well made, looks expensive and is perfect for the room.", 
    "I got the ivory leather headboard and am very happy with it! As some have mentioned in earlier reviews, it is a little wobbly even with the screws securely tightened. But I put some padding on the back and pushed it up against the wall to remedy this. It looks very rich with the Madison Park Trenton 7 piece comforter set I also purchased. Sweet dreams in my new bedroom.", 
    "Love this piece. Perfect addition to my guest room. Came packaged very well. Easy to connect to bed frame. Sturdy. Lovely.", 
    "Well.... I'm soooo glad I bought it! I looked at it day after day wondering if it would look cheap, color and bonded leather material. I purchased the queen size ivory bonded leather for a guest bed room I painted \"moody black\"...which is really a midnight blue color. The headboard is the same color as all the base and door trim in the room and its simply gorgeous again the dark wall! Another great item I could only find at a good price on Overstock.com of course, as I looked in local stores and online elsewhere and the prices were much higher. Its sturdy once attached firmly to bedframe, Im very pleased with it. Packaging was great, delivered on time and headboard was in perfect condition.", 
    "LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Just like the picture!", 
    "Love it! Arrived quickly, easy to put together, looks beautiful, and a great price!", 
    "This headboard looks as though it costs 3 or 4 times what I paid for it. I'm so pleased! And it is also extremely comfortable if you sit in bed and read at night, like I do!", 
    "I love Christopher Knight products and this one of many that I have. Looks elegant", 
    "Very pretty elegant headboard, great quality! I bought the ivory leather one and love it.", 
    "Very happy with this headboard. It is simple, was easy to put together and as with all my others arrived quickly.", 
    "I LOVE THIS LOOKS VERY EXPENSIVE !!!", 
    "Lovely headboard in cream color. Nice construction. Easy to install legs and install to bed frame.", 
    "Great headboard. Good quality.", 
    "I ordered this headboard before realizing it was a cream leather. When I finally ordered this knowing about the leather I was excited. It was easy to install and the look is fabulous! I love it.", 
    "Well, this looks just elegant. You'd never think I paid what I did. I'm thrilled. Brings some real class to my bedroom. It was very beach casual before. Just pulled everything together. And made me love a picture I bought and didn't like when I got it home.", 
    "This headboard adds a very cool and modern edge to my bedroom. I am very happy with it. The price was great, too,", 
    "It has a pearl radiance.... It looks good for the purpose I need.", 
    "Looks great but came with NO INSTRUCTIONS. The board is a lot shorter in the picture.", 
    "I am very satisfied with my item. It is of very Great Quality at a Great Price!!!!", 
    "It's a great product for its price.I only gave 4 stars because its difficult to assemble by one person.", 
    "This headboard is even better than I expected. It looks very expensive especially for the price! I would definitely recommend it!", 
    "The picture makes the headboard appear tall but it really isn't & I wish it was. The padding is very thick and honestly it looks rich & expensive. Putting the legs on the headboard was early but you do need a flat surface & strength.", 
    "It looks exactly like the picture. Beige linen color. For the price you can't beat it. It is a nice looking headboard. I've seen heavier bed frames at Homegoods that look similar, for double the price. However, for a headboard this is a good deal. Buy it. You'll be happy with it. Just needs a bed skirt to finish \"the look\".", 
    "I was very satisfied when I received my Headboard. It was very easy to put together and looks great in my room. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Great product! Great price!", 
    "We love the look of this headboard in our guest room but there were missing washers which we had to buy to make the headboard stable. Overall happy with the purchase definitely looks far more expensive than it was.", 
    "Product arrived very promptly with secure packaging. Easier if two people assemble, but doable for one. No other tools were necessary. Product is as pictured. Looks great in the guest room and will lend itself to a variety of bed linen styles. I am satisfied.", 
    "The headboard was worth the money and easy to put together.", 
    "Bought this headboard for my guest room. The price is great it looks really good in the room. Easy to assemble. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "This headboard looks just like the photo. It serves as a great addition to my guest bedroom. It is finely crafted and impeccably designed. Christopher Knight Home furnishings does not disappoint! I did encounter a little trouble attaching it to the bedframe I purchased. The headboard arrives with 2 bolts used to attached the bedframe to the headboard legs, however I was only able to attached 1 bold to each leg due to the design of my bedframe.", 
    "The headboard looks like white vinyl. But the construction is great. The tufts on the leather headboard are more spread out than the tufts in the linen version. We ordered 2 and we think they look really 70s and make for an unexpected and fun design feature.", 
    "Looks precisely like what is in the photo. Actually with solid wood frame, very heavy, in a good way.", 
    "The headboard is not as high as it looks in the picture and I who's the bottom frame matched the headboard better. The metal sticks out under the headboard. It still looks nice though and not bad for the price!", 
    "I ordered the white leather finish headboard. It looks very fancy, but it isn't as tall in height as I expected. It isn't that high over the bed. Other than that, it was very easy to put together and overstock's delivery time was really fast. I love it in my bedroom and will purchase a tufted bench to pair with it", 
    "Lovely neutral beige works well with my different quilt and comforter sets. Well made, tailored look. I love it!", 
    "This headboard looks nice enough. Easy to install. But a little boring. However, I have gotten compliments on it. Nice for a \"beach\" themed bedroom. Sandy color.", 
    "Ordered for my extra bedroom, and I wasn't disappointed. It was just as pictured and love that it is adjustable so you can make it fit any height. Will keep Overstock on my \"go to list\".", 
    "I needed a headboard for my guest room. This looks just beautiful in there and I can't believe how great the price was!", 
    "Headboard for guest bedroom,beautiful tufting,the quality is there and I waited for sale.Only negative is that driver left it outside when I was home,it takes two people to carry and put together so make sure u have so one to help u.", 
    "Very happy. Headboard looksgreat, easy to put together andinstall. Queen size good fit.Thisheadboard makes our guest roomlook very inviting...", 
    "I love the headboard and I received it the *** day after I ordered it.", 
    "Very nice for the price. Sturdy and looks good. I have very deep mattress and had to jerry-rig it up off the ground to work, but it is fine.", 
    "Bought this for a guest room headboard--very nice touch to the decor.", 
    "Was better than I expected....The only suggestion I would make is in the directions...right and left leg is based on looking at thefront of the bed, but other than that I dould not be happier with this purchase......", 
    "perfect size headboard - great quality ! great value !", 
    "I bought this for a condo I will be furnishing in Florida in a few months. I did open the box to inspect & love the quality of this headboard. Normally the more tufts, the higher the price....retail stores are asking $300-$500 for a similar headboard. I can't wait to put this together in my new condo in Florida!", 
    "Easy to assemble, beautiful results, wonderful! Love it! It was easily assembled, the only time two were involved was when I had to hold it up while Fred attached it to the bed, otherwise it was great to put together and we are very happy with it!", 
    "The headboard is easy to assemble and is very attractive looking. It was shipped quickly and is a good value.", 
    "Installs easily. Looks great.", 
    "Bought this for my granddaughter and the princess LOVES it"
