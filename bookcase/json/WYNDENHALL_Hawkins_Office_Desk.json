    "We have been searching for a quality, attractive desk without spending $1,000. This fits the bill. It's modern and stylish. It's longer than our old desk. It took a bit to put together but nothing too difficult. WE ARE VERY HAPPY with this purchase. Only con - the keyboard tray is a bit wiggly.", 
    "This look was just what I was looking for. The clear coating on the wood started to peel right after we purchased it. I just didn't feel like going through the problem of returning it, although I have never had a problem with Overstock returns.", 
    "We were looking for a desk for my high school age son that was sturdy and had a keyboard tray. We were pleased that it was easy to put together and nice quality. There is enough room for him to spread out his books, papers along with the computer. I would recommend especially at this price point.", 
    "Love this desk! Very timeless and classically beautiful!", 
    "This is a gorgeous piece of furniture! Easy to assemble; my four-year-old did much of the work. It is quite heavy for the price and we couldn't be more pleased.", 
    "Got this desk for my son, it's very easy to put together and very sturdy. For the price you will not be disappointed.", 
    "Very nice desk. Sturdy and plenty of room with my dual monitor setup"
