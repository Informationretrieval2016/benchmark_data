    "Love these pans! I ordered them on a Monday night expecting them to show up on Saturday at best, and received them in 3 days. I just got a new glass top stove, and wanted pans that would be great for this and gas if ever I get to renovate my kitchen. These pans were great! I used them that night and could not ask for better pans. Everyone I talked to was worried because there are no non-stick pans, but with the right amount of oil and heat nothing sticks. The heat is evenly distributed, so the food cooks beautifully. The handles truly do not get hot, warm but not hot. I definitely recommend these for anyone who enjoys cooking.", 
    "I needed new cookware so I went with this Cuisinart set. I was delighted to receive it within two days of my order. I would give the set 5 stars except for the 9 quart stockpot with the strainer. The size of the stockpot is great, the matching strainer, not so great. It sits several inches above the top of the stockpot which doesn't allow one to fill the pot enough to boil pasta in. If you fill the pot high enough, then it boils out all over the place. I would also have liked a smaller stockpot or larger saucepan, around a 4 quart size. Other than that, I do enjoy my new cookware.", 
    "owen this before, i love my new cookware, wife said they are easy to clean, makes cooking simple", 
    "This set is beautiful and the quality is excellent. Thank you O for the great price and fast delivery.", 
    "Have this set for years now. Used on a daily basis. GREAT products, actually considering another set, thats how satisfied I am.", 
    "This set claims to have a rebate. Where is my rebate information? It doesn't say anything more about how to obtain the rebate. There was nothing in the box about the rebate when the shipment arrived. What do I do? I chatted online with customer service, and the person didn't know what to do either.", 
    "I really like this set of cookware. The only problem I am having is with food sticking to the bottom of the pots. You have to keep heat low, and I have but food still sticks and that is my only problem. I will continue to lower the heat and see if that helps.", 
    "Waiting to buy a new set of pans and the price on these was right. Very conductive on gas stove.", 
    "I bought this for my adult son for his apartment.. I suggested this as a Christmas gift when he mentioned that the handle of the only fry pan that he had snapped off. All reviews about this product were positive and Overstock.com had the best price. Except for a couple of pieces, we didn't take the entire set out of the box here on Christmas morning because we knew putting them back in would be a trick but I was impressed with the quality of the the pot and lid that I personally inspected. My son loves the set and is glad he now has enough cookware that he can throw out all the junk he was trying to make a meal with before. A great gift idea that flew completely under his radar.", 
    "This cookware is great. I thought long and hard about purchasing stainless steel. Like everyone else, I was afraid of the cleanup because I heard that everything would stick. After following the instructions that came with the cookware, clean-up is a breeze. I actually like this more than my non-stick pans. You don't have to use any specific kind of utensil. Just remember that you don't need high heat. I now cook on the #3 on my cooktop and everything cooks evenly and very nice.", 
    "Great set,looks good,and cleans up easily.The set arrived in perfect condition,and came fairly quickly.I have no compliants.I have a newsmooth top electric stove,and this set is excellent,as so many other sets are not smooth bottomed,and are to heavy.", 
    "Shipping was fast and accurate. The set was perfect and just what we wanted.", 
    "We changed all our pots & pans & loved how Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless Steel 14-piece Cookware Set looks, but can't season the frying pans! We have tried everything but everything continues to stick while cooking. Maybe prolonged use may help. I just purchased 3 non-stick frying pans because cooking eggs & breakfast hassle free is a must! All other pots perform great.", 
    "I gave this set to my son and daughter-in-law for Christmas this year. They both love it. MzAnna", 
    "The set was a Christmas gift. It was greatly appreciated. The pans are very solid and there are plenty of lids. Packing was excellent.", 
    "So tickled to get a new set of cookware. We have only been married 24 years and this is the first set we have actually bought. The first set we received at the reception and the second set we got many years later as a Christmas gift. I have been pleasantly happy with this set. I read all the other reviews and took into consideration what the other reviewers wrote (BTW, thank everyone of you for taking the time to post) I have Bar Keepers Friend on hand at all times to clean the cookware. They do stick if the heat is too high, but I can fix eggs perfectly by adding a small amount of water with the oil to the pan and not turning it up too high. I am thinking we are saving energy since the heat doesn't have to be all the way up. Also the added benefit of NOT having Teflon coating has tickled me pink!!! Can't think who makes that right now, but they can eat their own carcinogens. Also that the cookware isn't aluminum, but steel helps me to sleep because we all know that aluminum is hazardous to our health as well!", 
    "My kitchen is being remodeled --cannot wait to use this shiny cookware", 
    "I purchased this cookware for my mom as a birthday gift. She had been using the same set since her wedding 50 years ago! She loves this new set and likes that food doesn't stick to it like her old set. Mom also likes the long handles that don't get hot. Her old set had plastic handles.", 
    "Purchased to replace my 10-ish year old set of Cafe Collection cookware which was starting to get pinholes in the pans. Much lighter than my old set - very easy to lift and maneuver even the large skillet one-handed if necessary. Haven't use the steamer insert yet but love the pasta one!! I do wish the lids were see through - didn't think it'd be such an issue when I bought the set but now I really wish they weren't solid. Overall a great set that cooks evenly and cleans easily - just remember to wipe them down so you don't have water spots! :)", 
    "even heating and easy cleaning. so far a pleasure to use", 
    "Excellent pots and pans. Heaviness is workable. Cooks evenly. I used to have Le Cruset and absolutely loved them but they got too heavy for my hands and switched to this product. Enjoy them!", 
    "Great item that cleans up well in dishwasher and if you clean it by hand washing. Its a great set, that I personally have really wanted for a very long time. It works well on gas stoves. It has multiple pots for cooking that allows for easy cooking and clean up.", 
    "I love, love , love them and they cook beautifully", 
    "These are the very best pots I have ever used. Perfectly even heating across the bottoms. And did I mention that they are gorgeous? Very easy to keep clean, just swish or wipe out the big pieces and pop into the DW. Stunning! I had no idea that this set would be so perfect for me. If this set is in your budget, you cannot go wrong. Enjoy, because I love mine!", 
    "Christmasbpresent I sent and seems very nice", 
    "Could not beet the price offered on \"O\" - I tried :-)and I do love these the entire pot/pan is oven ready also. love that. I use this so much. The only draw back is I wish these sets had come with 2 each of the sauce pans. almost have to spend the same amount for two more individual sauce pans :-)also very pretty set and so easy to keep clean and shiny.", 
    "I was really excited to receive this set since I have always heard that stainless steel is very good. I has highly disappointed because everything sticks in the pan. Unfortunately we had to send back. :(", 
    "Pans are great I have my own set this set was purchased for a family member. But even I can't burn anything in them..", 
    "Everything looked good, but on the smallest pot there are a few tiny black spots (like pepper). I scrubbed and scrubbed but they haven't come off. They don't seem to affect the cooking, just the look of the pot. They tend to be hotter than my old pans so it takes a little getting used to.", 
    "Because they are not non-stick it is hard to cook certain foods with. Also, the inside changes to not as shiny after the first use. But I love the way the outside look and the weight.", 
    "I keep a kosher home and bought 2 sets. They cook well and at a lower heat. You do need to make sure you use oil, butter or non-stick spray, as they are not non-stick. But, if you're careful, things wont stick anyway.", 
    "pan sticks and the handles become warmer and warmer after a time while cooking - just opposite to what is said in description (\"Handles stay cool\" feature).moreover - handles are inconvenient and slippery. when you pick a heavy pot with hot anything inside - it is extremely complicated holding it with a tiny ribbed handle...", 
    "Like the way you can cook in them", 
    "We haven't had these long enough to really judge. Some of the pots have small brown circular spots on the inside bottoms. We use Bartenders Friend to clean them but the spots remain. It's not a big deal just a heads up. Food cooks wonderfully in them.", 
    "This item was actually purchased for the home we're selling as we have and induction range & few of our existing cookware was compatible. We ended up replacing most of it and this was one of the sets we purchased. As buyers are a bit wary of induction we purchased this set as an inclusion in the sale. Beautiful, well balanced and includes everything you need for cooking options.", 
    "One lid had a small dent on the edge, but still fits, otherwise love the products, esp the colander in the stock pot.", 
    "I am very happy with these. I love that the handles do not get hot when I'm cooking. Great value at a great price!", 
    "LOVE! Excellent clean up too. Fantastic set for the price, no reason to try to find a better caliber or more expensive set. I think you get far more than you pay for in quality here. I will buy another set when I have some extra funds just to have more pans.", 
    "This is a nice set and I enjoy using it.", 
    "The set of pans was received as advertised and was exactly what we were looking for.", 
    "She may not be the best cook in the world (I'm better) LOL but she wanted new pots and pans for her birthday. These were rated high and priced right . Bad news...my sister has them packed up in the garage because she said they burn everything...hmmmmm? I think I'll keep them and give them a try, if they burn MY FOOD, them they're going back! to be continued....", 
    "This is an amazing set and well worth the money. They are sturdy and strong and will probably be good for many years to come.", 
    "I received the cookware in a timely manner and everything was as I expected it to be. I have not had an opportunity to cook anything yet, but everything was there and I'm anxious to use it.", 
    "I bought this after looking around for a loooong time. The order was delivered quickly and packaged so that every piece was in perfect shape. After washing and drying the cookware I couldn't wait to use my new pans. I was worried that after using the cookware the shine would dull, not so. Cooks evenly and while the cookware is solid it is not so heavy as to be cumbersome. I love this set!", 
    "Yes, the inside of the pots and pans do fade a bit and discolor when you cook in them, but as long as you keep the outside clean, they remain beautiful. I love the variety of different types and each has it's own lid. I am really happy with this set. IT was packed well and each of the pieces are attractive.", 
    "Love this cookware! I've had it for about a month and use it every day. You do have to cook on a slightly lower setting, but clean up is very easy.", 
    "sent as a gift, very pleased with efficiency of sending product", 
    "The set of pans is exactly as described. They look nice, are easy to clean, and food cooks fine as long as you follow the directions and cook on medium to low. I have a flat top stove. I like the pot with strainer for cooking pasta. I also like the fact that each pan has its own lid. Bon Ami works well if you cook with heat too high.", 
    "The cook ware set is wonderful. They are a beautiful color and feel like quality products. I have used them often and while some food sticks to the bottom it all washes off very easily. Care is really simple and they are a joy to use. The only problem is that they say to never use them are more then medium high so boiling water takes a bit of time.", 
    "I purchased this set for my daughter who loves to cook and has wanted stainless cookware for a long time. She LOVES it and can't stop saying thank you. She had made omlets without sticking and clean-up problems, sauces, veggies etc. all effortlessly and without using much electric as the pots heat so evenly and retain the heat. This is one gift I really scored with and we both recommend it highly.", 
    "THis cookware set is a perfect gift ofr people that love their kitchen and want to give it an elegant look.", 
    "Came in a timely fashion. Very happy. Quality of pans good.", 
    "We lost our home to a fire on August 29th. After months of living in a camper, we finally purchased a new home. I bought a very high end stove with an induction cook-top. I ordered this cookware and was very excited about using it in my new home. This cookware does not work on an induction cook-top. I tried using the large skillet to make sausage gravy on a regulas cook-top and the sausage stuck so bad that I had to change skillets within 5 minutes. Unfortunately, I threw the box and most of the paperwork away during the heat of the move. This cookware is only beautiful, not functional. What really aggravates me is that additional cookware and wasted time aren't really in my budget right now."
