This Myra Rolling Bar Serving Kitchen Cart has a weathered and timeworn patina allowing traces of natural wood and original colors to show through. The frame is made of black sand metal with 3 tiers of storage area. The tray top and wine glass inserts make this bar and kitchen serving cart the perfect entertainment piece. There are metal hardware pulls added to the sides of the cart and rolling caters built onto the cart's bottom that allow you to move it from room to room with ease. The casters lock to keep the cart in place even if someone leans on it while preparing a drink.Materials: Poplar wood and black sand metalFinish: Black sandColor option: Brown, bistre brown, greyWine glass inserts, removable tray top, bottom storage, metal hardware pulls, Two (2) Locking wheelsTray top depth: 2.86 inchesBottom storage depth: 5.86 inchesTwo (2) Locking castersDimensions: 32.5 inches high x 26 inches long x 18 inches wideAssembly required: YesMaterialIron, WoodAssemblyAssembly RequiredCart TypeKitchen CartColorBlack, Brown, GreyCounter TypeWood
