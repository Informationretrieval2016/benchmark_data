    "Overstock has become one of my favorite shopping experiences. My husband and I just moved to a new house. I am an author and artist with an office/studio set up in our upstairs loft area, so I was looking for a stylish, cute red table for just that special spot in my loft and found this table. When I received it, the front leg was damaged at the u section that connects the leg to the table top. I was afraid I was going to have to re-box the whole table and ship it back. I didn't have to. During a chat session, the young woman I spoke to offered to either send an entire new table or replace the damaged leg. I was thrilled that replacing the one leg was made easy so I chose that option. I received the part today and am happy to report that my table sits right where it was designated to sit and it looks as charming as I expected it would. I have had issues with two separate orders including this one and have been absolutely thrilled with how overstock handled each situation. They truly do practice customer care. As a previous business owner I KNOW the utter importance of customer care. Overstock receives a five star rating from me!!", 
    "Better if it is higher and wider.", 
    "LOVE this piece. Going to use it in staging a condo - in the entry hall - really just the pop of color I needed and such a nice size - love it!", 
    "This table would have looked really nice in my entryway... if it hadn't arrived completely damaged. In three places. First we noticed that the rails that hold the shelf in place were broken and coming apart from the tabletop. We thought OK we'll just glue them and then make sure we don't put anything heavy in the drawer. Fine. But then we noticed that one of the legs of the table was completely snapped into two pieces! Irreparable. And packing the whole thing and shipping it back is likely to be more of a hassle than it's worth. What a waste.", 
    "Seriously, Overstock, it's well beyond time for you to demand that your suppliers to use something other than styrofoam for packing!! With so many green options available, please Overstock, the planet needs your attention to this issue! Also, the workers who pack these items are exposed to styrene which is toxic... Come on folks, we only have one planet. Do we really need decor that is shipped in toxins? I wouldn't have ordered this piece if I'd known about the styrofoam. **************"
