    "Just received this today. I ordered the charcoal which is a medium-to-dark cool gray and looks just like the picture on my monitor. I am a picky person so I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this is. It is very lightweight compared to how warm it feels - very cozy on this chilly night. I think of a \"sherpa\" as the guide who take hikers up a mountain so for anyone who is confused this can best be described as a faux shearling (sheepskin) on one side which looks pretty convincing but is much softer than real shearling. It does not catch on dry skin or hangnails like many synthetics tend to do. The reverse is a silky soft, sleek, velvety microfiber (that is not going to pill) on the other side The two pieces are nicely finished with a seam detail about 2\" from the edge and a faux miter seam at the corners.I am not experiencing any shedding from this even though I am wearing a brown wool sweater. It also appears durable enough that my cats won't rip it to shreds, though it has yet to be tested on that front.Definitely an excellent bargain and I would recommend it.", 
    "Cozy and warm great for guests or around the firepit", 
    "Very warm and silky. It was a very appreciated gift.", 
    "Unique throw. Looks expensive!", 
    "very comfortable. definitely a winter quilt....", 
    "This throw feels very soft and cuddly. However, it is very light-weight and not as thick as I had hoped it would be. The wooly side fibers are sparse and you can see a lot of the background fabric. It may be a good throw for someone who just wants a light blanket to keep their toes warm, but it won't keep you very warm on very cold days.", 
    "This blanket is very warm and great for cold days on the sofa. Easy to wash and not too bulky.", 
    "I really love this throw. Very warm n comfy. Just covers what you want it to cover. Very good item!!!", 
    "Grandma loved it and said it was soft and warm", 
    "Excellent quality, soft, and so very comfortable! Washes up beautifully. It is cozy and warm.", 
    "This Pro is soft and comfortable and it's better than the picture! The only problem is that me and my dog fight over it :-)", 
    "I ordered this as I have looked at \"similar\" products in the store and they ran $$$ or so. Obviously I didn't expect to get anything as thick, lush or soft as what I've looked at for $$.It's OK, sort of thin and I hesitate to wash it, (when I do, it'll be all by itself!) as I suspect it may fall apart. It's served its purpose, kept me warm after surgery and while I was recovering.", 
    "beautiful blanket and color", 
    "This is exactly what i was expecting I love it. Soft and warm.", 
    "Love it. Very soft and warm!", 
    "I gave this to my daughter and she loves the softness. I have had ones that were better made.", 
    "This is a great throw- it doesn't make me too warm or feel heavy. Comfy for this wet and cold time of year.", 
    "It's soft but not as soft as expected", 
    "This is a very soft and comfortable blanket.", 
    "Bought as a Christmas gift for 2 different families they both said it was a great gift."
