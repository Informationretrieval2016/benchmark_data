    "We bought this bookshelf because it was the perfect narrow size for our son's nursery. We couldn't find one in the yellow oak stain that would match the rest of the nursery, so we looked everywhere for a bookshelf that was REAL WOOD so we could sand and stain it to match. This bookshelf says that it's material is wood, but it is really particle board/MDF with a woodgrain sticker on the outside, so we cannot sand or stain it. Our baby is due this week, so I don't want to mess with trying to repackage and return it, and we'll now have to paint it... I never would have bought this if I knew it was cheap material. Buyer beware.", 
    "Bought this in white for our mud / laundry room entry. Perfect size for my husband's size 12 work boots! Heavy-duty, solid piece, that is not going to be \"sagging\" or warping any time soon - and probably not ever. Very nice finish - one that will easily handle regular cleaning since we are using this to put shoes in [versus books or decorative items]. The size could not be more perfect - for what we're using it for!", 
    "Don't love the color - looks unfinished. We stained it and it is a little better."
