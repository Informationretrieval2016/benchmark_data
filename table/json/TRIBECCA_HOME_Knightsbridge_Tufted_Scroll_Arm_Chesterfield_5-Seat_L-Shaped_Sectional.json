    "Pro: The style and shape is exactly what I wanted. This piece fits perfectly in my living room. The scale is what I wanted a sectional with comfortable seating that was not a monsterous sectional. Cons: If I would have saw this piece in person I would have never bought it. I am actually very sad over this purchase. Aside from the size that is where the pros stop. The fabric is extremely thin, almost cheap looking. Within on day I noticed a runner and several pulls in the couch. I live by myself so it is not like I have young kids jumping on it. This sofa would never be able to hold up to young children. Aside from the fabric looking cheap, I ordered what was supposed to be gray. This fabric is not gray. I was actually shocked when I looked at it. It is an odd black and white tweed looking fabric. It is not a solid color. I wanted a solid, gray modern chic piece. Instead what this looks like something I bought at a discount store made of remnant fabric. Not the look I was going for. I looked for several months before purchasing something. I wish I would have requested a swatch of fabric or something that would have allowed me to see the fabric first. The picture for the grey color does not reflect the true color. Like I said good size and shape, fabric horrible. I am almost embarrassed for people to see it.", 
    "So far...very happy with our couch..and with the service from Overstock.Will order from O again!", 
    "Love the look of this sectional. I would recommend having someone help with assembly. I did manage by myself."
