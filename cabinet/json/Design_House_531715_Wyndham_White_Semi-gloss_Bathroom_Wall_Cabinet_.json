    "Nice cabinet. No written instructions which I find easier... Also, it's up to you to figure how to mount it on the wall. Looks good after completed, but could have used better instructions The finish is very nice, and the doors quite well made Would go a lot easier second time around!.", 
    "Cabinet is well constructed, solid and versatile. Construction details need more written information not pictures, as I had to \"guess\" sometimes on location/ particular screw/ part..... took much longer to construct than expected but in the end \"good\" product.", 
    "Bought this cabinet based upon price and appearance, as others have mentioned there is no mounting hardware or really a good way to mount it. Due to this reason 2 months after purchasing the cabinet is sitting in my trash pile after falling off the wall and breaking. Definitely a waste of money.", 
    "This was not a very good product. The sides were not painted properly. the stripes of wood were not cut the same length that left gaps. It was very unstable. Poor quality. Needless to say ,I sent it back!", 
    "Just the right size for what we needed. This looks great in our bathroom.....added a few white accents and it was done.", 
    "The directions to put this piece together are poorly written. The doors do not close and there is a gap between them. The pre-drilled holes do not line up with the brackets so you need to drill your own holes. I would not buy this item again. It also does not come with a mounting bracket. For a wall hanging unit why would you not include brackets to hang it on the wall?", 
    "I am very satisfied with my new bathroom cabinet. Also, was not difficult to assemble."
