    "Very heavy, solid construction, easy to assemble. Beautiful finish. Good fit at the end of our king size bed", 
    "Talk about heavy duty and class all wrapped up into one. This bench is so sturdy and so beautiful. With teenagers we wanted furniture that would stand the test of time... So far it's winning lol \ud83d\ude0b", 
    "Sturdy, good quality wood. I have gotten many compliments!", 
    "Bought to complement our dining table. Strong, sturdy, beautiful, perfect buy.", 
    "This was a super good buy - I love it! You wont be dissapointed. Very sturdy, wood looks great - even better than I had expected. Packed and shipped well. Easy to put the legs on.", 
    "Love the look. Wanted a solid bench, this is it. However, it scratches so easily I am constantly putting on old english to cover the scratches.", 
    "Great piece in every way for the price and well-made", 
    "Exactly as pictured, extremely heavy well built piece of furniture! Love it!", 
    "fantastic bench aesthetically and functionallyone minor issue is w/ closer inspection there is one groove that was not cut correctly... seems like it is a defect", 
    "This bench is beautiful and extremely well built!!", 
    "We were worried about buying online, but the reviews on customer service were solid, so we went with it.Pros: Solid bench, matches table perfectly, easy/fast to put together, Smooth finish with no seams/gaps in between \"boards\" of table top, NOT at all picnic table like, delivery was 5d to CA, and very well packed.Cons: As others said, quality control issues - All the legs had some battle damage, 2/4 were pretty dented/scratched. BUT, went on overstock chat, told them about it, and BAM, new legs mailed out. Done. Super easy! Notes: Need two people flip/move after assembly between size/weight. Also, get a 13/16\" deep socket wrench and ratchet, makes putting together super fast/easy.", 
    "I bought the bench to match a dining table I purchased at Arhaus, which was made from reclaimed wood from India. Since this bench was also made from reclaimed wood from India, I hoped they'd match well. The first bench I received was assembled and felt very sturdy and solid, however there were two sizable areas ( 1.5 x 3\" and 1.5 x 5\") on the top surface of the bench that look like patches. This would be a big deal, considering it was reclaimed wood, but the patches felt like it was from a thin layer of veneer. There was a hollow sound when I tapped it with my fingernails, like it was going to crack with a little more pressure. Having a house of two young boys, I thought it was inevitably going to be punctured, and I'd be left with a bench with two big holes in them. I contacted Overstock.com's customer service online and was sent another bench top a week later. The 2nd bench didn't have any patches in it and looks great for the most part, but there were two small dings on the top surface that looked like shipping damage. I can live with the dings. Overall, not the best buy ever, but customer services was awesome.", 
    "The only thing that keeps me from giving this five stars is the fact that two of the legs came in a much darker color than the bench, itself, and the other two legs. Contacted Overstock today and they are sending us two new legs. This bench comes in a dark brown, as well as the lime wash finish that we purchased. Think the two dark legs must go with the darker version. Other than that, we love it!", 
    "We bought the Hamshire 60-inch Wood Bench specifically to go with the Deep Chocolate Cooper Dining Table sold on Overstock (Item #: 80004999). The length and style of the bench fit the table perfectly. The bench tucks neatly underneath the table without hitting any part of the table. The color of the bench almost matches the table perfectly. The bench is solid & heavy. It was a breeze to assemble. Just a couple of pieces, neither of which were damaged or scratched. After assembly, no wobbles at all. Couldn't be happier.", 
    "Ordered this bench as a rustic dining bench. It definitely fills the bill. The only thing is that 3 out of 4 of the legs have what look like hairline & larger cracks in them. One leg cracked through upon assembly tightening. Wasn't sure if it would be structural problem in future. I contacted Overstock and they offered to send replacement legs. No hassle at all. So they sent a whole new box of legs and 3 out of the 4 legs in that box also have the same cracks running through them. Honestly don't think that they are structural problems but if it is a problem in the future, I've got plenty of back-ups. I would not recommend the product but I do recommend Overstock. Was very happy with the way they handled this problem.", 
    "This product is very heavy, sturdy, and well crafted. The legs were easy to put on and took only minutes. It looks like a $XXXXX table (I am using this as a coffee table, not a bench). The white wash / distressed look is very well done and not like some of the pieces i see that look drab and worn out. It is very contemporary looking too.", 
    "I ordered this bench because it has a simple style. However, the bench arrived with a broken support beam underneath the bench seat. Given the protected position of this piece under the bench seat, I find it difficult to believe the piece was damaged during shipping. More frustrating, two of the four legs were not the same length, which means the bench tips. This was absolutely not worth the money. Do not buy this bench."
