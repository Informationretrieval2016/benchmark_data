    "Had to purchase nuts and washers to assemble product. Screws wer coated with strange plastic material so acetone had to be purchased to remove the coating. In excess of **** spent on acetone and screws. Product obviously was a return item judging by the taping and retaping of box.", 
    "I was very excited to receive my new beautiful table when it arrived there was barely enough tape to hold the two sides if the box together and of course the table was damaged.Overstock graciously sent me a new one but it arrived in WORSE condition, even without the nuts and washers needed to put it together. I'm so disappointed.", 
    "I am so in love with this gorgeous table for our kitchen nook. I purchased it on black friday and got an amazing deal of about half price. The quality is really good for the price. Im probably going to have a piece of glass made to protect the top but other then that i see it lasting a long time. Overall my best overstock purchase to date!", 
    "This set looks great but, if you plan on actually using it, be aware, the wood is very soft and it is easily scratched. I have owned it for 6 months, and it has scratches in it.", 
    "Gorgeous table & chairs, VERY STURDY.", 
    "Bought the chairs & table and I love it! The top surface of the table worries me a bit as it is a softer wood and could really leave gouges. I hope it works for us and doesn't look too bad after a few years!", 
    "A nice 4 person kitchen table. Be careful though, the table nicks and scratches very easily.", 
    "This table is very sturdy. I've had it for about a year now and am still very pleased with it. The cream and brown colors are beautiful together.", 
    "I bought this table for my kitchen. It looks exactly like the picture. Sturdy, well finished and very easy to ensemble! I'm 40 years old, no experience with tool and I'm proud of been able to do the job alone! :)Happy costumer over here!", 
    "I love the look of this table but was disappointed at how easily marks are left on the table. Every time a glass is placed on the table it leaves a ring.", 
    "The table arrived in good shape and the color was perfect!", 
    "Really great table. However, be SUPER careful. The table scratches very easily. I have gone ahead and purchased a glass tabletop from a local company for $235. It was worth the investment.", 
    "I'm very happy with this table. It was a great price and the quality is very nice."
