    "Very good backpack. Fits my 15.6 inch Dell laptop. I have a 9 cell battery on it so its quite bulky too. This seems to fit seamlessly into the bag. Doesn't feel congested at all. Plenty of room for everything else. A couple of books, files, stationery and of course all the junk we like to carry around. Its definitely not the cheapest bag out there, but it's definitely worth the money.", 
    "Great bag with plenty of room for everything. Very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "This backpack is perfect for the long haul. Use it for laptop and all necessary materials to run a moving office.", 
    "Great backpack for hauling books", 
    "High quality item at a good price, Fanz says \"Two thumbs up ! \"", 
    "My son is a teacher and he really loves his new backpack for several reasons. He can put his work supplies in it and be very organized going to and from work. Having the laptop area was perfect. I actually purchased this for him because he is going to be traveling soon so I got him a carry on suitcase and this backpack. Turns out he really loved it so much, he is using it for work as well. Lots of functionality and very sturdy.", 
    "Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.", 
    "I like the bag, it has a lot of pockets and sturdy construction. There front compartment isn't huge but it will carry a few books etc. My only complaint is that the bag itself seems very heavy. I guess all the padding to protect the laptop weighs it down. I think it's a great travel backpack but maybe a little much for school.", 
    "Very good product... strong and affordable", 
    "This is an excellent and top quality product that has great durability.", 
    "Great bag. Very sturdy and carries a 17'computer, notebooks, jackets and more. I'm very tough on my backpacks and can verify that it will hold upto heavy loads and use. Lots of pockets!", 
    "A good price for a good bag", 
    "I use this bookbag for airport travel and it's great. It makes going through the TSA easy because it's airport friendly. It's very sturdy and made of quality material", 
    "Bought for my son for Christmas last year. Six months later the zipper broke. Overstock would not replace. Back to LLBEAN that stands behind what they sell ~ forever. This was not a cheap purchase. Great looking and sturdy the six months the zipper worked. I guess I should read return policies better.", 
    "Like the back pack but I have had one better for storage but it only last two years (another brand) so I will try this one.Would have like to see a padded handle at the top and then a pocket in side with a flap in the first compartment for my passportI only had it a week but I do like it about 90% satisfaction.", 
    "great backpack, tsa compliant", 
    "Great purchase for my son. He still is using it for a 2nd year.", 
    "This is a great backpack. Plenty of room and good quality. We've had this backpack for almost a year and it is still good as new.", 
    "Very well made and nice looking!", 
    "Ordered this bag for a business trip to Europe. Was disappointed that the laptop \"scan\" feature couldn't be utilized in all countries, but it was extremely convenient in the US. Regardless, it was easy to remove and replace the laptop quickly.", 
    "As always Swiss Gear makes a very durable high quality backpack...I would expect this one to last easily 15 years! I really like the new design and color options.", 
    "Since my 11 yrs old goes thru 3-4 book bags a year, I wanted to invest in something more durable, and long lasting. This bag looks good, but not for a six grader. It has only one compartment for books, which is fairly small if you have to fit 2-3 books, and a couple of note books, and the 2nd compartment is almost useless... the only thing you can fit in, is a laptop. It looks big, but not so... It does have lots of small pockets tho, therefore it's a good organizer, but that's about it.", 
    "This is the finest backpack I HAVE SEEN!My 7.5 inch laptop fits like a glove and is well protected. They even gave me a spot for my tablet . I have plenty of room for all the extras ie: power cords, mouse manuals, and lots more. THIS IS A MUST BUY!Terry", 
    "I am a teacher and have been using this backpack for about a month now. I replaced a leather satchel that I had for 16 years that finally needed to be \"retired\", and a separate computer bag. This backpack is extra roomy and allows me to carry both comfortably. In fact, I can see that all the pockets could be a problem in that you could very easily overload the backpack and make it very heavy to carry. For a teacher, however, it's perfect for the computer and accessories, pens and pencils, and the papers and books required of the profession. On the somewhat negative side, it has taken me a while to get used to the side zippered laptop section. Now that I'm used to it, it's not so bad, but if I were be designing the bag for myself, I would put dual zippers on that pouch like the others. Another personal (and somewhat humorous) negative is that because of my age (I'm 62), I don't know what all the things are for on the backpack. There was no instruction manual to explain things like the twin side straps that link to each other, but don't go any where. Or the grey loop things on the tops of the carry straps that have no explanation. There are also three sewn loops down the front of the backpack that I can't figure out, and a small loop at the top of the backpack, beneath the carry handle that I don't know its function. Wenger Swiss Gear WAS nice enough to put a small glasses icon on a clip on the strap and a headset icon on a small pouch that allows someone who walks around with an mp3 player to be able to gain access to a unit carried inside the bag. Overall, I think this is a very well constructed bag that is a great value. I would definitely recommend the bag, and any negatives I have found (and listed) are just personal issues that I have and NOT a result of poor design or quality.", 
    "I owned a similar backpack from Swiss Gear and it lasted through 7 years of not so gentle treatment. The zippers finally wore out and it was time for a new one. I found that this model has an even better configuration of compartments and is built with the same quality I have come to expect from Swiss Gear. I would recommend this pack to anyone.", 
    "I had to replace a backpack that was stolen in Paris. My previous one had the right number of pockets that were perfectly located, and all I had to do was grab it and take off. I ended up buying 5 backpacks before I settled on this one. Recently, I was even able to use the ScanSmart feature at the airport, and it was so nice not having to take out my laptop and stuff it back in while trying to get through the security line.This backpack is very well-constructed and the zippers glide easily on their tracks. I love Swiss Gear's quality and I'm hoping this backpack lasts as long as my previous one.", 
    "Using it heavily for 2 months now - so can't say how long it will last - but as it was moderately priced - I am very pleased with it and it had more nooks than I thought - which is great for keeping things organized. Also - nice coloring. sharp black and true red.", 
    "Wenger does not make junk. I own both a regular laptop bag and now this backpack, and both are made of quality materials and workmanship. The big has a lot of padding for the laptop enclosure on both sides. Lot's of well placed pockets and this backpack is stellar. I purchased it to carry my laptop and other work related material on my motorcycle, but it is utilitarian enough to be used for day hikes or overall school pack as well.", 
    "I was excited to get this backpack for my 15.6 inch laptop. I have no issue with the backpack itself just the price. I am disappointed that I found the same backpack 2 weeks later for $20 cheaper. Oh well, this is my first and last purchase with Overstock.com. They don't really have the lowest price.", 
    "Excellent, good quality backpack fits 17 inches laptop", 
    "I had been looking for a nice, quality pack for several weeks. I wanted one with lots of different compartments and the ability to clip things to it. For the value this pack is GREAT!", 
    "Very impressed with this bag. Every aspect has been though of. I never write reviews but I had to write one for this thing. Easy to carry with the top handle. The bag pack straps hugs your back distributing the weight of my monster 17 inch laptop. This is by far the best bag for my laptop I have ever used.", 
    "I needed something bigger than a traditional laptop case. this will help me carry on more when I travel", 
    "I bought a very large laptop and had a lot of troubles finding a bag that would hold it. This bag does the trick. Even though it is a tight fit, it is easy to get the laptop in and out of the bag. Very happy."
