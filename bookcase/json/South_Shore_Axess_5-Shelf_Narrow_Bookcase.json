    "great shelf for a narrow space. Good, solid construction and attractive finish.", 
    "I ordered this one along with the wider one, unfortunately this one had a broken side wall. I have since returned the item and received a full refund. Easy return process. These are nice bookcases and as it turned out I could fit another wide one so I ordered another one.", 
    "This is a good size for a narrow bookshelf, but the finishing caps for the screws break very easily and look cheap and there was a scratch on the finish that I didn't see until I put it together.", 
    "Great product, easy install", 
    "Easy to assemble, nice stools."
