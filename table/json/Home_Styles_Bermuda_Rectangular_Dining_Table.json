    "I love my new table. It compares favorably to other tables that I looked at which cost much more than this one did. Since I was working alone, it took me a while to get the table assembled, but the directions were clear and all the hardware that was needed for assembly was included. Did I say, I love my new table.", 
    "We recently purchased this table in espresso. I love it!! It was the perfect style for our formal front room and goes well with both our black cabinet and our dark brown bookcase. It as a sturdy, quality feel and looks great. It arrived in perfect condition without a nick, scratch or bump. My husband and I put it together in about an hour. Assembly isn't too bad, but you MUST have a drill to help with a few screws. The unique size of the table makes it very versatile. It's small and narrow enough to be a large desk, and large enough to be a small dining room table. (We're using it, with the insert, as a desk.) A great buy! Highly recommend.", 
    "This table is very heavy and was fairly easy to put together. It is very bright white color. It was well packaged with no dents or scratches. It really does not look like wood it looks like some kind of fabricated material.", 
    "seems to be made out of some kind of composite wood, and the stain (espresso) was not applied evenly on the top. At one corner there's a triangle patch that is barely stained, so it's several shades lighter than the rest of the table top. Also scratches too easily. But I love the shape (allows me to seat 6 nicely)", 
    "I used it yesterday for my banquet..I love it.you just have to protect the surface..i love tablecloths so I always have a beautiful cloth on it..", 
    "This table is not Espresso. It's really a dark cherry. On top of the color being off, I had to order this table 4 times before I received one that was in acceptable condition. It scratches extremely easily, it's hard to clean, and in my opinion it's not worth what I paid. Very disappointed with this table. However, if you're looking for a dark cherry table that has that \"distressed look\" and will look even more distressed within a few days of use, this table might be for you", 
    "I have now received two of the Bermuda dining table in the espresso finish, both came with factory defects in the finish that made them impossible to use. The first one had a corner which wasn't coated with the finish properly, as well as patchy areas along the side of the table top. I didn't even finish taking the second one out of the box, because the first table piece I removed had a large chunk of finish missing in a conspicuous area. I'm disappointed that Overstock is carrying an item that has such quality issues.", 
    "Pretty basic but good quality table. I love that there is a leaf which I just ended up leaving on but not crazy about the very noticeable lines that are around the leaf on the white table.", 
    "Searched for a dark cherry table with different but beautiful legs. This is the only one that caught my eye that also had a leaf for extension when needed. It is well made, easy to assemble and the color is gorgeous. It matches my cherry cabinets in my kitchen. I also received it within 2 days during the holidays which was impressive! Was missing 2 tabs for the bottom of two legs but received then quickly in the mail after making a call. Very satisfied with the table and the service I received.", 
    "This table was exactly as described. Great quality for the price. Relatively easy to put together. Very happy with the purchase and would recommend this to others.", 
    "The size of this table was exactly what I was looking for. I wasn't sure about the quality of the wood and was not really pleased with how it shows in the photo. The finish is not excellent but for the price, it was good quality and the fact its solid wood is definitely plus. I was hoping to find the folding expanding leaf but this locks very tight and haven't had any issue. I'm using the table with table cloth and I would highly recommend to do that since the finish doesn't have strong protection against stain and pressure. Overall, I'm very pleased with the product and glad we got it.", 
    "Arrived with two identical sides (not male/female), I could not contact them because their business hours are remarkably limited (9 - 5) The two nights I was able to call in before they closed I was on hold until they closed (5:00p eastern). They sent incorrect hardware 3 times. Then they finally sent the correct side of the table, but it was Damaged. Last communication was a clarificat ion of the shipping address - really? Assuming the yhave sent the correct side of the table, and it arrives, within 5-7 business days, undamaged, I will give it a better rating. This has been a real hassle. My husband, who is retired, and has done the lion's share of communication with Home-Style, noted,\"They really don't have their act together.\"I never communicated with Overstock Customer Service because I could not find that information on their web-site.", 
    "I ordered the white version which is nothing exceptional. It's an ok table for an ok price. I'd recommend two people to put it together because inserting the leaf can be a bit tricky and the table is difficult to pull apart if you're only one person. This is one of the more disappointing purchases from Overstock whose customer service is outstanding!", 
    "I have been looking for a nice eclectic dining table, and I found it in this table! The finish looks like genuine Macassar Ebony! And it goes great with my tall leather Parsons chairs, and ghost side chairs on the side. It's perfect, and it arrived in perfect condition.", 
    "It is the perfect sized for my small cramped kitchen. I distressed it to match my country home decor.It has a leaf for when company comes or I want to bake.", 
    "Great item, arrived in a great time i believe it got here in 2-3 days. Great condition, dark wood just what i wanted."
