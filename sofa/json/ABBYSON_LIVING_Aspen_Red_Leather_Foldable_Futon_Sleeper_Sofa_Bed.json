    "This was the second attempt to get this couch, a NEW one. Unfortunately, this couch has visible color defects right in the center. We thought it was a mean joke sending us the defective couch for the second time in a row. Very frustrating.", 
    "Feels amazing and looks great", 
    "When it arrived it was real easy to assemble, once I found the parts zipped into the bottom of the futon. It is a little smaller than expected, but overall a decent look for the price point it is at. I am not sure anyone can really sleep on it except very small people or a casual inebriated friend. Overall good value for the money.", 
    "I received this couch approximately two week ago and love it. It's comfortable and sleek, and the leather is good quality.", 
    "We are MORE than pleased with this futon. It is very attractive, comfortable, and adds a fun addition to my grey/red livingroom. It was so easy to put the legs on, and walla...it was up and ready to use.", 
    "Very comfortable, leather is soft not too hard. The red leather is a perfect shade of red. Perfect for my teenagers room, for sleep overs, and playing his xbox with friends.", 
    "This leather sofa is perfect for my home office which now can double as a guest bed if needed. The leather is soft and the color is accurate. The delivery was fast and timely.", 
    "We love the color and comfort", 
    "this is really a beautiful piece of furniture and it's worth every penny", 
    "The red is not right is light and dark", 
    "this is a beautiful futon.......very soft to the touch and it looks great.",
