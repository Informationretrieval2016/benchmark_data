    "One of the cheapest pieces of furniture I have ever bought and the quality is commensurate. It is practically made of compressed cardboard painted white of the outside. It doesn't come with any screws, but it gets glued together. And it is not even white, but a dirty version of white. Do not recommend buying.", 
    "Love this bookcase! Perfect next to my bed. Easy to put together. Practical and very affordable.", 
    "I use it for small books and decorations. It's perfect for that purpose.", 
    "This bookcase was quite easy to assemble with few tools needed. We like the smooth finish look and the size is perfect. We needed shelves large enough to hold music books (including 3-ring binders) for our organ. this bookcase fits the bill nicely, yet takes up very little space. It is a nice buy!", 
    "I don\u0092t typically write reviews, but I liked this product so much that I decided to look up their website and see what else they had. It was very disappointing to see that I could have purchased the same exact product from the ***. The only downside to that is the awful amount they charge for shipping. Regardless I did manage to find yet another website that offers free shipping and sells the same product for $$$. Will definitely be ordering more, but not from Overstock :( >.. Very easy to put together. Took me about 8 mins."
