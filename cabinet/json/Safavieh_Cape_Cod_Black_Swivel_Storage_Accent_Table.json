    "These tables are good quality, look great, excellent value!!!", 
    "I was interested in this piece for months, but each time I was ready to buy .. it was sold out! Finally I got lucky in more ways than one. This is the 2nd table I've bought from Overstock.com and this one is just wonderful. Lighter than I expected but more beautiful than the pic can show! I checked around and other sites that carry it are $20 to $70 MORE!! You can't go wrong with Overstock, or with this black revolving swivel table. Packing was superb as usual, no damage whatsoever! GET IT while U can!!", 
    "This cabinet extremely met our expectations. It is well built, swivels, has a drawer and shelves. The color is black which is what we needed. It was scary ordering online without seeing the product but we have not been disappointed. It would be great if they even make a larger cabinet such as this one.", 
    "This cabinet fit perfectly. We had a small space next to the bed and wanted a night stand with a door and drawer. A plus is the fact that it comes already assembled.", 
    "This table is exactly what I wanted. I purchased it as a night stand. The color (black) blends well with my new decor. The height is good beside my bed. The inside is deeper than I thought, the drawer comes out further than I expected. The top can accomodate a lamp and telephone. I like it a lot. I am considering purchasing another one. I like the swivel feature. The workmanship is excellent. No nicks, chips or dips, no odor. Great purchase", 
    "These cabinets are so useful. I am using them (bought 2) as night stands and the little drawers are great for my box of tissues and my tv remote. The two shelves behind the door are unbelievably roomy and serve for a great amount of storage. I am very pleased with that purchase.", 
    "Great quality and extremely well made. Great buy also", 
    "this table looks great in my room next to my chair", 
    "I had an awkward corner in my home office where I wanted to place a lamp. I could have used a \"corner\" type cabinet, but the round, barrel shape of this little unit was just a bit quirky (in a good way) and fits the corner perfectly. The black finish is attractive and the piece fits in well with the traditional style furnishing of my office, a very nice accent piece.", 
    "Great quality and attractive.", 
    "This is a nice sturdy little table. It was well packaged and arrived in perfect condition.", 
    "The swivel isn't as smooth as I hoped. Lacks refinement. Nice simple storage solution however. I would recommend it for casual decor settings.", 
    "I see small side tables like this in the same price range all over the place, at local retailers like ***and ***, and online. A lot of the ones I've actually seen in this price range tend to be kind of insubstantial, and like they'd be easy to knock over. This little guy is solid and has some weight. Nobody will knock this over unless they push VERY hard. The little drawer and cabinet with shelf is a bonus! You can never have too many places for additional storage! I think this is a great value for the price."
