    "This product was better than I expected. I am very happy with its look so far, very simple, exactly what I wanted. It looks like the photos, color is basically spot on. It is grey but still resembles a grey with a hue of a light brown. The instructions were simple and straight forward, I followed them step by step and successfully put the tv stand together in less than 45 mins. (I was also watching TV while working on it). Typical instructions through, just step by step with pictures.", 
    "We were taking this to our daughter's new apartment so we had it delivered to our house to make sure there weren't any issues. Lucky we did. One of the shelves did not have the threaded screw hole where the front of the shelf attached to the metal sides. We used a sheet metal screw instead and screwed it right into the shelf. Plus the top shelf is only screwed down at the two front corners. So when you lift it, the back of the top shelf comes up. It is held in place by metal dowels,but not held down in the back. We used a corner brace that allowed us to attach the shelf divider to both the back and top. This worked well.", 
    "I am in love with the finished look of this product PLUS it is very sturdy! The only down fall is during the assembly process things weren't labeled correctly or the directions gave a very confusing way of directing the assembly which made it a little more work and time. Other than that, it is wonderful.", 
    "This is such a beautiful tv stand. It adds so much class to my living room. I live the weathered grey look. Great color and great price. Easy to install and my husband is not handy.", 
    "Super easy to assemble and a great price for the size and style. Perfect for that shabby beach look.", 
    "Bought this for my room and it was a great choice very sturdy for the price and looks and feels like a very expensive piece. Do not hesitate get it now!!!!", 
    "Sturdy, wide and heavy. Very pleased. Incredible quality for the price.", 
    "Box was sent with two pices the same, so not worth it to send back since had drama geting it delievred. I have a covering on it to hide that one side is inside out being sent me two right sides.", 
    "Very durable and matches the decor of my room to a \"T\".", 
    "Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.", 
    "Fairly easy to put together and it got the job done. It's not that expensive but stylish, which is what I was looking for.", 
    "Very heavy piece alnost too heavy cannot more it witbout 2 peolle. Was surprised the wood was covered with what appears to be contact paper? Guess it will look better once the TV and equipment is on it. Probably will buy baskets for the bottom shelf.", 
    "First stand arrived damaged and had to wait for a replacement. Second stand was fine. Took two of us a couple of hours to assemble. Not difficult- but directions lacked some fine details which made it necessary to disassemble twice. Have had lots of practice assembling furniture and these directions were very brief. Also, one screw came out of a shelf as the MDF is merely supported by a wooden plug inside. This was not enough to hold metal sides to MDF board. Everything else is pretty tight, so we are just taking extra care when moving table. Cosmetically, this fits the bill. Glad I didn't pay more for piece than I did.", 
    "I really like this tv stand. It is sturdy, and pretty durable. I've left cups and all types of things on the top, and it still looks good. It has also survived several months with three little kids. It is not real wood, but you wouldn't know it from looking at it. Putting it goether took me longer than it should have because I had some pieces backwards, but if you take your time and check your work, it is pretty easy. Overall, I'm very happy with this tv stand, especially for the price.", 
    "Hard to put together if you're alone...get help if you can. Overall looks great in the living room.", 
    "Very heavy but easy to assemble. Instructions are clear and concise. Sturdy and looks amazing.", 
    "Very Sturdy heavy and strong. one of the best made pieces of furniture sold on Overstock.com", 
    "I love my new TV stand. It's sturdy & is a great addition to my home.", 
    "This was my first purchase through overstock and I am very impressed! The furniture was not cheap when I put it together. Being familiar with target and ikea, I was expecting a struggle with assembly (I'm a single girl in her own apartment who doesn't like to ask for help). But the stand was quality which made assembly much easier than expected. It goes perfectly with my living room and I love walking in and seeing it!Highly recommend :)", 
    "it is fine. simply that. the first one came so banged up the interior was shattered, but overstock replaced pronto. low cost so i got what i expected. be careful, the screws into the top portion are too long and bust through the particle board. but it is great for about $*", 
    "This was for daughter, who had no problem assembling it. Looks great and solid. Very happy.", 
    "Very nice piece of furniture, especially for the price.", 
    "A very nice TV stand nice conversation piece . I brought it for my bedroom and it brings out bedroom very nice quality !!", 
    "The materials are very good quality, it looks bigger once you put it together, very modern.", 
    "Beautiful, sturdy TV stand-perfect size for my 48\" TV. Two of the pieces were mis-labeled for assembly purposes, but I was able to sort it out.", 
    "Item arrived exactly as pictured. Very easy to assemble. It says you need two people but I assembled it myself. Happy with my purchase.", 
    "Good for the price, nothing overly special but nothing wrong with it either!", 
    "Looks better than the quality but the price is right", 
    "everything arrived on time and in great condition. Couldn't be happier.", 
    "Can't put product together. Had to have product replaced twice and finally gave up and just returned it altogether.", 
    "This product line is all stickers and fake wood. It is sturdy with the amount of screws you put into it. I am sure it will hold more weight than listed. It has a back piece which I didn't notice when buying that was a pleasant surprise.Overall for the cost of the unit, its a good buy.", 
    "Being that this was inexpensive, I got what I paid for. the \"wood\" is particular board with a contact paper coating that is bubbling at the curves of the \"wood\". It took my husband many hours to put together and at one point, we were about to give up. My husband is a very handy contractor and never has issues with construction. With that said, it is now in place and does the job.", 
    "The TV stand is sturdy and easy to build. Some of the table layers were labeled with incorrect stickers indicating they were different letters, however it was easy to figure out. It looks great overall and is strong & durable. The color is perfect and exactly as pictured.", 
    "This tv stand was relatively easy to put together over the course of 2 hours - excellent instructions - and it's really great looking. We have it in a room that features designer furniture and it looks like the same quality as the really good stuff! Very stylish and sturdy.", 
    "This is a very sturdy piece of furniture. The directions were clear and easy to follow.", 
    "I thought that this table was hard to put together. Some assembly required is an understatement. The shelves are pretty heavy and it took me an hour to finally set it up. It looks nice and doesn't take up alot of space in my living room.", 
    "I love the look of this TV stand. Very simple but stylish. The frame is very sturdy. I had some issues with putting it together but it came out great. I liked the style so much I bought the coffee table and end table to match. Such a cool set."
