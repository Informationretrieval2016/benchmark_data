    "The chairs are more beautiful then the pictures when you are ordering them I love them", 
    "I wish I would have read the other reviews more thoroughly... the table IS very low to the ground. I'm hoping the chairs I purchased separately, will make sense with it. I saw the dimensions but the picture is misleading because it looks like a traditional table set...it's LOW. The \"legs\" are somewhat adjustable but after putting together, one leg was shorter than the other so if I adjust them all now, it will rock again. On the upside, putting it together was pretty quick and easy...after I found all of the screws and whatnot that fell out of the package.", 
    "Substantial table! Very solid.", 
    "This is a solid piece of furniture. It is HEAVY, and just the perfect size for my smallish dining room. Table seats 4 comfortably, but you could squeeze in another 2 diners in a pinch. Although, it would be nice to have a small leaf to expand table size. Satin black finish matched my kitchen and other black dining room pieces perfectly. Assembly was average, not too hard. This purchase met my expectations.", 
    "Appearance is great, and looks like a more expensive table, but the construction is suspect so I think I will be replacing it within 2 years", 
    "This table is great for a small space, but a bit too short for a normal dining table. The border along the edge takes away even more space, so it's quite tight. I will be using this as a game table and replace the dining table with something taller.", 
    "I chose this table for its clean, simple lines and affordable price. It is just the right size for my dining area and can be matched with many varieties of chairs. It was easy to assemble and not too heavy...did it myself without assistance....and I am a small 67-year-old woman. It wipes clean easily and is water resistant, so I don't worry about marring the smooth surface, but I do use place mats to protect it. The table is also sturdy. Good choice for me!", 
    "My daughter loves it in her apartment. It was delivered in perfect condition."
