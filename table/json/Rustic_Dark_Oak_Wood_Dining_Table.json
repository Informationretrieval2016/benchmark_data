    "The table took some time to assemble as I had to look several steps ahead to see how the piece would be used to make sure I put it in the right direction but the end result is worth it. The table is solid and beautiful. A very nice piece.", 
    "The color is more cherry than dark oak, so this table was more red than the dark brown I wanted. It is very sturdy and the perfect size for my space, so overall I am pleased.", 
    "beautiful... only drawback, all of the damn pieces", 
    "A little hard to put together as the other reviews state. Also, be sure you do not put it face down on a surface that can scratch it. I had to buy the stain pens to fix it, but since it is distressed anyway, I hope it will add to the charm. I suggest assembling face down on a blanket. It is a beautiful table once complete.", 
    "The box and the pieces are heavy. It came with over 100 screws and was made pretty sturdy. We love the colors. The only thing we wish that it could have been different is the hammered pattern on the table surface. You could tell that it isn't authentic mark and very intentional because they are very repetitive as if it as made by a machine. The hammered marks on the leafs are pretty much identical.", 
    "The other reviewers don't lie - its a pain to put together. I have blisters today from turning the screwdriver so much. Two people took four hours. I gave it 4 stars because it is more redish than I thought it would be, the assembly is annoying and I can't for the life of me figure out how the leafs store within the table?? I do love it though and it looks great in our kitchen.", 
    "Purchased this for my husband's home office. Stain color matches perfectly. Quite a few pieces to put together. Do not use a power tool, it causes too much force and will go thru the top (my husband did this)! Overall, a great table. We have received many compliments on this piece!!", 
    "Great table with extensions will easily seat 10", 
    "This table is wonderful, just what we wanted for large family gatherings..However, it came in a gazillion pieces and was VERY difficult to put together. Thus a 4 for a great but mind boggling table.", 
    "this table Is great !very nice"
