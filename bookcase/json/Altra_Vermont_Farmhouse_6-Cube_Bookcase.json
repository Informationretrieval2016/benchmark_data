    "Was not at all difficult to put together....did it alone in about 2 hours and I am a 70 year old woman. Be sure to check that you have all the parts and follow the instructions to the letter. Not good quality at all but believe you would need to have a really close look at it to detect a short-fall. Someone visiting your home and viewing the cabinet would think it sturdy an attractive. When I assemble furniture and have handled each piece I know each flaw but in time forget the tiny flaws and just enjoy the unit in total.",
