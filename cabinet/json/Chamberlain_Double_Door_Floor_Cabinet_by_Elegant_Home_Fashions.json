  "reviews": [
    "Overall quality/value is good for the money. The door gaps were aligned well all around, however there is a big gap between the two doors that makes it look cheap.", 
    "Overall this was exactly what I wanted but was very disapointed that the washers were missing. The missing was was a manufacturing error. These washers were glued in several places on the item but missing them on some of the ends. The fasteners and screws that were bagged were all there. This was simply a quality control issue by the manufacturer.", 
    "It looked nice, but the quality was poor, the doors didn't line up correctly and they were very wobbly....sent it back without a problem and still love OS", 
    "First delivery of the cabinet was great they said it would be here on Friday and I actually got it on Thursday so that was a great surprise. Opened box all the part were there but no directions, lucky for me I have put quite a few products together so only took about 45 minutes and that was without the instructions. The only thing i really don't like is that the shelves are not completely stable when you put in towels the shelves lift up and the magnet that door closes against could be bigger it doesn't stay closed good. But other than that the cabinet is nice and looks great in the small space I have.", 
    "This cabinet looks very nice however it did not come with any instructions. I looked up the manufacturer on line but there was no help there. I had to pay someone to put it together and unfortunately not all the parts matched. The doors did not line up exactly right so the magnet does not hold them completely shut. Shame that there were no assembly instructions as the cabinet really is very functional and makes a nice piece of furniture for small spaces.", 
    "I love having this furniture in my kitchen for storing my cookbooks", 
    "Wife had 3 stroked and need something to put supplies and medical items in and it is perfect and everyone sees it says were you get that at it's is perfect", 
    "Simple assembly despite the funky instructions. Great quality for the price. Looks great. Nice size and it is almost counter top height. I may buy a second one.", 
    "Purchased for bathroom. Just love it.", 
    "excellent storage space and very elegant", 
    "This cabinet is just what I needed for my bathroom. As a matter of fact the color is close to my bathroom cabinets. It was real easy to assemble but heavy and study. The magnetic clasp on the doors do not hold as I would prefer. However, since this is my bath, I do not expect my grandchildren to be opening the doors and getting in the cabinet.", 
    "The back pops out. If it is against the wall, you may not care if it pops out. The doors don't close if anything is sticking out even slightly. I use it as a pantry, so even if a bag of rice is protruding, the door will swing open.", 
    "I just needed a small cabinet for my china and this works perfectly. It looks very nice as well.", 
    "I love this little cabinet, I bought it to display some blankets and it is just right. It is much heavier than I thought it would be, and after reading some of the reviews I was worried it might look cheap but it looks great. The cabinet doors do match up and stay closed if you install them correctly (make sure the magnets are at the top!), which was a concern. Definitely would buy this again!", 
    "Not the best quality for the dollars.", 
    "If I could give less then one star I would. It is flimsy, the holes did not line up, one corner was chipped off, and the doors won't stay shut so I have them tied with a ribbon until I can work on it. Once I put floor pads on it and tried to move it, I heard a loud crack so I guess I can't use this as a pantry cabinet....", 
    "This is a very nice little cabinet I use it by my desk to store paper for the computer and papers Just saying that you can use it for a lot of different uses not just what it is advertised as.", 
    "this piece arrived unassembled but actually went together pretty easily. all holes and hardware were correct and , while the directions didn't provide a ton of detail, there was no problem. i like the glass doors with magnetic catch. seems like it would scratch easily...i think it's just veneer. the only problem i really have with it is that the back wall is very cheap, thin, bendy material with a plastic joiner down the middle. it's very cheap and not substantial at all. i think a piece of corrugated cardboard would be stiffer.", 
    "Very cute but we followed the instruction and everything lines up correctly but the doors are always flying open.", 
    "Looked hard and long and settled on this piece. The piece couldn't be too high nor too tall nor too wide, and the color. It replaced a 25 year old receiver cabinet. The product arrived as stated. There was no dents or breakage of any kind to the product. Unfortunately there was a defect on the top part. I am so glad that they were able to just replace the one piece and not have to ship the entire product back. Had to switch a part around in the assembly stage. (Operator error). Wasn't looking at it from front to back. It's steady enough for the item we have placed on top. And it works for the application we needed for the price.", 
    "The exact cabinet for which I have been looking. I wanted a small, inexpensive display cabinet for souvenirs, and this fits the bill. I will put glass tiles on the shelves to display items better. The directions were easy to follow and I only had to use screw drivers. It's not as well constructed as my $$$$ cabinet, but it was a good buy for the money.", 
    "Very nice and I would recommend using glue when assembling. Looks very classic.", 
    "Piece fits wonderfully in a narrow bathroom were extra storage is needed. The finishing looks very nice and fits nicely with the furnishings in the house. Easy to put together and extremely helpful.", 
    "The color is nice. Other than that, there is nothing else I can say that is positive. Took me awhile to figure out how to attach the sides to the bottom, and then to the top. Cabinet is very wobbly. I would not feel comfortable putting anything breakable in it - it might collapse on top of it.", 
    "Ok for the money. Not bad for the price paid. Had a few issues setting it up.", 
    "it was terrible to put together; parts broke and we had to finally glue it together. it was a good thing that my spouse was handy with fixing things.", 
    "It is a very nice cabinet.I like everything about it except it is not very strong.I kept the cabiet tho.maybe I can tightin it up later.yes I would recommend it to a friend.", 
    "The color of this cabinet is beautiful The glass doors really gives it an expensive look. The only problem I have with it is that it does not feel stable or study. I am using it in my guest bathroom for towels, washcloths, etc., so it should hold up. If it had some type of brace that helped to make it feel more study, it would be an excellent piece.", 
    "It's lovely to look at and the doors DO stay closed however the back panel (as I've found w/ most 'put it together yourself furniture') is cheap and very flimsy. It's the same rigidity as a piece of acrd stock. But as long as it's against a wall and not visible it is a cute, functional shelving unit.", 
    "I would agree that this cabinet is not of the highest quality. It feels somewhat fragile and unstable when assembled. But, it is a fair value for the price paid and it has a nice appearance.", 
    "The cabinet arrived on time which was great, BUT, it was not easy to assemble. Also, it came darker than viewed and also had quite a few scratches and nicks in it. I'm going to keep it because it will probably cost me more to send it back then its worth. Shame on you, Overstock.com", 
    "This was easy to assemble and went toogether nicely. It is perfect in my bathroom to hold extra towels and washcloths. It does not take up a lot of space for the amount of storage it provides and it was much nicer than I expected. Love overstock!!", 
    "I have this piece in my entryway to the kitchen. I have my wine glasses etc displayed in it. Very nice piece of furniture. I know it's suppose to be for towels, but looks good anywhere", 
    "I ordered this cabinet because I wanted a very nice, subtle, but elegant cabinet for my guest bathroom. This definitely did it's job! It has ample storage space and fits in very well in my bathroom. One issue: I was missing a few parts when I received this item, BUT I contacted the number on the assembly instruction sheet and got very prompt and friendly customer service! No extensive waits, no rudeness, and my replacement pieces came within the next 2 days! Great cabinet for the price, and their customer service is exceptional!", 
    "This cabinet has been a perfect fit for my small hallway space. I was looking for something with glass doors and this fit the bill. The assembly was quite easy which I assembled alone and had no problems. The piece isn't heavy or what I would consider high quality, but I am using it to display my knick knacks so it's been a great little piece. I'm not crazy about the woodtone, so may eventually paint it. Can't beat the price!", 
    "Simple and beautiful. I was about eight months pregnant and was able to put this together. It comes in a million pieces and has a lot of bolts and screws, but it was simple to put to together. Just READ the instructions. I also love that I was able to match this to the cabinet color exactly already installed in my house. Also the box shipped in is super heavy so if you may need extra hands. Other than that I have no complaints about this. Great for storage in my master bathroom.", 
    "The product is great. Why Overstocks would send an item without instructions is beyond me. Had to wait 3 days fro them to be emailed with the unit in pieces in my tiny NYC apartment. When I went to read reviews, I saw this occurs regularly. The piece is good., but I'll never order from Overstocks again as I don't need more frustration in my life.", 
    "Because this cabinet was reasonably priced, I was a bit hesitant that I would receive a quality products. It is solid wood throughout (except for the back section). The most amazing thing to me was that the assembly was flawless. Everything fit together and it looks like a lot more expensive piece of furniture.", 
    "the magnate si not strong enough to hokd the door closed, otherwise good", 
    "This was not difficult to assemble, and everything fit just fine. I like the fact that the shelves are adjustable. The wood color is medium which goes with most other woods. The magnets that hold the doors closed are not very strong. I put 2 small glides under the front legs which lifted the front up about 1/4 inch. This solved the problem. The size is really perfect for my needs. I wish I could get 2 more to make a horizontal bookcase arrangement.", 
    "Beautiful cabinet. Looks far more expensive. I have it in my kitchen for all my cookbooks and it looks great and is so functional.", 
    "this is a nice looking cabinet, it's exactly as the picutre show on internet, but the only thing i was dispointed was the door, the doors don't kiss the magnetic they have originally installed in. but i still keep it becus the look.", 
    "I brought the Chamberlain floor and wall cabinet. They look great together in my bathroom. They do not take up much room and they are great for storing bathroom articles. My bathroom looks like a completely different room. I am so glad that I purchased both these items. My guest love the look and feel it gives my bathroom.", 
    "This cabinet makes a nice addition to my main bathroom. Has room for guests to set things on and holds extra's like soap, toilet paper, hair dryer, washclothes, etc. The only problem i had is with the magnet for the doors. I have to add some magnet for it to latch. It was not drilled quite close enough to the front of the cabinet and i was unable to move it close enough.", 
    "This cabinet fits my needs for linen storage in the bathroom. It was easy to assemble and is sturdy."
