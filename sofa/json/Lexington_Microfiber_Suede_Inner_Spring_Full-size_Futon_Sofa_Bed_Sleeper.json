    "I received my article very quickly. The directions for assembly were clear. All needed accessories were included. I like my product very much.", 
    "seat gets slightly saggy, drawers came apart and are not strong enough to store items, no even wrapping paper. will not attempt to store anything and sadly that was the main purpose of this purchase, I strongly regret not going to a furniture store, can not wait to get rid of this sofa and get a better one. Shame on me!!", 
    "The wood in this couch is nice and very pretty, The cushion is really bad. The material is cheep, and actually has a bad smell. Also took three people almost all day to assemble! This was taken to our cabin that happens to be way out in the mountains. So I have no way of returning it. I'm very sorry I purchased this couch and would love to have my money back!", 
    "This futon is very nice looking, and sturdy. I wanted something that would double as a bed when we have company. It works well in our room over the garage, for watching TV, especially when my grandchildren are visiting. But I didn't want anything that looked cheap. This one looks like it costs more than it does, and blends in well with my other furniture in the room. It was delivered very quickly, which was nice. I wouldn't have wanted to put it together (quite a lot of pieces!), but my son-in-law said it wasn't too bad. Very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "Wow, is the word I would use in regards to this futon. The base is heavy and both pieces meaning the frame and the mattress are made of excellent quality. Not the cheap stuff. Especially love the drawers down below. Since I have company on a monthly basis it allows my family/friend to feel more at home because they have their own personal drawers and do not have to keep digging into a suitcase. \"Helps keep the area clean too if ur guest has a lot of stuff\" The only dreadful aspect was putting the futon together. It took my friend and I from 8pm to 3am to put it together. But the finished product is well worth it! It's a must have for a spare room or as an additional bed. Also u DO NOT feel a metal bar in ur back when lying down so u can sleep comfortably. It's crazy when my back starts to hurt or spasm I will sleep on the futon vs my orthopedic mattress. The futon feels better to me and great to sleep on."
