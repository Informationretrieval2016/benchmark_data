    "I love my new couch. It makes my place look absolutely fabulous. The material is very nice. Looks just like the photo. Highly recommended!", 
    "This is a great sofa for the price, it is definitely big, but having it in my living room works fine. The instruction is very specific not hard at all. I will recommend this sofa to anyone.", 
    "I live up two flights of stairs and I was able to move it myself and I\u2019m not super strong. It was super easy to put together without tools and it\u2019s very comfortable. I got it because it is perfect for my space.", 
    "The sofa is truly a beautiful sofa but it's not deep enough for me, also the cushions are not reversible and to me they are very small...returning it.", 
    "....................................................................................", 
    "easy to assemble and looks great.", 
    "I love the color, its very sturdy, great fabric. Good size, easy to put together. I love it. Great buy.", 
    "Great construction, easy to put together, pretty to look at. Horridly uncomfortable! If you don't want your company to stick around buy this couch.", 
    "I looked everywhere for a sofa like this one but would have to dish out thousands more than I paid for this. This is a beautiful sofa! It is more of a beige or taupe color though which worked out fine anyway. It is very well made and beautiful as well. It's almost too pretty to sit on so I have it in the living room instead of the family room where everyone wants to be anyway. It's very classy and sophisticated. Love the rhinestone buttons!"
