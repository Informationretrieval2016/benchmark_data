    "We are very happy with the look of this bookshelf. The design is very nice and the size is just what we needed. The reason I took off a star is because a pair of the pre-drilled holes were in the wrong place. The bottom middle divider's peg holes were about 0.5 inches off from where they needed to be and had to be re-drilled. Luckily, the extra holes are hidden under the divider, so you would never know once it's all together.", 
    "I would have put excellent, but the order that the instructions indicated was not easy. Also, a couple of the screws were difficult to connect."
