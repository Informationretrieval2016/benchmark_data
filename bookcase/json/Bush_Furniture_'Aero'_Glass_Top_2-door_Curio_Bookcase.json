    "It is a beautiful and elegant piece. I got it in black and it is perfect for a small area, it is not that tall, mid size books fit on the shelves and the glass on top is smoky and adds a nice touch to the whole item. I simply loved it.", 
    "Purchased this piece for my office for storage. I matched it with the Kathy Ireland whites desk by bush furniture- the 63\" bow front double pedestal desk. Good quality bit of paint was missing on a piece but I am able to touch it up", 
    "Couldn't be happier!!!!! Bought this for my daughters room and she put her t.v. On it..... Looks Great! Thanks Overstock \ud83d\ude00",
