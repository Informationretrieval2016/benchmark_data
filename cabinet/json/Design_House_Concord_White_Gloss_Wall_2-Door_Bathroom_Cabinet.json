    "Very nice cabinet. We had it installed by a pro because we needed to cut out some of the back to allow access to 2 electrical outlets, so I can't speak to ease of installation. Only complaint is that the top of the vertical sides of the cabinet is not painted. I can't see it but anyone over 6 ft can.", 
    "It does what it needs to do. Looks good. Came in one piece, just needed to hang it", 
    "The cabinet was packed in a box inside another box. The problem is that a cord is wrapped around the inside box that the cabinet sits in. This was applied too tight and it damaged the back edge of the cabinet on both sides. I can only imagine most of them will be this way util the packing method is changed. Overstock was very helpful in resolving the issue by refund.", 
    "Bought this for my new bathroom suite for over the toilet.. Great room to store toilet paper, pads, soap & first aid items.", 
    "Cabinet is well made, with a nice finish. It was easy to install, and just as descibed when I ordered it. I am extremely pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Nice quality. Like the glossy finish.", 
    "Arrived put together except for door handles and installing shelf. Good quality and was easily installed. Used my own wall anchors and screws for a more secure mounting.", 
    "Engineered wood.to solid wood. Glossy paint was not flawless. Comes with drilled holes for hanging, but the are not 16\" OC. Anyone hanging the cabinet on gyp board and not into the studs is crazy. Looks nice."
