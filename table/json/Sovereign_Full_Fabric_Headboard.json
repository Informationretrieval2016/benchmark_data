    "I ordered the headboard in \"beige\". It took a little over a week to come in. The quality is fine. Nice fabric, buttons are sturdy, easy to install. My disappointment is that it is not beige. It is closer to a brown sand color. If it was light brown, that would be ok. But beige and brown is not the same color. I will probably return it and order something else.", 
    "Love the fabric and it was easy to assemble. Definitely a great purchase.", 
    "This headboard looked even better than expected. Very pleased with the look of the material. I think it is going to be perfect. Thank you.", 
    "Great looking headboard, my daughter loves it, and the price was perfect!!!", 
    "Headboard is as described.Had to return first headboard because there was noticeable threading that was loose. Exchange took about two weeks. It looks very nice and is a huge space saver."
