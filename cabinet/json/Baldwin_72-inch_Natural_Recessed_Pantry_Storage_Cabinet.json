    "Our house has a tiny master bathroom with a pedestal sink, toilet and shower. The only storage is the medicine cabinet. I've always hated my bathroom. I saw these recessed cabinets and thought they might work in my bathroom. I got two and my husband modified them slightly to fit side by side, like a mini closet. I can now store things out of the way. They're well made and weren't terribly hard to install. The storage space is awesome.", 
    "I had this installed by my contractor during a kitchen remodel, and I love it. It's perfect for holding cans and small bottles (oils, vinegars, etc.). My contractor built molding around it to match the molding in the rest of the house, so it looks like it was meant to be there. I'm already thinking about where else I can put one or two of these for even more handy extra storage.", 
    "Excellent use of space for storage. Well made and finished", 
    "High quality, sturdy, easy to assemble and install. Love this pantry!"
