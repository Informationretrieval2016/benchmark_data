    "Table is great quality and price. It was very easy to put together and is very sturdy. The color is definitely grey but that's exactly what I wanted. It's perfect.", 
    "This is a really sturdy table, its a taupe brown, with french accents on the legs. not very large; we put one chair on each side. however its perfect for 4 people", 
    "The table is beautiful and exactly as pictured. My only concern is that the top part of the table doesn't seem as if it would last too long and edges seem as if the will peel very fast. Thought the top would be a solid piece of wood not stuck on.", 
    "The table was easy to assemble and the first thing I noticed was how great the stain on the wood came. The table is sturdy and looks much more expensive than it is. The legs are also beautiful and the table can fit 6 comfortably. Would highly recommend.", 
    "Decided to give our kitchen table an updated look 6 months ago with this beauty. It's exactly what I was looking for. Distressed, brownish-gray, rectangular. We have 4 seats at our table, but I think you could easily seat 6. Perfect for family meals, homework, craft projects, etc. Have used it every single day for 6 months (including every day use from a 2 year old) and hasn't shown any wear. LOVE THIS TABLE!", 
    "I love this table - it is simple yet elegant and functional. The grey color is fantastic and the table is so easy to put together. It's heavy, so having an extra set of hands is helpful, but I am so happy with this and can definitely recommend it! I was happy to find such a great 5' table for my breakfast nook with kitchen benches. I also like that there is open space underneath so there is plenty of room for several pairs of legs!", 
    "exactly as pictured. beautiful grey wood toned table.", 
    "We get so many compliments on this table! Beautiful color and perfect size for our small dining room!", 
    "This is a nice and sturdy table. Looks more dark gray in person (thought it looked more brown in photo). Would have preferred the more brown color. Still a nice table, it will do for now."
