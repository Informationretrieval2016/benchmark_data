    "these are exactly the chairs that I have been looking for. really easy to assemble! they are not meant for lounging.", 
    "these chairs are great. fast shipping. look sharp in our law office.", 
    "It is a nice chair. Made solidly with decent fabric. It is definitely smaller than one would expect so scale your expectation of size. But a very handsome chair indeed.", 
    "You're going to love it and it was extremely easy to assemble.", 
    "These chairs are stylish and exactly what i was looking for, but the quality wasn't great. The fabric was puckered on the upholstery and the legs didn't fit in right. They are a very small scale chair, which is great if you need them for an apartment or condo, they just looked too dinky for my living room. Dang, cause the color is gorgeous and the style is beautiful. If they would have been $$ dollars less, I would have just gone with them.",
