    "These chairs are perfect with our rustic/modern dining table. They are sturdy, comfortable and priced well.", 
    "Great look for us around the dining room with a farm rustic table", 
    "The chair seems sturdy but it is short. When pushed up to a table you can barely see it. When you sit in it, it is the right height but as I said it was supposed to be an awesome focal point for this farm table."
