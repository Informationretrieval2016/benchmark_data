    "This is a piece I use for staging a bedroom....and it looks great....no need to move big heavy furniture....if you are looking for a classy look that is a no fuss piece to move - this is wonderful!", 
    "This would have been great if it didn't have 2 small rips in the corner of the fabric. Then I read other reviews and this is not the first time. The corners were fully protected in shipping so this did not happen then. This company needs to inspect product before shipping. The box is huge so it's going to be a pain to return.", 
    "Love love love the headboard...very qualtiy and looks just right in theroom with the dark gray walls....would highly recommend this item to any one....love the shape....very unique and different...."
