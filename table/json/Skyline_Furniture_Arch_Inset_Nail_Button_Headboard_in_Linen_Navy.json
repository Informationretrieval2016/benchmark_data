    "Fantastic quality and perfect navy color!", 
    "We bought this for my daughter who wanted her room to look finished and polished. It really elevated the room and gave it that pop she was looking for. Its a true navy color and was easy to find colors that complemented it. Very easy to assemble and seems sturdy. There are no bedside rails so we have to get a bed skirt, but thats fine."
