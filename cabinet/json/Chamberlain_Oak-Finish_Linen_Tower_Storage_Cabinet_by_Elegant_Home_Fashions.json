    "This cabinet is very sturdy. The instructions were missing when I received it, otherwise this product would have received a 5-star review. I was able to construct the cabinet regardless and I do not consider myself to be very handy. The boards that are included are not flimsy. The drawer sticks a little. The glass is appropriately made. It is a very pretty cabinet and is tall enough to store many items. I would recommend this product. It came with free shipping and is a great product. I did not expect quite as nice of a product for the price but I was pleasantly surprised.", 
    "This piece is really poorly made - I had splinters in my fingers and hands . It was almost impossible to put together - and I've put this sort of thing together many times. The color is awful - I painted it white. The drawer does not quite fit. It's just a piece that is badly made, not worth the time or money. Do not buy this piece!", 
    "I bought this for a narrow corner in my DR to store and displays some large serving dishes rather than for BA storage. The amount of solid wood in it, and the quality and number of hardware fasteners was surprisingly good for the price. The kit was missing two cam locks, but these were easily replaced at a hardware store. As usual with Overstock shipping, the packing box had some tears and scars by the time it arrived, but the pieces inside were all intact and one slight scratch seems to be of factory origin, not related to the packing container. Four hands would have been helpful during the assembly at two points in the process, but not absolutely required. I assembled it by myself, and I am a senior-aged woman, altho with quite a bit of former experience in assembly furniture of this type. It took about two hours to assemble, but I wasn't trying to hurry.", 
    "Take your time putting it together. Love this tower cabinet.", 
    "I'm very pleased with this product. would recomend it to others", 
    "I've put together a lot of furniture that came in pieces, and this one had to be one of the best in terms of quality, making a complex project clear, keeping the steps organized, and thinking of every detail to make sure the cabinet went together as well as possible. It's beautiful to look at and structurally sound--a very nice piece of furniture. (It does take a few hours to put together though.", 
    "Nice sturdy cabinet for my bathroom. Would have been nice to have written instructions with picture diagram. Took over an hour to put together, but worth the time. Unit did have scratches and hoping to fine touch up paint to fix. Color appear to be two tone, but overall a very nice wood cabinet.", 
    "Purchased this to replace an old vanity when updating our bathroom with a pedestal sink. Nice Wood Grain on all visual sides, looks updated but goes with with vintage accessories and bronze faucet and mirror. Enough room on three shelves to easily hold 12 bath towels folded in thirds. Received a lot of compliments on it. Only complaint is drawer is a little tight and slides are sticky. Otherwise really happy with it especially at that price!", 
    "My husband, who is pretty mechanically inclined, assembled this cabinet in about an hour. However, the pieces did not all line up properly, and he had to make some minor modifications. All in all, it's a good value for the price, but don't buy this cabinet if you're looking for top-of-the-line furniture.", 
    "Very satisfied with this purchase. Just what I wanted in all respects", 
    "Not as bad but did not meet my expectation.", 
    "Very good for small spaces i save a lot thinks", 
    "Quality much better than the price would dictate. Easy to assemble dispite the instructions. Looks good. great for linens.", 
    "Purchased for bathroom. Perfect for what I wanted to use it for.", 
    "VERY HAPPY WITH THIS CABINET. IS PERFECT FOR SPACE I NEEDED AND QUALITY AND PRICE WERE GREAT! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. EASY TO INSTALL.", 
    "We bought this item to fit in our apartment. We needed vertical storage in our kitchen and wanted something to coordinate with our white and oak kitchen island without breaking the bank. This piece is great, but the directions were not. Assembly took 1.5 hours. Directions were not clear and left a lot to be desired. As long as you don't mind putting in the effort to assemble, then you're all set!", 
    "Nice cabinet for the price. Easy enough to assemble with only picture instructions. Written instructions with pictures may be more helpful. The finish was an oak color but appeared darker on the mahogany veneer material. The drawer top edge had a splintered edge which was pulled off and showed a lighter color. Hopefully the color can be matched, covered by a furniture crayon.? Another back side edge was frayed and could be a problem with splinters when assembling. Works fine for my needs in a limited space.", 
    "I put this in a bathroom, added pretty woven baskets on the shelves, and it has been exactly what I needed!", 
    "The cabinet is shorter than I expected but it looks nice in my bathroom.", 
    "The door came with the handle on the side with the hinges so they were nice enough to send another door and that door came with a crack along the side with the glass. It's to big to send back so I glued it", 
    "Good for a temp solution. Not long term, for sure", 
    "This was surprisingly a solid and sturdy cabinet for the price. Looks great and was exactly what I expected. Assembly wasn't bad at all, and all pieces fit together well, including the drawer working smoothly, when completed.", 
    "The quality of this product was not as good as I'd hoped for the price that I paid for it. It isn't very sturdy and the wood/material seems kind of cheap.", 
    "Needed something to fit in a small space- did the trick.", 
    "Instead of piles of papers all over my small house, I use this tower to organize and keep important papers at hand but out of the way!", 
    "Cheap hardware some scratches", 
    "Once together This product looks good. We had problems with some of the hardware. It broke while trying to screw it in. Had to replace the hardware in order to complete the tower. The wood is nice and was true to the pictures. It is now in my bathroom and looks guite nice.", 
    "Strong little bathroom storage unit was easily assembled with detailed directions provided. Color and appearance were accurately pictured. Increased storage and holds more than you would think", 
    "Satisfied w/ the shelves. Just a tad wobbly, but won't be putting anything heavy on them. Like the way they look and didn't want to spend big bucks", 
    "This piece is well worth the price. It's sturdy and looks great as an additional area for storage in our bathroom. I wouldn't say it was easy to put together...but it wasn't impossible either. We are very pleased and felt we got an awesome deal.", 
    "Beautiful in my bathroom and added much needed space in my bathroom.", 
    "We were looking for a small cabinet for towels to use in our master bath. This cabinet looks great and fits the space perfectly. Putting it together, however, was not fun. The directions were not specific and not detailed. But the hubby got it together and we do like it. The only thing I don't like about it: where the big, round screws go in on the inside of the cabinet, they give you little round wood colored stickers to cover the holes. Great idea, but they do not stay in place...bigger stickers than the hole would be a good improvement.", 
    "Not as sturdy as hoped. Wood around the glass has already let go and will need to be glued and clamped. We ordered two to replace a china cabinet in a narrow dining room. We shoved them into the corners and they don't interfere with people getting in and out their chairs. They look good and serve the purpose but are flimsy. You get what you pay for.", 
    "Pressed word was not my first choice, but the real wood cabinet was out of stock. Broken door on one unit was replaced in a timely manner.", 
    "I had hoped the quality of the cabinet would be a bit better than it is. However, it is stylish and fits into a narrow space in the master bath. It provides the extra storage space that I need in this room.", 
    "We bought this for our bath room for more a small nook we have in there, it has been working out just fine, keep lots of things in it and have not had a problem with it, alot less expensive then a built in unit, so we are happy with this one.", 
    "This is a nice looking item but it was too hard to put together and there were NO INSTRUCTIONS!!!! Don't bother unless you are mechanical.", 
    "Beautiful cabinet but heavy and somewhat difficult for me to put together. But overall I love the cabinet", 
    "Works just fine and fits nicely in my bathroom. True to color.", 
    "you get what you pay for. I wish I could have found the same style in a better quality. It serves a purpose though...I can always move it to the closet if I find one I like better.", 
    "Fit perfect in the room. I love it. I get lots of compliments", 
    "This cabinet is very sturdy and super easy to assemble, looks good and serves as a towel cabinet in the bathroom.", 
    "I am disappointed with the material and construction of this product. I needed to use construction type wood glue to keep the parts together. I do not think I will shop with overstock.com again.", 
    "Well built for the price !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1", 
    "I had to modify some of the holes in which the pegs go into because they were not drilled correctly. a few of the rep-drilled holes were to big for the fasteners on one of the panels. Over all the quality of the wood is good."
