    "I originally bought a top of the line firm mattress from another company. I was disappointed when the mattress was anything but \"firm\". I happened to be shopping on Overstock for another reason and decided to see what they had to offer. I was surprised to find so many affordable options! This futon mattress is fabulous for the price. I didnt purchase the futon cover, but actually use a hypoallergenic full size mattress cover instead and it works well. The futon is comfortable and I would definitely buy another when my guest room is ready!", 
    "The futon mattress was thick as advertised, but for me it is too soft (pillowy) to sleep on. If you like a firm mattress that you don't sink into, this is NOT the futon mattress for you.", 
    "I bought this to replace the original mattress. This by far is the cheapest mattress I have found and most comfortable. Shipping was very fast. I put this on the futon up in our loft / 3rd bedroom. I passed right out on this mattress and slept very well. Woke up with no body aches. I think it is more comfortable then my pillowtop mattress!!!!!!! You will not be disappointed in this mattress!!!!", 
    "I don't understand why this mattress has received such great reviews. First, the picture is misleading. It makes the mattress look like its stuffed full and tight, which is not the case. It is not over stuffed at all, in fact, it is very loose. The tufts, which are the stitches that go through the mattress to keep it together, look like they are good quality in the picture. When I got the mattress, they are barely hanging on by a thread, no pun intended. There aren't buttons or anything holding the tuft in place, just the thread itself. When I opened the mattress to see the stuffing, it is extremely low quality. It doesn't even look like cotton in there, it looks like ripped up old wool jackets or something. The foam is 2 egg crates stacked on top of each other, with this wool/cotton blend (questionable whether its cotton at all) stuffed in there. I've had it for 2 weeks and it's very lumpy in spots altready. No firmness at all. I'm extremely disappointed, and if it didn't cost so much to ship, I would return it. DON\"T BUY THIS MATTRESS. Don't make the same mistake I did.", 
    "We got a full-size, 10-inch mattress and while it's very comfortable, it's also very big! Too big for our full-size futon, which we use as a second couch. The futon is so big, we can't keep it place; the bottom basically sits on the floor, preventing it from sliding off altogether. The only way we can use it as a couch is to pull it up (one person on each side) and immediately jump on it to keep it in place. And then it's quite comfortable. We're hoping if we use it often enough, we'll eventually tame this critter! Recommendation: 8-inch mattress if you use it primarily to sit on, 10-inch to sleep. FYI: it did puff up to the the full 10 inches once we got it out of the box...and it's made in the USA!", 
    "So far so good, The bag seems small but when left to fluff up for a couple days it comes pretty close to the 10.\"", 
    "Everything was as described. My problem was telling my son,\"No its for your living room, not for your personal bed\"", 
    "I was debating the ten-inch and the eight-inch futon, but the ten-inch is so worth it! Fits well into our futon frame, and the three different guests we've had sleep on it so far (including in-laws) have all slept well and said it was luxoious and comfortable. I also sit on the futon every evening in the same place, and don't seem to be affecting its wear (unlike other mattresses I've had).", 
    "I was duly impressed when this futon arrived in mail. Though vacuum packed, very easy to unpack and it fluffs up nicely. So plush and I feel so robbed by having paid over 400$ for my last futon which never was comfortable. This is definitely sofa quality and a terrific buy.", 
    "This is for my bed and is very soft AND supportive. I love it and sleep very well on it. Great choice and great buy", 
    "The mattress is plump, not skimpy. There was a problem with the odor for a week or so after I took it out of the packing. I sprayed it with Fabrez and in a few days, the odor was gone. I'm very satisfied with the size and thickness of the mattress.", 
    "This is a classic futon mattress. It is very heavy and dense which was what we wanted. It did get up to the 10 inches after we unpacked it and let it sit 24hrs before moving it. Our only complaint is that it smells, not just a little either. I understand that new items have a chemical smell to them, like new carpet or a new car, but this thing smells like nail polish remover and diesel fuel. I'm hoping that after a few weeks it will be gone, because I want to buy another one for another room, but if it doesn't stop stinking I won't be buying another one!", 
    "Yes it did have an odor, not sure why. To get the best opinion I had to take it out of the box & open up. I can't see ever getting this back inside another carton to return although I would love to. It is not the feel of the foam description I was looking for. Ii isn't much better than my current mattress already on the futon. I can't imagine sleeping on it either. But it would cost quite a bit to return so I probably have to deal..", 
    "A correct product description would be: This full size futon mattress boasts 4 layers of extremely thin and poor quality 1.25 inch eggshell foam, layered over a 1.5 inch solid piece of foam. For added mattress height, The foam layers are then wrapped in 3.5 solid inches of compacted dryer lint containing hair, yarn, threads, ribbons and masses of dark lint containing a mixture of natural and synthetic fibers. The fibers have been treated with a strong smelling chemical flame retardant for your \"safety\". It is then wrapped with a thin layer of polyester batting, stuffed and tacked inside a cover in your choice of colors.", 
    "As stated, the cover that I selected is not a good one if you have a dog who insists that it is her bed but we put a cover over that for when she makes that decision. Outside of that it is a wonderful mattress for our futon bed and we have tried others and were not happy with them. This is a bed that we use for guests and now we feel that we are giving them close to the comforts of home. The mattress is heavy to move and bulky but it is worth the sweat to move it when needed. A great purchase.", 
    "Risked the hassle and ordered the mattress on-line through Overstock.com. Very nice, thick, plush, 10-inch futon mattress for the money and very comfortable. Family members fight over who is going to sit/ lay on it next. The futon is in our main living area, so the mattress needs to hold up to the demanding job of seating a family of five and look good as well. Just wondering how long the mattress will hold up for the long haul. So far, so good. I have no complaints. I am a very satisfied customer. :)", 
    "Quality is fine if not being used too much. Wouldn't want to sleep on every night but ok for occasional guests or watching TV . Needs another cover!", 
    "I use a futon in my garage and I ordered this in error. I have purchased the innerspring mattress a number of times and I really like that mattress, but I was rushing and didn't realize that I had selected the wrong one. This mattress is flimsy and has no support. When you sit on it, it compresses down to the frame. It also had a very nasty odor for several days that I never detected with the innerspring mattress. I'm going to use it until spring and then I'll replace it with the innerspring.", 
    "This mattress has no cushion or support as described. The stuffing provides no cushion between you and the frame. The cover is not soft at all - it feels like burlap - very stiff. Also, it does not look like the picture. The stuffing does not plump up (even after 48 hours), therefore, it does not fill up the cover nicely as show in this picture. Very deceiving. Not a comfortable mattress at all.", 
    "When I ordered this item, I thought I was purchasing a futon, not a mattress. For a $$$ ring, it should have came with the frame. It is also way bigger than expected.", 
    "I bought this to replace my old futon mattress because we'd be sleeping in our baby's room for 6-mo. My old 10+year futon mattress had springs and would still have been more comfortable than this, had we not gotten rid of it. Right away, this one sunk in on both sides (we are not overweight)- leaving a high 'dividing' hump all the way down the middle. We have had to sleep on in the past 6-mo nonetheless.", 
    "Overall the futon mattress is comfortable. It is just so thick that I can't get it to bend and stay on the futon couch. Every time I put it on, it 'unbends' and slips right off. It certainly doesn't look like the photo. I tried sewing straps onto the back, but it still isn't staying.", 
    "True to color in picture and comfortable. This product is great for the price for a guest bed.", 
    "I bought this mattress and futon to furnish our guest room, knowing that parents and siblings would be using the bed, so I was really looking for something comfortable and affordable that wouldn't take up too much space in the room. This turned out to be exactly what I was lookng for, and it is accurately described on the website. The mattress fluffed up after being shipped in a compressed box; I was concerned it might be lumpy, but it is not.", 
    "The product arrived within the specified dates. The assembly instructions were easy to follow and we had the futon framed assembled in a little over an hour. The futon looked exactly as I had imagined it would in my children's entertainment room. Their friends have already asked if they can have a sleep over in that room. The futon make the space more desireable for entertaining their friends.", 
    "The navy futon makes the den attractive and inviting. It is perfect in a beach house, and a good sleeping spot for weekenders.", 
    "The futon was shipped quickly and without mistakes. The futon itself was a bargain at half price. The depth of the cushion makes it most comfortable.", 
    "iit wa svery comfortable a good size nice and fluffy bed to sleep on for company and also a great couch to sit on.", 
    "The color is perfect, the quality of the mattress is great and I was pleased at how comfortable the mattress is. We purchased this for our second home and my grandkids won't mind crashing on this mattress!", 
    "The futon met my expectations. It is nice-looking, and arrived quickly. We slept on it for four nights to accommodate some guests and it was quite comfortable. There was a lingering chemical smell for a few days after arrival, but it seems to have dissipated.", 
    "Well made. Exactly as shown in picture and description, right down to the Hunter Green color. Comfortable, too.", 
    "This futon makes a really comfortable sofa, and a really, really comfortable bed. My son will soon be 12 and wanted me to fix up his room so he would have a place to entertain his friends. I bought a used frame on *** for $75 and then invested in this excellent futon, based on the ratings of others. Good decision on my part-- my son's limited space is now a nice little place for him and his friends to play video games and hang out. I put a ultra suade futon cover on it that I also purchased from Overstock (which is equally awesome in that it cleans up beautifully with a sponge, and the colors are fantastic) and put a few colorful pillows on the sofa to jazz it up. My son is so proud and everyone compliments his transition from \"Little Boy's room\" to the swinging crib all his friends are envying. Most importantly--it is a really comfortable, cushy mattress that isn't too soft but not hard either. It's very comfortable.", 
    "The futon mattress was delivered promptly, but was folded in quarters. It still hasn't worked all the lumps out from being folded, but I don't really know how else it could have been shipped. It does fit my needs very nicely", 
    "The mattress arrived vacuum-packed, so be warned, if you want to return it, you'll never get it back in the box. It is a great mattress - great color - very thick - but unfortunately, way too thick for the futon frame that I had, and not very flexible. It's also extremely heavy, so I had quite a time just moving it around by myself - finally had to get someone to help me. I can't use it, and I can't return it, so I guess I'll store it for later use or donate it to a worthwhile cause. Oh well......", 
    "The mattress I ordered is clearly stated here in this description as Full-size 10-inch Futon Mattress. I was sent notice of the mattress being shipped. On the shipment notice was stated Full-size 9-inch Futon Mattress. I emailed support to inform them they had shipped the incorrect mattress. Support replied back with telling me that I ordered a Full-size 9-inch Futon Mattress. I then sent an attached file of my order receipt which clearly stated. Full-size 10-inch Futon Mattress. Support replied back to me telling me that I ordered a Full-size 9-inch Futon Mattress and that if I was not happy, I could call for a rma number in order to return the mattress for a refund. Once again, I sent an attached file with my order receipt clearly showing that I ordered a Full-size 10-inch Futon Mattress. I then called support on the telephone. I told them what was going on. She went and found the attached file of my order receipt clearly stating that I ordered a Full-size 10-inch Futon Mattress. She told me that they changed the description to a Full-size 9-inch Futon Mattress AFTER I had placed my order. She told me that it is actually a Full-size 10-inch Futon Mattress but once I strap it down and tie it to the frame, it will then only measure to a Full-size 9-inch Futon Mattress. I questioned with are you telling me this ties to the frame. She answered with stating that yes, that is to keep it from slipping. She apologized and has given a 15 dollar credit for my inconvenience -- whoopty-do. I accepted the Full-size 9-inch Futon Mattress because these people clearly do not have their act together and I didn't feel like dealing with such people as this. The mattress arrived in a gigantic box. It was a gigantic roll rolled up in plastic with a notice stating it was vacuum packed and to allow 24-48 hours for it to expand to full size. After letting it set out for 48 hours, it is the same size as it was when I took it out of the box AND THAT SIZE is not even a Full-size 9-inch Futon Mattress. Instead, it is a Full-size 8-inch Futon Mattress. The mattress has no straps whatsoever. This mattress does not tie down to the frame to keep it from slipping. They have clearly scammed me. They advertised a false description on their website. They then shipped to me an incorrect mattress. They told me it ties down to the frame and so it will be one inch thinner. They have sent to me nothing of any description typed or spoken. They have lied and they have scammed me. I am not going through the trouble to try to box this thing up and send it back to them. It would surely cost me quite a bit to do so AND it would surely be a pain in the behind to do so. This mattress should have never been sent to me from the beginning and I should not have to have this to deal with. I have no idea where to go in my hometown to look at futon mattress'. I will most certainly seek out a place to go the next time I need one. Overstock has obviously pulled a scam on me. Why? I do not know. Maybe they had far too many of these 8-inch mattress' that they needed to unload and the only way they could do that was to rip people off! IF I ever order another mattress through Overstock.com, it will be that I cannot find where to buy one in person and I will know to expect that they will pull a dirty stunt like they have pulled on me with this mattress. As far as this Full-size 8-inch Futon Mattress that I have received, I guess it could be a good mattress even though it is very uncomfortable for me. It is not the mattress that I ordered and I needed a Full-size 10-inch Futon Mattress of which I did in fact order and they did in fact NOT send to me what I ordered!", 
    "I actually thought that I got a futon bed and mattress set, but come to my surprise when it arrived at my door it was only the mattress, but non the less it is a great matress. it is comfortable and thick enough for guest and everyday use. I would not make it into a full mattress for full time use though. The color is really nice and the style is modern to fit almost any style home.", 
    "I bought this to replace an old futon mattress, we use this as a couch and not a bed. I could not even sit on the old one it was so uncomfortable, now I can sit in my den, this is comfy. It was delivered quickly. We'll see how it holds up to the use it gets, the den is where the kids and dogs hangout.", 
    "Very nice & sturdy. Met my expectations completely", 
    "quick delivery, well packaged, kinda bulky to get up steps, but very comfortable. Only thing I would like to see is side handles to make it easier to move and turn. color awesome to. I got the navy blue", 
    "pleased - color is good - mattress doesn't fit very well but is acceptable", 
    "This is thick and comfortable mattress for my futon looks great for when guests stay over.", 
    "Bought for my teenage son. Great for the price. Took a few days to fully fluff up but overall happy with it.", 
    "This is a good size and thickness. Is comfortable.", 
    "The fit and comfort is perfect and just as advertised. Sleeps well and sits upright on the futon exactly the way we pictured.", 
    "I was told when I ordered the mattress the bed come with it so I just sat on the phone and I insisted they talk to there manager to make sure you got all of it they promised it did well I got the just the mattress and no bed then I had to buy the bed because I could not shrink the mattress the bed cost me another 169 but better yet I did not get the whole bed go figure I will never buy from this company again maybe someday the people answering the phone would not say just any thing to make a sale like I was told atleast 7 times that he is sure it come with the bed even his supervisor told him he said", 
    "constantly slides down; needs some type of ties to the futon to hold it in the correct place. my son has slept on it with guests and likes it for sleeping but as a sofa; not so great.", 
    "This futon mattress is exactly what I ordered. It came vacuum packed and took a moment to fluff, but once it came to life we have been enjoying the comfortable seating and sleek look.", 
    "Mattress is very full and firm. I don't have a problem sleeping on it.", 
    "Straight from the factory. Beautifully thick and comfortable.", 
    "I've had this mattress for just over four months now and it is about 3-inches thick--- not 10. I had to buy a memory foam topper for it after one month and now, even four inches of memory foam can't make up for its lack of structure. What a waste of money. Honestly, don't waste your time with this product...", 
    "My husband started out with the \"meant to work like a sofa\" split cushion from our favorite Swedish big box store. Even with the cushions securely zipped together he kept falling into the crack. With this mattress, he falls immediately to sleep and stays that way 'til morning. God bless this futon mattress.", 
    "Good quality for that price", 
    "We have been limping along with a 12 yr old fairly thin futon mattress and finally had to replace it. Found this one from overstock.com and were so happy that it could be red. oh MY is it an improvement. VERY comfortable. we will not be sleeping on it since our futon passes for our couch, but it is comfortable enough to sleep on. Even though we were informed that it wouldn't be totally fluffed up for a couple of days, it seems pretty \"fluffed\" after three hours. There is a slight dye odor...so try to get some ventilation if you are very sensitive to smells...but even that is almost gone. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a comfortable bed or seat. and the colors are just a bonus", 
    "Only compaint is that they sewed the stuffing with white thread on a navy cover. Why not navy thread?", 
    "Enjoying this fluffy, comfortable mattress!", 
    "This is pretty nice. however it is not 10 inches, 7-8 inches thick. sits very well. my daughter said it slept fine. Thanks", 
    "This mattress surpassed all expectations. As comfortable as many expensive mattresses. Spend a little more for a foam topper and your in cotton heaven. Great bang for your buck.", 
    "Great for children game room and guests", 
    "Very comfortable. Easy to use. Quality product at good price.", 
    "Thick, heavy, comfortable... everything I was looking for.", 
    "Too firm for sleeping but great for just sitting.", 
    "WONDERFUL!!! Very very nice!! Fit the fram perfectly as a couch or the bed! Comfortable and they look awesome!!", 
    "very good value. coupled with a used futon frame and a new micro suede slip cover, you can have an economical, but very very nice futon", 
    "As promised and advertised. Quick and Easy", 
    "Very comfortable and thick mattress. Had a slight chemical odor at first but after a few weeks it went away. Nice mattress for the money.", 
    "After having this for several years, I can say that it's held up well after several moves and pets. It has lost a bit of its shape, but that's to be expected after some use.", 
    "Not worth the money. I wouldn't buy this again.", 
    "Purchased this futon mattress for my sister who was in need...........she reports the mattress is very comfortable, she is thrilled with the gift.", 
    "Absolutely love this futon mattress. Top quality and my quests rated the comfort as top notch. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "Good quality! Very comfortable.", 
    "Great mattress. However ad is misleading in that seems like the frame comes with.", 
    "At first this was a great mattress....2 years later you can feel the futon frame throught the mattress. The mattress also has an awkwards fold in it from being in couch mode so often. Also the strings fell out over time, not good for continuous use.", 
    "There was no way to use this without the platform.", 
    "If you like the hunchback look, this futon is for you! If you have grappling hooks that can help pull you out of it every morning, you have meet your perfect futon. Otherwise, way too soft for a healthy spine.", 
    "very comfortable both sitting and lying down", 
    "very comfortable ,well made", 
    "I was very interested to find out how this bulky item would be shipped. It was in a box that would actually fit in the back seat of my car. Once I unpacked it I found out that it was vacuumed sealed for shipping. Had to let it sit for 48 hours to allow it to bounce back per se. It was a great quality product and very comfortable. The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 is due to the smell that the mattress has. I am assuming this is a manufacturing smell. Hope it doesn't stay around too long.Happy Shopping....", 
    "Better than sleeping on the floor when out of town guests arrive.", 
    "I've had a Futon frame for sometime now with no mattress. I had company coming and after searching online I realized I can get a new futon mattress for the same price as a really nice air mattress. I purchased this based on the reviews and I am not disappointed. It plumped up to the 10 inches after about 48 hours, and is very comfortable. There's a bit of a smell at first but we left it in the guest room with the windows open for the first 48 hrs. And with freshly washed sheets, it's not a big deal. We won't be using it for everyday use and we haven't had it that long but so far we're happy with our purchase. Our guests had a great nights sleep.", 
    "I had searched for a futon mattress for months and started reading the reviews on overstock. I trusted the reviews and my own judgment, so very happy with it! ! My futon is a good quality and arrived promptly.", 
    "This replaced a wonderful 9 inch mattress that I've had for over a decade. This is 10 inches but will shrink down to eight quickly . It's not quite as pleasure as comfortable as I hoped. But one month and it is standing up to some wear as I use it for both sofa and bed every night.", 
    "I have not really used it, but guests commented that it was more comfortable than my bed. It is always good to go for a thicker futon mattress if you're looking for comfort. This is HEAVY duty. I had trouble getting it on the frame, so I think it will be very durable.", 
    "This mattress has worked out great. Don't judge the quality immediately out of the box. It needs sometime to fluff up.", 
    "Before you buy (and I recommend not buying late at night or when you are to tired to read the description and not just look at the picture), make sure you know that this is for the mattress ONLY. I thought it was for the whole futon until after I got the ship notice and read the title correctly. Sent it back without unboxing it. Return was easy. Credit issued quickly.", 
    "Fantastic futon mattress! Definitely worth the expense, especially if you will be actually using the futon at any point as a bed. Very nice and thick mattress.", 
    "very nice, like it a lot.", 
    "Comfortable and very well made!", 
    "Bought this for my son, and he said \"Super Comfy \" I shopped all over before i bought this. You can't beat price and comfort.", 
    "Good matress puffed up real quick and very comfy", 
    "Very comfortable and plush. We will be very happy with this futon mattress.", 
    "good futon for the price...", 
    "Contents were wrapped securely, mattress sprung to life as I was standing there. Very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "The mattress itself is great! UPS destroyed the box, however, in shipping. Fortunately, the futon was wrapped well in plastic. Pleased with the purchase.", 
    "My daughter likes the thickness and finds it comfortable.", 
    "Replaced one that felt like a rock. Very comfortable for sleeping now.", 
    "This futon mattress is far more comfortable than most other futons I have slept on. I bought it to put in our small guest room instead of a bed, to save space. It's comfortable enough that my boyfriend sometimes takes naps on it, and our older parents don't have a problem sleeping on it when they come to visit. The only downside to this futon, as other reviewers pointed out, is that it has a weird smell straight out of the packaging. It's nothing too awful, but a chemical kind of smell like it came from a warehouse. I think it's the foam inside the mattress. I would recommend giving yourself a week or so to air it out before you plan on having anyone sleep on it. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase.", 
    "Several years ago we had a customized futon of oak made. Not all mattresses fit as well as this one. It does not \"bend\" as well as some, but that is not an issue.", 
    "It most definitely serves its purpose super thick but also very firm.", 
    "Thought it would be a little more comfortable, but ok", 
    "A little disappointed, the color looks old and dark, overall quality is lower than my expectations..", 
    "I needed a replacement mattress and couldn't find a way to get it home from a store. This was the perfect solution!", 
    "I'm not a big futon person, but thought it would be good as I needed something that was both a couch and a place to sleep if needed. After purchasing this, I'm still not a big futon fan.....", 
    "I have never bought anything online, or from Overstock.com.I hesitated buying this mattress because I paid attention to the very few negative comments. But, I added up the positives, and decided to purchase it. I am so happy with the purchase. It was delayed because of the huge snow storms back east, but, I was notified by UPS and Overstock.com, immediately. It arrived within the time frame they gave me. The box was huge and heavy. I popped out the mattress, and it fluffed up right away. I even slept on it that night. The color was exactly what I expected. It is a very supportive mattress and I feel like a million bucks every time I sleep on it. My guests also love it. There was absolutely no smell associated with it. I will continue to purchase items from Overstock and recommend this mattress to anyone thinking about. It is completely 10 inches high and is a great buy!", 
    "Not impressed when I first took it out of the box, but laid it on a flat surface for a few hours and watched it grow into a thick, comfy mattress I'm sure will last for years. Wish it had included care instructions, i.e. the top I just shared.", 
    "So comfortable! But, the mattress looks much nicer with a cover on it, I purchased the ivory color, and you can see the filling through the fabric. There is a bit of a smell when you first unwrap it from the plastic, but it goes away quickly. Full size sheets fit on this perfectly. This is the most comfortable futon mattress I have ever slept on. It's like a real mattress, and it's also super comfy while used as a couch. The one downside is that the right side of my mattress is missing filling compared to the other side, so when it couch form, that part sags and it feels like you're just sitting on the frame.", 
    "This futon mattress is more comfortable than most mattresses.", 
    "I was so excited about this futon mattress and couldn't wait for it to arrive, unexpectedly i was shocked to open it and let it unfold to find that the color that i got which is burgandy has so obvious wide threads i thought that was only at the back but it turns out that to give it the bumps look they sew thread to make it look like that. Common sense would say they use thread of the same color, but the used white which makes it look soooooooo cheap and not at all anything compared to it's price. I hate that, and i dont know how to fold it back to return it because this is a waste of money, really! if i'd pay that much i'd expect something look nice, and they wouldn't be so cheap when it comes to the finishing which is so important for the final look. and i'm not thinking about buying a cover, because i chose that color because i want it to show not to cover it up.Also everyone talked about the smell. Well it is there but it's going away and i used a fabric odor product to take that down and it worked, the smell is less intensified, and i believe it will go away. bottom line, if u will cover the mattress up then you are good to go, other than that it looks ugly, and i can send you pics if you want.", 
    "Thick and nice fabric cover, much nicer than other futon mattresses I've seen priced in the same or more expensive bracket. Actually this is one of the best purchases I've made at overstock.com. I really like the fast delivery. This group you can count on!", 
    "I use this in the guest room/ bonus room. Have had 3 different people sleep on it and say it is quite comfortable. Great for watching movies too!", 
    "If I could take this back I would, but when you order online you can't send it back once opened. Its smell is horrific. The comfort is fine but you cant enjoy the comfort due to processed chemical out gassing smell. A waste of ***.", 
    "We use this futon mattress in our spare room for over night guests, so far those that have slept on it LOVE it.. I have slept on it 2 times just to see how well I can sleep, it was a good night sleep. I would definitly recommend this mattress. So worth the price, in fact my daughter is planning on buying one for her room.. You cannot beat the price and it was shipped quickly.. Love buying from Overstock, so far have been so pleased with everyhting I have bought.", 
    "I have not had an opportunity to sleep on this futon mattress, but we sit on it when we watch TV at our cottage during the summer. It is very comfortable and provides support. It is not too soft, so it holds its shape when we are sitting on it. I'd rather have the support than a too soft futon to sit on. My husband's back could not take a too soft futon mattress. We still use pillows behind our backs, but we do the same on our good couch at home. I would recommend this futon mattress.", 
    "Maybe I was just using it wrong, but after spending hundreds of dollars on this thing I threw it away rather than putting someone else through this misery. I first used it as a bed for 2 months. Then I only used it as a couch/place to drape my clothes (you know how it goes). It slipped down on the futon frame and jutted out about 6 inches. At first it was easy to just budge it back up, but eventually it wasn't having it. It just stayed with that terrible crease and there was nothing my roommate or I could do to get it to stay. We simply couldn't sit on it. Buy this mattress if you're planning on sleeping on it on the floor (which I actually did for 2 nights while awaiting a newer, better mattress). Otherwise, spare yourself the trouble. On a positive note, the blue color option was quite bright. And it was a bit liquid/stain resistant.", 
    "I bought this futon mattress to replace an old one in my daughter's room. It took 24-48 hours to get to its normal shape due to packaging, but looks great.", 
    "The mattress was exactly as described. It is a little harder than a regular mattress, but perfect for a guest bedroom and if you want it be a little softer, a mattress pillow would work, but in our case, this mattress fit the bill to a T", 
    "10-inch Futon Mattress is Excellent! And I am so happy I got it,", 
    "Was a little concerned about buying such a big purchase without seeing it in person. The mattress is very thick, did not smell, and is very comfortable. We bought this mattress for our futon that we use when we have visitors. We would definitely buy this product from O again. We have another futon that has two thin mattresses on it. Will be buying this product again soon to replace those.", 
    "I purchased this mattress for my son to sleep on when he comes for a visit. He is a rather large person and I wanted to make sure he was comfortable. I have not heard any complaints from him and he gets a good nights sleep.", 
    "This 10 inch pad is AWESOME! Everyone that comes to visit and sleeps on it says they are coming back to stay again haha! Super comfortable!", 
    "This was purchased for a camp bed. It is working out great, the mattress if firm, we really like it.", 
    "Easy mattress, good size, very quick delivery. No fuss. Expanded to full size in less than a day. Doesn't fit corresponding futon cover very well--pretty loose--but that's not really a problem.", 
    "For the price, this product is a very good value. It came vacuum packed, and looks small. Once unpacked and let sit for about a day or two, it regained its shape. Looks big and thick enough. Will buy again. May be deserves 41/2 stars.....", 
    "Was a bit wary of buying a mattress online. After purchasing this mattress my fears were squashed. Good construction. Looks great. Delivered in a timely manner.", 
    "The futon mattress was delivered in record time. As several reviewers mentioned, it took a day or two for it to fully expand, but thanks to the reviews, this was expected. It was important for the mattress to provide good support, as it's intended for nightly use. It seems to be more than adequate, and a very good value for the price.", 
    "The original mattress was thin, about six inches, and had become thinner. Time for a new mattress, something which I would not feel the frame's bars. I shopped around, an I had used Overstock before, buying stuff for a friends house. I tried it again, found a 10 inch futon mattress, and at a discount. It came in a few days, and I can now sleep on the futon. Great. Great sleep, great mattress.", 
    "I ordered burgundy but it was really a purple, rather than a deep/dark red. It's actually an odd purple, not easy to match. I'm going to get a cover so the odd color won't really matter. But, if you're not going to cover the mat and want it to match, I'd suggest a primary or standard color - red, blue, white, black, etc. Accurate 10' and size matched my futon. No complaints regarding quality Great price and free delivery...what is there to complain about? :)", 
    "I've had this mattress for about 6 weeks now. I use it on a futon as a full time couch/spare bed for guests. As a couch it is comfortable enough, not as plush as a real couch but I have no real complaints after sitting on the thing for hours on end playing xbox.", 
    "Using this as a mattress and it is very comfortable to sleep on. I don't like spring mattresses. After a few months, it is still nice and soft and doesn't seem to have settled. It seems to be about 9 inches high. That is plenty.", 
    "Just as described! Great product and fast delivery!", 
    "I had reviewed many futon mattresses prior to making this purchase. The reviews on this mattress appeared to meet all expectations of the mattress I was looking for. I was worried about the remarks of a strong odor. I went with the Khaki color hoping to avoid strong dyes in other colors. This mattress was packed great and once unpacked there was no odor and the mattress expanded to expected size overnight. I am so pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice soft futon mattress. Also, great experience dealing with Overstock.com. This was my first purchase with them.", 
    "Was nervous about the 10'' Mattress but it fit perfect on my futon and is pretty comfortable...I would recommend the 10'' for more comfort.", 
    "I got exactly what I wanted and what I paid for - a new futon mattress for my floor, to replace the old one which had lost all its softness over the years. I was concerned that I might not be able to get a mattress separately from a frame and so I would end up with a frame I had no space for and paying too much, but this deal was exactly what I wanted in terms of price. I wasn't sure if it would come with a frame or not, because it was pictured on a frame, and the description did not make it clear whether or not the frame was included - but at this price I was willing to take it regardless. In this case, I was happy there was no frame, because as I said I don't have the space for one. But someone else might be unpleasantly surprised by this difference from the picture, which is why I can't give the product 5 stars.", 
    "I have had this futon 9 months now and stll love it.", 
    "Exactly as advertised. Very plush and comfortable - almost too plush! Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "The product has held up with respect to the cover. The cushion is good, however the cushion is splitting on one end. Therefore it looks like it is indented at one. I have had cushions that have lasted many many years and don't look like this It is still comfortable except for the visual aspect.", 
    "Love it&#12484;.this product is great for family and freinds.It is really comfortable and relaxing. Fits my room perfectly. (Display without frame)", 
    "Great mattress...comfy. I did not get the smell other reviews have mentioned. Would buy again:)", 
    "I got this for my daughter and it she likes it. She says it's not THAT comfy, but it's alright. She's a teen and says it sometimes bothers her back.... This probably shouldn't be used as a regular bed, but is fine for recreation and as a short-term 'guest bed'.", 
    "Very comfortable both to sit and sleep on. We cant feel the frame under it at all.", 
    "We replaced a futon mattress with this one and we are very pleased with our purchase. Price was good, shipping was fast! Could not be happier. We will look to Overstock.com again for future purchases! Thank you!", 
    "Recieved the mattress quickly, let it air out and get it's full height. The mattress is well-made and fit wonderfully on the bed. My son has been sleeping on this ever since we got it and hasn't complained once. Says he loves it! Would purchase another one in a hearbeat.", 
    "I bought this mattress for my 12 year old daughter. I have an old futon mattress, over 10 years old, that has a comfy foam core. My daughter loves sleeping on that mattress, so we decided to purchase this as it seemed similar to the one we have, but even thicker. We were not disappointed. Very, very comfortable, and with the great price, can't complain. This would be great for a guest room, or even as your regular mattress.", 
    "Love this mattress! Very comfy!! Great for guests! I was 9 mo pregnant and sleeping on this every night!", 
    "Once decompressed from shipping having a hard time keeping on frame in sitting position. Will be purchasing Velcro to attach to back and frame for more stability and to keep from sliding", 
    "It arrived on time for delivery & was as shown on the website", 
    "Easy to order, arrived on time, great tracking criteria", 
    "I ordered this in a haste before the holidays (2012), it was shipped pretty quickly. When we opened the package the mattress came pretty close to 10\". The in-laws loved it, great buy!", 
    "The mattress is plush and comfortable, thicker than another mattress I had for a second futon in the house. My son loves it and so do people he has had over for sleep-overs.", 
    "Great futon mattress. It's very soft and comfortable. I'd definitely recommend it to any one that has a futon and frequent overnight guests that need a placed to sleep.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this mattress!!! The quality and the texture of the fabric are excellent and the thickness is greater than I'd expected.", 
    "Futon is nice and thick. I would say more on the firm side but not uncomforable. Fabric is good quality and well made. No strange smell from stuffing which is what my old futon had. The only complaint is the zippers are on each side of the futon. I ended up buying a futon cover to make the look a little more finished. other than that, I love it!", 
    "This mattress is very comfortable. I have slept on it several times and the thickness makes it feel like a nice firm mattress. I would recommend as at the price it is a good deal. Only complaint is the white stitching for the tufting contrast against the green color and makes it look cheaper, however as I intend to put a cover on it anyway not really an issue. It is fluffy in the seated position, but still very functional (did plump up after a day out of the box). Overall a good purchase.", 
    "Our old futon was flat and hard, circumstances forced us to get a new one and we wonder why we waited so long. This one is wonderful, very thick and cushy. We mostly use it in the sofa position, occasionally as a bed. We use Velcro to fasten it in place so it doesn't slide down. This trick works great, just stick Velcro strips on the frame and pin the mate to the futon and it stays put.", 
    "Will use site again.", 
    "The mattress arrived quickly and we were pleasantly surprised at the quality. It looks really nice and is very comfortable.", 
    "Very comfy! Great price. love it! Thicker than I expected in a good way.", 
    "I've had the futon for a little over a week now. Slept on it the first night I got it, and it's extremely comfortable! It's not super firm, so it's really comfortable to sit and sleep on. And thick! And it's fit my frame perfectly! Really appreciated Overstock's excellent customer service!! There was a mix up at UPS where the mattress was originally delivered to the wrong apartment and I never received it. After one phone call, Overstock worked diligently to have another mattress delivered, and kept in touch with me regarding every step of the process! Thanks!!", 
    "I do love this mattress! It is comfortable and great for the money. However, I would agree with previous comments about the odor..it took a couple of days before it started and probably took acouple of weeks before it went away. The odor is strong..even Lysol did not help. Other then that, great quality, fast shipment!!", 
    "The futon isn't quite as cushy as I had hoped but matches the description fairly well. I bought this to replace a really thin futon that i could feel the bars of our futon frame through. I don't feel the frame anymore. We have been using it as a sofa while we wait to get our actual sofa, and it has worked well. We will be using it for a guest bed and I think it will be perfect for that when we can move it into the guest room.", 
    "I bought a foton mattress and the puckers were not buttons they were just stitched. That was misleading but I can live with it.", 
    "This mattress fluffed right up upon taking it out of the box. We love the 10 inches.", 
    "This is an incredibly comfortable mattress. We purchased for the bottom futon bed of my little girls bunk. I have spent a few nights sleeping on it with her and it is very comfortable. I would give 5 stars except for the off-gassing. We have had the mattress for about three weeks and it is still producing a bit of a smell... but it is getting more faint.", 
    "Good deal on mattress, seems tough yet comfortable to sit and sleep on.", 
    "I have had this futon two months and loved it right away. No slipping off the frame, no fumes, no problems. It gave an instant upgrade to the look of the futon. Although noone has slept on the mattress, we will only use it maybe once a year for that. It is comfortable to sit on, although it is mostly used by our two labs, who haven't complained. I am Very Satisfied.", 
    "I have not sat on a futon that was not too firm for me. The futon we were replacing had innersprings and it sat very firm. This one is no different and perhaps that is just the nature of futons. I have only sat on a handful of futons in my life, so my expertise is limited at best. As for laying on it; this futon is comfortable to lay on and provides adequate support for a restful sleep without being rock hard. As far as the appearance of the futon, it is a bit nonuniform and bulgy for my particular tastes; but again, perhaps the nature of all futons. It is a very versatile piece for our small cabin, but wouldn't be a choice I would make for our main home.", 
    "As advertised. Shipping went great and it arrived on time.", 
    "Very happy with the product. Better than expected! Roomy and very comfortable.", 
    "Futon arrived on time by UPS, well packaged. Received tracking info promptly and was able to follow the package and prepare to make sure someone was home to take delivery.", 
    "Another Overstock value !!! Love it !!! Never been disappointed yet !!", 
    "This mattress is SO FAT... it has trouble folding on a futon. Luckily I don't use the futon as a sitting place but as a mattress it has proved to be comfortable and a good deal.", 
    "I use my futon primarily as a couch, rare occasions as a spare bed. The description was accurate and helpful in choosing this one. I followed the directions of unpacking and letting it lay on the floor for 12 hours before putting on futon. It was amazing how much it grew out of vacuum packing. We have had it almost a month now and it is working great. I have rotated it every 2 weeks to evenly wear on it. I would recommend this as a great futon couch. I did sleep on it one night and it was firm yet soft, very comfortable.", 
    "The 10 inch memory foam mattress is very comfortable to sit on and relax or for watching television. The price that I paid for the mattress was resonable . The mattress arrived on time and in good condition. I would recommend this mattress to anyone who has purchased a futon that requires a mattress .", 
    "It arrived in a timely fashion. I just cut away the packaging and plopped it on the futon and it's just fine. It's exactly as I expected.", 
    "If you are looking to upgrade your futon this is a great product for the cost.", 
    "I am extremely picky when purchasing products and this was the best mattress I could find online. I am overly happy with this purchase. The mattress is AWESOME!!!!!!", 
    "This futon mattress is very comfortable. I was surprised how thick the mattress is. This was exactly what I was looking for. Great bargain.", 
    "The only thing I did not like was the corners were not filled out and there was a smell that was hard to get out but hopefully that will go away.Also the mattress would have to have a different futon cover over it.", 
    "I ordered this for my 17 yr. old son to use as an everyday bed. I, of course, was concerned that a futon mattress would only be suitable as an 'occasional' bed. However, so far, (approx. 1 month) I have only heard raving reviews from my son about this mattress. He said, \"at first, it seemed like it was going to be way too firm, but when I woke up...Oh my God, I felt so great!\" So, like I said, it has only been a month, but everything seems perfect for now. As a side note, I also ordered a solid wood constructed futon frame. I did a lot of research before purchasing either frame or mattress, and I learned that no matter how good your mattress is; if your frame lacks the 'proper' support--well, you might as well just sleep on the frame because that is what it will feel like eventually.", 
    "I could not believe that they were able to get this thing in the box. Once we opened it up, it just started growing and growing. After about 3 days, it was so amazingly plump and comfortable, I could not believe it. We decided on a futon because we have a guest room/office combination. We bought a frame that came with a futon but it was such poor quality we decided to spend a little extra to get something more substantial and we could not be happier! I am still amazed at how quickly it arrived and how well it was packaged.", 
    "This mattress is very comfortable and looks very nice. It enhanced the beauty of my old futon. I am tempted to sleep on it instead of on my own bed. I've had lots of great comments from friends, some are now considering switching to futons, a more convenient way to have extra bedding for company.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for. Excellent quality and service.", 
    "We purchased this mattress for our wooden futon frame. We are using it as a couch (a lot cheaper then a real couch). I was a little hesitant at first b/c I was concerned that our living room would look like a college dorm but was pleasantly surprised. The burgundy turned out to be a great color without being too bright. The mattress arrived and we let it rest two days before setting it up. It didn't expand too much b/c it was already close to the 9-10 inches when we removed it from the package. It did help with the plastic smell (probably from being wrapped up and shipped). The smell went away quickly. At first I thought the mattress was going to be too thick but it settled into the frame nicely after sitting on it a few times. I have napped numerous times on the mattress so far and it is very comfortable. We plan to use it for extra sleeping space when we have guests over. The only negative aspect that I can think of is that the \"notches\" are stitched into the mattress itself. So if you want to take the cover off to wash it you will loose the \"notches.\" I am considering purchasing a separate cover so I have the option of easily removing it to wash.", 
    "It's good for the purpose it was purcahsed for; it's for a spare room and I wasn't trying to spend much.", 
    "The product was as advertised however the site is very misleading with the picture showing the entire bed complete with frame which is what we wanted. But only the mattress was what was for sale. Other than that it was ok.", 
    "I have been very happy with our new futon mattress. It is comfortable and fits well.", 
    "Not sure it is really 10 inches, but very good still. It is very comfortable and it is great to sleep on too.", 
    "I had an old futon with the old original mattress...needed to use it in a new place...the old mattress was so thin it hurt to sit on it...I went to Overstock to check out replacements...the raves for this one sold me immediatley....it was a great purchase!!", 
    "Read alot of reviews, both good and bad. Decided to get it anyways, Couldn't be happier. Would I recommnd it to a friend...Already have.", 
    "We've only had it a few weeks, but so far it seems really nice. Guests were comfortable sleeping on it when folded down. I'm only concerned that it's so soft that it may lose loft over time on the spots where people sit a lot (we use it as our everyday couch). Sometimes it appears to me to be squished where my mid-sized husband tends to sit. Only time will tell, but we do have the option of flipping it, turning it etc to distribute the wear. But it's very comfortable and attractive so far. We have a plush cover on it, and it's definitely a huge improvement, visually and comfort-wise, over the old futon mattress and cover, which were ancient.", 
    "Mattress was packaged shrink wrapped. It was easy to unpack and is all of 10 inches nice and thick and comfortable.Would recommend highly!", 
    "This futon mattress is high quality and a great value. It arrived in a timely fashion, upacked well, fluffed up and is comfortable as a spare sofa in the tv room, or a spare bed. Great buy.", 
    "Very happy with this purchase. Replaced an existing futon mattress and this one is much more comfortable.", 
    "This was a great buy! My mattress came quickly and is excellent quality. The mattress is firm for both relaxing an sleeping. It's not our main couch it's in our finished basement so we don't spend a ton of time on it but i'ts wonderful so far and totally worth the money!", 
    "Was exactly what it said it was. We had shopped around and this was the best deal for the price. Excellent mattress for the price.", 
    "I have a large bamboo sofa on my sun porch , my pillows were always sliding out of place. When I purchased this 10 inch futon mattress I was wondering . would it fit this large sofa absolutely perfect. I am completely satisfied and happy with my purchase and will be purchasing a cover of a different color for summer. I am extremely satisfied . thank you Helen S. Kansas City Missouri", 
    "haven't slept on a futon for a long time, and this one is really comfortable. it actually was more comfortable without the frame, except i couldn't get up off the floor- too old for that. frame makes it easier, but less comfortable. but i plan to use my antique bedframe with extra padding & put it on that instead, where i hope futon & me will live happily ever after,i bought what i thought was the simplest foldover inexpensive metal frame, had to wrestle with it for hours before it came together & it turned out to be not as comfortable as the floor. i would recommend a wooden one instead.", 
    "Our shipment came less then a week after we order it! the box had instructions explaing that you had to allow 48 hours to allow the matress to fluff....I was suprised to see that it was already very full. Its extremely comfy.", 
    "I have bought other futon mattresses and had been told that they were the best I could buy. I think this one is better and was cheaper then the others. I loved the convenience of how it was shipped with all of the air vacuumed out so it fit in a cardboard box. This made it very easy to bring upstairs myself!!! If I had picked it up at a store I would have had to wrestle with transporting it home and getting it into my house. I would not bother with 8 inches, 10 inches is much more comfortable!!!", 
    "This was a Christmas gift for my son. He is beyond thrilled with the thickness of the mattress and the high quality. No problems with odor as some others stated.", 
    "Very comfortable futon mattress. The thickness was ideal for guests to sleep on, the last mattress was too thin and uncomfortable. As usual delivery time was great.", 
    "We purchased this mattress after our 8 inch mattress had begun to flatten, to the point where we could feel the ribs of the futon frame when we lay on it. The mattress arrived quickly, looked exactly as it did in the photo (we ordered the beige/khaki color), and was thick and comfortable. It takes a couple of days before you can fold the mattress up to a sitting position, otherwise no complaints. Much better than our old mattress.", 
    "This is a really nice mattress. It arrived on time and was packed tight. Took it out of box and the burgundy color was great. Give it a day or two to get to its size due to the air tight packing. It is so soft and a perfect size thickness. Was afraid it would be too thick, but it was perfect, wouldn't go smaller. Good product at a good price.", 
    "The mattress is exactly as it is described. It is working well as a substitute for a full-size bed. The delivery was very fast and no complaints. I enjoy doing business with overstock.com. They have not failed me yet and I have been ordering from them for quite a few years!", 
    "It's much more comfortable and lighter in weight than our last futon mattress. And, the khaki color looks great even without a special cover over it!", 
    "The product is very comfortable and a great value for the the price. I was not expecting it to be as fluffy or comfortable. I bought it for my son's room. He said it's \"awesome!!!\"", 
    "Delivery was speedy. When I opened the mattress there was a strong odor, so I aired it out for about a week. The mattress is thick and comfortable. Very happy with my new futon mattress.", 
    "The shipping was right on time. We let it air out (as recommended by other reviews). There was dust on the cover, but it was easily cleaned off. We have a baby who gets it dirty, but we find the fabric is easily cleaned in general. Our family slept on in for 5 days and said it was comfortable, and now a month out it is still full and comfy. I recommend this product. It is a great replacement futon mattress for us.", 
    "We were amazed and surprised how once 'unbound' the mattress opened up and became a full-size mattress. Our first guests slept on it for 4 straight nights and said that it was more comfortable than their mattress at home. The only complaint is that it had an odor to it and we sprayed it with Febreeze, which helped neutralize the odor.", 
    "The futon is great - very thick. It arrived vacuum-packed in several plastic bags, inside a box. The box was destroyed, but the futon was in great shape. Once I removed it from the bags, I noticed an odor, but this has dissipated over the past day. The mattress is fluffing up nicely now that it is unpacked. It seemed soft when first laid out, but now that the foam inside has decompressed it seems firmer. It will be much more comfortable than the matress we had. The cover is very good quality, with a substantial zipper. My other cover will probably not fit since this is much thicker than the mattress I had, but the cover that it came with is nice enough not to cover. Overall, this is much nicer than any matress I could have purchased locally, and it was much less expensive. A great value!", 
    "Other reviewers mentioned a chemical smell, ours definitely had a smell but it wasn't overwhelming in a large room. After a few days, you could only smell it if you put your nose right into the mattress. The mattress itself puffed up to a full 10\" within a few hours of opening. Being a 10\" thick futon mattress isn't ideal for when the futon is in the \"couch\" position. It simply doesn't stay up in our frame. Works fabulously as a guest bed.", 
    "Purchased the futon for my mother and she was really happy with it. The color was great and overall a good mattress for the price.", 
    "Instead of buying a sofa for my living room I thought I'd upgrade my futon mattress. I'm very glad I did as this is a very nice product. Comfortable and Los great. Saved alot on buying that new sofa !!", 
    "I bought this for Thanksgiving guests coming to town. It arrived at my doorstep in 4 days!! There is a strong plastic/chemical smell coming from the matress as other reviews stated. But letting it air out a few days before use cleared it up some. Color was great - vibrant red, but there are white threads that are visible against the red. Wish they would have used red threads to stitch.... My guest said it is comfy... not as permanent bed, just to sleep on a few nights is fine. We mainly use it as a couch. It is very difficult to put it back into the couch position from bed position with just one person. Maybe b/c its new?? Overall, good buy for the occasional guest. And very sharp looking!", 
    "I ordered this to replace an older futon mattress. I had guests who recently slept on it and remarked that it was comfortable to sleep on. I have laid on it and sat on it and find it to be comfortable but slightly on the firm side, and I much prefer that to mushy. There is a slight chemical smell emanating from the mattress that to me is non-offensive and hopefully will dissipate more over time. I would highly recommend this mattress as a great USA made value!", 
    "I would recommend this futon. It is nice and thick and made very well.", 
    "Futon couches aren't the most comfortable piece of furniture but on my budget it fits me just fine. I should have replaced the mattress a while ago. But I'm so happy I got it now. Very satisfied!!!", 
    "I have a rustic log futon in my sun room. This mattress was perfect for it. It is comfortable and looks great. Shipping was very quick and arrived with no problems", 
    "It's actually a pretty comfortable futon. It doesn't fold great to the shape of a sofa, but that might improve as I wear it in. Pay attention when you order, it does NOT come with a frame", 
    "I bought this mattress to replace my old one and it is one of the better mattresses I have owned. For the price it is as good as you can get.......The only problem I have with it is that it is not easy to fold back up into the couch version if it is folded down, that is just a minor thing so it is no big deal at all", 
    "This was a great buy. It's more comfortable than the mattress on my bed. Makes me want to sleep on the futon!", 
    "our only problem is the oder from? I unzipped and left mit outside separated foam still oder was to strong to use.. after a week I was able to bring inside oder was not gone completely . as recieved could not use If a person has reaction to chemical smell not a good buy. we still have to air out room . matteress is comfortable sooooo.", 
    "This mattress is a wonderful product. Actual product matched pretty near to the description on site. I expected it to bit more bouncy, but it is still comfortable and relaxing. Fits very nicely on my futon and holding it up nicely. I heard stories about slippery mattresses, but this one in not one of them. My wife too..likes it.", 
    "it is 10 inches thick- great night's sleep. in spare room on floor- got white- sheets on -love it! price was perfect also- never disappointed with overstock.com!!", 
    "My intention was to use this as a sofa and only an occaaional sleeper. However, it is a bit firm for me. It also tends to hold the shape of the last person sitting on it. I thought that it would puff itself out like it did when you first open it but that does not happen. I think I would have prefered a matress with springs more suitable for my intended purpose.", 
    "great mattress. nice color. fast shipping. great quality. highly recommended.", 
    "At first i was worried because as some reviews said it did have a certain cheap smell to it. but having aired it out for about 3 weeks the smell has gone away. ALL of my roommates think i have the best bed in my house. out of 6.. that's alot. it's really like sleeping on a cloud. i Love this bed. all i need now is a better frame... lol", 
    "The product was exactly as described. Excellent quality. Arrived promptly. Just wished the packing department had not put the packing tape on a black cover on the right side of the mattress. Now I have to get the sticky residue off what was a beautiful futon mattress.", 
    "Would def order from this vendor again. Received it much more quickly than I expected.", 
    "Very pleased with the purchase. Met all the advertised specifics & continues in use on a back porch with great success! Initially received incorrect color (black). Your customer service was outstanding--emailed a return shipping label within 10 minutes of my phone call. Black futon returned easily & at no charge. Blue futon arrived quickly & is exactly what was expected. My first shopping experience with O.Co but will not be my last.", 
    "I would recommend this product. I would never buy a futon mattress under 10 inches again. It looks great and is very comfortable.", 
    "the mattress is very soft but the smell is so strong it has consumed the whole basement level of my house. Hopefully it will subside.", 
    "One disappointment was the futon cover (Ivory) had dirt marks around the edges. It seems the people at the factory didn't have enough protection on the floor or on the work bench when they folded it and vacuum packed for shipping. Other than that, futon is great.", 
    "Good buy for the price. No regrets here. ..............", 
    "It's not white, the material is substandard. Looks like it is secondhand. I have to go out and buy a suitable cover for it now which sucks.", 
    "This mattress is lovely. It is not super firm like some but not overly soft. It will last a long time. I went to furniture stores and tried several out and I didn't like any of them as much as this one. It is incredibly comfortable to sit on. The price was much lower than the furniture store also. It does have a bit of a scent to it when first opened but this goes away after a day or two. I let it sit on my porch for a bit to air. I bought black and the color is a nice deep black. The cover is a sort of fuzzy material, soft to sit on. I am very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "The key point on this product is uniform comfort when sitting or sleeping on. The negative point is the covering material used (Plush raised felt like) could tear easily if caught on something. Overall price was good for product received. I note edges are rounded and not squared.", 
    "This is a wonderful mattress for the money. Good-looking and comfortable for sleeping.", 
    "Don't pass this by. It is even better than the picture and description. I t does \"plump up\" like they say. The quality is amazing. Much better than what came with the futon.", 
    "Prior to a platform bed with this futon mattress, I was sleeping on a king size bed with a $3,000.00 mattress and bed springs. This is much more comfortable for the simple reason that it is firm. I am not waking up with kinks or aches. If you like a firm sleeping surface, you will like this Futon mattress. I am about to order a second one just to raise the level of my platform bed.", 
    "This futon mattress is a very fine one, and I'm very happy with the quality. Ordered a futon cover, but if you don't have children, or pets, it's not really necessary. It stands alone, and is very nice looking. I would order this again. Be aware that it is vacumn packed. It's important to open it near the futon frame you will use it on, as it is heavy. I actually opened the box outside and rolled the well packed mattress up my stairs and into the bedroom I am using it in. I read about the heaviness and vacumn packing in aother buyer's review. The reviews on this site are really helpful to me. Thank you, Overstock, for a very fine product.", 
    "This futon mattress is great! It is very thick and comfortable. I would highly recommend this if you're looking for good quality at a great price.", 
    "The mattress was made very well. The only complaint that we had was that it had a strong odor of what smelled like petroleum solvent. It took several weeks for that odor to leave the product.", 
    "Good quality and size for the matress. Comfortable.", 
    "Super comfy mattress to sleep on. Fit the frame perectly.", 
    "I love this futon mattress! It is much higher quality than the one that originally came with my futon frame. I would recommend it to all! The only issue with it is that where the \"tufting\" is the cording that created the dimple/quilting affect on the surface- the cording ripped through on 2 places leaving a small cut or hole. This can be touched up with NoFray sewing product to help with keeping the hole from enlarging over time. When the mattress was put together the person or machine who tightened this corded area just pulled too hard causing it to rip through. Other than that it is worth the money!", 
    "The futon quality is great, nice and plush. The crease at the fold is a little awkward first, it takes some sitting on it to get it used to being folded up. So no problems with the product. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because I do have to say that the delivery was kind of a pain. There were storms delaying delivery and they could not say what day it was being delivered. Then UPS left my futon at the front entrance of my apartment building. Mind you it weighs 50lbs. And it was raining. At least the futon had plastic around it, but the cardboard was soaked, which made it even more difficult to drag up to the first floor. Well, can't say I am a wuss girl ;)", 
    "I took a chance on this purchase. It is more than I had hoped for! Great comfort for overnight guest!", 
    "We had never placed an order from Overstock. We are very pleased with the 10 inch mattress. We purchased the kahki mattress; it looks a like a very light olive tone, but it matches our curtains perfectly! The mattress is very comfortable to sleep on. We will definately be making other purchases from Overstock.", 
    "Its a futon mattress. Nothing special. Price was right. Its comfortable enough to nap on, but I wouldn't rely on it for an every night sleep. My cats enjoy sharing it with me while I do homework :)", 
    "Almost bought the 6inch pad but for the few extra bucks decieded to get the 10 inch mattress,good call,we are very happy with the purchase.", 
    "The mattress is great, and really comfortable, but due to \"inclement weather\" delivery was delayed 3 days.", 
    "This was supposed to be a 10\" futon mattress and only expanded to about 8\". There's a pretty strong \"factory\" smell to it as well though I expect that to wear off over time. The thickness, or lack thereof, is what disappoints me the most since we use this as seating but will also lay down for guests to sleep. It seems pretty comfortable so far but what will happen when the foam condenses over time?", 
    "I love this item, the cover it comes with zips off but I wouldn't suggest this. I got another cover for it and it works perfect.", 
    "We have owned this for a few weeks now and it has been such a great mattress. The kids love to sleep downstairs on it and it has proven to be much more comfortable than the lumpy mattress we were using. We would recommend this product to anyone.", 
    "Nice thick mattress - pretty heavy and comfortable - will recommend it", 
    "fantastic futon mattress at an affordable price. Excellent", 
    "When I bought my first futon bed I spent 130.00 dollars and it was a worthless piece of crap, so seeing such a cheap price scared me initially but, I decided to take a chance and I am so please that I did. This futon bed is awsome!! So comfortable and nice looking! I definitely recommend it.", 
    "I thought i was purchasing a mattress and futon with it but it was only the mattress. I was able to find both products for a better price on a different website.", 
    "This Futon is not bad at all.. frame is ok, Mattress is ok,, i will use it in a spare room for occasional company, would not work if it were to be used daily.. but over all, it is ok.. easy to put together, took about an hour for the frame to be assembled.", 
    "Based on the other reviews I thought this was an actual futon and not just the mattress. I have no idea if it's any good because it's sitting in the corner waiting to be returned. I ended up getting a free one from ****. Bedbug free."
