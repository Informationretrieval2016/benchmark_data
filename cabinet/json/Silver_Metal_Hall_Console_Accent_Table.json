    "This table looks really cheap in person and is pretty flimsy. I would have returned it, however, my son surprised me by setting it up while I was out of town and had thrown the box away already.", 
    "When I received it, I was kind of hesitant because it wasn't a high shine meatle like it showed in the picture. As I put it together it looked way better! I have it in my spa at the front were people sign in and it is just beautiful!!!"
