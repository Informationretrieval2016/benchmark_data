    "When I ordered these pillows I didn't pay enough attention to the size. The pillows are of excellent quality, well stuffed, heavy fabric, and nicely zipped. They just weren't as large as I had hoped. Nonetheless I am happy with them. The colors in the photo are accurate.", 
    "These pillows are so stylish and have plenty of colors to blend with whatever you have in your bedroom or living room. I paired them up with two other square throw pillows I also bought on Overstock with the same colors, but different patterns, and they look amazing on my bed.", 
    "These pillows look great on my brown leather couches. I find the color to be more tan and brown, not the gray.", 
    "Ordered these to go with my new Pottery Barn sectional. They are fabulous! They are firm yet not rock hard. Aside from being decorative, they provide great lumbar support when sitting on the sofa. Highly recommend!", 
    "I love the shape of these pillows and the pattern. The aqua blue is really pretty and goes with the brown and cream nicely. I wish they sold them individually since I did not need 2.", 
    "durable brighten up my coach", 
    "These pillows were just what we were hoping for. They look nice, seem well-made so far, and are very comfortable for lounging.", 
    "Purchase for ends of leather couch. All other pillows slip off leather.", 
    "They worked perfectly for the sectional that needed a little boost in the lumbar area!", 
    "I absolutely love these pillows. They are well made and are just as pictured.", 
    "Nice pillows and good quality.",

    "They looked great, but are looking worn out after only a few months of using them.", 
    "Had to fix the unsewn parts. Hem came undone..", 
    "Not what I expected quality is good", 
    "Theses pillows are exactly what I needed!! Great purchase", 
    "Just arrived today and I must say, they're awesome! Not quite the color I thought they'd be, more green than yellow but excellent quality! Will recommend", 
    "Color matched my new violet colored comforter and the new Bark colored Deco solids accent chairs I also purchased from Overstock!!! Great match.", 
    "Pillows are 10 inch by 21 inch in reality. Smaller than stated in description. But are a very nice pillow.", 
    "We bought the lime green set. Very well made, good construction, and no weird smells. Excellent!", 
    "Love it, matches my family's room decor", 
    "It is suppose to be burgundy and its purple. and Now that I am looking at my receipt it says kidney pillow! I wish it would of been like the picture but its not! NOT BURGUNDY!",

    "Will enjoy them on the sofa", 
    "Nice size and great color.", 
    "Pillows are great, well stuffed. Love the rectangular shape",

    "Looks gorgeous in my dining room on accent chairs!", 
    "This pillow has good support for my back and the pattern can go with any solid couch. Very satisfied with the product Overstock carry.", 
    "The color of the pillow is not true to the eyes. The colors are misleading. I couldn't use the pillow as it clashed with my rug and carpet. I truly believe I was sent the wrong one.", 
    "Matched the ottoman we bought perfectly and love having the option of a different shape pillow", 
    "Perfect fit & they are exactly as shown", 
    "The title says it all. We've only had these pillows for a few months, but sadly the stitching is falling apart. They'll probably last a few more months :/", 
    "The colors matched way better than i expected.", 
    "The seems starting to come apart within a month after buying them. I would not buy these again.", 
    "Disappointed that the pillows after one week...did not keep there shape! They look contorted and as if a sewing student was there first project.",

    "great fabric, love the shape, exactly as pictured,", 
    "Well made pillow. Sized perfectly for comfort behind one's back. Love the colors.", 
    "I first ordered this pillow in the Geometric pattern to go with other pillows that I had ordered that had tan/brown/light blue color scheme because that's what it appeared to be in the image (at least on my computer monitor) but the pillows had more of a greenish cast to them when I saw them in person, so they had to go back. I wound up ordering them in Mocha instead and they go perfectly. Very nice quality pillows despite the initial color scheme mixup.", 
    "These pillows are good quality and good shape. Like them a lot.", 
    "Smaller than I thought but what a compliment to my chairs", 
    "I ordered three sets of these pillows and, sadly, only kept one. The color of the \"Splatter print\" pillows is more a blue, not a maroonish color that I thought and the \"Burgundy stripe\" color was more a washed out pinkish color. I kept the \"Earth tonal\" pillows because they are exactly as pictured and the quality is great. The pillows are firm but comfortable and are just the right size.", 
    "Love these pillows. Good quality and good price.", 
    "Love these accent pillows. Add a touch of color to my neutral couches. Love the teal color! Covers zip off for easy cleaning.", 
    "i purchased two look great on the chairs that match", 
    "These pillows are great!! Loved them, and the colors were true to the pic.", 
    "Great quality and perfect size for couch or chair. Color was a little different than picture but that's to be expected. Easy to remove cover to clean if needed!", 
    "I think these pillows are very attractive and well made. The design is very nice. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for attractive throw pillows.", 
    "I love the shape for back support. The fabric is very nice, too. The textured pattern looks well with several colors.", 
    "Nice teal color. I thought they were a bit small for the price. Other than that, well made and no complaints", 
    "The pillows look nice but they are a bit small do check the dimensions",

    "These were a gift for our daughter-in-law and son. They love the pillows.", 
    "Love these. Look nice on tan leather sofa in family room. Purchased 2 in Dec, 2 more in Feb. If you need lower back support when sitting on sofa, these are great !", 
    "Comfortable and nice pillows. very dense for daily use and the color was represented well.", 
    "I got the one described as Peacock Moroccan Pattern. I wasn't sure from the picture if the fabric was a print or woven. I was glad to see that it was woven. The color is a rich teal with a bit of a shimmer. The white is more of a cream. The only disappointment is that the pattern doesn't line up well on the front and back, so if this a concern, you may want to consider one of the solid pillows.", 
    "Buyer be ware. This pillow looks nothing like the website. It has a very dark beige background and the other colors are just ugly. And then they wanted $** to return them. I'll never buy from this site again", 
    "Excellent, high quality, stylish, we are very pleased", 
    "I had been looking for this shape and size for my loveseat for a long time. Perfect size and color.",
