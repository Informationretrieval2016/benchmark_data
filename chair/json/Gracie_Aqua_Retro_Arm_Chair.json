    "Bought the sofa and was so impressed, i ordered this one. high quality and worth every dime! wanted to write this review to encourage this type of value in the o-stock community!", 
    "We bought this chair for the main reason of the retro look for our family room and its the perfect size....I know some people have said that its way to hard but not us we think the firm seat is perfect and will last a long time", 
    "One person can put this chair together, but it will go faster with two people. The instructions are easy to follow. I did have to modify one piece under the seat as it was too big and wouldn't allow the washer to be flush with the wood frame. I used a box cutter and shaved the piece down and it worked just fine. Make sure you use a towel over the wood plugs when you hammer them into the arms. Light and firm taps is all that is needed and do not try to hammer them flush, because the wood in the arms can split. Just tap them in enough that there is a little bit sticking out.These chairs have plenty of cushion and are stiff, and at the same time, they are comfortable. I am 6'0\" tall and my husband is 6'5\" and the size of these chairs makes them particularly comfortable for us they hit us in the right place behind the knees and resting our arms is delicious. The fabric is divine and the aqua provides a pop of color, but without looking neon and overwhelming a space. We have found ourselves sitting more in our living room, because these chairs are so attractive.Shipping was quick and I would definitely purchase another set if they were offered in another color like green, yellow, or gray.", 
    "exellent look easy to assemble a bit hard seats but im sure it will soften in time", 
    "The chair has a nice look, but overall I find it to be very stiff. When I bought it I thought it would be more like a mid-century chair that is low to the ground and leans back comfortably. This is much more upright and higher off the ground than I imagined. It's also not a high quality piece of furniture by any means, but that's mostly evident in the construction, which you can't see except for when you're putting it together. In the end, I'm keeping the chair because I like the look of it, but if it didn't seem like such a hassle to get it back in the package it arrived in then I might have sent it back.", 
    "This is a very attractive chair but tricky to put together. While well proportioned it is stiff to sit on.", 
    "Very comfortable chair for an occasional chair. Color is great and it is easy to move around. Not really Mid Century Modern but for the money it works", 
    "The color is as shown. Easy assembly, modern yet mid century and it's comfortable too!", 
    "Easy assembly. Great color, Perfect size. Don't know why we waited so long to get it.", 
    "Color just as pictured, comfortable. Easy to assemble for the most part but not perfect.", 
    "I previously bought the Gracie Retro sofa in Chestnut and bought the aqua chair to go with it. The chair was much easier to put together and looks great! The material is slightly different than the sofa, and has a softer feel and texture. So far it appears sturdy but I would recommend re-tightening the screws periodically.", 
    "This was purchased for my bedroom, couldn't be happier, looks great, is very comfortable. I read, watch TV and get dressed in this chair, Color depicted online is accuraate, although mine seems brighter, probably because of the lighting online. Best bang for the Buck", 
    "These are very cute, while putting them together can be hinky, it's worth the trouble.", 
    "Looked good onscreen and just as good once we got it together. It takes 2 to put it together and doing a bit more than following the instructions. The seat is NOT as comfortable as we had thought it would be...not soft at all. That's the downside of ordering on line. However, one of our house guests loved it so much, she wants to order on. We LOVE the look of the chair, but be forewarned...the finish is very typical \"made in China\" factory finish. Still, compared to prices at the furniture stores...good for the price.", 
    "I have bought three different years now from overstock. While this set was more involved assembly than the others, it was not a science project like some reviews stated. If you want a soft cushion on which to sit, do not purchase this chair. It is very firm, with which I'm fine, and I'd rather that, so overtime, they will not be saggy. The pop of aqua color with the wood among the rest of the furnishings in the living room look great, especially this fashion forward retro mid-century modern style.", 
    "I wrote the original review above. After a few months, I decided to buy another chair. This one assembled perfectly (it requires some force to get all of the bolt holes to line up, but it is definitely doable). To the extent there were quality control problems, they appear to have been fixed. I would definitely recommend this chair.", 
    "The chair showed up, in pieces (as expected; we're supposed to assemble it) and ... was missing some of its hardware!!! Now I have the parts of the chair strewn over my floor. To their credit overstock appears willing to help, but save yourself the hassle and don't bother with the pathetic quality control on this product."
