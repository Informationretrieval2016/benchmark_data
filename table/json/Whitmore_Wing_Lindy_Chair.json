    "Now that I've purchased the four chairs I need I'll write my review. ...always terrified they will sell out before I buy. This chair is fantastic for the price. I originally bought the Baxton Studio Norwich Lounge Chair in gray however was very disappointed in the dimensions (very low, very narrow and very deep [I'm 5'-7\"]) and overall quality of construction [legs easily marred and sloppy upholstery] . I have always intended to reupholster the chair so the color/quality of the fabric wasn\u0092t critical; however I was pleasantly surprised to the point that I may modify my interior color scheme to accommodate as is. The Biltmore Wing Lindy is a lovely chair in shape, dimensions, construction and overall appearance. The chair is stiff, built more-so like a commercial lounge chair however it\u0092s comfortable enough for a living room chair that is more for show than regular use. It\u0092s a breeze to put together, only have to screw in the legs, and I cannot believe the price, especially as compared to the Norwich. I highly recommend this chair to anyone looking for clean modern lines in a classic style.", 
    "This is a great wing back chair. Just beautiful and the silver studs really make it pop. I was looking specifically for a wing back chair but they were all too expensive. When I found this one, I was nervous that it might be cheap looking. It's definitely not. I received the item in about a week from overstock and when it arrived the delivery box was severely damaged but somehow the chair was fine The legs were packaged under the seat and it took about 5 mins to install. The color is a true beige and the look of the fabric is like a textured linen. The silver studs are beautiful and unlike the other reviews, very straight and perfect. The chair is also wide and deep so its great to curl up in and perfect for big people (ie: 6'0ft and up). The chair is a bit stiff but only when you first sit down in it, once you're in it, its a very comfortable chair. I just love it! I normally don't write reviews but I felt compelled to do this one because I really relied on them to make this purchase. If you're on the fence, just buy it. The color is a perfect neutral and will go with everything and the overall look of the chair is just lovely.", 
    "We purchased this chair for our family room. Style and comfort were both very important features. The design is great. The size is good for a smaller person to curl up in and good for an average to larger man to sit comfortably in. Fabric is nice. Cushion is not flippable.", 
    "Chair arrived in good condition, matches the description very well. Only had to screw in the legs for assembly to be complete. Cushion is a little more comfortable than expected for a chair in this price-point (others I have tried have been really hard and unforgiving), but the back is lacking padding...overall I like it, though. I'm 5'3\" so I need a lumbar pillow because the seat is fairly deep, but fits my husband just fine (he's 6'1\").", 
    "I love my new chair. It is being used in the sitting area of our bedroom but if we move it would easily fit into a living room because of its neutral color. Looks like the high end chairs I see in 5 star hotel lobbies. Very happy I made the purchase.", 
    "This chair is gorgeous. One thing you can't see in the photo is the curved hardwood legs, which give the chair a more modern flair. The fabric is nice--a woven color, the nailhead trim is straight. This is a full-sized chair, and I agree with other reviewers that a lumbar pillow is needed due to the depth of the seat. The cushion is firm, the chair is sturdy and heavy. The legs screwed in very easily. I will absolutely be purchasing more furniture from o.co.", 
    "great chair, looks SO much more expensive than it is! I want another but havent been able to find one. i have searched and searched for a neutral wing back chair with silver nail heads to no avail. great piece. the seam is uneven on one side, and you can see some of the underneath lining on the front of the chair, but that can be fixed. for the price, i dont even care.", 
    "I love this chair. It is perfect as a living room chair. It is comfortable and sturdy. I think it will be easy to clean.", 
    "I looked at many online stores and retail stores for two chairs for our living room. These chairs were the exact look I was going for! I relied on the positive reviews and ordered two chairs and couldn't be more pleased!! The fabric is a beautiful textured linen-like fabric that has a classic look. The nailhead trim is gorgeous and adds beautiful detail. Some other reviews indicated the nailheads were not straight, but the trim on our chairs is perfect. The height of the chairs is great...many of the other club chairs I looked at were too short to look right in a living room. I absolutely LOVE these chairs and would highly recommend them. Add a beautiful lumbar pillow and you are good to go. Classic chairs with modern touch. I am so happy with this purchase!!!", 
    "I've been looking quite awhile for a wing back chair for a room I've been wanting to set up as a quiet 'reading room'. Since I don't use the room a lot, I didn't want to spend a lot. The room this chair is in has a bright, colorful garden theme so I wanted a cream or white color chair. This chair is perfect. AND there was no shipping charges and it was delivered within a few days. It took only a few minutes to screw the legs on and put the chair next to the sliders so I can watch the rain (during the winter) and the birds (during the spring and summer). I will look at Overstock.com's website FIRST next time I'm shopping for furniture!", 
    "Doesn't everyone love a bargain? This was possibly the best one of the year. We recently purchased our house and I have a fairly persistent fiance who wants the house furnished in a \"transitional\" way, whatever that means?! She described the type of chair she wanted and i stumbled upon this. At first I was hesitant to order this based on the price, but the reviews said otherwise. It came to the house and has now become my chair. I love it. It's comfortable, looks stunning and even the nail heads are all in line! My only complaint, and it's little, is that the screwing of the legs onto the chair was frustrating as over time, you will have to keep tightening them. Honestly, if you're looking for a great inexpensive chair that rivals even the $2k plus chairs, then this is it! (Please note, that you cannot remove the seat fabric to wash).", 
    "Total garbage! It took 3shipments to get a matching set in acceptable but not perfect condition. after 6 weeks the back leg fell off on one of the chairs. The cushions started to sag and the overall quality and appearance was what I would expect from a chair purchased at a big box low end retailer. Finally requested a total refund and returned the China made chairs to Overstock. Recommend not purchasing furniture on line. Glad the customer service representative agreed to give the refund and UPS was very prompt with the call tag pickup.", 
    "Very cute chairs but poor quality. I was disappointed when I pulled the chairs out of the box and half of the studs had broken and fallen off. Also, the stitching isn't even and it's coming apart at seams. The chair looks poorly made.", 
    "I ordered two chairs and was very pleased with the quick delivery, I received them in less than a week. The legs were easy to assemble. I placed the chairs near my fireplace and they look absolutely gorgeous!! Everyone that comes over comments on how beautiful and modern they look. My son loves them too and says they're really comfortable. He likes to snuggle in the chair and fall asleep. My boyfriend is 6' 7\" and was impressed with the size and comfort of these chairs. I love the fabric, it has a great texture with a linen look. The silver hardware gives these chairs a high end look. I totally recommend this chair. I am really happy I ordered these chairs!! Thank you.", 
    "I just recieved my chairs yesterday and they are awesome! I love them. I before I even put the legs on, I sat in it. The high back feels great. I'm only 5'0 so this could be a factor but these chairs are more comfy than most people have described. The texture of the chair resembles tweed, or burlap but it's not itchy. they are a tad wider than i imagined but i had a nice sized space to fill so it works for me. I'm using them in my formal living area but they give the space a modern glam look. Love them!", 
    "The chair is lovely to look at and not too uncomfortable but the fabric feels rough and of poor quality.The shape is beautiful but the frame feels very cheap.I kept the item because it is pretty in my living room, but you just feel like you are sitting on a piece of furniture that is very flimsy and poorly made.Next time I will pay the money for a piece of furniture of higher quality.", 
    "I never went on overstock.com because I thought it was a membership club.....but after spending a wk at furniture store s and not finding what I wanted for under $1200. I thought I would take a gander and \"just look\". Right away I found a chair and for cheeper than any I had seen.....and then it was delivered to my doorstep!!! I have since told everyone I know about O>S.", 
    "Took a chance on this chair and am very pleased. I actually purchased two for my living room. I rely on reviews when purchasing big items from Overstock, so I thought I'd write a review for anyone contemplating this chair. Arrived one week from order, very well packaged. Only issue was that one nailhead had popped off, but was in an inconspicuous place, and I plan to reattach. Fabric is a great textured, linen-like, off white. Silver nailheads were straight. Screw the legs on and the chair is ready to go. This is a fairly stiff backed chair, but that's what I wanted for my living room. Plan to put a lumbar sized decorative pillow there which should add a bit of comfort. Chairs look more expensive than they were. This was a great purchase. If you are on the fence, go ahead and purchase. You will be happy you did.", 
    "Overstock has come through for me again. This is a great chair, good scale, for the $$$. Works well with my modern sofa & looks great with some throw pillows. Like other buyers mention (and is represented in the photos) the fabric is lovely and adds a lot of nice texture to the chair. It certainly looks more expensive than it is.", 
    "I love the chair! It is perfect for the space that I needed it for. The fabric has a nice texture that you cannot see in the photos. It is also not as white as the picture, which is good for what I wanted.. The chair is very comfortable. Quality is good for an occasional chair but I would not recommend it for everyday use. Overall it is an attractive neutral chair at a great price! I am so happy with my purchase that I just ordered a second chair.", 
    "This chair for the money is a great buy. I put it in my bedroom. It's not super comfortable when sitting in it be wise the back is a bit hard, but I put a pillow with it and its perfect!! This chair looks very expensive and I couldn't be more thrilled with it!", 
    "I really loved the shape on the site and in person. Like other reviewers of the Biltmore Chair, I noticed some of the nailheads aren't perfect, but the chairs are so lovely, that it doesn't bother me. The color is a warm white, not yellowy at all.", 
    "Not the most comfortable but purchased to lighten up the room. Very good buy--sold elsewhere for $1200.", 
    "These chairs are very pretty. They have a textured fabric that adds a bit of an edge to the chair. They did arrive a bit dirty on the edges of the arms (which is really hard to clean on this particular fabric) and one of the nail heads was missing. Overall they are fantastic and we are happy with our purchase.", 
    "I really like this chair. It looks great and is well made!", 
    "Comfortable and of clearly good quality. For assembly just have to screw legs in manually.", 
    "This chair is perfect for my bedrooms. The color and fabric is easy on the eye and feels good to touch.", 
    "Beautiful, stylish chair!", 
    "These chairs are great and look very classy and expensive in my living room!", 
    "Very comfortable, looks way more expensive in real life", 
    "I just received my chair today. It was received in perfect shape, no missing tacks. This chair is very comfortable and ample size for most people. I looked at the reviews and was apprehensive, but I am so in love with the classy, elegant look of this char. I did order a small chocolate lumbar pillow which just finishes off the look.", 
    "It's super comfortable, the material is nice and soft. Just an FYI, the legs are shipped under the cushion. Save you some time and emails to customer service.", 
    "I have had two of these chairs in my main living room for 2 years. They have been way more durable then I could have imagined. They are comfortable to sit on I have paired them with ottomans and a lumbar pillow. They look really nice and are pretty easy to clean. The old thing I don't like it the cushion is not reversable and tends to get a little out of shape after sitting on it over and over. I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice looking chair at a great price. This is not going to last us forever or even for another two years but they have been great fire the price.", 
    "Very nice, good looking, appears very more expensive than it is. Love the fabric and color.", 
    "Great chair- looks beautiful as s decorative chair - just needs lumbar support so we purchased a lumbar pillow that matches our decor and now it's just fine. Looks great with a throw draped over the arm as well. Not a chair anyone sits in everyday we bought it for when we have guests forvmore seating options", 
    "This chair is simple with clean lines. It is relatively large but perfect for my space. With an oversized pillow, it is comfortable and appropriately firm. It was also really easy to put together. I was worried about buying furniture online but was pleasantly surprised. A great buy!", 
    "This is a lovely chair - maybe not the most sturdy but it has had lots of use over the past 6 weeks and no problems. The color is a nice oatmeal and I bought the \"pillow perfect ferrow rectangular throw pillow\" to go on it. The colors work well together", 
    "The really like it. An amazing quality and looking really pretty!!!", 
    "Have had it about a year and it is very sturdy and durable. Love it.", 
    "These chairs are so elegant! We get compliments on them all the time. They are super easy to put together (just screw the legs on) and came in the mail fairly quickly. They are a perfect width (even for bigger guys) too. My only complaint would be that the back is very hard. However, if you are looking for a good \"sitting\" chair - this is perfect. Just toss a small throw pillow on it. You will not regret buying these chairs!", 
    "I love this chair! It is stylish and yet fairly comfortable. The brads on the front of one of the chairs are crooked and it really bothers me, but overall I am happy with my purchase", 
    "It's perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. Great quality too.", 
    "Chair is reasonably comfortable and fairly solidly built. Color maybe slightly darker than it appears on ling. We are using this as a reading chair in the master bedroom. So we expect it should hold up well. Order arrived quickly, however, the carton was severely damaged. The chair survived somehow with no visible damage.", 
    "These chairs are great! I ordered two for my living room. The description is true to form. A little stiff at first, but I'm sure it's because they are so new. I'm very pleased with the purchase.", 
    "I only use these in the corner of my room so the only use they get is when we have lots of people over which is about once a month. The only thing that gives away the lower cost is the weight. These chairs are very light. This could be a negative in an every day use chair because they move around too easily on anything other than carpet. It's a plus for me because they are easy to pull around to wherever we need extra seating.", 
    "the Lindy chair looks great. I love the nail heads it looks more expensive then it was. Love it!!", 
    "Very pretty and incredibly uncomfortable. One leg won't screw on properly. You get what you pay for, folks!", 
    "Beautiful chair. Looks much more expensive. Linen fabric looks better than in picture. True ivory. Threw a gray throw over it.... A+", 
    "True to the color in the photo....very comfortable!", 
    "Great chair that looks and feels great! Very well made.", 
    "These aren't our main seating for the living room, but they are very cute accent chairs for guests and are plenty comfortable. They are very well made and have nice detailing.", 
    "The chair looks great and is very comfortable. It has just the right amount of cushion on the back and on the seat. I ordered two and they are a great addition to my modern coastal decor.", 
    "Item was as pictured. Neutral Linen fabric. Easy assembly. It looks sharp and is a nice change from the traditional wing back. It is a bit firm but for the price I was happy that it had a loose seat cushion. Thumbtack detailing is also an added feature.", 
    "Well, this is a nice looking chair, but it's not the best quality. Purchased for the bedroom as an accent chair which will only be rarely used so i didn't want to spend a fortune. For this purpose, it's a good chair, but i would not want it out in a living room where it got daily use. If the fabric were nicer, i'd give this chair 5 stars, but it's a very cheap scratchy fabric.", 
    "Comfortable and was a great addition to our upstairs family room.", 
    "Beautiful chair, just the right size I was looking for.", 
    "I bought this for a client and it was everything she'd hoped for! Excellent quality! Loves it!!", 
    "What a great chair for the price! We bought this chair to be used in our Master bedroom, so it doesn't get a lot of wear. That being said, it looks great and is relatively comfortable for reading. Our cats seem to love lying in it too. I would definitely recommend this product.", 
    "I love the Lindy chairs! I ordered 2 for my living room. They are large, comfortable, and the color is precise. I did have a little trouble with the legs, but after a few minutes, I finally got them lined up. Overall, for the price you can't beat them.", 
    "Clean, neat detail, and solid. The chairs are comfortable and lovely. Good price! We had to check the on line picture to make sure the legs were properly attached. Even at that we had to change the legs to make them correct.", 
    "I just purchased two of these chairs for my front room. They arrived within 2 days of my order, and they were in excellent condition. They rival the designer versions I saw that cost 5x as much. I'm very pleased I went this route....and so is my pocketbook.", 
    "I ordered 4 of these chairs and I like everything about them except the fabric has not held up quite as well as I hoped. It's frayed some on the wing edges and torn away from the frame. Otherwise, I love the height and comfort.", 
    "Color as shown, quality is very good. It's not to soft, not a chair for lounge area, but it's also not to hard, as for me - the most comfortable feeling. And it looks gorgeous! It came in a box, just screwed legs on and that's it, so easy", 
    "Beautiful chairs that match our sofa as though they came together.Great quality for the price.", 
    "This is chair is actually better than it looks.", 
    "This chair looks great and is comfy too! The color is exactly as shown which I was very pleased with.", 
    "These chairs look even nicer in person. Definitely look like they are not a cheap costing chair! More comfortable than I thought they'd be.", 
    "The chair is an attractive piece of furniture. We have it in our office and really love it. The cons would be the firmness and the color. (Light beige) However, it's not in a main living space in our home, so it's works perfectly for us.", 
    "The chair is very nice and a great value. The color is darker then the photo fyi", 
    "for the living room redo--very comfortable all around. Perfect out of the box, just screw in the legs.", 
    "The nailhead's are not straight and after about a year they started popping out. Also the fabric isn't great.", 
    "Really pretty chair. Nice price. The seat cushion is not very soft, but that's okay because it won't get much use in the spot we placed it. Would recommend", 
    "perfect color. legs are a little weird and looks knocked over but we have a table in front . still happy", 
    "This chair is very elegant and makes a dramatic addition in the room.", 
    "This chair is beautiful in person. The fabric is great quality, and looks just like the pictures. It is also comfortable to sit in.", 
    "Every time someone comes to my home, that is the first thing they see when they walk in and always comment how nice the chairs are. These chairs are well made. You need to put on a rug or they will slide on hardwoods. I have seen no damage to my floors as they have the plastic covers on the bottom. I have them sitting half way on a rug and the look amazing.", 
    "After looking for an armchair for a long time to fit our contemporary home (without breaking the bank) we settled on this one, and I'm glad we did. The wingback design is very trendy and we like the overall clean lines of the chair. The cloth material is woven with thick threat so you can see the details of the cloth. The color is hard to describe but it's slightly creamy and \"sandy\". The nail heads are chrome, which adds to the contemporary design. It's also fairly comfortable, so you're not making a sacrifice there, just don't expect it to be that ugly grandpas recliner (in the comfort department). The reason I'm giving only 4 stars is because the legs are not extremely steady and can wobble a bit if you're moving around in the chair. They also make a bit of a squeaking noise. It's nothing that would prevent me from purchasing this again, but full disclosure.", 
    "They are very firm and seem sturdy enough, easy to assemble the legs. They look okay and I bought 2 and kept them, They kind of look like they are made out of ivory colored burlap, and they will last okay in our living room, because it hardly gets used.", 
    "On one side in the back of this chair a lightly soiled stain is almost visable, and one of the tacks in the back is messy. With such a big item, I decided that it would not be immediately noticeable, so I kept the chair which is otherwise good quality.", 
    "The only reason not a 5 star item is because the chair seems a little bit fragile. Not the most comfortable, but it is over all a nice chair.", 
    "Bought a pair for the living room. I wouldn't describe them as \"comfy\", but they're ok (good for a room rarely used). One of the front legs, when fully screwed on, didn't flare out in the correct direction. But that's expected at this price point. Not noticeable unless you're looking for it.", 
    "We love it, our dog love it!", 
    "Well made, A bit stiff but the style is excellent. A great accent chair. The color is more oatmeal tone than appears in the photo. A ggod buy.", 
    "We ordered this chair for our nursery and it is working out well. Well made chair in a sturdy material. Color is a bit creamier/off white compared to website pictures. The cushions are a bit tough but we're breaking them in. I love the high back/sides and stud details. Adds a bit of sophistication so we can use this chair in other rooms later on. Really happy with our purchase.", 
    "These chairs are way better than the pict", 
    "This chair looks great, especially for the price. It is a little on the stiff side but works nicely in the living room. However be prepared to receive and return several chairs prior to finding one that you want to keep.", 
    "The chair arrived in great condition and pretty quick. It is exactly as pictured and a very nice piece. When you sit on it it's very firm and doesn't feel like the best quality. It's entirely sturdy, what I mean is when you lean on the back part it's a little \"crunchy.\" Don't know how to properly describe that. The back just feels cheap. But, we purchased it more as a decorative piece to fill an empty corner in our family room, so it' does that job very well. It's not so uncomfortable that I wouldn't recommend it, but this isn't the chair you want to buy to cozy up with a book or relax in for a long period of time. Depends on your needs.", 
    "Just beautiful and classic. Cannot go wrong and looks a lot more expensive than the price. Very satisfied", 
    "We've been looking for a wing chair for a while and this one looked exactly like what we had been looking for. The chair arrived and it looks a lot more expensive than what it cost. The material is a light oatmeal, cream color-exactly like in the picture, and the fabric is like a linen type fabric. The legs are almost black, very dark espresso. Now some people complain about how stiff the chair is. I like it that way but it's not a chair you can cuddle in. It is kind of hard to sit on and not designed to lounge in.", 
    "I have been shopping for four chairs for my living room to be placed in a circle around a large ottoman. I found these chairs and ordered one to see how they stacked up to the high end chair I had seen for 4x the cost. The chair arrived in perfect condition and although it is a very nice design, it is not a sink in comfy type chair... It is firm, but extremely stylish and because I do not plan to spend much time in my living room, it fit my purposes perfectly. I ordered three more to complete my design and two of the three chairs arrived banged up with missing nail heads. I did the return online and had UPS pick up the damaged chairs. The replacements arrived in perfect condition so I am pleased with my purchase and my experience with Overstock.com.", 
    "Description of color was very accurate. Beautiful natural white, not yellow/cream. Great piece for the price, looks expensive. Not super comfortable but great for guests or someone who needs a more supportive chair as opposed to cozy/comfy. So glad I purchased, arrived quickly too.", 
    "Very firm chair, assembly was easy, just screw in legs and then screw in a drywall screw for extra security.", 
    "Reasonable chair for the price, it fits well in my study and provides the comfortable support needed for reading. As with many of the chairs at Overstock.com, the color choices are limited. But that being said, I believe that the chair is a good value for the $***purchase price.", 
    "This is a great chair. Somewhat firm cushions, ample room on the seat for lounging, wing backs make nice headrests as well. Good neutral color, zero assembly. Sturdy (two toddlers rough housing on it can't tip it over). Very pleased with quality for price.", 
    "These chairs are great looking (although I would have preferred to be able to choose the nail color as the silver is not my style). They look comfy until you sit down. They are very firm in both the seat cushion and the back of the chair. I am 150 pounds overweight so I typically sink into furniture but these chair cushions did not budge. If you like a firm seat, then this chair is for you. If you like a more comfortable seat (which I do), then don't waste your money.", 
    "This chair is really pretty. It's just a little different than what I expected which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. The material is a little more \"burlap-like\" than I thought. I thought it would be a softer cotton material. It's pretty \"woven\" and the color is a little darker than the picture. So, the picture is slightly deceiving. Not terribly, but the color is a little more of a light wheat color, than a true cream or ivory. I'm going to keep it, only because I don't want to deal with shipping it back and trying to find another one. It's a very nice chair, it's just a little different than what I was expecting. But, quality is good, shape is beautiful, and the nail heads are very nicely done.", 
    "Very attractive chair, average quality and low on comfort. This is a great looking chair but probably not for everyday use. This chair is mostly an accent piece with moderate to light use.", 
    "I was very disappointed with this product and wish that I decided to return it. I was hoping the chairs would \"grow on me\" and that they would soften up, or that I could do something to the cushions to make them more comfortable. The fabric is similar to a bleached burlap. The weave is \"big\" or loose. The nailhead trim and seams are not straight. I cringe everytime I look at them and they make me so unhappy that after spending almost *** on two of them my husband says \"Just get rid of them!\". I feel like I am stuck with them because I spent the money. They also make a very funny noise when you sit down and then get up. The legs feel \"wobbly\" and I can't tighten them any further. ***", 
    "Was a little hesitant to purchase chairs sight unseen and had to do a little research first before I decided to buy them. I was not disappointed! My two chairs arrived less than a week after I ordered and they were very easy to put together and once I had them set up it went perfect in my formal living room. The color was more of a creamy beige than the whitish color it looks like on the website, however, it ended up looking perfect in the living room which is of a grayish color scheme. The chairs were well packed, the seats are firmer than I expected, but I am happy they are since I know over time they will soften up once they are broken in. The nailheads definitely make the chairs look very classy and expensive. Overall,very happy with the quality especially for the price of these wingbacks.", 
    "We love our new chairs! They look great in our family room. My husband likes them as much as I do. For the money, this is a great chair!", 
    "We were looking for style in our updated master. This fills the bill. The linen fabric is up to date, but I wouldn't want it in a chair sat upon by everyone. Not sure of durability in the long run. But all in all satisfied", 
    "I've used this chair numerous times in model homes. its a perfect size and color.....not a bit comfortable, but looks great...very stylish and priced right!", 
    "Although the style is perfect, this chair is poorly made. The first time I sat in it, I could hear a crack in the wood, and I am 5'4\" 130lbs, so not large by any means. Also, 4\" of the fabric on the back of the chair was lifting exposing the nails. If the chair were sturdier, or had the fabric started lifting after some wear, I would have tried to fix it myself, but not for it being right out of the box. This is being sent back today.", 
    "The chair looks good and is a good size with a fairly high seat, which makes it easy to get in and out of, but the seat is very hard. I'm hoping it will soften up a bit over time. Since I had to leave on travel a couple of weeks after receiving the chair I can't really judge this yet. Same with the wearability of the fabric. It feels a little rough; this is not a soft, luxurious armchair but if it wears well and proves easy to clean then I can live with that. The price was reasonable.", 
    "I love these chairs. I bought two to put in my formal living room. They are perfect.", 
    "I love this chair! The size is perfect and the details are very well done (nailhead trim). I do find the chair is quite hard, but that wouldn't deter me from ordering another one, as I'm sure it'll soften up over time.", 
    "I really liked the style of the chair especially the nail head design. It's not very comfortable though. I'm hoping with use over time the seat cushion will be less hard. Other than that it's a good value for the price.", 
    "We bought this chair for our son's nursery. My husband actually turned it into a swivel glider. The chair is a true linen/cream color. The fabric has a grid-looking texture that looks similar to burlap (but don't worry, not scratchy a all). The cushioning on the chair is a bit lacking, especially against the back. The piping is a bit crooked in some spots, Overall, a good-looking chair, but not the best quality.", 
    "This is a really nice chair for this price. After reading all reviews, I've decided to purchase this chair and it did not disappoint me. I love the silver nailhead which gives a sleek modern look. The color is ivory/cream (very light, not yellowish) just like picture. Matches my light grey sofa. I am really pleased with the chair. It looks expensive. Will give it a complete look by adding a colorful throw pillow. The seat is also very roomy.", 
    "Mostly, I am pleased with my O purchases. This one failed to please. Very surprised because most of the reviews are good. Purchased two chairs for hearth room. If you don't look too close, they look great. Upon closer inspection, the left side of one chair has two metal wires coming out. The other chair has a flaw with seaming and nail heads. This may just be with this chair as the one with metal wires has straight seams and nail heads. Both chairs are hard as a rock and \"smell\". They have sat in my house for several days and it still hasn't gone away. Can't wait to get them boxed up and out of here so I can get rid of the odor. There are inexpensive, but you get what you pay for.", 
    "Stunning chair with impact. Nice and wide. Not very comfortable cushions but Zim very happy my purchase!", 
    "The material is fabulous! the detailing is perfect...brads we're perfectly lined up and add such a touch of class! It is a firm chair , so if immediate comfort if what you are looking for it will take time to break in.", 
    "Bought 2 and they look awesome in my living room! Great quality and really deep and big! Putting 2 side by side is a nice look!", 
    "I am very happy with the color, style, and quality of the chair. It is a very nice chair for the price.", 
    "I ordered these chairs after searching at local stores, XXXXXXXXX etc. most places they were upwards of $XXX. I love these chairs! They came within days of ordering and all I had to do was screw on the legs. I bought these for my front living room space, the space that isn't used everyday so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on furniture in there. These are perfect! They look fabulous and are very comfortable! I will say the back end had some bumps where the fabric had a bump in it from staples and just needed to be hammered with a rubber mallet. Definitely buy again!", 
    "Considering the price I think this was a great find. I don't sit in it often, I use it more for decor but a lot of my guests sit in this chair and seem to be fine. Considering the price I am very happy with the chair.", 
    "This is a great chair, as long as you understand that it is not very comfortable. It looks wonderful, and looks like a much more expensive chair then it is. But it is not very comfortable.", 
    "The chairs are very pretty, but if you want a solid piece of construction, this may not be for you. I purchased two, and these chairs are more for decor, and two extra seats when we have company, so for me they work well. However, the back is not very solid. When I press on the back of the chair, I can push the panel in and out...almost like it's cardboard rather than wood. One of my chairs arrived in a damaged box and had some scuff marks, which I was able to clean up. i decided that would be easier than returning. One of the arms was also slightly bowed, but I was able to hammer it back into place. I don't notice inconsistencies with the nailhead like many have mentioned, so that's a plus! Overall, the chairs are really pretty, and are fairly comfrotable with a pillow behind your back. If you need a large side chair that won't be getting a lot of wear and tear, I would definitely recommend this one.", 
    "Beautiful chairs. They are very high quality and easy to put together. It was worth the price.", 
    "Love this chair! We bought it as an accent chair for a corner in our living room and it is a beautiful chair - looks much more expensive than we paid for it. It is the perfect size, easy assembly, and looks great. Not the most comfortable chair to sit on but as an accent chair, it works just perfectly! Would highly recommend to anyone.", 
    "The chair arrived within a week.Was more larger than I expected.The nail heads are not lined properly, look poor quality work.The legs had scratches and one leg is shorter.Chair is light. Not buying again from overstock again. I bought this chair after reading reviews and so I thought I should write one to help other make a decision.If you are some one who wants to buy quality, this is not the chair for you.", 
    "Love this chair - the nailhead trim is a nice touch. The shape is interesting and the material seems fine, though a couple of loose threds here and there. The back is really firm though and I wouldn't sit on it without a pillow. Not really a comfy chair and it's pretty wide but very stylish. Wouldn't recommend it for small living areas.", 
    "I bought two of these chairs for my bedroom in our shore home. They are very pretty and stylish..The color is an off white with a silver nailhead trim. The trim is very straight and really makes the chair pop and look upscale. The fabric is a little coarse but still pretty..I don't know how the fabric would hold up in a family room or room with lots of use..but mine are in the bedroom and so are perfect for where we have them. I love them so much that I just ordered another for our main house bedroom..I waited for the XX% off coupon and got the chair at an even lower price..I wouldn't hesitate to get this chair if you are on the fence..You will be happy you did!", 
    "I love this chair I ordered two for my formal living room and they look just beautiful. The fabric is very nice and the nailhead trim is just beautiful. The only thing is the fabric on the seat cushion does continue on the other side so you can't flip over.", 
    "I like the color-- a creamy beige. I like the style. It is comfortable but very firm. It was easy to assemble. It is a good size, not too overwhelming but not insubstancial. I think it is a good choice."
