    "We were looking for low cost kitchen cabinet. Found this one that sort of suited our needs. This \"put it together yourself\" cabinet is made of cheap quality materials and when put together tends to lean from side to side. The back is cheap (multiple) pieces of thin paneling that you tack on with tiny finish nails. You may also want to invest in a pair of bifocals or magnifying lens to read the directions which are poorly written. It appears as though trying to fit all the directions on a double sided single piece of paper is more important than thorough easy to read directions. Low cost, low quality in my opinion. Would not purchase again.", 
    "I appreciate the versatility of this hutch. There is plenty of room and hidden storage. We had no issues putting it together. Great for the price.", 
    "Where to begin...Well first off, it's fiber board so you have to be really carefully during assembly. Hopefully it won't have to be moved because it doesn't seem overly sturdy. The instructions could've been better. In the end, the doors don't line up very well. We've adjusted them so atleast they'll close not without catching on the drawer. I'm disappointed we weren't able to get it \"as pictured\".", 
    "EXTREMELY difficult to assemble. Functional unit, well-designed butrather lackluster in materials and style", 
    "Perfect size to hold our dinnerware. Great addition to the kitchen cabinets."
