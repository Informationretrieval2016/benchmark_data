    "daily motivation. placed along my morning route in house, this art embodies beautiful spirit. i love it.", 
    "This is such a gorgeous piece. I love collecting celestial art, so this was a no brainer. The face of the sun is so mysterious, and a tad creepy. After I purchased Nocturnal Sonata, which is just awesome, I had to have this beauty. The arist who makes these sculptures is incredible...I have other pieces of his that are just as beautiful in the sun/moon motif. Do not hesitate on this one :)", 
    "Ive had alot of compliments on this piece. Its the perfect size for my hall wal. I love it", 
    "love this sun art work have it on my beach home everyone coments on it", 
    "It's a beautiful design and very nice piece! Kudos to the designer!", 
    "I could hardly wait for this piece to be delivered. I absolutely LOVE this art piece. It is such a wonderfully detailed and intricate piece of artistry!!!", 
    "Absolutely beautiful, looks great in my kitchen.", 
    "Very well made. Quick shipping", 
    "This is one of my favorite art pieces in my home! My husband passed away, he used to call me \"So Sunny\", that's why I bought this... it reminds me of him, plus he was a precision welder and the piece is metal. Love it!", 
    "The artistic style is different from the run of the mill items. The color is pleasing. It was easy to hang.", 
    "cool I't would look good outdoors with a Tuscany look.", 
    "looks exactly like picture love it", 
    "It was a very well made sculpture very true to the picture", 
    "Delivered quickly and is exactly what I have been looking for.", 
    "I loved the wall art and think it even exceeded my expectations. I was having an outdoor party and she arrived in plenty of time to be displayed. I was easily able to bend some of the \"rays\" to give the work a more 3D look.", 
    "It took three weeks to arrive and when it did.....meh....I moved it to a different spot and ordered a custom one from Etsy", 
    "Looks great in our backyard and well made.", 
    "I like sun design art. This is pretty, but after I received it, I feel it's a bit pricey. But considering it was free shipping it wasn't too bad of a deal. I love Overstock.com!", 
    "Love this artwork! Bought with \"Sumptuous Sun\" & am very happy with both. My husband slightly bent some of the cut-out \"flames\" upward to give it a more 3-D effect & it just pops! Very mystical looking face. I want to put it in the front of my house so EVERYONE can see it but it will go on my patio so I can see it every time I'm in the backyard. Beautiful piece, kind of coppery & gold colored with a red accent around the face.", 
    "GETTING THE MOON TOO MATCH ,LOOKS COOL ON A PATIO.....", 
    "this looks larger in the photo, wouldn't buy it again", 
    "Looks awesome. Very well made", 
    "Loved the \"Lady of the Sun\". Bought it for my daughter as she likes to hang anything artsy outdoors. She loves it.", 
    "Lady of the Sun did not disappoint me in the least. I'm big on facial features and this was spot on. The size and weight were perfect for what I was looking for. The quality was flawless. I'm very happy. It complimented the Welcome sign that I also purchased at this time.", 
    "It hanging in my terrace I always get compliments. It is sturdy and still looks great after months if being outdoors", 
    "For me, this is the perfect size, the perfect style and adds class to my collection of sun wall art from around the world. Love this piece!!!!", 
    "I loved the style of the Lady of the Sun wall art. I had not seen anything that compared. The piece did seem small as previous reviews mentioned. The face is 5 1/2 inches across. The cut marks to define the face features were not done very well and I had considered sending it back, but the style won out. It's a piece for my patio so my husband sprayed clear matte lacquer on it for protection and we will take it in during the winter months. Although smaller then I hoped for it looks good at a distance.", 
    "Love the design. The quality is so-so. The cost at XXX+ was probably more than double it's worth. Being my first purchase with Overstock.com, I'm reconsidering any future business for the lack of value verses price.", 
    "This is a stunning piece of art. I love suns, but most are tacky and cheap. this is one of my absolute favorites", 
    "She is hanging over my bed....She makes me smile....lovely....", 
    "Has a \"manufactured\" look if that makes sense. However, put it on an outside wall in patio area. Looks fine there. Live in Southern California.", 
    "I love this piece of art, it is exactly as I expected.", 
    "Having looked at several \"sun\" wall art pieces, when I saw this on Overstock, I was struck by the originality and style of the piece. It arrived yesterday, and I am delighted with it -- it is lovely and well crafted! Thank-you to the artist! Also thanks to Overstock for making such work accessible to the broader market and for the ease of this transaction -- timely delivery and as expected.", 
    "The dimensions were not included in the description of the product. I thought it was going to be a lot bigger. If I would have known the size I would have not ordered it . The product was good and beautiful but I was very disappointed in the size .", 
    "I collect suns so it is a theme around my house and especially in the pool area as it is walled in, I wanted it to feel like the outdoors. This one is exceptionally pretty. Very delicate looking and quite unusual. She hangs in the very front of my house. Sprayed it with a product so it wouldn't rust as we we get a lot of rain in Florida. Very different and quite lovely. I would not have minded had it been a little bit bigger, but, it is beautiful.", 
    "In the picture it looked like the face has dimension, The face is actually very flat! It is smaller than I thought it would be and the quality is not as I expected. I will keep it since I don/t like to send things back. It will hang in my sunroom when it is completed, being built now. I just hope it looks better from a distance than it does up close. Looks pretty cheap up close. I could go on as to how disappointed I am because I do love sun faces, but I won't enough said.", 
    "I love her and everyone who sees her on my porch wall wants her. She would look good inside but I got her for the front porch wall and she looks great there. I really think she is great. Glad I got her.", 
    "I didn't want just any kind of sun, like those that you can find at any retail store. This one was very unusual and since I needed to dress up my back yard, this was perfect right over my swimming pool's rock waterfall. Fits the decor well.", 
    "would buy again, good quality, colors are very accurate", 
    "I paired this with a similar sized moon-themed steel wall art as a gift for a friend who is decorating his home in a southwestern motif. He called to let me know that the pieces were well made, of beautiful coloring and looked lovely hanging in the sunroom.", 
    "Very happy with this purchase. It looks fabulous on the wall and the detail is beautiful. Also, this piece was packaged and protected very well to prevent crushing of the 3 dimensional detail. Thanks overstock!", 
    "I am extremely happy with my purchase which looks just as pictured on the website.", 
    "I am very pleased with this piece. It was exactly what I wanted. Very well made and it looks really cool. The way it was packed for shipping was perfect. Some of the pieces are made to stick away from the original setting and it was packed to preserve the artist's design of the art. I would recommend this to anyone who loves sun art. I now am wanting to buy another piece because I love this one so much!", 
    "It is a beautiful piece and the colors were perfect!", 
    "different than everyone elses, very nice and very well made, i love it (:", 
    "I loved this wall art- it really tied my collection of wall art together (other items from Mexico and Calif).", 
    "This is a gorgeous and unique piece of artwork. I love it.", 
    "I love this. It is so beautiful and the colors match the sitting area in my kitchen.", 
    "I adore this art peice! It's really wonderful looking. It's smaller than I anticipated, but it is an asset to any room. My only complaint is how long delivery took, 3 weeks! But I understand these items come from the country of the artist and it always takes longer. That doesn't make the anticipation and waiting any easier. But this was worth the wait!", 
    "i'll keep it because i don't like sneding things back"
