    "These pillows are great, and the back of the pillow is exactly the same as the front.", 
    "Perfect size, can be hard to find large throw pillows", 
    "This pillow is nice quality and true color to pictures.",

    "This is a good size pillow, and the colors go really good on my daybed.", 
    "Pillows are nice with great design and subtle colors.", 
    "Awesome accent pillow, very well made.", 
    "Cute pillow...just not the best quality. After a while it started to look shabby.", 
    "I like the design of this pillow but it's already got some threads coming loose, so I don't know how long I will keep it. If you like to update your throw pillows often, it's not a bad deal for the price.", 
    "These throw pillows look exactly as they're shown in the photos. Very nice.", 
    "Exactly as pictured! Perfect!", 
    "I had previously ordered some pillows from here that were larger and had an embrodered pattern. I expected these to be woven and instead, it was just a printed fabric. The colors are subtle and they suit their purpose as an accent.", 
    "Nice color pallet and thickness to the pillow.", 
    "Goes with my d\u00e9cor and liked them so much ordered 2 more for the family room. I wanted a firm pillow for my back and these are perfect.", 
    "Great! Exactly the colors of the picture, good quality and not too stiff.", 
    "It's a very nice pillow, colors are as shown. It is firm however and I prefer soft throw pillows to snuggle up with.", 
    "exactly as picture shows. Happy with my purchase.", 
    "Good quality but expensive. The colors are perfect in my living room therefore I decided to keep the cushions. Definitely expensive. I should have waited for a sale to justify the price.", 
    "Vibrant colors and so far is with standing the abuse my four grand-daughters have had on them. I get lots of compliments from family and friends"
