    "This patio set is made for ages 3-10. This is a VERY small set. I'm 6'0\" 175 and take up almost the whole couch just sitting down. This is something for a playhouse.", 
    "First thing I have gotten from Overstock that I hate. It is like little children's furniture. Very low to the ground, very compact and not comfortable at all. Picture VERY deceiving. Just being honest. Regret buying it.", 
    "Small and cheap. This item does is not marketed correctly. Returning asap.", 
    "much smaller in person, hate it", 
    "I thought I was getting a really good deal, but this item is very small, very light and not great quality. I wouldn't buy it again. We ended up selling this set on Craigslist and buying a different set that costs twice as much but was larger and much better quality.", 
    "I'm an Overstock lover, but this purchase was a great disappointment. First time I feel like it wasn't honestly described. Set is so small that the typical adult cant get comfortable.. It's childrens furniture!!", 
    "Be cautioned - this is a very small patio set. Sits very close to floor (similar to beach chairs) but is very sturdy and comfortable. It fits beautifully in our small condo patio. We have it facing an outdoor TV and then have bar stools behind the patio set which provides additional seating when watching games, etc. Am a little concerned regarding the ivory cushions. Would have preferred a color that wouldn't show the dirt but overall still very happy with the set. Directions were not included so it took a little figuring out. Would recommend getting a real allen wrench, preferably attached to a drill. Was tight to get into some spots. Overall very happy.", 
    "We found the height of the seating very low, but it works. Not for BIG people though (ie over 220 pounds).", 
    "Actually it is a very good set for smaller people and small court yard:) I have been looking for something smaller for my little court yard until I saw this set. Love it and love Overstock service:)))", 
    "they are very low.... I bought 2 sets and think I may return one that I didn't open", 
    "Looks great, very rich. Slightly low to the ground.", 
    "After assembling the furniture and looking at it I was so embarrassed! I ordered this set thinking it would be perfect for our deck and my son's first birthday party with all of our families. What a joke and waste of time!", 
    "Very pretty, however not a very sturdy piece of furniture. No recommended for heavy weight people. Also sits very low to the ground. We are not heavy people and feel the furniture would not support alot of weight.", 
    "When this arrived it all came in one medium size box , which I thought was strange since it was a 4 piece outdoor patio set, but when we opened it and put it together we immediately knew why, it was very small , tiny sized pieces none of which a normal 5'6\" woman could sit comfortably in. The cushions are a cheap vinyl that feel rough and itchy on your legs and look terrible. We are returning the whole thing !", 
    "excellent packing.arrived in good condition.worst user friendly assembly ever encountered.the screws are very fiddly.the one Allen key does not help either.Took over 3 hours instead the 45 minutes per instruction.would be good idea to replace with Phillips screws so that we can use a Philips screw driver", 
    "It's nice but I did finds them to be low for the price is ok.", 
    "Use this furniture for the water resistant quality of cushions. They have lasted more years than most furniture. Wish the coffee table wasn't glass", 
    "Its like children's size. very misleading... now we have to sell it... ugh...", 
    "I do not like this set at all. It is way to short for anybody to sit in. So I am now stuck with a ******* patio set that no one can sit in", 
    "This set came in and we put it together with some difficulty with some of the screws. This set is SO short there is NO way my 6'5 husband can sit on this. Very disappointed, wish I could return it!", 
    "This outdoor set was easy to assemble and would complement any decor. The fabric is durable and the resin-wicker material is very stylish. I like the fact that it has squared lines without being too chunky.", 
    "good value patience needed for assembly.....will look good on the deck", 
    "It took half a day to put together and when we were done it was child size furniture!! It's a joke! My 15 year old daughter walked in and said \"is this like for kids mom\".... It's very poor quality as well. Do not buy this!"
