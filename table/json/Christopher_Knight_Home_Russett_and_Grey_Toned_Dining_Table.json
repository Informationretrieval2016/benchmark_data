    "The color of the table is nothing like picture it's way darker. Not happy with this purchase but to return it we would have to pay for the oversize shipping save your money. They actually lose the top to this table when we first bought it and we had to wait 3 months for it to come in.", 
    "Love the table, the different colors are beautiful!", 
    "Loved this wood, great quality, beautiful colors in wood. Only negative is the sheen shiner than I would have liked. Would have liked more of a hand rubbed look.", 
    "I was a bit apprehensive about ordering such an expensive piece online, sight unseen, but I was determined to track down this table, and there weren't any local options available. Overstock not only had the best price on the table itself, but also offered free shipping and credits through my Club O membership. The table arrived very quickly, and was in perfect condition. The colors are a bit darker than in the main photo (the detail shots are accurate), but the main photo is shot with pretty extreme lighting. The packaging was superb- it arrived very well protected from any possible scratches or other damage. Very satisified with my purchase!"
