    "Feels and looks a bit like thick plastic. Feels solid and the design is very pretty.", 
    "Very happy with this purchase. What a beautiful couch! Very firm, easy to get out of. Wipes clean. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Sofa is easy to put together and nice solid sofa but it's Navy Blue with a white mottled speckle throughout. Not true Navy like photos shows and it's a bit funky. If you can get passed that- it's great!", 
    "Furniture is even prettier than the picture, easily assembled, comfortable and excellent customer service.", 
    "Item as described - great purchase!", 
    "Best piece of furniture item I ever bought", 
    "The couch is so beautiful and is a great value. The color is a true navy but with a lovely dappled blue design. ( like a dappled grey horse for you equine lovers) It is firm yet comfortable. It came true to all specifications in size and was easy to assemble. A caution for cat owners, my kitty poked holes in the surface within the first day. I now have a navy blue covering over my pretty couch.", 
    "The seats are firm which I was surprised to learn that I enjoy about this couch. The color is great and more intricate than the picture displays. It is a great piece to my living room. My only complaint is with the seat cushions. They seem to move easily so I find myself getting up to push the seats back into the couch. It doesn't happen frequently but enough for me to deduct one star.", 
    "exactly as shown. comfy and the leather although bonded, looks and feels durable. love the color and the chesterfield type style!", 
    "I love the sofa's...can't wait for them to be 'worn in' a bit. The cushions arrived very stiff and will be looking for a way to remove the sheen that really cheapens the look.", 
    "I saw this online as risked getting it. I am so glad I did. It was easy to put together and comfortable. The color is beautiful", 
    "This is the perfect look. LOVE the modeled navy -- more a \"cadet\" blue. It gives it a bit more of a casual look with the elegance and timelessness of the chesterfield style. It was super easy to put together and takes literally 5 minutes or less. Well packaged. Two things I would have changed or maybe would like better: I like the look for a 2 cushion or even single cushion seat. And the cushions move out of their position too easily. I have kids and the cushions tend to slide off the couch. Maybe I will have to put down double sided velcro or something. It would be nice if they could be interiorly secured. Comfort wise, it needs some decorative comfy pillows in order to lounge on it. It is a rather firm sofa... but a firmness my 60's mom would enjoy because you don't sink down and get stuck in it. I imagine the leather and sofa will get a little softer with use and should age beautifully. Overall very happy with my purchase. My husband hated the look to begin with on the computer -- but has really warmed up to it since it has been in our home. It is \"neutral\" but adds color to a space and maintains an elegant masculinity. Paired it with the Safavieh vegetable died blue rug and it has been PERFECT!!", 
    "Great sofa, quality, firm and comfortable"
