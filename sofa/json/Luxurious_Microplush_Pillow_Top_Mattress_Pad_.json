    "I purchased this mattress pad first for myself as I wanted the soft feel of a luxurious hotel bed. This did not disappoint. I was so pleased I bought another one for my parents. They were also very pleased with it. I have had mine now for about 2 years and it has not broken down. Would highly recommend.", 
    "I decided to buy this mattress pad after reading all the wonderful reviews. I cannot believe that no one mentioned the fact that on the bottom side there is a hard seam on all four sides of each block where they are stitched together. It is not just a few blocks, it is every block. If this excess material had been trimmed off it might be okay but it was not. If it wasn't for the fact that I have it on top of a memory foam topper and these hard seams sink into it making them somewhat less noticeable, I would not be able to sleep on it. I sometimes wonder if the one I received is defective because it seems as though this would be a major complaint from everyone. I wish I had sent it back.", 
    "My daughter is one tough customer. I have a mattress that is two yrs old but she felt it was too firm for her. She was \"used to a pillow top\" I love to spend time with my children so I would do just about anything to keep them visiting. I considered buying a whole new mattress and I saw this item and descided to give it a try first. She loves it!!! Made a huge difference. Thank you for a cheap solution to having my daughter visit more often. To me, that is PRICELESS.", 
    "I was very pleased when the mattress topper came in.It arrived very quickly and I put it on the bed right away. Very plush. I had been waking upduring the night with sore spots, this seems to have helped.", 
    "Pleasantly surprized with the quality and texture, we needed to \"comfort up\" a tired hard mattress and replace a mattress pad in our spare bedroom. I added this over the top of a 3 \" memory foam pad also purchased from Over stock. In stead of just buying a mattress pad we bought a slice of heaven...", 
    "We have a latex mattress, and it is divoted where we sleep but not enough (of course) to get a new mattress per the warranty. We had a regular mattress pad on there, but it ripped, and I bought this one after looking at several on Amazon and Overstock. This one was $10 cheaper than one with a very similar photo available on Amazon, and we are so pleased with it! It has decreased the divot \"sensation\" quite a bit, which I think will increase the life of our mattress. As some others commented, I can occasionally feel a seam here and there, but it is a very small price to pay for such a fantastically plush matress pad. Don't hesitate - get one today!", 
    "I purchased this microplush pillow top mattress pad and was amazed by the quality once it arrived. It is very comfortable to sleep on. The fabric on top is very soft and the pockets are extra deep. The box stitching helps to keep all the padding stay put. It washed great and I have already recommended it to two friends who have purchased their own. What a great value - you will be happy with this product.", 
    "If you are someone who enjoys a good night's sleep, DO NOT PURCHASE this mattress pad!! I received the microplush pillowtop mattress pad several days ago and put it on my bed. At first, I was impressed with the nice, cushy loft of the pad and slept well the first night. However, after just two nights of use, I woke up with pain at all pressure points on the left side of my body. Along the seams of the \"baffles\" in the pad, it felt as though there were hard \"cords\" running through them. Now that the initial cushion-y feel of the pad has settled somewhat, this obvious defect is painfully apparent. I was so uncomfortable that I gave up trying to sleep in my bed and spent the rest of the night on the couch! Getting dressed this morning, I also noticed a couple of small bruises along the sides of my left elbow and outside of my knee - Wow! Save yourself some time and a few bruises and make another selection when shopping for a comfortable mattress pad . . .", 
    "This mattress pad worked wonders on a very firm bed I have. Now I'm not skeptical about letting guest sleep in it! It had large pockets that I'm sure would accomodate any depth! Arrived quickly and in brand new packaging and transformed my hard stiff bed to an enjoyable one I find myself napping on! Another successful buy on Overstock I'd say!", 
    "We've used this product for about a week. We don't know how long it will last, but in the meantime, we are certainly enjoying it. It has a very comfortable, cozy feel. My husband has a foam mattress pad on his side of the bed. We've put the pillowtop pad on top of it. If and when this one loses it's comfort, we will definitely purchase another.Promptness, packaging, problem free service from Overstock; we recommend Overstock also.", 
    "Slept on our new pillowtop mattress pad last night with fingers crossed that it would make a difference in our quality of sleep. Did not disappoint us. My husband, who rarely gets quality sleep, said it made a huge difference in his sleep. And Overstock was, as usual, so quick in its shipment. Fantastic product!", 
    "Wow, this is like sleeping on a cloud! So far I have purchased two of these mattress pads, and I might buy more. They are the best! Well worth the money.", 
    "I ordered this mattress pad for my eight year old son's bed. After receiving it I then proceeded to purchase one for every bed in my house. As of today, I have purchased six of these Microplush Pillow Top Mattress Pads. Just last week I purchased one for my cousin and had it shipped to her house as a gift. She loved it! They are so worth the money and I highly recommend purchasing them. Happy Sleeping!", 
    "I honestly can not say enough wonderful things about this bed! The price was great and it is oh so comfy, you just sink right in, its like sleeping on a cloud! Very soft if you are a firm lover it may be too soft", 
    "I ordered it because I have serious back issues and wanted something soft on my bodies pressure points. I have a very hard time getting out of bed in the morning because my back aches so bad. After using this new mattress pad, I am able to get out of bed much easier, because I don't ache quite so much as I did before. You may think I'm crazy, but this mattress pad has made a difference to me.", 
    "Don't know why this got good reviews. Very thin, not \"pillowy\" at all. Overpriced. Could get something better at ****. -Dan", 
    "This is the 3rd microplush pillow top mattress pad I've purchased and they are everything I want in a quality mattress pad. Last fall we purchased the queen and double size pads and last month purchased the CA King size. They are all excellent construction, amply sized, wash beautifully, retain their shape, and are very comfortable. Couldn't ask for a better product!", 
    "Bought this for my gf. Made her bed soo soft, that we almost don't leave. Easy to maintain after many washes.", 
    "This is a wonderful product for this amount of money. I priced others in department stores at 3 times the cost and less plush. The fabric is soft, suede-like and non-skid so that the sheet does not slide around over the mattress pad. The plushness is adequate, but not nearly as fluffy as a pillow - top mattress. However, comparing the cost of a new king size pillow top mattress to the cost of this mattress pad, the purchase of this pad is a no brainer. The depth of the mattress pad is more than needed for the height of my mattress, so it there is more than enough to tuck under my mattress.", 
    "I was very hopeful when I ordered this...but was a bit disappointed that the loft wsn't as great as I expected. But my main dissatisfaction is due to it becoming lumpy with hard 'knots' where the seaming intersects. You stretch out your legs or whatever and hit an uncomfortable 'hard spot'. I wish it had been an item I could return because I sure would have.", 
    "After about six months this microplush topper looses it plushness - it becomes a fancy expensive mattress cover! Not sure it's worth the money. Spend more on your mattress and skip the extra topper.", 
    "This is the third of these mattresses pads I've bought (for 3 different beds). Great quality, very soft and comfortable and the filling never shifts. Washes and dries fine, although you will probably need a commercial size washer for the king size. Just bought a queen size, so don't know about that. I use these over the 2\" memory foam toppers (also bought at Overstock) and together they make a supremely comfy bed. The pad provides a soft cottony cushion over the foam - much nicer to sleep on. Will definitely buy again.", 
    "Arrived quickly, good quality all as listed . We have sleepnumber bed so not a thick a mattress as new ones thus corners of mattress pad tend to slip and slide down off the end of bed over time.", 
    "The price was excellant for this quality product!!! The cush is nice, but, could be a little more \"pillow-cush\". :)", 
    "I purchased this item for a queen size bed that I have in my guest bedroom. People commented how comfortable that bed was and asked were I purchased the mattress pad. It was so well received that I order this item for my own bed plus the other guest bedroom.", 
    "I bought this for my new firm mattress. The quality is excellent. Made my bed much softer and firm at the same time. I highly recommend it.", 
    "LUMPY, DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY .SLIDES OFF. ABSOLUTE JUNK!", 
    "I saw mattress pads of lesser quality for double this price at a retail store. My husband is in love with this mattress pad! My elderly parents stayed in our room last week while visiting and now my mom wants one of these pads for her bed at home. I am completely satisfied!", 
    "Absolutely loved the softness of the mattress pad. Slept wonderfully. The only thing I was not real pleased with is the fit. It is not real tight and tends to slip a little. Believe me even if your mattress is deep pocket it will fit and then some. Even with that being said I do love the comfort and softness.", 
    "Had one at home in Chicago....was deployed to Iraq and the beds are quite uncomfortable..as you can imagine. So I ordered this mattress pad and it is amazing! I love it and it gives me a great night's sleep. I'm even going to order one for one of my friends here, as soon as they get some more twin size in stock. Don't even think about it, there's no way you won't like it!", 
    "This mattress pad has made such a difference on my son's twin bed. The mattress was so hard and uncomfortable, and now with this pad, it is very soft and comfortable. I wish I'd bought this a year ago!", 
    "This mattress pad is incredibly soft to the touch, well constructed and fits the 17 inch mattress perfectly. The elastic skirt is snug and does not pull out or up when sleeping. That may be helped by the fact that we don't toss and turn all night anymore because the pad adds comfort to sleeping. The end to end box stitching is solid and the fibers don't shift. I was so impressed with it, that I not only took the time to write a review I also purchased another one.", 
    "This \"mattress pad\", almost a mattress topper really, is ultra comfortable. It is very soft, and the padding is heavenly. We have it on a pillowtop mattress, and it adds even more soft \"squishyness\" to a very comfortable mattress. However, the fabric that stretches over the mattress sides is very cheap. We've had it 3 weeks and the material has completely stretched out already. You may be OK if you have a very deep mattress...15 inches or greater...ours is about 12 inches. A deeper mattress may help keep this pad in place. So, because the pad fits so loosley, it always comes off the corners of the bed, and takes the sheet with it. Mildly bothersome. If the material on the sides was better, I would give this a 5. Even with that said, it is super comfortable!!", 
    "was very thin, didn't notice any extra padding on my mattress.", 
    "I like it on my bed very much. Very helpful.", 
    "Durable can't go wrong love it", 
    "This mattress pad was perfect size when installing over a 3 inch mattress topper. Fit perfectly over the topper and the mattress itself, keeping everything nice and snug so nothing slides around. Very satisfied with price, quality and so far its holding up very well. So smooth and soft you won't want to put a sheet on your bed lol, could barely get my daughter out of my bed and will probably be purchasing one for her.", 
    "Not the nicest mattress pad I have ever bought but was well worth the price for our guest room. I would not want this to be my primary mattress pad.", 
    "this is very soft and comfitable", 
    "I bought this a long time ago, so long ago I can't remember the date, but it still looks good and fits my mattress well. It is king sized and is a bear to deal with after it has been washed, getting it on the clothes line or in the dryer is tough because it is so big. I guess I should be sleeping on a twin sized bed.", 
    "Nothing special, not plush, but a good thick mattress pad. Great for the price.", 
    "I love this mattress pad. I had been using foam mattress toppers to extend the life of my 26-year-old mattress. But they crush and shift and have to be replaced more often than I would like. This is truly like sleeping on a cloud.", 
    "This is a wonderful mattress topper/pad. Very high quality. Has the stretchy part that wraps fully around the mattress so it doesn't come loose. Very soft and plush. Definitely money well spent!", 
    "Yup, it's a mattress pad alright. It's actually for the guest room bed so we haven't personally slept on it, but it fits well and it arrived quickly, so I have no complaints.", 
    "Would recommend this product!", 
    "Purchased the pad for my queen bed in the guest bedroom. It looks and feels great, fits perfectly and seems plush. I had one overnight guest sleep on it so far. She complemented on how comfortable she slept. We have a good quality mattress to begin with so I can not judge how much of a difference it would make on a mattress that is not comfortable to begin with.", 
    "Very comfortable and easily fits over my pillowtop mattress!", 
    "This really helped on a futon mattress that we own and all our overnight guests say it is super comfy and now they sleep great! It was much needed because futon mattress was a little dense and firm and this really adds some cushioning and comfort! Great buy and thinking of getting one for our bed!", 
    "Bought it as a gift for a friend, and they love it.", 
    "Fantastic,comfy addition to a mattress that is firmer than you might want.", 
    "comfortable and WASHES WELL!", 
    "Bought this for a guest room and am very pleased with it. Am using it by itself, without a box spring, and it is substantial enough and quite comfortable.", 
    "Very nice. As described and then some. Comfortable. Thick. Deep corner pockets that hug the mattress. No slippage. Very happy.", 
    "It barely does anything. Not worth the money", 
    "This is very nice but would be better to use in cold seasons as it does keep you warm", 
    "We recently purchased a $**** mattress that was perfect in the store but after one nights sleep I realized it was far too firm and woke so sore I slept on the couch. I ordered this pad in addition to a memory foam topper and now the bed is absolutely perfect.", 
    "This is really a high quality purchase. I'm so glad we got it!", 
    "Fast shipping and love it!!!!!", 
    "Fits well and soft would recommend", 
    "Great fit. Washed well and easy to put on the bed.Adds a nice feeling of plushness under the bottom sheet.", 
    "A little thicker than we required but good quality.", 
    "decent quality for the money not noisy soft and helps make the mattress more comfortable.", 
    "The Pillowtop Pad was much better than my previous purchase from a local department store. It is soft and cushy and I have less back pain since using it. I was apprehensive reading some of the reviews, but glad I trusted my gut.", 
    "this is an outstanding mattress pad; very pleased!", 
    "This is worth the cost if you arent quite ready for a new mattress.", 
    "Not nearly as full as the picture appears. I expected better quality.", 
    "Love this mattress pad. Made the mattress feel plush and so much more comfortable. I highly recommend this item!", 
    "Good quality, with a fairly plush top. Fits our mattress perfectly.", 
    "wonderful plush mattress pad which I am using in my guest room. Arrived quickly and as described.", 
    "Comfortable. Exactly what my don requested as a gift. Perfect fit to the mattress", 
    "I have to say that this is the most comfortable mattress pad I have ever owned. I can easily sleep on it in the event the fitted sheet slips off...it is that soft. We use it over a pillow top mattress, so I did not buy it for the thickness of the pad but for the softness.", 
    "This topper has good reviews for a reason. It is a great product. It has made myvery firm mattress feel softer. It is not \"hot\" during sleep. It washes very well. I purchased mine after seeing my daughters. She loves hers as well.", 
    "This was exactly what we were looking for. Soft, plush and good quality.", 
    "This is well worth the price. Well made and soft. Works great with my Temperpedic mattress.", 
    "I received a firm mattress from a friend. It's a very expensive mattress but just wasn't comfortable to me. Before I bought a new mattress I ordered this. Huge difference, it feels like a plush mattress.", 
    "Nice deep pocket mattress pad. I have not noticed any problems yet. Coupled w/my new mattress set, it's like sleeping on a marshmallow.", 
    "Have bought several of these. They are so comfortable and have had many compliments", 
    "The top is ok, but the fabric on the sides is too flimsy and streatchy. I was looking for a tighter fit that wouldn't allow the top to slide on the bed. I don't think the light weight nylon sides will hold up as long as the top of the mattress pad.", 
    "Perfect fit. Soft and lightly padded for comfort. I would buy again.", 
    "I really love the feel of this mattress pad. It's squishy around the edge, it's so soft on top, and I've not had any problems keeping it on the bed because the corner pockets are deep enough to put under the mattress and that holds it in place. I recommend this to anyone wanting to add just a little softness to their sleeping surface. My mattress is firm, but I wanted just a little softness without having to go the whole memory foam topper route. This totally works for me.", 
    "Love this mattress pad. I would purchase this item again. Nice and fluffy.", 
    "It's n my bed and I love it..It makes for a omfortable sleep", 
    "Very soft material. It adds bonus to the mattress, but do not expect something that will make your bed pillowy.", 
    "A Good Buy. Adds padding, without wadding up, to a very hard matress. Fits and holds place over the matress.", 
    "We`'re so pleased because it even fits over our waterbed! That's a challenge. That's the reason we can never purchase sheet SETS. Contour sheets don't fit. This mattress pad DOES fit. Thank you.", 
    "The pad slides around on the bed because the material is slick feeling and the part that tucks in as too slick and won't stay tucked in", 
    "Very comfortable at the right price. I said it all no more to say. If I have to say more no rating will be completed.", 
    "Meet all of my expectoration's, product are great i bought altogether three i rune first one so i need to buy another one LOVE IT! LOVE IT! Totally recommend to anyone at least give it a try if you love soft martial.:):)", 
    "Fits well. I also order 3 inch memory foam pad from Overstock, together they made my bed like sleeping on a cloud Much cheaper than getting a new mattress.", 
    "I bought this fro a Christmas present for my daughter, I have taken it out and I know she will be pleased. I laid on it and felt the softness. Feels like a bed of feather. very cloud like. Happy with the price and product. Will probably buy another fro my bed as well.", 
    "Very good quality, exactly what I wanted. Fits well, is soft", 
    "mattress pad feels comfy, but does not stay in place, I have tucked in the corners tight but in the morning it's kind off the sides.", 
    "I bought these mattress pads for a couple of beds that really should have new mattress they are the best mattress pads I have bought in some time------now I can wait for awhile before I buy the new mattress!", 
    "Buying this mattress pad is one of the smartest things I've ever done, it's comfortable, and stays in place, very nice!", 
    "It depends on what you are looking for. I wish this was a thicker pillow top", 
    "Bought this to use on an older mattress in my guest bedroom. It is extremely comfortable and wouldn't hesitate to buy again.", 
    "For the price I paid, I expected more \"cushiness\" than this pad provided. The edges are puffy and soft and the part you sleep on not so much. However, it appears durable and fits well.", 
    "Never had one of these before and never will be without one again. So cushiony and soft. Washed it once and it came out great. Fits my king size bed well. Adds such comfort to my sleep. Love it.", 
    "This was a perfect addition to my memory foam mattress. It really adds some extra added fluff to my sleeping experience.", 
    "I have used for 2 + years. This is a nice quality mattress pad, soft with a good amount of padding. Washable/dryable but evan so, after 2+ years of use. I always change my mattress pad.", 
    "This Mattress Pad was just what I was looking for. It gives the mattress a little added softness. I have had this item on my bed for a few yrs and I still sleep like a baby when it's on the mattress.", 
    "It wasn't as thick as I thought it would be but it is comfortable.", 
    "I was hoping this would be sort of \"plush\" as the name implies -- instead, it's really just a very slightly \"padded\" mattress pad that I could've got for much less anywhere else. When I tried it, it was like there was no difference in feeling of comfort. I was also really frustrated that O.com charged me $*.** (16.5% of cost) to return it and I will use other sites in the future 'cause they send a return label (as do most places now) and don't charge for return. A very very discouraging experience all around, especially my first order with Overstock. .", 
    "This in on our CalKing bed that we sleep on everyday. It is as great today as when I bought it over a year ago. I couldn't be happier!", 
    "It's comfy and beats buying a new mattress. This was a prefect fix to an old mattress.", 
    "This met my expectations and was exactly what I wanted to add a little softness to my hard mattress. Good quality", 
    "Like sleeping on a cloud. Quality fabric. I would reccomend this mattress pad first before I invested in a new mattress!", 
    "It has held together very well after washing and is soft but does not stay in place over the memory foam topper.", 
    "This is like sleeping on a cloud!!! Perfect addition to my bedding.", 
    "The mattress pad fit perfectly and was of good quality. I would purchase the same item again.", 
    "Its nice, but only about one inch thick, from the photo I thought it would be much thicker. The top side is soft flannel, but the underneath is a very hard stiff fabric.", 
    "This is the best martress pad cover we have ever had! Super soft and padded without bunching. Would never buy another except this", 
    "Mattress pad is alot thinner than it appeared in picture and it barely made any difference. I would not recommend this mattress pad to anyone.", 
    "I was looking for a mattress cover / topper combo that would give enough of a cushion to soften the firm mattress but not so much (like a pad) that we would sink into it. This works great, good quality, good fit and about 1/2\" to 3/4\" padding.", 
    "Although this mattress cover isn't quite as thick as I would like, it still made a nice fluffy difference. I did A LOT of looking before purchasing this one. I don't believe you will find a better one out there at such a great price!! I would buy this product again.", 
    "I was very happy with the quality and price of this pad.", 
    "I bought this mattress topper for my husband who complains about our hard mattress. Ever since I put it on, he has never slept in and now he does. I bought a king for our king size bed and it fit perfectly. I must admit it offers great comfort, doesn't move or bunch up, and I like it so much that I will be getting toppers for other beds in the house. Definitely a good buy and worth every penny!", 
    "This is the most comfortable, plush mattress topper I've ever owned. It's like sleeping on a cloud. I've already recommended it to others.", 
    "This thing was out of stock for almost 4 months and I was pretty bummed out the day I went to order it. When I saw it was back in stock I grabbed one based on all the positive reviews. All I can say is I sleep like a rock. I have a cheap firm mattress and the 4\" memory foam wasn't cutting it. After I added this which fit perfectly over the memory foam, I instantly noticed a difference. One being that I don't get out of bed on time. I'm supposed to be to work in 8 minutes and I'm not even in the shower. But overstock sent me this reminder email so I feel I have to spread the word. Thumbs up.", 
    "The mattress pad is AWESOME....like sleeping in a cloud and bed is warmer too Would definitely recommend to anybody", 
    "The first night I slept on this mattress pad I couldn't believe how comfortable it was. After a month, I still love it, it made a real difference on my too firm mattress.", 
    "Its a nice, plush, cushiony mattress pad. What they DIDNT say was that the top layer of it was like a brushed polyester FUR type material! NOT ideal for a heat-eminating sleeper like myself!! Its great if you want a winter mattress cover to help keep the heat in, but not good at all if you want a cool nights sleep!", 
    "Perfect fit and protects the mattress very well. I recommend this.", 
    "Excellent service, quick shipping and great communication. This mattress pad is really very nice -- very soft and comfortable.", 
    "Soft, cushy and luxurious. Great buy for the money.", 
    "This mattress pad exceeded my expectation. It very lofty and soft!", 
    "It is hard to put a reguak queen sized sheet over it. It is so hot you sweat In your sleep. Wouldn't recommend or purchase again.", 
    "A well made, and very full matress pad. I put this over a foam pad which is on top of my matress, and it still fit so it is very deep. Also, the surface is plush, like velour or suede, so the sheets stay in place. It was on sale, and very UNDERPRICED compared to other matress pads I had looked at. This is a top quality product and appears to be very durable. I am extremely satisfied with this, and would recommend this most highly!!!!", 
    "Very comfortable. It is like sleeping in a hug! I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again for myself or as a gift!", 
    "This pillow top is very plush and turned our old mattress instantly into a pillow top and make our bed so wonderful. Fits our queen size mattress like a glove and prevents our sheets from slipping off during the night.", 
    "This is a great pad, very soft and warm, I've been sleeping great since I put it on.", 
    "Our super firm mattress seemed too hard for me. My husband was skeptical about ordering a new mattress cover to make it more comfortable. It turned out incredibly soft and comfortable for both of us. I love it.", 
    "Loved it so much I am ordering more! Put it on top a latex mattress deep pocket cal king and it fits like a dream!", 
    "Talkabout plush!! Very comfortable and the Cal King size was perfect. You sure can't go wrong wth this item and a very good price to boot!", 
    "This mattress pad far exceeded my expectations. it's very soft and makes my bed feel like I'm laying on 3 down comforters, I'm thrilled with it. Want to get them as gifts this year.", 
    "This is a very high quality & plush mattress pad. It has by far the most stuffing/padding of any mattress pad that I've ever had. It did make my bed noticeably softer. The sides are very 'elasticy' so it should fit many different size mattresses. Mine is a pillow top about 9\" thick and it fit well. I don't have much more of a detailed review because unfortunately like an idiot I put it in the dryer and melted the underside of the mattress pad, ruining it. So be careful if you wash it, I'd recommend air dry only. I did replace it with the Sateen 300 thread count pad which was about half the price. That one is pretty standard but not nearly as nice as this one. If I could do it again I'd probably pay more and get this one.", 
    "Love the mattress pad. Very comfy and fits my king bed wonderfully. I sleep much better. Wish i would have ordered one for all the beds. Would be great on the spare beds! Guest will sleep better!", 
    "This pad fits really well -- nice, deep sides. It also stays in place better than a lot of pads I have tried in the past. Very comfortable on top of our memory foam mattress!", 
    "Just love it, very comfy! Fit nice on the bed also.", 
    "This is one of the nicest mattress pads we have ever had. The ony drawback is that it would probably do best on a thicker mattress than what we have as far as staying in place. Aside from that, it did make our bed more luxurious to sleep on and we are not disappointed in the product by any means.", 
    "This product added just a little mmore comfort to our bed. It does side around a little bit on our queen bed, but happy with purchase.", 
    "Mattress pad is very soft and fit snug. My sleep has greatly improved. Highly recommend.", 
    "I love this mattress pad. We have a very old, uncomfortable guest room mattress and we were having company over to stay, so I knew I needed to get something to make it a little more comfy for our guests! I ordered this and received it within just a few days. It is so thick and a great price for the quality. I had looked at others in stores that were almost 100 dollars. Great deal and highly recommended!", 
    "I opted for a new mattress pad instead of a new mattress on my 11 year old mattress and it feels like new! The pad is very plush and soft. I would sleep on it alone. only thing was that it slides around a bit but that might be attributed to the user.", 
    "I recently purchased a Serta 8 inch memory foam mattress from O.co and felt it was just a little too firm for my liking. I bought this mattress pad and it is now PERFECT! So soft and snuggly I never want to get out and fall easily to sleep every night. The corner pockets are very deep and would accomodate a much thicker mattress but stay on very well.", 
    "This is even better than the description. Love ity..Will be ordering for my other beds asap!!!!!", 
    "Very plush pillow top. Fit bed extremely well, although bring new it's never been washed yet. So far so good.", 
    "The Mattress is very comfortable . I would recommend this product to anybody.", 
    "This fits my mattress perfectly. The top is very plush and soft to the touch.", 
    "i was very happy with this mattress pad...i am hoping that it will wash up better than the last mattress pad i purchased", 
    "I ordered this mattress pad based upon the overwhelmingly stellar reviews of the product. I mean, with over 300+ people saying this has been wonderful, how can I go wrong? Well, I can now say that 300+ can be certainly wrong abt a product. I was so excited to receive it in the mail, as was my husband. The very same day, we put it on our bed, with expectations that the bed will be plush and like a hotel's bed. Wrong. I noticed that in many spots, there were lumps in the pad, like the cotton had balled up in those places. Also, at the head of the bed, the mattress pad would slide down, leaving a large swath of area with no support. My husband would have to put another pillow in that area to make up for the lack of coverage. All in all, I was very disappointed with the mattress pad - I am sorry I spent the money to buy it in the first place. Also, because of Overstock.com's poor return policy, we will be keeping the pad instead of returning it. We will continue to look for the right, plush, soft mattress pad from a dept store that we will be able to try out and then return if we aren't satisfied.", 
    "I was very disappointed when I got the mattress topper out of the box and it was so thin. It was only about 1/2 inch thick. It has cords that run through it that are uncomfortable too. The only positive thing about this is that it has a soft material on top.", 
    "A very nice mattress pad at an exceptional price! Will likely buy more for other beds in our home.", 
    "love this mattress cover, it its very well on a deep mattress, stays put and makes the bed so much more comfortable", 
    "This mattress pad was everything I hoped it would be. I have an old matress and was looking for a matress pad with extra cushioning. This matress pad was exactly what I needed. My bed feels so much more comfortable!!", 
    "I read as amny reviews as possible, after all it has 4.8 stars out of 5, and I guess, I bought into it. The pillow top is heavenly to sleep on. My mattress is a bit on the firm side, and this topper just makes you want to curl up in bed. The only draw back, is its size, it's a one size fits all, so it moves, so every week, when I change my sheets, I have to adjust it. Overall, however, I do not regret the purchase...", 
    "This is the best mattress pad I have ever purchased. The microfiber is so comfortable you can actually tell thru the sheets (and I have high quality sheets). It makes my sleep number bed even more comfortable. It's very cushioned, but not hot. This mattress pad is well worth the money I paid for it.", 
    "This mattress pad is very comfortable. I was very impressed by the quality for the price. Have used it for about a month and still very happy with the product.", 
    "I LOVE IT AND IT ADDED COMFORT TO MY BED AND YES IT IS PERFECT.", 
    "This mattress pad is perfect what it is intended. It has a nice soft cushion to it and it fits the bed perfectly. I've washed it a couple of times and it's kept it's shape very well.", 
    "Purchased the product after reading other reviews. I already have a 3\" foam mattress and was looking for a little more spillow type softness. This helped but not to the degree that I thought. It fit perfectly even with the 3\" foam matress and seems to stay in place. I would buy another topper but probably try to find one with a bit more pillow. Overall it is a good buy.", 
    "Outstanding quality and plush as described. Very pleased.", 
    "I love this mattress pad. It is very soft and almost snuggley. It is especially welcome on a cold winter night, but never too warm in the summer. The only minus is that it makes tucking in the contoured sheets a lot more difficult because of the extra bulk. All in all, It is a good purchase.", 
    "Renewed our mattress and we LOVE it! Very cushy. Bought more for the kids beds after trying it on ours.", 
    "We opted for a standard king bed mattress without all the bells & whistles that can be found. It was just a bit too hard. My husband didn't want to buy a foam topper so I thought I would try this mattress pad. It made the bed just right providing just a bit of cushion but not so you sink out of sight. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "Well made product that works well on mattresses that need a little extra cushioning.", 
    "This mattress pad is very thick and very good quality. I'm very pleased with the purchase.", 
    "The pillow top itself is great, but it tends to slide around a lot on the mattress. Would be better if it had a different backing or less material on the sides.", 
    "I put my mattress pad over my 12 inch foam/memory foam mattress which had developed impressions from sleeping on it for a couple of years. It is a real bed enhancer and has made our bed comfortable like a fine pillow top mattress would. I followed the advice of the reviewer who operated a bed and breakfast in the home and am glad I did.", 
    "My mattress is about 9 years old and I was starting to feel I wanted something softer. This product definitely made my bed more comfortable and at a very reasonable price, especially compared to purchasing a whole new mattress. I feel sure I can get quite a few more years out of the mattress now and am sleeping much better!", 
    "I run a BnB from my home and have tried out a number of Pillow Top pads from Overstock. Some are ok, some are really stretching it to call themselves a Pillow Top (they arrive flat and continue being flat). But this is the one that remains the best. It's extraordinarily soft to the touch, retains its thick plush bounce, and truly adds comfort to sleeping. It also cleans easily from stains. The fact that this is below $$$ is an additional surprise.", 
    "This mattress pad is comfortable and the stitching is not lumpy feeling. It made our somewhat hard mattress much easier to sleep on. I combined it with an old down comforter and now have a very soft \"pillow top\"! My daughter recommended it to me and I would certainly recommend it to others.", 
    "Super cushy on my mattress. Helps me sleep wonderfully.A great price for this article.", 
    "This mattress pad was a great buy,and a VERY worthwhile purchase.Soft enough to do the job,without being to mushy.Well worth the price and shipping was super fast!I am going to buy one for our guest room.", 
    "this mattress pad is comfy and fits well on my queen sized mattress. i recommend this product for anyone looking to supplement a firm mattress.", 
    "Exactly as described....very happy with this item. I have never had a problem with anything I have purchased through Overstock. It's good to have a reliable source when I need one.", 
    "I was leary at first about ordered this mattress top, but my girl friend recently bought and really enjoyed it. So then I decided to purchase one. It is one of the best decisions I have made as far as bedding I have made. It is soft, comfortable and dare I say inviting to want to go to bed. I have a great top mattress but after a few years of sleeping on it, it needed a little boost. This mattress top will revive your mattress. Just one word of warning.....measure your mattress and the new top to make sure your fitted/flat mattress sheet will fit. Luckily my sheets were made to fit. Go out and buy this item!!!!", 
    "What a disappointment - couldn't tell the difference between this and the \"generic\" mattress pad I replaced. Not the luxury I had hoped for at all. I have trouble with my hip and can't sleep on my side so was looking for something to help with that - this isn't it. I kept it because it's fresh and new and i'll use the old one on the Aerobed when I use it for overflow guests.", 
    "Very pleasantly surprised..So soft and comfy..really fits the deep 17 inch pockets of my bed..easy to put on, so I am very pleased...........quality material...very nice! We love it!", 
    "I have fibromyalgia so finding a comfortable mattress is hard for me. I have had the mattress pad for just a few weeks and so far it seems to be farily comfortable. I was hoping for a little bit more in the comfort level. But, in all fairness to the mattress pad, I believe having fibromyalgia may have had something to do with that. That being said, it has been a good addition to my mattress. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend to family and friends.", 
    "We love it. It was great quality and fit the mattress well. The bed was so comgy I had to buy my daughter one.", 
    "Its a really nice mattress pad but it always slides down towards the bottom. This is my first mattress pad so I dont know if thats normal or not, but really comfortable", 
    "Rec'd the mattress cover and really like it. I let it air out for several days before placing it on the bed and it really has made our bed much more comfortable. You can feel the seams of the squares but after sleeping on it a few nights, those seem to have smoothed out. Would definitely recommend this product to others and will be purchasing another one for the guest bed.", 
    "no more mattress pad searching. so happy about it i might get another one.", 
    "I didn't expect this much comfort for the price. It stays on the mattress well, very comfortable!! Worth every penny!!", 
    "Great quality, super soft and fluffy! We're very happy with this atop out new Swiss Lux mattress!", 
    "This is a great product!. While considering replacing our mattress we decided to first try an upscale mattress pad. This pad did the trick. It's very comfortable temp-wise and adds a nice pillow-top layer. We're very happy with this. The pockets are more than adequate for fitting over the mattress. I echo other reviewers regarding its care. I take it to a laundry mat where the washers and dryers are adequately sized to accomodate the pad. The cleaning/drying results have matched the sleeping comfort--5 star.", 
    "Product is exactly as expected - soft and comfortable on the bed.", 
    "Soft and snuggly mattress pad. I was especially pleased to find that the fitted corners are extremely generous. We bought this mattress pad to cover a 4\" memory foam mattress topper, and I fully expected that any mattress pad we bought would pop off the corners by morning. No danger of that with this mattress pad... they give you what you need to cover a foam topper and a deep mattress. Love this purchase!", 
    "I purchased a firm mattress 5 years ago and this mattress pad makes it so much more comfortable. It makes a tremendous difference, and it is like sleeping on a cloud. I used to wake up with stiffness and aches from sleeping in the wrong position (or so I thought) but not any more. It is also a good fit for my queen bed, and is not too small for the mattress, like some mattress pads are. I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a more restful sleep and a more comfortable bed .", 
    "This really transformed a hard mattress to one of great comfort. I was far happier with this than I expected to be!", 
    "I ordered this mattress cover for my son's bed and it is thick enough to make a noticeable improvement in both warmth and cushion. I was struck by how plush (true to the name of the product!) the top surface is. It's almost a shame to have to put a sheet on over the cover, it's so soft! I liked this product enough that I bought another for my bed, which is a pillow top, and the elastic skirt fit around the mattress easily.", 
    "This has helped immensely in \"softening\" an otherwise hard mattress. I would highly recommend this product for anyone needing support from a firm mattress, but the cushioning this top provides.", 
    "A very soft and puffy mattress pad adds to the comfort of our queen size bed. Fits welll and has a very generous tuck in to keep it in place.", 
    "This mattress pad appears to be well made and is a good fit for the mattress. It is very soft and the material breaths well. I would recommend this product", 
    "this has to be the most over the top matress pad there is. like other reviewers have noted the pad is super soft almost feels like flannel and dense. I cannot believe there is a better buy for the money.The cal-king fits perfectly and has deep pockets for 18-22 inch mattress. it stays in place well and does not slide around.it really feels like sleeping on a cloud!", 
    "This item is well made and plenty plush. It even keeps my mattress feeling a little warmer when I first get in bed at night.", 
    "haven't slept on this yet. I actually just got it today but so far, what i see i love. Put it on the bed and yeah it definately would fit a deep mattress. Anyway it is so soft don't really want to put the sheets on. It did give a little plush to my bed and makes the bed look great. will try it out tonight. Looking for a good night of sleep.", 
    "We are delighted with our new mattress pad. It is SO SOFT! We are sleeping much better! We couldn't be happier. It has extended the life of our old mattress!", 
    "This is a great pillow top and a real value at its price. Does not QUITE fit on my mattress correctly and could use a touch more stuffing, but for $xx bucks its a steal.", 
    "I have a temperpedic classic mattress on a platform bed. It's quite wonderful, BUT needed a little softness to be perfect. I wanted a pillow top but not a giant addition to the bed. This product was just right. It didn't elevate the bed too much but gave a cloud like feeling to the support of the temperpedic. The fit was fine, the quality of the fabric was excellent ,the price was amazing. I am thoroughly satisfied. The Overstock order and delivery was flawless.. I probably should have bought 2", 
    "This is simply the best thing you can do to pimp your bed! My husband loves it! It's is terribly soft and cushy. It helps keep the sheets on the bed too.", 
    "We purchased this new matress pad after our old one began to tear and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! It's like sleeping on a cloud--so soft and comfy! I think it will help us get a couple more years out of our mattress!", 
    "very good buy made a good mattress even better! Was not sure I wanted it but glad I spent the money", 
    "My husband and I spent $1800 on a mattress and have hated it. I saw the great price and $1 shipping and thought hey let's give it a try. Slept better immediately. I am not ready to invest in a new mattress but this was a great way to make the current one work for us.", 
    "I was looking for something that was a bit more packed and thick. The picture shows it as being tight, and fully packed. That's not the case though. It's very plush, and you sink down into it. I would not recommend this pillow top if you need something firm.", 
    "Love this mattress pad , it is so cozy, actualy much nicer than what I was expecting!", 
    "I really like this mattress topper; good fit, and definitely improved the quality of my mattress. The only not-so-perfect part is that it adds just enough girth to the mattress to make my sheets barely fit (and I mean I spent 10 minutes struggling to make the fitted sheet fit over all four corners). Still, great buy.", 
    "This is the softest mattress pad I have ever owned! I absolutely love it! I purchased it for a mattress that is a bit too firm and it provides the exact comfort level I was looking for.", 
    "This pillow top is amazing - I bought it and put it on my bed over the mattress and a memory foam pad. My bed has never been so comfortable! My only problem is that it is hard to get out of bed in the morning!", 
    "The king will not fit in my washer, but that isn't a big deal. I'll go to a laundry-mat or drop off to their service. It is very plush on its surface and just right in its thickness- not too thin, not too thick. It stays well on the bed. (My sheets come off the matress.) My friend just purchased the same matress in a queen and wants the same cover.", 
    "LOL... I've never had a mattress pad that was soooo soft! which is kinda cool, but then ya' put the sheets over it, I've got a really firm mattress, so this pad gives a little \"pillowy\" effect.. adds to the comfort.", 
    "I love it! So soft and comfortable. Great value. Anyone who's slept in my bed tells me how much more comfortable than theirs it is.", 
    "Love love love this mattress pad! Soft and comfortable! I've been sleeping better than ever since having received it!", 
    "So glad I read the reviews before I ordered this item because everyone was correct. It's so super soft, ten times better than the more expensive one we had on our bed!!", 
    "Just what we needed! Very comfortable -perfect size. My first purchase on Overstock - love it!", 
    "This mattress pad is a dream. The microfiber material on top of the pad is very soft to the touch. I almost want to sleep on it without sheets. My husband likes a softer mattress and I prefer firm. We bought a firm plush mattress and put this pillow top pad on top, and both couldn't be happier.", 
    "Excellent product. Comfortable and easy to put on/take off.", 
    "I am very happy with the quality and the price of this mattress pad. Not only is it thick and well made, but the velour fabric of the top is an added bonus - it keeps the sheets from sliding around. We are using this mattress pad on our sleeper sofa to improve the comfort of the mattress.", 
    "This is a wonderfully plush mattress pad. I think anyone would enjoy it.", 
    "Absolutely loved this product as it gave our somewhat firm matteress more softness and was extremely comfy.", 
    "This is so soft, washes well and adds so much comfort to the bed and I would have given it a 5 star review if it wasn't for the fact that it slides from bed. I have an oversized mattress and use it with a day bed. When sitting on bed the mattress pad moves quite a bit so I am constantly readjusting.", 
    "I bought this to go over the top of the Bodipedic 10\" mattress and add a little \"plush\" to the firm mattress. This mattress pad is so soft and plush that it repels liquids. Contrary to some of the other reviews mine does not shift around. Then again the cover on the mattress is not slick and probably a little on the tacky side. My only complaint is that I can feel some of the seams under my sheet. It's not annoying in any way when I sleep, but it is enough to knock a star off. I do wish it was a little thicker. None the less I am pleased with the product.", 
    "Wow, it's super-soft! I fell in love with the way it feels, so much so that the first night I put it on my bed, I decided not to put my fitted sheet over it, it is so soft.", 
    "I would agree with the other reviews that said this is a great addition to a Tempurpedic/Memory Foam mattress. We have a Tempurpedic and this added just the right amount of softness to make it the most comfortable bed around. The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because it does indeed fit loosely and slides around a little bit; nothing that would deter me from recommending it though, I just put it back in its place each time I change the sheets.", 
    "We loved this pad..very soft..I would watch the price when I order another one. I feel I could get something similiar cheaper. Otherwise nice pad!", 
    "I put this on top of a Temperpedic mattress just to plush it up a bit. I am not sure I can tell much of a difference, really. The sides are VERY stretchy, so actually allow the mattress pad to slide around a bit, and I have to pull it down once in a while. But over all, it's OK, and I am glad I have done the most for my sleeping comfort that I can.", 
    "This mattress pad is the nicest I have ever owned. It is really like wrapping your self in a pile of kittens or puppies. Absolutely heaven.", 
    "Very comfortable but it does not stay in place. Constantly must be readjusted on the bed, otherwise excellent.", 
    "Was skeptical but after getting it and sleeping on it the very first night we were extremely pleased. It fits out Tempur-Pedic very well and keept the heat generated by the mattress from getting to our bodies. We were using the mattress cover recommend by the mattress store to use on the Tempus-Pedic that was supposed to keep us cool. NOT. This product is nice and soft, cool and a very welcome addition to our bed.", 
    "It's super comfortable. If you wash it, make sure you tumble dry on low heat. If you dry it on a high setting it gets all funky.", 
    "I bought this for my firm mattress hoping that it would be softer and not so harsh on my back. When it came I took it out of the package and it felt very cushion-y. However when i put it on my bed, it didn't do any difference. I would not recommend this to my friends...", 
    "Very plush, doesn't \"scoot\" around on the mattress. Slightly large, even on my pillowtop mattress, but I just tucked the sides/ends in deeper. Would purchase again.", 
    "I washed this product in a washing machine that was not functioning correctly. The product was immediately destroyed. I purchased another one and was able to use it for a while. It added a good amount of padding to my bed which was helpful for my sore back. Unfortunately, I had to wash. It came out of the wash (from a new machine) intact. I put it into the dryer and it has holes in it now. I followed the directions on the product for care of the product. I will not buy another of these.", 
    "We had found that our temperpedic mattress was hurting our joints and were looking for something to improve the situation. This mattess cover has made a significant difference, and our joints are grateful. A review by another customer had addressed this same situation and found this cover really helped. We agree.", 
    "Soft and fluffy. Very large pockets, in fact almost too large for my mattress. I haven't washed it yet so I have no idea how it will hold up. Overall I am very pleased.", 
    "This mattress pad is soft and cushy, but does not do a lot to change the feel of our existing very hard mattress. We will probably buy a foam pad to put underneath. Good value for the money, nice quality.", 
    "This pad is maybe two inches thick, and compresses quickly when you sit / lie on it. It's great to make your mattress a little softer, but it does not make up for not having a pillow-top mattress, as we had hoped.", 
    "Absolutely great. Wonderful to sleep on. Excellent buy at nearly half the price these are in the regular stores.", 
    "I all ready had a great memory foam mattress I was sleeping on, but I just wanted it to be a little softer on the top. This pillow top did the trick and then some. It fits perfectly and is spectacularly comfortable. I would recommend especially to memory foam matress owners, but to everyone would just like a little extra softness in thier matress. Truly awesome.", 
    "First a big THANK YOU to the person who recommended this for use over a tempurpedic mattress that was causing soreness. I too, find my tempurpedic too frim , while me husband loves it. This product is a lifesaver. It is soft and comfortable for me, with the mattress firmness beneath for him. A perfect solution. It moves a bit on our queen size bed, but I just smooth it out when I make the bed in the morning. Like sleeping on a cloud...", 
    "I have a mattress that I am trying to improve. This worked quite nicely. It is comfy and makes a good mattress topper. I like that it stays in place. The \"pockets\" are deep enough that I could put my down filled pad under it, and the sides and top didn't pop up. After trying it both ways, I finally put my down filled mattress pad on top of this one because I had become used to the down, but it was just a matter of preference because it worked fine either way. I liked it well enough that I purchased another one for my daughter and her husband.", 
    "I received the microplush pillow top mattress pad just as promised. It fit perfectly on my queen size mattress. The only problem is that the part that fits around the mattress is very stretchy and tends to move around alot thus making the mattress topper change position as well. It's a minor problem because I really love the plushness of the mattress pad. It's so comfortable that it's hard to get out of bed in the morning. I'm very happy with my purchase.", 
    "the mattress pad is comfortable and adds that little extra softness to my extra firm mattress. The pad seems to stretch more than I anticipated however. It would have gotten a five star rating if it held it's form to the mattress better.", 
    "Very please with the purchase of the Microplush Mattress Pad. My bed was too hard and I wasn't getting a good night sleep on it. This Pad is plenty soft and now my bed feels like on of the expensive bed you get in a good hotel.", 
    "This mattress pad made our bed feel like the Westin's Heavenly Bed without the pricetag! We love it - it's so comfortable. I washed it and it didn't change in size or consistency. Highly recommend this product!", 
    "This has to be the most comfortable mattress pad I've ever slept on! It is so thick and soft, easy to wash and care for. The only thing is that it does shift a bit, but I don't feel that it's a big problem.", 
    "great product. as expected...going to buy another for my daughters bed.", 
    "At first, I thought that it wasn't very fluffy but it seemed to fluff up over the first few days of use. Perhaps it needed to be out of the packaging for a while. It does shift a bit over time but it is not problematic - I just retuck when I change the sheets. Very nice and comfortable...particularly for the price!", 
    "This luxurious mattress pad is wonderful. It was purchased to improve the quality of sleep for my mother. I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I love it. It is so soft, and is makes the bed really nice to sleep on. I have washed it. It does really well. I would definitely recommend this product. You can feel how soft it is even with the sheets on.", 
    "The pillow top was very nice and soft. The only thing is that is moves around on the top of my bed. It's not snug around my mattress.", 
    "I bought this microplush pillowtop matteress cover for my adult daughter. She says is fits the bed well, and gives her matteress the softer feel that she wanted. She is very pleased with it", 
    "We have a GREAT mattress--a Tempurpedic--and have had no issues until recently. After being gone for about a month and sleeping on different softer mattresses, I experienced hip and leg aches after sleeping at home. After reading the reviews on this mattress pad I ordered it! It's GREAT. It provides just enough cushion, while allowing our Tempurpedic to do its job, too. It fits nicely over the mattress and our sheets fit fine over the mattress pad AND mattress! AND--no more hip and leg aches in the mornings! GREAT PRODUCT. Washable,too!", 
    "I bought this mattress pad because of the reviews and was really surprised. It is very comfortable and makes my old mattress bearable. The shipping on this item was very quick and I would definitely recomend this mattress pad.", 
    "Very soft and comfortable, stays centered on mattress, would purchase again or recommend.", 
    "We have a memory foam mattress which we love but it's quite firm. I ordered this pad for the cushioning effect and it's wonderful! Now we have the best of both worlds and sleep very well.", 
    "I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS MATRESS PAD EXCEPT GET IT YOU WON'T BE SORRY IT IS SO COMFY I LOVE TO JUMP INTO BED. I ENDED UP ORDERING TWO. YOU WON'T B SORRY!!!", 
    "I have about 3 inches of memory foam on my mattress, and I needed something softer. I saw this and took a chance. It is so comfortable, stays in place very nicely, and has the perfect deep pockets to tuck in. You don't really feel the edge that is raised, at least I don't, but, then again I haven't slept so well on something. It is really nice for me because I have fibromyalgia, and it seems that getting something soft for the bed in a huge goal for most of us. I highly recommend this mattress pad. And it was a great value!", 
    "This mattress pad exceeded my expectations. Very comfortable, soft. I'd purchase one for every bed in my house. Stretches over the deep mattress very well. Money well spent!", 
    "Outstanding product. Very comfortable and good price.", 
    "I bought this mattress pad for my daughter who is away at college. Her queen size mattress was very uncomfortable. She said she could feel the springs. I ordered this mattress pad and had it delivered to her. She absolutely loves it.. She said her sleep has been sweet. She loved it so much, I decided to order one for myself and I have a very good mattress, but just want to try it because she loves it. I rate this 5 stars from easy order process, to shipping and delivery to experiencing the actual product. All five stars... Thanks Overstock!", 
    "this is so very comfortible, it feels like a new mattress. Well worth the money.", 
    "Excellant quality, price was great and it is so comfortable! we baought it to got with new mem foam topper and are happy happy with all our overstock purchases!", 
    "Very Comfortable pad. My husband was not sure about having a mattress pad but after sleeping on it , he loved it. I would recommend this item to anyone.", 
    "I ordered this pad on sunday and it was on my doorstop by tuesday so first, great service and delivery O! the pad is wonderful! Very soft fabric on top and it is very soft to sleep on. My husband doesn't sleep very well and last night I put it on the bed and he was able to sleep throught the night. If he can enjoy it anyone can because he is super picky! We wanted to get a new mattress but decided to try this less expensive fix first and Im sure it will make the life of our mattress last alot longer! I recomend this product completly for people who like a soft but not squishy sleep. I think the only thing I was hoping for would be if the pad itself was just a little bit thicker.", 
    "I love this mattress cover, very soft. Unfortunately, I just washed it for the first time. According to directions, which were cold water, gentle cycle. When I removed it from the washer, it had an 8\" rip with the stuffing coming out! I am so disappointed. I'm going to try to mend it when it's dry. I like to wash my mattress pad about once a month, but I'm afraid it's going to rip more. Very discouraging.", 
    "I threw this in the cart last minute because I needed a new matress cover. I was estatic when I pulled it out of the box and realized what luxurious microplush was. It fits over my feather bed wonderfully even with a deep queen. Even helps my fitted sheet fit all the way because of the smooth surface. And wow is it soft. The angels come out and sing everynight I crawl into bed. I love it. Definant recommendation and so worth the price.", 
    "I ordered this topper because my husband and I had just purchased a very expensive mattress. My husband thought he wanted a firm mattress but found out very soon he did not!! So, trying to save money I ordered this first before trying to replace our new mattress. Thank goodness...it worked great. He was like a new man. It was like having a brand new mattress. Not sure how long it will last for what we need but, for the price, it was well worth it. Give it a try before spending a lot of money on a brand new mattress.", 
    "I bought this for a guest bedroom,bed and I have had a few guest sleep on it and they all have commented on the softness of the bed. Really does feel wonderful to lie on!", 
    "This pillow top mattress pad is like sleeping on pillows but with the firmness of the mattress still there. I highly recommend this to anyone who craves true comfort!!", 
    "I ordered this because I love the quality of merchandise from Overstock. I wasn't disappointed this time either. Wonderful quality, very comfortable. We love it! It is very well made and fits perfectly. I would recommend this product to everybody; it's wonderful!", 
    "This mattress pad looked great upon arrival. Good deep pockets and felt soft. When I went to change the sheets the fabric of the mattress cover looked worned where the sheets rubbed against it. Since it was on my grandchildren's bed over Christmas vacation and the children are small, I beleive this should not have happened. It was not worth the price I paid.", 
    "These are great mattress pads. They have a nice thickness and they fit our mattresses very well. They keep you warm without becoming too hot and they are very soft, adding a nice level of comfort to one's bed. I've bought one for each bed in our house.", 
    "This was not at all what I expected. The fabric is nice, but it is not as plush as it appears to be in the picture. The filling also bunches up into each corner of the stitching and you can feel lumps.", 
    "This item is very comfortable and it made our mattress very much softer. Will purchase it again.", 
    "well satisfied on all aspects will shop again found price was right and a good buy ,", 
    "I bought this after reading the reviews, but I should have listened to the one about the HARD SEAMS!! They really are HARD and very uncomfortable! And, like the previous reviewer stated...it is every seam around each and every block in the pad! It is like they ran pvc piping around each square! My husband began having back pain after sleeping on this, so I am returning it for a refund.", 
    "Good quality but slightly less thick than I had hoped. Still a good value for the price.", 
    "I thought my memory-foam mattress (also from Overstock) was perfection, but I was *sorely* mistaken that was until I added this mattress pad. Product arrived sooner than expected; it was almost like UPS man was at my front door as soon as i hit the \"submit\" button.The product was exactly as described, fit perfectly and is one of the softest things I have touched in a long time. Would recommend to one and all...", 
    "While I do love the actual top, the fabric to tuck it under the mattress is extremely stretchy and will not stay in place, keeps untucking the fitted sheet. I've got it on a softside waterbed that has a pillowtop cover and there is way more fabric to tuck it in than even that requires. If it were on a standard bed with less movement it probably would work better but the previous pillowtop pad I had on this bed did not have the same problem.", 
    "Wow! You won't be sorry when you enhance your bed with this mattress pad. It exceeded my expectations in loft and softness. I'm upgrading all our beds now. There's nothing like a comfortable nights sleep and this MP will only improve the quality of comfort.", 
    "Not as thick as I had hoped, and kind of lumpy. Not the value I expected/", 
    "A super nice mattress topper. Cushy and very comfortable! I put it on my waterbed and it stays in place nicely.", 
    "I was very happy with over all quialty of this item far more than what i'd expected..But didn't fit the bed as i'd intented it to. so had to deal with it sagging in someplaces...would of liked it to be a little more snugged..really for very deep pocket matteress.But qulity wise very soft to the touch...Enjoying it..", 
    "Enjoyed my most recent purchase with overstock. The pillowtop mattress pad is extremely comfortable and I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.", 
    "I am very happy with my purchase! It is exactly what I wanted and was delivered to my home in just a few days!", 
    "love this matress pad!!! feels great and made the mattress much more comfortable. fits great too. would buy again and highly recommend it.", 
    "This is a great value and better quality than in the sters for less money.Very soft and thick I purchased another one after I saw the first one", 
    "I really like this pad. It's so soft and cozy. I would like to buy for everyone I know.", 
    "The micro plush fabric is nice because the sheets don't slide around on top of it. However, several of the tufted seams are pretty hard and lumpy. Fortunately, most of them are not in areas that cause discomfort when we sleep.", 
    "My husband and I are loving our microplush pillowtop mattress pads. We have adjustable (\"hospital\") XL twin beds, and it's difficult to find a lot of choices for XL twin that aren't for college dorms!! These mattress pads have enhanced our sleeping experience; they are extremely comfortable, not overly soft, but truly just right. We are very, very pleased with them. Washed them before putting them on the beds, and they were like new. I think we'll continue to be pleased with how they wear. Good construction.", 
    "Please dont buy this....I think 2 towels will do a better job..my daughter..a light weight...said this to me ! She slept on it !", 
    "GREAT PRODUCT SURE HELPS YOU GET A GREAT NIGHT'S SLEEP, APPEARS TO BE WELL MADE AND LOVE THE DEEP POCKETS.", 
    "I ordered this mattress pad based on reviews I read, but had little hope that it would even come close to, much less meet, my expectations. But, it did. This is a wonderfully soft pad and has retained its loft over the month we have been using it. Here's hoping it retains its loft for the next year as well!", 
    "a great product. value,comfort, quality, shipping and handling very fair and fast.", 
    "Pillow top pad is nice and thick. it fits beautifully over my deep mattress. I would buy it again.", 
    "I couldn't be happier with this mattress pad. We needed it for a sleeper sofa since there's not much padding on those. It was so soft and plush and we had rave reviews from our house guest. I'd been pricing these for a while - the product and value was excellent!!!", 
    "I was hesitant about the cost of this item, as I originally just wanted a mattress pad. But when it arrived, I could see it was worth every penny. It is ultra soft and cushy, with quilting so the padding doesn't bunch up during washing. One side seems water resistant. The pockets are extra deep to cover any thickness of mattress. I feel like I am sleeping on a cloud, and the mattress is well protected. A definite winner and I'd recommend this bargain to anyone.", 
    "So soft and very comfortable. Great price for the quality.", 
    "Definitely an improvement on my old mattress and a good value for the money, but I would have liked another inch of padding", 
    "I had a super hard mattress in my guest room....you could feel the springs in it! This amazingly helped the mattress. It is sooo soft & comfortable. I think I'm going to get one for my bed. Love it & def. recommend it.", 
    "This mattress cover far surpassed my expectations. It is extremely soft , well made and comfortable. could not be more pleased.", 
    "This mattress pad is super soft and thick. It does tend to bunch up a bit around the edges but just shake it out everytime you change your sheets. I think it may be too warm for the summer time but for now, on these cool night, it is really cozy.", 
    "This product has a plush and cozy feel. If you have an uncomfortable mattress this won't do the trick of making it feel like new. However, as a mattress cover it does the job well.", 
    "I bought the mattress topper for our guest room bed. My parents came to visit and loved sleeping on the bed, They thought the topper was comfortable and warm. I suggest you buy this product.", 
    "We have been using this for about 3 weeks and love it...it really is like sleeping on a cloud.", 
    "From the other reviews, I was expecting a lot more....Really isn't any better than your average mattress pad. NO added softness....and you can feel the lines in the pad through your sheets. I too wanted something that would soften my mattress, as I let my husband purchase a very firm bed. It did not do this. The thickness was not up to the description.", 
    "I have to say that this is one heck of a good topper. Ignore all comments that states that this is regular foam. This is indeed memory foam. I bought the King size on a queens size bed. You can immediately feel the different in sleeping once you lay on it. Perfectly warm for the winter but I wouldn't recommend it for the summer. I'll have to see how it is then. The smell still lingers. I tried letting it air out for 3 days but it still smell like paint or white out. Definitely worth it though. For the same price, people should get the pillow contour that comes with it if ur not looking into the twin sized mattress. I was originally thinking of getting the king size and cut it in half for 2 twin size beds.Definitely get it for the price.", 
    "I ordered this mattress pad to replace our old one. The microfiber material is heavenly. Almost makes ya wanna sleep on the bed without sheets! Once the sheets went on, I noticed how well the mattress pad kept the sheets in their place. I didn't tell hubby that I had changed out the pad. The next day, he commented that 'something was different' and he slept like a baby. Adds a nice cush. Will be ordering more for our grown kids for Christmas gifts!", 
    "I bought this for my son's dorm room and he loves it!", 
    "Very comfortable, fast delivery. We are very happy with this mattress pad. Would order the same one all over again.", 
    "Bought this to cover a pre-furnished college bed in my apartment and combined it with the eggshell topper, truly wonderful by itself or paired!", 
    "Not only is this soooo comfortable, it looks great on my bed. Love the quality, the deep pockets and the soft, soft feel.Will probably purchase another for a spare bedroom.Thanks Overstock! This is a wonderful product.", 
    "The mattress pad did the trick and provided the extra cushioning that I was looking for.", 
    "Arrived quickly and was packed tightly in plastic wrap. I unrolled it according to directions and it didn't take anytime to spring back into shape. Although the size was very very slightly irregular, it fit well and is the most comfortable sleeping mattress pad I have ever purchased. I have a very hard mattress and would wake up every morning with my back hurting. Now, I don't want to crawl out of bed in the mornings. It is so comfortable, I can't wait until bed time. It feels like a bed should feel in a plush bedroom. I have no regrets and will purchase for my other beds.", 
    "Love this matress topper, not only does make the bed the perfect bit of 'squishy' it also hold the sheets in place. LOVE IT! Hope it lasts for a long time!", 
    "I purchased this for my sofabed. My son works out of town and when he comes home, he likes to sleep on the sofa bed and watch his big screen TV in the living room. The first night after he slept on the mattress pad, he commented on how much more comfortable the bed was. I would HIGHLY recommend this product!", 
    "I have a Sleep Number bed and wanted a more \"plush\" feel than what the mattress was providing. After doing a lot of comparison shopping in stores around town and online, I chose this cover for the price and reviews. I like the velvety feel of the topper, it adds to the softness and feels nice under the fitted sheet. It stays in place - I haven't had a problem with it sliding around. The only negative would be that there is one place where I can feel what seems like excess fabric sewn into one of the seams, but it's not an annoyance. Overall, I'm happy I bought it and am glad I didn't buy a mattress pad at a higher price.", 
    "Reasonably priced combined with a prompt delivery makes this buy and great find.", 
    "We bought this mattress topper to supplement our relatively new pillowtop mattress. It feels really good, but I can't actually tell if it's that much better than our mattress alone. It's well made and fits the deep mattress well. I would recommend it, especially to someone, who wants to improve an older or hard mattress.", 
    "Good value, very comfortable, well constructed. The title can say \"an extra layer of plushness.", 
    "I bought the matress pad for my son who did not think it was necessary. After I put the pad on the bed he immediately noticed the difference. My sons comment was \" I do not want to get out of bed since it is so comfortable\". Thank you for the great price and quality of your products.", 
    "This mattress pad has made my very lumpy mattress feel comfy and inviting again without spending a great deal of money. It does require that I use deep pocket sheets.", 
    "I thought this produce would be more plush. But you get what you got for the money.", 
    "Just received this item yesterday....I love it, I am ordering one for my son!!!", 
    "While staying in a very nice hotel recently I really liked the soft plush feel of the mattress. I decided that I was going to try to duplicate that at home. I read all the reviews and decided to try this one. My wife likes it so much that we ordered another for our guest bedroom. We love the feel that it adds to the mattress.", 
    "I bought one for my bed to make it softer and my boys loved it so much I bought one for each of their beds.", 
    "We had our mattress(not from Overstock) replaced under warranty, and the new one is hard as a rock. I didn't return it because my husband likes it, but I thought I'd try to soften it up with this mattress cover. I failed. It is not soft, not lofty, and makes absolutely no difference on my cement slab of a bed.", 
    "The mattress topper I purchased was used for a waterbed. It is great. The insulating quality is so good that we do not even need to have the bed heater on. It is a very good fit and is extremely comfortable. A great product.", 
    "I brought one for my self. I love it so much I brought one for my son .It is so soft and now I don't hate my mattress", 
    "This has got to be the most comfortable mattress pad pillow tops that I have slept on. It feels like you are lying on a bed of clouds. Very comfortable. I actually bought this for a spare bed and now I am ordering one for my bed as well as my daughters bed. A great buy !!!!", 
    "I really like this mattress topper. Ver soft and comfortable.", 
    "IT IS VERY SOFT , LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. GREAT BUY . IF YOU PUT IT UNDER YOUR FITTED SHEET MAKE SURE THE SHEET HAS DEEP CORNER POCKETS OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE FIXING YOUR SHEET EVERY MORNING ON THE CORNERS.. THATS THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH IT..... OVERALL I LOVE IT!!!!!!", 
    "I love this mattress pad!! I could not be happier!!", 
    "Great purchase / very comfortable / worked well covering the our mattress and memory foam pad.", 
    "If you want a nice soft mattress cover that will cradle you in comfort, this may be your solution. The fit is great and the feel is even better. This mattress cover parallels the padded covers you'll find in fine hotels. I highly recommend it!", 
    "I bought this after buying some satin sheets that I really like from Overstock. I have a mattress protector that makes my bed run warm even with the pad I had before, so the sheets were a little thin. I love this! Its comfy and the sheets fit over it beautifully. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to improve their sleep. I've ordered the Highloft 3-inch Memory Foam Topper too. Can't wait!", 
    "We are very happy with it. It fits the mattress well and is pretty comformable. Thank you", 
    "I brought this pad to use on a memory form mattress I also purchased from Overstock. It is oh so soft and the price was very reasonable as always. I would highly recommend this to a friend.", 
    "I love this product. It is very soft and comfortable, since I have had it I enjoy every night sleep!! Great product and price!", 
    "This is an excellent mattress pad that is thick and offers a great deal of firm cushion to a worn out mattress. We used it at a camp bed and we finally had a decent night sleep!", 
    "I used this product to re-created a pillowtop mattress feel over a memory foam mattress. It goes a long way to provide a softer, more comfortable sleep surface without buying a new mattress. My only complaint is that the sheets don't stay put through the night.", 
    "The product is great and extremely comfortable! There are only two things that I would change. First, the sides that wrap around the mattress are very loose and difficult to tuck in, and second, I would add a little more padding for that \"pillowtop\" feel. Other than this I am very pleased with the quality and price and will order one again when this one gets old.", 
    "This mattress pad is wonderfully plush; we bought this for our son who is renting a house at college. I would recommend this to anyone .", 
    "My biggest sleep problem is my husband's restless legs. In addition to being a really comfortable mattress, this one prevents me from feeling his every jerk and twitch. I bought it with a pillowtop mattress pad. I bought the medium and ,as stated in other reviews, it is plenty firm. Sometimes, in the middle of the day, I think about how comfortable I'll be when I go to bed at night.", 
    "this mattress topper, fits well onto a thicker mattress, is soo super soft, you feel like you are sleeping on a cloud......so glad i purchased it", 
    "Lucky for us the dog ate our last mattress pad! We checked out quite a few and settled on this one. We are glad we did. This is the MOST comfortable pad we've ever had plus it's washable. I swear I've never slept so well.", 
    "We bought one of these for my daughter's college dorm mattress (very uncomfortable) along with a memory foam pad from overstock.com. It is amazing. We now want one of these on every bed in our house. We made her bed so soft and comfortable, she might not ever come home again. She could have a mattress made of nails, but with the memory foam and this soft mattress pad, she would never know. We love this purchase!", 
    "I put this on our bed and immediately had to lay down! I don't know what the top fabric is made out of, but I want everything I own to be this same material! So soft and fluffy you will have trouble getting out of bed. You will love this product!", 
    "I am very happy with this mattress pad. I have a pretty firm mattress, but this gives me something soft to sink into regardless. I wouldn't say that it makes the mattress itself any less firm though, which is what some of the reviews I read said. It's comfortable and the price is great. However, if you're looking for a good quality mattress pad that will last for years and provide great support, look in the next price range up.", 
    "Very soft to the touch, almost ashame that it's uner the sheets.This is a super comfortable mattress topper, it's even better than I expected.I'm sleeping like a baby on a cloud.", 
    "We absolutely love this mattress pad. It is so soft, it feels like you are sleeping on a pillow. It is also large enough to fit over our pillowtop mattress.", 
    "I needed a new mattress pad. I had looked all over and could not find one that I liked. Some were to expensive, not made well, or just not available. I was very frustrated. I saw a commercial for Overstock.com and decided to check their site. Instant success! I am very impressed with the quality of the mattress pad, the cost was in my price range and the quality service given was excellent, five stars and a \"highly recommend\" for this product and company!", 
    "The pillow top mattress pad is a great product. I would definitely reccomend this to a friend. It helped my hard mattress give a boost of plushness. Two thumbs Up!!", 
    "it's lumpy around the stitching. But soft and pillowy. We used in combination with the 4\" topper, so don't really need the pillowtop for cushion. I think i'll try something else.", 
    "I was absolutely delighted with this product. It adds definite softness to the mattress. Laying down on the bed is like floating on a cloud. You can't beat the price for the quality. It's an absolute steal! I'd reccomend this product to any one.", 
    "If you want to sleep like a baby, then capture this product for your bed. I purchased this for one of our queen size beds and I've never used a nicer mattress pad/cover. You could sleep on this without sheets and be perfectly satisfied as it's soft to the touch, unlike many mattress pad covers. I liked it so much I'm ordering more for our twin beds that are in desperate need of softness.", 
    "It's soft and squishy and I want sheets made just like the top fabric on this pad! The fabric is nice, it's pretty squishy (it could use a bit more, but compared to the other mattress pads I ran across, this one is a dream!), and it fits the bed great. Definitely worth trying! My daughter LOVES it.", 
    "I bought this as a cover for the futon when I use it (mine is a firm, not a fluffy futon)....It really made the futon more comfortable. Not as soft as memory foam, but still nice.", 
    "I love this mattress pad. It is excactly what you see in the picture; soft, comfy. The shipping was quick. This was my first experience with Overstock and will be shopping again in the future.", 
    "My mattress is super hard and I could no longer sleep on it. This microfiber pillowtop solved the problem for me and I'm back in my bed and comfy. The \"stuffing\" stays right in place due to patchwork tyoe seaming (squares) and doesn't move or lump up so you have the same pad tomorrow that you bought yesterday with consistent softness and padding all over. It will fit over sized mattresses with ease. I'm well pleased with my purchase. Excellent product.", 
    "I am such a mattress snob it isn't even funny. I put this item on my bed and said \"Oh Yea!\" Nice! I actually bought two - one for each of my king-sized beds (one master and one guest bedroom) and have not regrets what-so-ever. I'd recommend to a friend in a heartbeat!", 
    "The mattress cover is very soft and comfortable. It fits the bed well. It was much nicer than I expected.", 
    "The top is very nice and comfy but it does not fit snuggly on the mattress and is a constant struggle to keep the sheets on the bed.", 
    "This mattress pad is the best and worth every penny. Such a great bargain. It is support soft to touch and very comfortable to sleep on. You can't go wrong!", 
    "Bought it for my son's bed - tempted to take it for my own! Very thick and soft and comfortable. Love it!", 
    "We bought a 4in rejuvenator memory foam pad for our old mattress, and tho it did what it's intended for, it was just a little too stiff for our liking. So we topped it off with this mattress pad... and now our old broken-down mattress is like sleeping on a firm, yet soft cloud! We love it!!! And the pockets were actually deep enough to fit the mattress and 4 inch pad. The only problem is now my husband and I don't want to get out of bed in the morning! I definitely recommend it even if you don't have an old mattress.", 
    "Better than a new mattress, and a lot cheaper. It's also washable. I've never slept better in my life.", 
    "I purchased the padded mattress cover this past month and was pleasantly surprised at how thick it is. I would definitely recommend this mattress cover.", 
    "I purchased the pillowtop mattress pad for my daughter's birthday and she loves it. Her bed is quite firm and the product softens it nicely. She loves to sleep in and with the comfort of this product, I guess she will sleep even longer, if that's possible!", 
    "This mattress pad is thick and great to sleep on! I just washed it by hand and it came out great. Since our pad is a king size and very bulky, next time I will take it to the laudromat to a commercial size machine. I highly recommend this pad to everyone. The elastic holds the pad in place so it doesn't move around.", 
    "I bought this mattress pad for my travel trailer. I had originally purchased a foam mattress topper from overstock, but I like to sleep on my stomach and kept sinking in too far. So I put the foam topper under our thin camper mattress. My husband is a big guy and he could feel the hinges underneath the mattress to the storage unit under our bed. The pillowtop mattress pad is the perfect topper, not too thick, but thick enough to not feel the coils on the cheap camper mattresses. The bed now feels like the featherbed we slept on from a visit to an expensive luxury B & B.Would recommend this highly, as always the overstock.com price can't be beat.", 
    "Love this pillowtop mattress pad. We have a memory foam mattress that feels too hard when you lie on it, but gives great back support. This pillowtop mattress pad totally took the edge off the hardness of the mattress. Now we get a great night's sleep and feel like we are floating on a cloud! Love it!", 
    "We are using on master bed over no name memory foam. Added that extra pillowtop softness we were looking for. No complaints. Overstocks typical fast & reasonable shipping.", 
    "GREAT ADDITION TO A HARD MATTRESS. STAYS IN PLACE UNLIKE MANY OTHER PADDING OPTIONS. THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THAT IT FEELS \"KNOTTY\" IN SOME PLACES WHERE THE STITCHING INTERSECTS TO CREATE THE BAFFLED SQUARES.", 
    "I ordered this for my daughters matress that was a little worn down. She wanted a pillow top like mine and I didn't want to spend the money for a new matress. After reading tons of reviews for different pillowtop pads I decided on this one. It has plenty of cushion and stays in place. My daughter loves it. The only complaint I have and it's a small one is that it is a very deep pad and doesn't fit snug on a standard matress but would do great on a deep pocket matress. So all in all I saved several hundred dollars, which made me happy.", 
    "I love this product, it made it possible for me to get sleep in my own bed! The microplush is a wonderful bonus! I highly recommend it if you are looking for an affordable mattress pad.", 
    "This mattress topper is really thick and plush. It is also really soft (which is luxurious, but once I put a sheet over it, it doesn't make much difference). It is exactly what I wanted--something similar to a hotel pillow top mattress. It does seem to hold in heat, but that's not a big deal to us. It fits great over my mattress as well.", 
    "This is not the soft pillowy mattress pad I had hoped for. It is skimpier than described and there are actually knots of material in some of the squares that have to be smoothed out before every making of the bed. This is the first big disappointment. I have had from Overstock, but it is a big disappointment.", 
    "I was expecting more from this mattress pad, based on other reviews. While it's okay, it isn't great. It moves around under the fitted sheet because it's so big and kind of bulky. It gets lumpy in spots where it bunches up, also because it doesn't fit tight on the mattress. You can see that in the picture.It is padded for comfort but it's not anything special. I'm sure there are better mattress pads.", 
    "A great deal! Perfect for adding a little padding, comfort and softness to a childs mattress. Much less expensive than buying a whole new pillowtop mattress.", 
    "I got this mattress cover because I had slept on a pillow top mattress at a hotel and wanted to duplicate the comfort of that without spending the money to buy a whole new mattress set. Our mattress is 20 years old but is still in good condition. I put this mattress cover OVER the other one I already had to try to maximize the cushy feeling I had with the pillow top mattress. It's not quite as good as the mattress but it's not bad either. At least now I can sleep on my back without feeling the pressure on my behind that makes me uncomfortable sleeping in that position. The product has a wonderful softness sort of like suede and it is cushy to some extent. So I have to say that, for a mattress cover it's a good one and for the money a very good one.", 
    "I purchased this mattress cover because we had slept on something similar in a hotel. Since putting this on our bed at home, I have had a more restful sleep than in many months. It is very comfortalbe and makes the bed look more luxurious when made up with the comforter.", 
    "This plush pillow top mattress pad, while not really a pillow top to my mattress did add a little comfort to a rather stiff mattress. I am pleased with the quality and the added comfort. Future concern may include the breakdown of this top - will that leave the bed appearing lumpy?", 
    "Oh my gosh it is so comfortable. This has made an already comfortable bed even better. Easy to put on fits our large bed well . I highly recommend this product. You'll never want to get out of bed.", 
    "I found the pillowtop mattress pads a little disappointing. However, they were purchased for my kids and they are happy with them. The description says \"overfilled for extra comfort.\" It is not what I would consider \"overfilled.\"", 
    "This is truly a comfortable addition to my bed. Great workmanship.It fits over my older mattress cover which I am happy about. Now I want a thick feather bed.", 
    "We had a previous pillowtop pad and, for quite some time, every time one laid down on the bed, there was a noticeable \"Aaah\" experience, as the pillowtop made an appreciable improvement to the feel of the bed. Not so with this pad. This pad feels fluffy to the hand, but it flattens out under the weight of a body. [However, we got one of these pads for my 7 year old as well, and she's quite happy with it.] I think you could do better.", 
    "Daughter says it made a world of difference on her new bed which is firm!", 
    "I just got rid of a 25 yr old mattress and bought a new one. Found it to be not very comfortable so was looking for a pillowtop mattress pad. Found this one, bought it and love it! It is great quality and very comfortable. I could have just bought this and put it on my old mattress and saved $800...well maybe not, but still would recommend this pad to anyone looking for a comfy night's sleep.", 
    "Very comfortable and warm. Kinda reminds me of sleeping on my Granny's bed.", 
    "The mattress pad I ordered was for my guest room, and I had a special guest coming for a week. The bed was too hard feeling, so I wanted it to feel cozier. It does! I asked her about it and she said the bed was great- I tried it and it made the guest room much more appealing.", 
    "This was much nicer than I expected. Much higher quality than anything I could find locally and the price is exceptional considering the value and the quality. I've been using it for three weeks and there's no bunching or shifting whatsoever. I highly recommend this item.", 
    "I love this mattress pad! My husband does not. He states it makes him hot and doesn't let your body breathe. I, being cold sometimes; enjoy the warmth and the way it \"cuddles\" around your body. I would recommend it to anyone. Just the top layer alone is so soft! A truely good buy!", 
    "I ended up with two mattress pads and I'm bringing the other one back. This mattress cover is super soft and great quality", 
    "I love sleeping on this topper, it like sleeping on a big soft pillow! My only issue was that It seems like some of the stitching on the pattern was pulled or sewed improperly , with cause hard bumps in the corners! At first I wanted to send it back but then I realized how good I slept so I said \"what the heck Ill just keep it.. I serves its purpose\"", 
    "I just slept on it last night. It is so soft and comfortable I love it. totally worth the money.", 
    "For a king size mattress pad, this was a very good value for the price. It is soft and comfortable and fits a 17\" mattress.", 
    "We ordered the Microplush pillow top mattress pad for our new motorhome and it fit perfect,great quality, great comfort Jim , Boothbay Harbor Me", 
    "This mattress cover is awesome. I just love its plush feel. It's like sleeping on a cloud. My mother just happened to be over when I was putting it on the bed and she fell in love with the plush material. She's buying one for her bed too. The quality of the fabric is A+. I've had covers before where the material was quite cheap feeling for the same price. If you buy this you will not be disappointed.", 
    "I ordered this for a rock hard mattress and it definitely helped. We wanted an even softer mattress, so we added an egg crate underneath this and that has helped out to. I would recommend this for anyone looking to soften their mattress.", 
    "If you want to change how your mattress supports you, buy this mattress pad! It is dense enough it supports under your knees when lying on your back. When you roll to your side, it feels like a little nest surrounding you! My husband, NEVER sleeps an entire night in our bed. He does now! I didn't tell him when I put the new mattress pad on the bed. When he climbed into bed, all I heard was a loud \"AAAAHHH\"!!!! This product is so worth the money, and a great buy to boot!!!!! As always, Overstock delivered quickly, and represented the product honestly. I'll be back for more!!!", 
    "amazing n very comfortable", 
    "I love this microplush mattress pad! I purchased this to put on top of a 10-inch memory foam mattress that I also purchased from Overstock. The mattress itself is very comfortable, but the surface was just so flat. This mattress pad was just the ticket. It has a nice amount of loft, and the microplush feels wonderfully soft, even through the sheets. It makes my bed feel very cozy. The only minor issue is that, because it is made to accommodate even super-thick mattresses, the fabric on the sides is a little loose on my 10-inch mattress and it shifts ever so slightly over time. Not a big deal to me, but I think I might give some corner straps a try. Nonetheless, I am extremely happy with this purchase and highly recommend this comfy pad.", 
    "The cushion of the pad was nice and cozy, but the skirt part was so large and stretchy that the top immediately started slipping towards the foot of my 12\" mattress, causing the pad to wrinkle right under the shoulders. I even tried using sheet straps. No help. If you have a really large mattress it might work for you.", 
    "I purchased a new mattress that was very firm, and decided I needed to have a softer topping. It's comfortable and looks like it would cost as much as some of the more expensive products. I'm happy I purchased this item, because it has been worth it, Most mattress toppings of this quality would cost twice as much.", 
    "I ordered this to put on our queen size bed in our RV. We have slept on it twice now and it is wonderful. Would order another one if need be but I am expecting great things from this item.", 
    "Completely satisfied. Extremely comfortable. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for extra comfort in their mattress.", 
    "This is a very nice mattress pad. I highly recommend it. Nice and soft.", 
    "This is the BEST mattress cover I've ever purchased. It's thick, plush and adds comfort.", 
    "We really love the new mattress cover. We were reluctant to get a new one, because it might be uncomfortable. But this one was great and a good value.", 
    "I was hoping this pad would soften my extra firm mattress but it really doesn't. The material is very soft and comfortable. I think I will like it more when I buy a foam mattress topper to go under this. If you just want something soft to sleep on then you'll probably like it but it's not a \"pad\".", 
    "I am very impressed with this mattress pad. It is very plush. Fits my deep mattress well. Very comfortable to sleep on. I am buying my mom one too.", 
    "The picture does not do the product justice! It was exactly was I was looking for. I wanted a thick and cushy mattress pad and it really made such a difference. It was easy to put on and not bulky or heavy.I will be buying another one for my own bed soon!", 
    "Very soft and plush..Very Comfortable. We bought this to enhance our memory foam topper..it's perfect..makes our bed feel great. We sleep soundly now.", 
    "I ordered this item online and before I knew it the delivery truck was at my front door...to my delighted surprise...the mattress pad itself is really, really, really nice. The pillowtop is plump and full and the manufacturer gave plenty of 'tuck-in' room for under the mattress. I will be buying one more for myself and am purchasing another one for my daughter for her next birthday.,,,EXCELLENT PRODUCT...you won't be disappointed,", 
    "I bought this pillowtop mattress pad for my son. He wanted a bed with more comfort. This mattress pad is perfect on his king size bed and he absolutely loves it. The quality is excellent and it does not slide around on his bed. If you want your kids to go to bed on time without any hassles, buy them one of these. He can't wait to crawl into his bed each night. He sleeps so much better than he has in a long time. The quality and price is great. I would recommend this to anyone.", 
    "this is a great product for the money, very soft and comfortable great addition to any bed, only critisism is that there was on odd smell sort of plastic like the wrapping this totally disappeared after it was hund outside for a few hours. Very happy with purchase would buy again and recommend", 
    "Just as stated in previous reviews...it's wonderful. Soft, fluffy, and it doesn't bunch up in spots. Great!", 
    "I purchased this for my mother, but it was not at all comfortable - you could feel all the seams under you, and after she slept on it, it was if we never had put it on, since it flattened right out - unfortunately, it was not feasible for me to send it back either, since we had to pay shipping, and would only get back 80% of what it cost - all and all, it was one of those times that I wasted my money.", 
    "Does the job. Super soft. Nice quality. I would purchase this again at this price.", 
    "I was very satisfied with my recent purchase through overstock.com.. I priced these Mattress pads at several different retail stores and the quality and price was much better at this site. Shipping was cheap and I got my merchandise in a timely matter and packaged well.", 
    "Love this product! My husband purchased a new mattress for our ten year old daughter (which she picked out). I thought it was too firm, so I started checking at least 3 major dept. stores for a lofty mattress pad. They were all very expensive, so I decided to try online & found this one at Overstock. Price was much better than at the stores and when it arrived (very quickly), it was very high quality. My daughter loves it & sleeps like a baby. I fell asleep the other night while watching TV with her & was amazed at how comfortable it really was. Like being surounded by clouds! Great product & definitely worth the price! Love it so much I plan on ordering another for our bed.", 
    "Great way to get by with a less expensive mattress. They are super soft and the kids (teenagers) love them. Thanks!", 
    "I wanted to return this mattress pad but it cost just as much to send back. It is very loose and does not fit mattress snugly. It shifts while moving in bed making it very undesirable. It does not have a good elastic for tight grip and stretching.The loose edges causes shifting that takes away from how good this mattress pad could be. I gave it away.", 
    "I love this mattress pad. It's soft, fluffy and comfortable. The best thing about it...there is PLENTY of quality material that fits under the mattress. I highly recommend it!", 
    "The price was right. The pad is comfortable. But such a loose fit. Good for a double pillow top maybe but seems a little sloppy on a regular mattress. Go for it if you have a very thick mattress.", 
    "My son absolutely loves sleeping on this pad! I highly recommend it!", 
    "It is very soft and warm but it seem a littler smaller than full size bed. It did not cover all bed like picture. Over all it is still a good buy.", 
    "I bought this product because I stand all day at my job and it is taking a toll on my back, so I needed more softness that my hard matress, but I didn't want to go and buy a new one. The cover is very soft and comfortable and does a great job helping my back, but the only down side is all the lumps between the pockets, it really takes away from the feel and comfort. Other than that is a great value and great price.", 
    "I have a pillowtop mattress that is very comfortable. I needed a new mattress pad and thought I would try this one. The pad has deep pockets and fits perfectly. I was amazed at the difference it made from the first minute I laid down on it. You feel like you are melting into the bed. The best mattress pad! I recommend it highly.", 
    "I just recieved the matress pad today .daughterhter is autistic, and loves the feel of it.......I am ordering 4 more for my other girls before they sell out...... I use it without sheets, its the cream puffy.......i order everyday from over stock ,had bad experience with some jewlrey. ______100 stars for this ..cream puff matress pad. Thanks for this product, it will sure be a long lasting and sure fit.P FROM BOSTON MA.", 
    "Definitely one of the most comfortable matress pads I have ever had and the price was great....would highly recommend!", 
    "This cover is GREAT...It's VERY plush and VERY soft...The ONLY downside to this cover is that it slides around...So I had to use safety-pins to keep it in place.", 
    "Great value!! I purchased this to \"soften\" a firm mattress and it's wonderful! Extremely comfortable and plush. Would highly recommend.", 
    "I absolutely love this mattress pad. I bought it for my 2 year old son's bed to make it a little softer and more comfortable. I don't want to get out of his bed when I have to get him back to sleep in the middle of the night. I am planning on buying one for my bed in the very near future.I am a very happy customer, thanks.", 
    "I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN IN A HEARTBEAT! MAKES THE BED VERY COMFORTABLE. MY SON THINKS IT'S SO SOFT HE DOESN'T EVEN PUT IT UNDER THE SHEET, HE JUST SLEEPS RIGHT ON TOP OF IT.", 
    "We have an old king mattress which has no give to it all, hard as a rock. Not ready to replace at this time so the pillowtop seemed like a temporary solution. We love the fabric, the microplush feels wonderful, especially without a sheet over it. The sides and elastic is just fine and fits easily over my mattress. However, I would recommend using a sheet if you don't want to wash the topper every week or so! I wish sheets came in microplush. The cushioning does help the hard mattress, however, I went ahead and ordered the Serta eggcrate topper after about a week of just the microplush topper. We plan to use both and will try switching back and forth to see which is better on the top - the eggcrate on top of the microplush, or microplush on top of the eggcrate.", 
    "Snuggly, warm, true to size. Kitty had accident on mine so getting another + one for guest bed.Highly recommend.", 
    "You could sleep on this thing without any sheets, it's so soft! I loved it. I bought it with a memory foam topper, and my bed is a cloud. I love it. It's not as filled as i thought it would be, but it turned out to be preferable. I love this thing! And it fits my deep mattress with no problem.", 
    "Excellent! Made the bed nice and comfy. Good value and good quality.", 
    "I purchased this to help soften a mattress I already had. I love the feel of the top of it...I put my bottom sheet over it, but one could sleep right on the cover it is divine!", 
    "I love it !!! Made a firm (too hard for my back ) mattress, heavenly...The soft plushness is unbelievable, would definitely recommend it....", 
    "great sleep like a baby recommend for anyone great great", 
    "it is comfortable and fits nicely on our king sized bed. it really adds that a pillow top feel to a normally flat, rather uncomfortable bed.", 
    "I was unpleasantly surprised with the bumps and lumps in between each \"pocket\". The cover is soft, but I don't think I would have purchased it if I'd known about these irritating bumps. They are between most soft \"pockets\" and they detract from the overall soft effect of the cover.", 
    "I've been looking around for a pillow top for my king size bed and for this price the comfort and quality were great!", 
    "This mattress pad is nice and soft with alot of filling. We haven't had anyone sleep on it yet so we can't give a true review yet, but so far it's great.", 
    "Here's the thing, This product isn't BAD by any means. When I saw there was a sale on this mattress pad I read the reviews and almost ALL of them talked about how plush and wonderful it was. So I thought I couldn't lose. I love extremely plush bedding. I'm a bony person who needs padding so that I don't ache in the morning. The reviews made it seem extremely plush. I would disagree and I even have it paired with a 2\" temperpedic style foam pad. It's nice and it does a fair job, but mega-plush......no. Sorry. Maybe TWO of these plus my 2\" foam pad but one isn't quite doing it for me.", 
    "This is a nice, plush, quality mattress pad, but it is not good to use as a mattress cover. It is HUGE, which makes it impossible to wash and dry in a typical washing machine and dryer. I actually broke my washing machine trying to wash it. If you are looking for something to make your old mattress feel more comfortable, this might be it. If you are looking for something to protect a mattress that would need to be cleaned occasionally, don't make the same mistake I did. It is NOTa mattress cover...like it says...it is a PAD!!", 
    "This Mattress Pad is very soft and very cushy. However, Do not put it in a standard dryer after you wash it. The backing melts and leaves junk all over the dryer.", 
    "I have a theory. Like you, Bill Gates and the Queen of England only have 24 hours in their day. Like you, they spend approximately 8 hours of that 24 in bed. 8 hours is a full one third of one's life. All you have to do to duplicate the sleeping environment of the richest man in the world - or royalty - is to buy the most comfortable mattress - and in the case of this plush mattress pad - the most luxurious mattress cover you can afford. This mattress pad on top of our 10\" memory foam mattress is nothing short of heaven. I highly recommend it... especially at the Overstock.com discounted price. Now I am rested and can work on the other 16 hours of my day.", 
    "This pad feels like you're sleeping on a down pillow. Very comfortable! And fits the mattress very nicely. Doesn't pull up on the corners. Would highly recommend it!", 
    "I would really recommend this product. I have a new matteress which is kind of hard and instead of throwing away your new mattress this cover did a great job of making it soft.", 
    "I am especially impressed with the fabric on the sides. It keeps it place on the matress without getting askew. The fabric of the entire mattress pad is very plush.", 
    "I was very pleased with the product. I needed a mattress pad and the added microfiber was very nice. We have been using a alternative mattress topper on our regular mattress ,which gave a thicker padding. I liked the extra padding. But I did not like the fact that I had to adjust my mattress everyday. It was frustrating. But the new is suffiecient.", 
    "I would reccomend this pillowtop mattress cover to anyone. It really made a difference in my restful night sleep. I compared prices on alot of websites, but none compare with quality and price. I was hesitant to order, not seeing the fabric first...but I am glad I purchased it. It is everything I hoped it would be.", 
    "This is a great pillowtop mattress pad. It is definitely soft and plush. Fits very deep mattresses with room to spare. I definitely recommend this to anyone.", 
    "easy to put on the mattress, very comfortable, and like that it is washable", 
    "This was a purchase for an RV mattress. Although I had a memory foam topper, ( an overstock purchase), I felt the bed still needed something \"extra\" in the comfort department. I needed a mattress pad anyway so I went for this one. You can buy a more expensive one at overstock, but I can see no reason why as this one is exceptional in all departments. Of course the bed is made up with high quality sheets from overstock as well, and now I am sleeping better than ever. Even the Hubby agrees!", 
    "This plus pillowtop mattress pad is great. It's very fluffy and soft. I happen to have it over a memory foam topper, but I believe it would be fine without one.", 
    "I bought the King size first for our bed as I have arthritis in my hips and knees and this pad is amazing! I love it.I'm actually getting better sleep again. The fit for the king mattress is perfect and I like the way it tucks all the way under. The plush does not flatten out (as some do) and I liked so much, I came back and got another for the full size bed in the spare room! I would recommend this to anyone needing extra padding for their mattress, this is the best one I have purchased and believe me, I have a few others in a box not being used!!! Try it, you will not be sorry and the price is good too!", 
    "I loved this mattress pad so much, I purchased another one for our guest bedroom. It is a great purchase for an aging mattress to give it some additional life.", 
    "Super, super plush and soft. It was better than I expected!", 
    "This mattress pad is very soft. Makes you feel like you are lying on a cloud. Nice deep pocket to fit extra thick mattresses. Wish I had one for all my beds.", 
    "This is THE BEST mattress pad - We bought one for one of our guest rooms, and I quickly ordered another for the second guest room (we couldn't have our guest fighting over which bed is more comfortable!) - My husband even wants to order another one for our bed! Highly recommended!", 
    "Awesome! I've had the \"foam crate\" types before so I thought I'd give this type a try! I'm so glad I did, it's so comfortable and soft under my sheets. Fits my queen-size bed perfectly and is was just the thing my boyfriend and I needed to get a good nights' sleep.Would highly recommend!", 
    "This mattress cover adds a lot of comfort. I can't get my husband to wake up!!!", 
    "I read many reviews before I purchased this pad for my new bed so maybe I just got one of the poorly constructected ones. That being said, I have seen/used some of the much better quality pillowtop matress pads on sale at some chain stores for only slightly more money. I just figured with an original sale price of 168 this must be a great one despite the markdown. I was wrong. It looks like it will provide much more cushion than it actually does. If you want to be able to feel the difference then don't waste your money on this one.", 
    "This mattress pad far exceeded my expectations. The only things I can complain about are that the fabric is polyester (but sure doesn't feel like it; its sooo soft) ; I usually only like natural fabrics that can breath. But so far this pad has caused no discomfort from being synthetic; I was actually shocked to learn it wasn't cotton. But I did only gave it 4 stars for fabric quality because it is poly; which is cheaper. And the other drawback is that its way too big to fit into my washing machine so I will have to take it to the drycleaners or laundrymat when I need to clean it. But the great things are: I have a CA king mattress pad and this fit over it easily; no pulling and tugging. And it is SO comfortable and SO soft. Truly did turn my bed into a 5 star hotel bed! Incidentally I had just stayed at the 4 seasons hotel for the first time about a month before I got this pad for my bed...and now my bed is just as comfy! And for the price compared to other high quality mattress pads, this is a steal! I love it so much I'm thinking of getting one for my guest room. My husband loves it too; and we have differing tastes on bed firmness but both agreed this is great. If you have an old mattress or mattress that is too hard or soft, its amazing what a new mattress pad can do for it; espc one like this. I HIGHLY recommend!", 
    "Makes a big difference to the guest bed room mattress!! Now we dont' feel guilty having people sleep on it.", 
    "This is the best mattress pad I have ever owned. Would like one for every bed in the house!", 
    "The picture of this on the website does not do it credit. It is thick and luxurious, fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable to sleep on. The fitted sides are made of a closely-knit fabric that helps it fit your mattress, whatever the thickness, and stay in place. It is beautifully made.We absolutely love this. The quality of our sleep has improved since we got it and I am ordering a second one to use on the guest room futon.", 
    "Very Nice! Other family members want for their bed also!", 
    "This is a soft, plush, comfortable mattress cover. Ordinarily, a mattress cover doesn't feel this wonderful.And it doesn't make me too hot. I'm very happy with it.", 
    "I would recommend this for anyone that doesn't have some sort of mattress topper on their bed. It adds just enough fluff.", 
    "I am very pleased with this mattress pad. It is plush and very comfortable to sleep on. The price was great! I'm considering purchasing two more for my daughters bed.", 
    "I bought this for my spare bedroom where my 86 year old mother sleeps. I wanted a product to guarantee her comfort and warmth. This product did the trick. It is plushy, deep and very cozy. She says she is very comfortable and happy with the product. I want to buy one for my bed now. If you want added comfort...this is what you need.", 
    "The mattress pad fits perfectly on my cal. king bed and It never comes off the mattress like other brands. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a plush mattress pad for a very reasonable price.", 
    "I needed more padding for my child's bed that was kind of firm. This pad was just what I needed and it really help the sleepability of the bed.Much cheaper than a new mattress! Good quality workmanship and fit the bed well.", 
    "I would highly recommend this topper to anyone needing \"additional\" comfort to their mattress. I love my current mattress, but it was missing \"something\". After carefully reviewing several toppers and pads, I settled on this one. Boy did I make the perfect decision!! This topper is soft and plush. And best of all NO FEATHERS!! After being stuck by goose feathers a few times during the night, you'll seek other options. It fits my 10\" mattress perfectly and does not move or shift during the night. One of my BEST Overstock purchases yet. And it was delivered very nicely packed.", 
    "What a steal for the price, and it is thick enough to hold my sheets in place. and it is so soft to the touch, and to sleep on. it rejuvenates a mattress back to almost brand new, and I have a very tall pillow top mattress, and it way exceeded my expectations and I am truly hard to please when it comes to a bed", 
    "This topper is comfortable and soft. but you had best have snug fitting sheets to hold it in place. This thing slides all over the place and will end up sliding off the bed of your sheets are at all loose fitting. Once I put another, tight fitting mattress pad over this one it stayed in place an everything was fine.", 
    "This microplush pillow top mattress pad lives up to its name. The price was terrific as well as the quality. We also purchased the 4 down-pillow set which also are very comfortable. I enjoy getting into to bed and do not toss and turn any longer. It feels luxurious!", 
    "I loved my mattress but it needed a bit of softness. I ordered this mattress cover and absolutely love it. It is EXACTLY what I was looking for. The quality is excellent and the price was very reasonable.", 
    "This product along with the serta foam mattress topper made an old worn out mattress like brand new.", 
    "I ordered my mattress pad about 2 days after I ordered the Memory Foam Mattress that I got, and It came about a week later. I am so happy with this product, It came nicely packaged in a plastic zipper bag. It fit my mattress beautifully, you would think that it was supposed to come with the mattress.The pockets are very deep and it is made so that it fits exactly to each corner and all sides of the bed with no overlap. It is very plush, and very soft to the touch. I wish I could just sleep on it bare, but I know that it would not last very long if I did.I am very pleased with the service, the product, and My husband said that I did real good. He likes it even more than I do and that is saying alot.I will continue to purchase from overstock. I am sold, sold, sold. It is just so easy to do business with Overstock.I usually do not write reviews but I was looking forward to writing this one and the one on the Memory Foam Mattress that I just bought from Overstock.Thanks Overstock.", 
    "Before I bought this I read all the reviews. OH.......MY........WORD!!!!!!!!! This is very Plush and very well made!!! Usually mattress pads sides are made of a cheap fabric that wears out fast and rips easily, NOT THIS!! I was going to buy a foam topper and a mattress pad because they say toppers get warm. But after I read the reviews I decided to just get this pad first, I now see no reason to get the foam topper as well. Saved me couple hundred dollars! Thanks OVERSTOCK, you did it again!!!", 
    "This is the best pillow cover i've ever had. It helps my bodyaches at the end of the day. It gives me a very soft and cozy feeling.", 
    "I got this today, to put over my memory foam mattress topper, and it's very plush. I love the material, and the siding goes way down and covers not only my 4\" topper, but also my mattress, with room to spare. It feels very luxurious. I didn't expect it to be nearly this nice, for the price I paid. Great deal - I highly recommend this item.", 
    "Best night's sleep I've had in a while. Thanks O'stock......", 
    "This is a great item! It makes my bed feel like I am sleeping on a giant pillow. That is how comfortable it is. The item is a great value and I am looking at ordering another one for my Full Size Bed. The quality of the item is also well made. I highly recommend this mattress pad if you are looking for a comfortable nights rest.", 
    "and body. I was thinking of buying a foam mattress topper for comfort and a mattress cover to replace my old worn out one. This did both at a great price. Who could ask for more?", 
    "This is an awesome product that feels much more expensive than the price would indicate. The one review about the sizing of the sides is correct but you can buy clips to secure it and this is worth the hassle... feels more plush than down but is hypoallergenic!", 
    "THE MATRESS PAD IS GREAT SO SOFT,GREAT VALUE BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE AS A GIFT !", 
    "I bought this mattress pad because I was on a budget, and also because of the great reviews. I have to admit, I was leary at the size of the box, but wow, did it expand once taken out! So soft, so comfy, we LOVE it! Great Value!", 
    "I bought one and slept so well on it, that I bought two more for the other beds in my home. It is extremely comfortable to sleep on.", 
    "My daughter loves her new padded cover. It is just as comfortable as the one on a guest bed in our house that we paid double for.", 
    "I was unsure at first when the box arrived but after opening up I was amazed at the quality. Then after sleeping on it the first night I thought I was sleeping on a five star hotel bed. I'm buying four more for Christmas gifts. Highly recommended gift", 
    "This has really made a difference in the comfort level - much, much more comfortable, and I sleep better! Great product & value!", 
    "We were pleasantly surprised at the softness and quality of this mattress pad. We now call the extra guest room - the bed and breakfast room! This is quite elegant and we'll be getting another for sure!", 
    "i feel like I'm sleeping on a cloud with this mattress pad! I bought a firm mattress, too firm and needed something to soften it up a bit. The mattress pad was perfect! the microplush top is so soft and subtle. I showed my mom and she is ordering one too! Do pay special attention when washing. make sure your washer is big enough to handle this pad otherwise you may have to deal with torn/ripped material as I did. I have a top loader. If you have a top loader I would recommend taking it to the laundrymat or dry cleaners.", 
    "This is a very nice mattress pad. The plush top is so soft, I didn't want to cover it. The pockets are very generous and they're really almost too big from my little 8in. mattress. I wish it was a tiny but fluffier, but overall, I'm very happy with it and it's very comfortable. One of the seems in the baffling is thicker then the others, so I do sometimes notice a little lump when I moving around. It's towards the middle though so I rarely notice it. Would buy it again!", 
    "I bought this to add to my mattress just to make my firm mattress a little softer. LOVE IT! Quality is great and it has made a big difference in the comfort of my bed. I am buying 2 for my brother's for Christmas. Such a great deal!", 
    "Super cozy and comfy, the fleece top is luxurious, I almost don't want to put sheets over it! It could be a *little* thicker for my liking but, especially for the price, this seems to be the nicest mattress topper I've found. It's made our bed a haven.", 
    "This mattress cover makes my bed feel like I'm sleeping on a cloud. I wanted my bed to feel like that of a luxury hotel and it comes extremely close to that feeling now. I would highly recommend this mattress cover to anyone. The quality and value can't be beat! I wish I could go lay in bed now, but one must work in order to continue purchasing products of this standard.", 
    "I purchased this product to add to another pillow top mattress pad that I recently purchased. The original \"Charter Club\" product is very plush (2x the price),but I felt I wanted more volume so I got this one. I think that this product is very good as a bottom pad with the more plush on top. The combination works well. I also have a memory foan pad on the mattress. Only wish that I had purchased the pillow top mattress in the first place, well actually I did, \"Sterns and Foster\" But the pillow top made me feel like I was rolling off the edge, (not so with these), so I exchanged it for the flat top and now have added these 2 pads and foam. Almost feels like the bed at the 5 star hotel we recently stayed in at Charleston, SC.", 
    "I was expecting a nice mattres pad from the picture But I am impressed, this is much nicer and softer than I expected. I sleep very well on this pad, it is really too nice to cover with sheets.It is so soft, I feel like I am on a cloud.", 
    "This mattress pad is exactly what I was looking for a great price. It makes my bed very comfortable and inviting.", 
    "I enjoy going to bed now. It is so soft and comfortable, that I am not having trouble going to sleep. I recomend this to anyone that likes a soft bed,", 
    "I never realized how hard our guest bed was till I slept in it myself. I had a cold and didn't want to keep my husband awake. The mattress pad is excellent - super plush and very comfortable. I feel bad for previous guests in such an uncomfortable bed.", 
    "Off size. Did not fit the bed properly. All I ca say is that it was just awful.", 
    "I would recommend this product to everyone. I bought this for my daughter. She loves it and says she's sleeping better than ever. Tthe fabric is soft, it looks good and it's a great value."
