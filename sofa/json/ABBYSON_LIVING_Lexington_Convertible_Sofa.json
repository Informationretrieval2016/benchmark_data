    "The Abbyson lexington sofa is a great piece and Overstock has it for the best price delivered. Delivery was great, wand fast, assembly was super simple. The look is really modern and sleek. You'll love it, trust me...it's a great item to have in your home. Highly recommend!", 
    "Great product for the price! Looks great in person as is in the picture!!! Glad we chose this, just the right size for our bedroom. Added class to the room.", 
    "Absolutely love this sofa bed. Its not only stylish and classy but took only 10 minutes to assemble! This is a must have for the price point!", 
    "Looks great. Although not slept on yet, I am prepared for it to not be the most comfortable based on other reviews!", 
    "This is a great deal, works wonderfully in guest room.", 
    "Works out so well with middle table or sleeper.", 
    "Disappointed, thought they were black. cheap faux leather.", 
    "very nice couch. maybe a little harder than some would like, but don't like couches that one sinks into. maybe a little hard for sleeping though.", 
    "Looked nice when it arrived, but only lasted 1 year, the cover tore in several places just from sitting. Not very comfortable to sleep on.", 
    "Nice looking!! Wipe down when dirty! Perfect for my sons game room!!", 
    "I shouldn't have been surprised because the other reviewers said as much, but this couch is UNCOMFORTABLE. I'm not a princess-and-the-pea type - I've experienced my fair share of uncomfortable furniture, but this one is not worth the money I paid for it.It's uncomfortable for both just sitting on and sleeping on. It feels cheap and every time I sit down, I wonder if I might not soon break what little seat cushioning there is. I bought this couch because it was economical and it looks pretty nice. I still think that it looks nice and the fold-down arm rest is nice, but these two features cannot save it from being a regrettable purchase.", 
    "Very uncomfortable.... The seating is very hard and the material is very \"noisy\" when moving on the sofa. Fabric used on the lower back portion of the sofa is EXTREMELY thin.. already has a rip/hole in it. Pro... easy to assemble. Though I've been very happy with other purchases from Overstock, this one was a regret.", 
    "The picture is what I wanted and what I got. Easy to install and I was able to put it where i wanted it without getting anyone to help me carry it around.", 
    "It is nice quality, simple to put together, perfect to place in a small den. the color is rich. a little low to the floor if your tall", 
    "Delivered on time and an easy set up.", 
    "Does all the things I need it to do when a guest is over and stays over night! Looks good and compliments my other furniture. Cons, sturdiness is not that great!", 
    "Looks quite nice but feels relatively cheaply made. Given the price paid (<$$$), I'm quite satisfied. But I would have felt substantially ripped-off for the MSRP of ~$$$$.", 
    "I am really bummed. I bought this couch for my office. A place where sometimes we watch tv or just hang out. I also liked the option of another place for a guest to sleep. However, it is really uncomfortable. It feels like there is no inter support. When you sit on it, there is no support there. It feels like it is missing something.", 
    "Never again will i buy anything from Overstock.com. The item is cheap,", 
    "Has plastic legs that I'm sure won't last long. It's probably worth the money but don't expect to be getting a high quality long lasting comfortable couch. We got this for our kids have room. I wouldn't want it for much else.. ****** had one for the same price but a lot better quality, they just sold out before we got one"
