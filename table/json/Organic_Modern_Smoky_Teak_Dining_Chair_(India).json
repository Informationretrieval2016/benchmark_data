  "description": "Rustic and simple in design, this teak dining chair is an easy way to add a touch of style to your decor. This chair is handcrafted with reclaimed wood. With a tapered leg silhouette and 18-inch seat height, the Organic Modern Smoky Teak Dining Chair is the perfect option for getting to the table stylishly. The reclaimed teak used to hand-build the Organic Modern Smoky Teak Dining Chair originates from bridges, homes and other buildings throughout India, most dating back to the colonial era, and was salvaged prior to demolition of the structure. During the salvaging process, nails or bolts are removed from the naturally durable wood, and any large holes are patched with smaller wood pieces. Knotholes, slight cracks and indentations can be expected and do not compromise the piece\u2019s structural integrity, but rather add character to the design. Due to the construction process and materials, slight variations that enhance the piece's character should be expected. \u00a0Worldstock Country: IndiaChair Type: Dining chairsMaterial: Reclaimed woodStyle: Modern, traditional, casualAssembly: AssembledColor: BrownDimensions: 36 inches high x 20 inches wide x 18 inches deepStyleModern, TraditionalMaterialReclaimed WoodChair TypeDining ChairsWorldstock CountryIndiaAssemblyAssembledColorBrown"
