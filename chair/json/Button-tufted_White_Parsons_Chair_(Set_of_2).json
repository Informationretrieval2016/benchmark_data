    "I am simply thrilled with the price I paid for an extremely better product than I had seen elsewhere! I have had so many complements on the 6 white parson chairs that now sit around the table my father built for me. They are sturdy and simple to assemble... my 8yr old and I did all 6 chairs in about 2hrs...and we were not hurrying... the chairs have much more comfortable padding than many I have sat in and the high back is so wonderful for the style and feel! These chairs were a bit more than another sale I was considering purchasing from and I'm so glad that I didn't buy those....because the Bossa chairs are a better product and i know they will be more durable. I may even grab some slipcovers to give the room another look and to protect the chairs between use. They get a huge thumbs up from me!!!!", 
    "This is a true white, exactly what I had been looking for. Pretty easy to put together, 4 chairs took me about 30-40 minutes. The price was definitely a key factor for me, I looked everywhere for a true white, leather chair. They may not be real leather, but they look awesome! I am extremely happy with my purchase :-)", 
    "I bought these chairs for my modern study! They sit on either side of our large black desks and they look amazing. They were larger than I expected - which made me happy! They are comfortable enough, they allow us to sit at our computers for hours to get homework done - and they look WAY better than ugly computer chairs! They feel great, look great, are comfortable! And I promise I looked EVERYWHERE for a better deal. It isn't happening, these prices cannot be beat.", 
    "Very happy with the chairs! I ordered a different chair previously and they were a little small for a normal table. I ended up using them in the kids rooms. These are perfect.", 
    "I LOVE THESE CHAIRS MY DAUGHTER PUT THEM TOGETHER IN ABOUT 10 MIM A CHAIR THEY LOOK GREAT SO EASY TO CLEAN JUST JUST WIPE ITS SO COOL TO HAVE SOME BEAUTIFUL WHITE CHAIRS WITH CHILDREN.", 
    "I recommed these chair to anybody looking for real leather chairs. These chair are very white with the button very visible. I have another piece of white leather furiture that goes perfect with the chairs. I recommend these chair.", 
    "So, i decided to redecorate my dining room, mostly because i HATED my DR chairs. but, the whole thing snowballed. I was looking for white leather or leatherette chairs for my look. I found these on other websites long ago. They were out of stock in white all summer. Finally, in September they arrived in stock at the two other websites, but it was 100.00 more total for the six chairs i needed. When they popped up on overstock, cheaper, and with a 10% coupon I had, I knew it was time to pull the trigger. They arrived very, very quickly. I have only opened 1 of the three boxes. Each box has the two chairs in them. I put only one together so far. But, it went together well. The instructions are not great and there is one mistake in them, but it is easy to figure out and put together. The little pieces (bolts and washers) ended up all over the box and a few were missing. But, you can easily purchase replacements at the hardware store. they look EXACTLY as they do online. they are WHITE. not cream, not off white, but WHITE. they are comfortable. I do think it looks like \"leatherette\" and not leather, but they still look very good. I hope they clean easy because they are white. I am not sure if the material will last a long time. But, i do think they do the job and look good doing it, especially for the price. If there are any problems with the chairs I have not yet put together, I will update this review. overall i would recommend. Maybe not if you have kids or a very high traffic area. overall- very good!", 
    "Chairs arrived in one big box. It appeared the box had been opened before. Some of the parts were loose in the box, but all were there. There was a small hole in the lining at the bottom of one of the chairs as if someone had already attempted to put the chair together. A few of the locking spacers were already in the holes. Took over 30 minutes to install, but still easy to put together. Once completed both chairs rock. I don't know why. I made sure to tighten all the screws on both legs of the front of the chairs. That was disappointing. I know this can happen over time, but it should not happen straight out the box.", 
    "Chairs can be very expensive and I already had some good quality wood back/upholstered seat chairs that matched my dining table. So I did not want to invest a lot of money to get the look I really wanted. But at around $75 each, these were worth a try, especially given the good reviews they received. I purchased eight chairs (4 sets of 2) and the first two out of the box each had some minor flaws, so I was a little worried. But the remaining six were nearly perfect. Assembly was pretty simple, and the use of a power screwdriver sped things up greatly. They are obviously not real leather and high-end, but I'm very happy with them. They are very comfortable, much better than a wooden back, and higher seat height (20\"), which fits my table better. (Be sure to match table height with chair seat height when purchasing. Table height of 28\" needs seat height 18\"; table 30\" need 20\" chair.)", 
    "These are the most beautiful chairs ever!. My dining set looks fit for royalty. The material is beautiful and the high back with a slight tilt towards the back looks regal. The assembly is not too easy. I had a handyman put it together and it took him quite a while. Two were limping but he removed the cover underneath, adjusted the screws and the limping stopped.", 
    "Chairs arrived quickly and undamaged. They look good and the white is very white, which is a good thing. The directions say to attach the back to the cushion using the 3 shorter screws in the center first and then attaching the corners with the longer screws, but I found that if you loosely attach the back to the cushion in the corners first and then the 3 shorter screws in the center, then it is easier to align and tighten down. I will probably need to drill a few more holes and add a few more screws because the back to cushion attachment seems a bit wobbly when assembly is complete. Other than that I really like the chairs. I will have to wait and see how the white chair material and back-to-cushion strength holds out over time.", 
    "I love these chairs, easy to assemble and are comfortable to sit on, also color is white just like the picture.", 
    "Decent quality, great price. No surprises.", 
    "I purchased a set of 2 chairs, both for use with writing desks. One is for my daughter's bedroom, the other is for a built in desk in my living room. I'm really pleased with the quality, especially at such a great price! They are stylish and fit with my transitional decor. They sit a little high for use with a desk, but not so much that they make our legs touch the desk, so we're fine with them. The seat seems extra padded which makes it comfortable. The chairs will also double for extra living and dining seating when we have company. My son put them together quickly and with no problems.", 
    "Easy to assemble after you figure out which screw goes where... These are \"normal size chairs! I purchased a set prior think they were standard size and they looked like kids chairs :-/ They're easy to clean(ultimate test) I was painting walls navy and accidently touched the chair!!! wiped right off ;-) and they are pretty sturdy. Overall good buy!", 
    "I love these chairs. One came with the bolt upside down. Overstock is sending a replacement. They look better in person!!!", 
    "exactly what I had been looking for. Pretty easy to put together, The price was definitely a key factor for me, I looked everywhere for a true white, leather chair. They look awesome! I am extremely happy with my purchase", 
    "The good news is the chairs look like the picture and they are easy to assemble. The bad news is that I ordered 3 sets and put together the first two sets without any issue, but the last set included one chair that is never going to be level. Took apart that chair and measured the legs which are the same length so it seems the seat with back has to be off. I bought spacers and tried to level the chair but not the right depth. Will continue to try different spacers. I purchased a glass dining table that was sent in wrong size and it was a huge ordeal to return it with multiple calls to the oversize delivery department and the pictures to prove it was not my error. Guys I g furniture online seems like a good idea but It has bee time consuming and aggravating at best to me. Needless to say it's misersble to take apart and return furniture so we will keep the chairs and not let a guest sit in the bad one. If I had it to do again, I would go to a store and skip online furniture purchase. Not worth the hassle and I expected more when spending $$$$ for furniture.", 
    "looks great with a glass table", 
    "There was a nick in the leg otherwise I would have given these 5 stars. The quality is great and they are sturdy. Easy to assemble and comfortable. Nice detail stitching on the backs. Great price!", 
    "They were easy to assemble, really beautiful. I love the chairs, i have gotten so many compliments on these chairs from my guest. I love overstock.com.", 
    "These chairs are more than I expected for the price. They look really expensive and they are pure white. They were easy to assemble and are very comfortable. I would highly recommend if you are looking for dining room chairs they added so much class to my table and the room.", 
    "I purchased these chairs because the price was right. Unfortunately the quality was just so bad that I had to return them. Specifically the stitching on the back of the chair was messed up. Both chairs had the same problem, so it did not appear to be an isolated incident. I really needed them to work, so I has disappointed to send them back.", 
    "These chairs are just what I was looking for. I wanted a large button-tufted Parson chair, and that is exactly what I got. They were very easy to put together. I did remove the hard buttons on the bottom of the chair legs and add slip pads for hardwood. If you do have a chair that has a hard time not wobbling, just loosen the bolts and have someone sit in the chair. Then tighten the bolts with the person sitting in the chair. This keeps the chair straight so you can tighten the bolts. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Purchased these chairs to accent the white trim in my business. I wanted a simple, but classy chair and these fit the bill. I'm happy with the quality and my clients like them. They are comfortable enough for just about everyone and well constructed to accomidate my heavier clients without them feeling insecure. Putting them together was okay, shipping was fast and I think I'll have these chairs a long time as the quality will hold up well.", 
    "So much better than I expected! Seats are wide, backs are tall. Color perfect! Lov them in my kitchen. Easy to put together & delivery was so fast. I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I love these chairs. They really make my dining room pop. We purchased 6 chairs and only had trouble assembling one. I would highly recommend these chairs. My only issue was the packaging. By the time they got to my house, the boxes were beat up pretty badly. Otherwise, they looked fine.", 
    "I bought these chairs to use in my office. The are a true white, not cream. They are sturdy enough for office use. Easy assembly.", 
    "These chairs are great, the quality is very nice. They are sturdy and have a large seat and back which looks very nice for such a great price. They clean up well and were easy to put together.", 
    "I bought the chairs to add more seating and they are even more impressive in person. They give my beautifully refinished Duncan Phyfe dining room set a sleek modern look. Everyone comments on the WOW factor of the updated ook. Great investment!", 
    "All of the 4 chairs I got look good: matte white material without the cheap shine, the legs are black the seat is large enough and the back is mid-height. The major problem I had with these chair is that I once put my black leather purse on the chair seat and the color immediately transferred to the white material. I now have a seat with a permanent black purse pattern on it. Another thing, the seats are not made for sitting for long hours. I think they will do the job in an eat-in kitchen area since food stains are easy to wipe.", 
    "Love these chairs added a glamour sophisticated look to dining", 
    "I just can't say enough nice things about this totally cute desk. I am THRILLED with it and it was incredibly simple to put together.", 
    "I purchased 3 sets of these (6 chairs total) for my formal dining room. Assembly was easy. Chairs have a high-end appearance but light in weight. After hosting 3 dinner parties, 2 of them already broke when in use by our guests: (1) guest leaned back and we heard a crack - appears the wood supporting the back piece broke - it's now loose when leaning back on it (2) another guest sat down and moved the seat forward and broke one of the front leg - it now wobbles when you sit and lean forward. I'm so embarrassed by these because they gave off the bells and whistles (high-end appearance) but broke when in use by our guests! Made us look like cheap home owners!! The other 4 chairs seem to hold up for now, but I'm afraid to host any more dinner parties knowing they may break when in use by our guests.", 
    "Absolutely love my (2) white chairs for my formal dining room!", 
    "Beautiful and actually quite traditional with a fantastic modern edge. However, they aren't the highest quality. Very easy to clean but the foam is cheap for the cushion and although I'm very handy took a while to put together as the holes don't line up easily without some creative fidgeting. Also out of the 4 chairs that I purchased, 2 of them had legs1/2 inch shorter than the other legs. Easily resolvable with a couple of leg pads. Its totally not noticeable, but still a bit disappointing. Still a great deal for the price.", 
    "The seat has NO cushion. You are sitting on air. You awkwardly sink into it and not in the good way. There were screws that did not match up with the wholes and when they did they didn't screw all the way in and got stuck and wouldn't go any further. One of the legs has one of those little peg coastery thing on the bottom and it was SO off the center. It was off in the corner which would make the chair rock. I bought the chairs because of all the amazing reviews here and on other sites however they suck. The set I got was broken. :(", 
    "I'm using the chairs in my study and love the look of them. Initially the only thing I notice is that if I am wearing shorts, my leg sticks to the chair after sitting for a long time which seems to be wearing off once breaking them in. The chairs are very stylish and I do love the look of them. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I bought two sets of these chairs for our new dining room. They look exactly as they do online and they add a little touch luxury to the room. They will last us a bit, but definitely not forever. The quality is mid-grade. They look more expensive than they actually are. One of the cushion was slightly damaged, but not so severely to send back. Another chair was missing 5 of the flat washers that are suppose to come with it. I'm pretty laid back about these things, seeing as how I got a great deal of these ladies, so I will just hop over to the hardware store for replacements. Overall, these were a great purchase. You can't beat this deal.", 
    "Love the chairs, easy to put together and they look wonderful in the room. They look much more expensive then they are. There was a couple I did have to send back as they had ink marks on them but the one's I kept look fabulous.", 
    "These chairs are obviously not the same quality as real leather, but for the price, they are a very nice option. Easy to put together and shipping packaging was good. Very fast shipping time also. The seat feels a bit stiff, but not bad.", 
    "I know it's cheap but the chairs actually not usable.", 
    "The wood parts and fake leather smelled really bad. We placed them outside for 3 days to get rid of the odor but it didn't go away. Could not stand the smell so ended up donating them. They were very cheap and the quality was bad (made in China). We bought them for our office but they were not comfortable. I would not recommend these products. 2 stars for shipping fast and looking ok."
