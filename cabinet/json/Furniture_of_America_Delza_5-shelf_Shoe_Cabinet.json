  "reviews": [
    "The product is mostly MDF not wood. The fit and look is better than most other MDF product. But not worth the price.", 
    "The item looks very good after assembly. Assembly takes about 2-3 hours. The assembled unit is heavy which is good, feels very solid. Holds my size 11 shoes easily. Need to apply a little force to close the doors, but they shut perfectly. The only down side is that it is a bit pricey. I would give it a 5 star if it was around $***.", 
    "Cabinet is functionally ok, MDF construction. Color received was not color ordered! Be aware, not happy with supplier ie Overstock!", 
    "If you want no particleboard, this is not for you. At least the side panels and the bottom piece are made of particleboard. The shelves are probably MDF. The top could be solid wood but my guess is also MDF. So if you definitely want real solid wood then look elsewhere.The package when arrived is very well protected w clear wraps and bubble wraps. The pieces are intact without scratches and the hardware are sufficient in quantity. It uses cam locks and the back panel for structural stability which in the end is solid. The back panel by the way is completely finished, but the back of the side panel is not (not covered by the back panel) which I don't care at all.The assembly process does not take long, for the most part you can do it on your own but you will need another pair of hands to hold the front door when you screw the door hinges to the side panel.In the end it looks great. As a shoe cabinet it has five shelves and each can accommodate 3 pairs of shoes. If you have tall shoes you can just use four of them.I give it 5 star because of its practicality, being packaged really well, easy assembly and nice appearance. But you probably want to wait until the price comes down (it fluctuates from 250s to 290s) and use a coupon as it is not solid wood.", 
    "The piece looks very nice. Our handyman put it together and it took him several hrs to put it together. It is heavy and the shelves are wood. Thank you for carrying this. I may order more to put material.", 
    "The best cabinet shoes I bought it , I'm so happy with it", 
    "This item is not finished properly. The sides of the cabinet are not even sanded--they are raw, rough wood. While the top is sanded somewhat, it is also not finished properly. There are large gouge-type mars down the sides, and the stain/sealer is blotchy, rough, and uneven all over the piece. The louvers are only partly covered with stain. This item comes completely unassembled. I would be embarrassed to have this displayed in my home. Due to the ridiculous amount of effort it would take to repack it and haul it to a UPS store to return it, we will be relegating it to a corner in the garage for storage. Live and learn."
