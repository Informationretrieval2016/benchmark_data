    "We ordered this item, as it was the only one I found that would fit our components. Boy, are we happy with it! It arrived in perfect condition, as it was packaged better than ANYTHING we've ever ordered. Unit assembled flawlessly and it was fun to play with the different configurations possible. From boxes in the foyer, to completely assembled.... maybe 2 1/2 hours. We are VERY happy! Thank you & we WILL order from this furniture company again.", 
    "While a bit heavy (2 people recommended) it was easy and straightforward to assemble. Offers great versatility in thelength you choose to display your items. Great finish and modern look. Highly recommended......", 
    "In all of its simplicity, it still adds an understated element of drama because of the Tillman's ability to expand or change its orientation. Plus, it's the lowest bookshelf I was able to find (when placing it horizontally) and is level with the back of my 70s-style sofa. And with the numerous spaces in which to display your items, for the price it can't be beat. Word of advice. Don't be overzealous and install the feet without first placing the piece in its final location. Your first instinct is to place all of them on the largest flat surface, which is mistake since one of these surfaces will always be facing up.", 
    "Item is as described. Love how I can interchange.", 
    "Love my Shelf, I made it a TV Stand", 
    "I love this piece is very beautiful", 
    "These are easy to assemble, and make a great headboard with the extra storage we needed.", 
    "The only site that had the type and size of bookshelf I was looking for. It's really beautiful. Had a problem putting it together, though. Seems all the directions now are only pictures, no words, and the pieces were not clearly marked. Some of the pieces weren't marked at all. With some common sense, and trial and error, I managed to put them together. Just wish the directions from manufacturers would include actual directions. Nice looking, though.", 
    "I was deciding between this bookcase and a similar one on overstock.com. I decided to go with this version because the reviews for the other bookcase mentioned stickers that cover the screws. The idea of covering screw holes with stickers sounded kinda hokey to me, so I bought this version of the bookcase (not knowing what the screw covers would be like). This bookcase comes with plastic covers for the screws, so that's a step up from stickers. It was easy to put together and looks good. I took one star off for a few small nicks in the wood. Luckily they're not in conspicuous places. If needed, I suspect I could use a black sharpie pen to make them less noticeable.", 
    "I like that the two tetris \"L\" pieces can be slid apart or together, depending on how far you'd like the floor gap and the little topless shelf.The wood is also finished on all sides so you can rotate it if you want the floor opening and topless cubby to be on the opposite side.The materials for the display shelf are very good. They can hold my full weight. Unfortunately I know this because one of the pieces does not have holes in the center. The holes are about an inch away from the center of a long board, and the instructions don't say this anywhere.If you try to install this piece upside-down, two of three shelf walls will slide into place. A third one will not. If you line up that one, another shelf wall will not line up. I spent half an hour jumping up and down on the item, breaking off bits of wood until measuring the board and realizing it has to be rotated a particular way. I think this would be a simple addition to the instructions that would go a long way.", 
    "This bookshelf had pretty good instructions for assembly. I had no trouble putting it together. The items are very heavy and sturdy. The color is very dark brown. I love the versatility of the two pieces!", 
    "easy to assemble, beautiful classy look", 
    "Looks great, but bought it because of the practicality. If it ever gets boring, move it around, change it up, separate the two pieces. Excellent value.", 
    "Very easy to put together. The only issue with the product was it was slightly damaged when I received it. It was hideable so I decided to keep it anyway."
