    "This would be a very cheap looking bookshelf were I able to assemble it.. The wooden dowels to not match the holescut for them. They are also too small and slip right out of the holes. The nail holes for the back piece also do not match.If you are a carpenter, you might be able to jury rig this somehow but as for me, this bookshelf will make some veryexpensive firewood come next winter.", 
    "I found this bookcase impossible to assemble. The holes did not line up, the instructions were not helpful. It came out unstable and unusable.", 
    "This product requires \"jury rigging\" or a \"carpenter,\" if you choose to take the diagram literally and resigned to commit the product for \"expensive\" firewood.Obviously, use the holes where the dial rods fit snugly as opposed to thinking inside the box. They screwed this up for sure, but it doesn't mean the product cannot be assembled.YIKES!", 
    "I ordered this bookcase on 8/19 and did not receive until 8/30. It took an exceptionally long time for Overstock to process this order, therefore delivery was not timely. When the bookcase did arrive it was not packaged adequately as the packaging was torn during shipment and the edges of the bookcase were chipped in at least 2 places. The color of the bookcase does not look anything like the picture. The color is a light honey oak finish with lots of yellow tint. Additionally it was difficult to put together. If I had the time, I would package and send back, but I decided to keep it and put it in a room where it will not be seen. I would NOT recommend this item as a buy.", 
    "Please listen and do not waste a dime on this bookcase. The construction and machining is very poor. I have assembled a lot of furniture using the camlocks, and most are machined well such that you get the pieces together snug and secure. Not this bookcase. You can not tighten to camlocks for a snug fit because the cams pull out and the wood around it begins to splinter. It is very, very poorly measured and drilled. Also, several peices were scratched - when the box arrived, it was in horrible shape. Looked like it was dropped from an airplane. I realize it was not an expensive piece of furniture, but even at this price, it is NOT worth the money. You'd be better off going to the local Staples or whatever and buying a bookcase there. It's really a horrible bookcase in terms of build quality, machining, and what you end up with when you follow the assembly instructions. Crap.", 
    "While I was generally satisfied with the bookcase itself, it did however arrive in far less than perfect condition. If it wasn't for the fact that this book case was going in a bedroom and not out in the main part of the house I would have sent it back. While nothing was actually broken, the finish at a number of spots was rubbed off due to the box and packing materials being damaged in shipping. There were tears and holes in the box and some of the rigid packing foam was extensively broken. The bookcase I ordered was a cherry finish and the cheap marker the manufacturer included to do any needed \"minor\" touch up was brown...not a good match....besides, my required touch up was well beyond minor. Good thing I have cherry stain at home I could use to \"repair\" the finish...something I should not have had to do.Overall.....not a bad product, but lousy shipping to eastern NC.", 
    "It is a good looking durable book shelf.", 
    "I purchased 3 of these book cases and set them up end to end in my home library. They work perfectly in the space and are sturdy. My only complaint on the quality side, is that one edge on a board was slightly damaged and they will not hold up in any area where they could get bumped. Damage easily. The damaged board was easily covered with the furniture pen and isn't noticeable unless you go looking closely. For the price, it's a great value. Have had them several years and they are still working great!", 
    "These are nice shelves, but I did have issues with the edges of the shelves being chipped. Also, one big chunk taken out of a side wall. I'm choosing to ignore it since returns here are such a hassle. Also, the shelves have metal runners underneath to keep them from bowing, but mine still did even though all I have on them is paperbacks. Solid wood, which is better than some other manufacturers, but still cheap wood.", 
    "Sturdy, with very clear assembly instructions. It's just a bit cheap looking, which may not be unreasonable, since it was pretty cheap.", 
    "The weren't that easy to put together doing it by myself, so it took two of us. Once we got the hang of it we flew threw it and they look very nice.", 
    "Damaged in shipping. Big chunk out of corner of one of the shelves. Glued piece back on and it's to the back so it doesn't show. Scratches on top shelf. Brown marker included, so I guess mfg expects scratches. Assembly was easy, but it's kind of wobbley if there is nothing on the shelves. After it's stocked, it's sturdy. Looks good in a room not used very much.", 
    "Very pleased with the quality and the color matched my furniture. Although, it wasn't solid wood, you wouldn't know by looking by it. It is very heavy and will support lots of books on each shelf. I recommend it highly.", 
    "Here is my story: I am an engineer working from home and needed three bookcases to make my office look neat and put-together without spending a lot of money. I ordered two 4-shelf and one 2-shelf in the same color and style. Shipping: Horrible. The first two that arrived were damaged, and the third was slightly damaged but ok - I would say that this was caused by the very flimsy packaging. I constructed one bookcase out of the piece of three to get one non-damaged bookcase. Overstock was very nice and offered to send two new ones to replace the damaged ones. During shipping, one bookcase was listed as damaged and sent back to the manufacturer. In the end, i finally did get all three bookcases, but they are not in the best condition but i called it 'good enough'. Assembly: Not that bad, got down to 20min max. Added wood glue to dowels for extra protection. The packaging explodes onto the piece so you will need to unwrap with vacuum handy or you will have tiny white balls all over you, your house, etc. Construction: Poor. The packaging for shipment is loose and causes the pieces to smash together. This causes all the edges to be \u0093rounded\u0094 when they should be square and the veneer is peeling off. The manufacturing on these is poor as well. The last bookcase that I received even had areas filled in from where the drill didn\u0092t get the holes for the shelves in the correct location. Use: I needed these for 3-ring binders full of engineering design notes. The four shelf bookcase only fits three shelves of 3-ring binders, leaving the fourth self to be only about 4-5inches tall. I am using the \u0093little\u0094 shelf for plans but could have really used the extra room. In summary, I would not recommend these to anyone. I am not a proponent of big-box-store furniture but in this case you might as well! They do look nice with all the books/notebooks on them and picture frames on top strategically place to hide the damaged areas.", 
    "It arrived very quickly and is a good deal. Highly recommended", 
    "Product as described. Decent product for the price.", 
    "This bookcase is nice looking for the money. The color of the wood is very rich and the finish is beautifully done making it look like a more expensive piece of furniture. It displays books very nicely and fits more books that you would think. I bought six of these to fill up our library and they look very professional. I would recommend these to any one.", 
    "The assembly was easy, once you sorted through the 15 pieces, although a bit tricky for one person. However, the shelves were easily dented/scratched when unit was turned upside down (on carpeted surface) to install backing. The unit is a beautiful addition to the room.", 
    "Mahogany color is great, easy to put together and it looks expensive. I got two originally, plan to get one more.", 
    "Bookcase comes as described. Instructions were a little difficult to figure out at times, but I was still able to assemble by myself in one hour.", 
    "This particular item arrived with a damage to the top of the unit. Since the space I was using it in plus the trouble of repacking and shipping I decided to keep it. If it had not been for the damaged spot I would have given it a 5 star + rating.", 
    "This bookshelf was great! It has a very sturdy back, unlike some bookshelves and was easy to put together. It looks exactly like the picture. Very prompt delivery as well.", 
    "The bookcase was easy to order and arrived very quickly. It was easy to assemble, is strongly built, and looks perfect in our home which is mostly filled with antique furnitue. The inclusion of the touch up pen is a good idea.", 
    "Good quality, a cut above many boxed/assembly required bookcases, and delivered right to my door. What could be better? Assembly instructions have a few small mistakes, but if you've assembled this type of product before you will have no trouble. Good value, fast delivery, easy assembly (hammer and phillips-head screwdriver). You might want to put some white glue in when the wooden dowels are inserted for extra strength.", 
    "Good enough quality and appearance for the money. It has a look of having cost more than it did.", 
    "Excellent product , I purchased several for a field office . The price was great , have someone that is handy to put them together . They create a professional look without the expense .", 
    "Great value. Used to organize video game equipment, games, movies, etc in TV room. Attractive looking and perfect for what we wanted. Very satisfied with our purchase.", 
    "Good product, now have two of them, support much weight from books without sagging.", 
    "I think this was a reject from the manufactor, I got two top panel, when I should hav e I top and i bottom, the rail holes were off. There is no telphone or web site or e-mail to tell somebody about the mistakes, they made. This bookcase was not worth the money, now I have to drill a new hole , it won't look like the picture that I was buying from.", 
    "There are not many 4-shelf bookcases out there. This one is beautiful and very high quality!", 
    "We bought two of these bookcases to divide an office from a sitting room. We put plants and a few books on the top of them and they look very nice. They are very elegant looking and do not look cheap. We are very happy with them and are glad that we bought them.", 
    "Look great but the quality not that great. Also, the shipping is horrible!"
