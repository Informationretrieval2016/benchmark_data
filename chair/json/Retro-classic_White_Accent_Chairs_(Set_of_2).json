    "I spent a couple of months researching this dowel base Eames chair and the rocker version, almost pulling the trigger on the Modernica fiberglass proximity ($400!). The chairs arrived in 2 days, shipping cost a couple of bucks, and I put them together easily (4 hex screws, not complicated). General Measurements are very close to Eames specs listed on Design Within Reach's site (about a half an inch shy on all dimensions). Plastic Shell Finish is pure bright white, with subtle grained texture (similar to an egg's shell) only noticeable close up. The product detail shot looks to be more of a glossy finish, but the actual product is definitely matte. Very subtly \"dimpling\" noticed on seat above 4 areas where base attaches to the chair. This may very well be the case with the legit Eames version too, but worth mentioning. Base is adequate. Black cross beams with silver hex screws. The wooden dowel legs are fine- lighter colored birch (or perhaps \"beech\") finish. Glossy-ness of urethane finish on the wood is slightly cheap looking- though it should dull with time. I've seen the White on White version in person, and it excels in this area- their version features a more rich looking walnut, but is more expensive. Black floor caps on bottom of legs are nothing to write home about. All in all, a good product for the money.", 
    "I love these chairs! They are a great looking knock off of a midcentury modern icon that I could never afford otherwise. Shipping was super fast, simple to put together (I think it took less than 10 minutes to assemble both) and they are also quite comfortable. One bit of info that is not included in the description is that the arm hieght is 26\" off the floor. I took a risk ordering these not knowing if they would fit undr my dining table or not and fortunatley, they work for me.", 
    "Love these chairs. And everyone else does too! They are knock offs of more expensive chairs, but are great quality. I am a heavy guy - about 230lbs - and these fit me nicely and are super strong. However I have noticed that I need to tighten the screws about once every couple of months - so save that allen wrench! Also, as they are white, they get dirty fast. I live in NYC and it's dusty. These get grey after about a month. I get a bucket of water, wash cloth and some Mr. Clean, and it does the trick. You will need to do this about once a month or so. But again you will have that with any white furniture. These chairs do not creak, wobble or make noises. They do have some dimples around the leg areas on two of the chairs but I did look at the more expensive kind and they have the same. Oh and every designer on HGTV is now using chairs like these.", 
    "I love these chairs. They are super comfortable and easy to clean, which is exactly what we were looking for with active boys at home! The original Eames chairs are fiberglass with a smooth finish, but these reproductions are molded plastic with a very slight texture. When they get dirty I need to use a little elbow grease to get them completely clean, whereas the fiberglass wipes off super easy. Still, for the price they are well worth it. I would buy them again!", 
    "Good quality, sturdy chairs. The holes for the legs didn't line up perfectly, but it wasn't a big deal and we made it fit pretty quickly. Great design at a fraction of the cost! I would go with the armless chairs if you're looking for desk chairs as the arms are pretty high and would not fit under my desk. Awesome chairs overall!", 
    "We purchased these chairs for our mid-century modern bonus room, hoping they would stand up to a lot of use by teenagers. We have not been disappointed! These are exceptionally sturdy chairs. Much higher quality than we anticipated for the price, and they look marvelous, too!", 
    "Unfortunately, there were a number of defects in workmanship of this product. There were several scratches on the chair legs, even though the box was not damaged -- the legs should have been wrapped individually before packing. Also, several of the screws in the legs were uneven and not well installed, and the holes where the screws were placed had rough edges in spots. It was a shame that the product had these defects, as I was really looking forward to having the chairs in my home. The seats appeared to be in fine condition, although I never got so far as to attempt to attached the seats to the legs because of the previously mentioned defects. I decided not to try to order replacements as I feared that the replacements would be defective as well. I did appreciate that Overstock covered the cost of return shipping. Too bad -- perhaps I was just unlucky.", 
    "These accent chairs are working perfectly in my mod apartment. They are lightweight yet sturdy and add just the right touch of classic, retro style. The ergonomic seat is very comfortable and I can sit in these chairs for hours at a time. The assembly is surprisingly easy. Soon after the packages arrived, these chairs were ready to rock and roll! Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "These chairs are super cute! I wouldn't say they are high quality, but they are good enough for the price and one would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between these and Eames chairs. They are also quite comfortable. I added a fluffy white bolster pillow to each and placed them in an all white guest room. They're perfect!", 
    "Minutes to essemble them - no manual or tools needed. Pair looks great - the plastic does not have a smoothed shiny surface which I think would be esthetically even more pleasing. The best part: they are really comfortable. Used it for hours sitting at my desk.", 
    "First off, I bought this gift as an anniversary gift for my wonderfully artistic girlfriend. I bought it two weeks early thinking that there would be no problem. I was told that the shipment would be at my door no later than June 29. Instead, I watched the tracking notification not be updated for over 5 days. Afterwards, I saw it move at a snail's pace from Illinois to Illinois for several more days, until it finally arrived over a week after it was promised, and a day AFTER our anniversary. However, I that is not my biggest complaint. Prolonged shipping sucks, but let's be honest, crap like that happens all the time. What got me really irate, was after I excitedly opened the package, I found that the chairs are RED, and not the advertised WHITE. I mean, what the heck? This is not McDonald's or Target; I do not want RED eames chairs. I want the WHITE ones as shown. It's funny that I can't even find an option for these freakish monstrosities sitting in my living room. Now I have to pay extra money out of my pocket, to wait another two weeks for it to get to Illinois, for them to look over my order for another week, to then ship out the correct chair for another two weeks. Thus giving me a grand total of 5 weeks, extra shipping cost, and a whole mess of bull crap to deal with. I would not recommend buying this, unless you don't mind red pieces of bull crap festering on your living room floor.", 
    "I bought these two chairs to be used in our home office as an alternative to traditional desk/computer chairs; 'a great decision! The chairs look great, they're reasonably sturdy (I weigh 150 lbs), and are very comfortable with good support. The assembly was quick and easy. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "These will not fool anyone! The plastic feels looks and feels nothing like the orignal fiberglass, they just look cheap, also they are EXTREMLY short, the seat depth is barely at knee height, they are about 30 inches from top to bottom- child sized!", 
    "This is the first review I have ever written, but I depend so much on reviews that I wanted to write one. The reviews for this chair were amazingly high, since the actual product is HORRIBLE. I love the Eames style and the retro look, but this takes that look and puts a trailer trash cheap lawn chair take on it. It's actually more shameful since the style is so beautiful and classic to put a plastic flimsy top on it. Either the other reviews are rigged, or they are not even mildly discerning customers. If you are hoping for a look in spite of quality, this is not the product you're going to get it with.", 
    "Ive ordered similar chairs from overstock, the set of 4 white ones, the rocking chair, and they were great and easy to assemble, However, this set was so difficult to assemble since the screws didnt fit properly and when i tried to force the screws in, one of the bolts got stripped and i wasnt able to screw it down, was only able to get about 85%......however, it seems sturdy enough. I hope they last", 
    "While I've had tons of success ordering on o.co-- products come quickly, are USUALLY great quality, and guest service is on point-- this time was the exception. You totally get what you paid for with these chairs, the price seems \"too good to be true\", but the quality matches what you pay. Champagne taste, light beer quality. Stoppers on the bottom of the legs where plastic and completely scratched like the chair had been used, splinters along wooden legs and where screw inserts where. White plastic appears glossy and smooth on line, but what you get is flat, pebbly (ikea like) cheap plastic. I am not a picky person, but more than anything was let down, the only reason I kept them was to avoid the hassle of returning two chairs and a 30 pound box... They will not be kept in a common area of the house like the show piece I had intended them to be.", 
    "These chairs are great knock-offs for those without a lot of money. The problems with it are as following: 1. The moulded plastic is a little flimsy and can get you nervous about breaking and 2. the holes for mounting the legs onto the seat were terribly done. One of them wasn't fully bored our so a screw is just hanging halfway out of the hole. Not great for something you are putting your whole body weight on. All in all, not a bad product, but be ready to get what you paid for.", 
    "These chairs perfectly paired up with my 2black leather chairs I purchased from O. Love them! They are wonderful in my Salon in the reception room", 
    "I am very happy with my purchase. It is perfect for my midcentury decor. If you have a heavier family member not the best purchase, although I have had no problems with the chairs, the plastic might be too flimsy for a large person", 
    "I live in a condo above a DWR and they have they original versions of these chairs at $400/each. They are very nice. I thought I would save a ton of money and buy they knock-offs. I want to complain, but I really can't at the price. The are very similar from afar, but the quality of the plastic molding is definitely not the same. Overall, as in most things in life, you get what you pay for.", 
    "Two words for this great replication of classic mid-century modern design: dope chairs. Good quality, good looks, great price. Do it my friends and you'll be jamming to some fusion rock in no time...Mork will be jealous that Mindy will be kicking in in these smooth operators, and you will for sure be a winner in life again. Hope in your Delorean and get some of these asap. peace", 
    "Very cheap quality and certainly not worth nearly $200. Each chair is worth $30 max! The chairs are made out of cheap, soft plastic. I was expecting them to be hard and sturdy for the price, but nope! p.s. Assembly was a bear and a bit confusing.", 
    "Nice, comfortable BUT you have to tighten the screws every few days... I don't think they will hold up past a year.", 
    "Great price, but construction was not as good as the last set I purchased through Overstock. Holes were not deep enough for connecting the legs.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful. Look much more expensive than they are. I've noticed some issues with 'static electricity' - could just be my office environment - but often find hair and other lint 'stuck' on them. Have also needed to re-tighten the hex bolts on occasion. So keep the small tool that comes with them!", 
    "...but terrible execution. The company sent me the chairs, but forgot to include the screws/bolts required to connect the legs with the seat of the chair. Now, I am still waiting to receive them. Overstock is so close to excellence, but then falls WAY back when things like this happen. The chairs look good, but I cannot attest for their 'seat-ability'.", 
    "These chairs are perfect for my dining room table. I wanted the Eames look but on a budget. They are pretty light and were easy to put together. They wipe clean very easily and are pretty comfortable! I would recommend!", 
    "The leg joint were not properly fitted with the chair. So while one chair is fine, the other chair is completely broken and unable to be fixed. The joint between the legs and the chair are not properly manufactured.", 
    "Terrible chairs. Quality is terrible. Looked like a childs chair. Ordered for the head of my dining room table after considering purchasing a hight quality one on advanced interiors. I do not recommend these.", 
    "Chairs looked great on line . I ordered 4 sets for a dining room. Chair will not support a 230 lb man, Collapsed. Chairs are way smaller than designer original and might be good for a child but otherwise are flimsy. I am returning them,", 
    "Don't need to think twice about these. Beautiful, comfortable, well made and easy to assemble. Accurate Eames reproduction at a very good price point.", 
    "Ii placed both chairs in front of my fire place, love the design and look. I recommended some accent pillows for the looks and more comfort.", 
    "When I first took the chairs out of the box, I was taken back by the poor quality of the plastic chairs. You'd expect the plastic part to be shiny or at least have smooth texture. It's not. It's one of those cheap, grainy plastic that you'd find on cheap plastic garden chairs. But I decided to put them together before deciding to return them, which was another mistake! It was impossible to screw in all the way to make the legs fit tightly onto the seating part of the chair. Then I realized that the holes were not drilled in deep enough for the screws to go all the way in. As a result, the chairs were flimsy and unstable. So I went and got extra washers from a hardware store and filed in the space between the seating parts and the legs of the chairs. Now the legs are screwed in tightly, and the chairs are stable. You can't tell the poor quality of the chair from far away, but you can definitely feel it when you are touching them. After experiencing defects from other products I ordered along with these chairs, I concluded that I would never again buy furnitures from Overstock. There must be reasons why they are priced so low.", 
    "the chairs are easy to put together but the holes for the screws had plastic around the threads of the hole. This made putting the screws in a couple of the holes impossible. So for one chair, i could screw in 3 of the screws for the other chair I could only screw in two. So, that chair is unstable when someone sits down. I considered shipping it back but ended up keeping the chairs. The plastic seats are low grade plastic so don't expect quality anywhere near the real chair at Design within reach.", 
    "Love these chairs and they were a great buy. Saved at least $$ getting them here compared to other sites.", 
    "My first time ordering trough OVERSTOCK, and it wont be the last. AMAZING service. I ordered my chairs and it was such an easy process. I love my chairs! I was worry about how fast they were going to deliver them ,and they came home faster then I expected! Fast shipping, great product and great service, what else can you ask for?", 
    "The chairs are a good value. They are an attractive alternative to Eames, but not made with reinforced fiberglass. Easy to assemble.", 
    "I loved this design (I didn't know it is a copy of the designer's chair) so I checked all the reviews before I ordered them. First of all, lightweight plastic chairs but it is pretty steady. Second, big and feels comfortable if you are not really used to awesome comfortable chairs. Third, roughed edged like typical Made In China quality. There is no 'Made In China' mark though. Fourth, It is fine for price. Fun looking, not wiggly yet (it will be someday!) hold my butt comfortably. I can recommend it to my friend but I should mention about the detail.", 
    "This set of Retro-classic White Accent Chairs reminds me of my funny and full of excitement young hood. As soon as I have seen them on Overstock the great memories came back. Although I have a modern living room these great classy accented retro chairs look amazing in the room. The chairs are high quality, giving a great design and comfort on affordable price. I would recommend them for every retro fan.", 
    "These chairs are ok from a distance, but the plastic is CHEAP!!! I was sad when I opened the box, I won't deny. I've seen a lot of mid-century furniture in my day and these are in the bottom tier.", 
    "Love this reproduction post modern chair. Good quality and easy to assemble", 
    "these obviously have a great eames look to them at a fraction of the price. They go together very easily and had no quality defects. I would highly recommend", 
    "People are always asking me where I got them.", 
    "For the price, these chairs are pretty hip in our TV room for the kids. Easy to assemble and they really look like the real Eames chairs.", 
    "These are nice and old school cool. they look great!", 
    "Great Chairs! I'd buy them again in a minute.", 
    "Another great experience with Overstock. My husband did need to help me put chair legs on because it was hard to line up alone. Chairs are great.", 
    "These are really cheap plastic. Mine didint come with hardware or instructions, so they will be going back. They sell the same chairs in Amazon for less (Braxton).", 
    "Roomy. Sturdy. Easy to install base to chair. Exactly as shown.", 
    "Creeky noises are heard when moving in chair..", 
    "I love love love these chairs. Great conversation starters.", 
    "Great look- a bit hard to cleanoverall nice quality & sturdy. The texture on the chair makes them a bit hard to clean", 
    "They're fashionable & affordable!! We love them!", 
    "These chairs are comfortable and really nice looking. Love them.", 
    "This is a perfect arm chair mid century anthe price it was perfect", 
    "Comfortable, perfect height and accent in so many different rooms.", 
    "These were a gift for my daughters first apartment. The style is great, they are well constructed and comfortable to sit in. They are Eames style but not made of the same material. The molded seat is plastic not fiberglass so they are less rigid without the same smooth finish, but still good style and function for the price.", 
    "Easy to assemble, looks good, and fits perfectly into the house!", 
    "these chairs are comfy and look great", 
    "Easy to assemble. Perfect.", 
    "These were easy to assemble and look great. Not sure if they will withstand everyday use by my children...will see how they hold up in 6 months.", 
    "Cute and chic but screws keep coming loose", 
    "looks good, but the screws of the leg keep falling and we have to super glue it to the base....", 
    "Easy to assemble and seem to be sturdy enough for this mom with 3 boys\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc. Wipe down easily and add a nice modern touch to our space.", 
    "Really nice!! Look greate", 
    "These worked well except they need to be constantly cleaned because of the color. Expected for white though", 
    "I love the style of these chairs. The quality is quite good too. I have 2 sets which are used around our breakfast table. I don't give five stars because we have to constantly tighten the bolts that hold the chair together. Other than that, these chairs are great.", 
    "Easy to assemble and great quality. Very sturdy, look great in any room.", 
    "Exactly as shown . really a sweet pair of chairs for my yoga office", 
    "These are great chairs. Highly recommend!", 
    "These chairs were super easy to assemble and give a nice modern flair to the room. Love them!", 
    "I was not sure about how these would work in my office around a low conference taxable but they are perfect and very sturdy and comfortable?", 
    "Look good, but very cheaply made. No one over 150 pounds can sit in them.", 
    "These were very easy to put together and resemble the original chairs. They are hard plastic so are not super comfortable but I did not expect that. They are great for adding seating to any room.", 
    "Everyone who's visited has commented on the appearance and how comfortable the chairs were. I think because of the material, visitors thought that the chairs would be too hard and not pleasant to the human form.", 
    "Chair style is awesome but the hardware included doesn't thread correctly I the bottom of the chair so it's wobbly when assembled.", 
    "Love these chairs - great modern style stepping away from black and chrome", 
    "These add sophistication my new attic apartment", 
    "sure they are replicas, but they are perfect for our needs.", 
    "the chairs were easy to assemble and very durable.", 
    "Nice chairs and okay quality. Value for money!", 
    "Good chairs for the price. Put together very easily. Only comment is the white seats have a slight texture to them making them matte instead of shiny which is what the picture sort of looks like (and also, what the originals these are copies of look like). Still worth the price very comfortable and useful in many locations.", 
    "Great looking occasional chairs. Won't take much of a beating though, so I'd keep them out of high traffic areas. Very light construction and not very sturdy.", 
    "These chairs are pretty close to the real thing except they are a bit light weight and the feet are not level when you sit it on the ground which drives me crazy trying to figue out how to level them", 
    "These are sturdy, easy to assemble, and super comfortable. They are exactly the Eames-inspired chairs I was looking for and for the price they are perfect.", 
    "Love these chairs - looking modern, very comfortable and great gray color!", 
    "Absolutely wonderful well made chairs!", 
    "I put these in my mid-century styled living room as extra seating for guests. I love how they look and have a low profile so they don't block the view out the window. They are comfortable as accent chairs, but probably not that great to watch a movie in. They're not great for tall people, but as extra seating, this is fine. The white shows dirt easily, but they can be wiped down so this isn't really an issue. They were a breeze to put together and are quite sturdy after tightening all the bolts. I'd definitely buy these again!", 
    "These are a great classic, easy to assemble, and much more comfortable than they look. This is a great buy.", 
    "They look great and were fairly easy to assemble, but mine came with no instructions. I figured it out, but there were a couple pieces I ended up not using. Still not sure what they were for!", 
    "Super high quality, easy to put together, and they look much more expensive than they are.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Look great. Shipped quickly. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "These a a great buy simple to keep clean and very easy to put together. So versatile, we use them in the kitchen or as extra seating at the dining table!", 
    "Purchased for my daughter. Half the price of other chairs, stylish, comfortable and good quality!", 
    "comfortable at a fraction of the cost of the originals. love them.", 
    "Great quality and very durable", 
    "These chairs are a great deal if you're looking for an inexpensive way to replicate the popular Eames chair.", 
    "stylish and durable seating for any room", 
    "Extremely happy with my chairs. They are good quality at a great price.", 
    "I never wrote a review when I initially got these, but I wanted to now and let people know how they have held up over two years. The screws in bottoms of both chairs have completely come out--not just the screws but the casing too. It makes them pretty much unusable. They were barely used the first year and half and just recently started using them as dining chairs. If you don't mind spending the money, just know that these are a short term purchase and are not made to last. They are also very hard to clean-especially with little kids. The texture on them makes it hard to get crayons and other \"spills\" off easily. Would not buy again.", 
    "These are beautiful chairs. But--the screws come loose on the bottom after almost every sitting. I'm a cyclist, so I always have a set of hex wrenches nearby, so it's not a big deal to adjust them every so often... Just be aware that you will have to keep tightening the bolts on a regular basis.", 
    "They're beautiful and weren't too difficult to put together. Not for heavy use or with children (pen marks aren't easy to get out) but great for dining chairs.", 
    "Love, love these chairs. Comfy, sturdy and looks like the original Eames chair . Highly recommend if you like mid century modern look. I bought 4 of these chairs for my breakfast nook with matching table.", 
    "They look awesome around our IKEA tulip table - so modern and durable and they wipe off with a sponge and look new even months after tons of dinner partys - love them.", 
    "These chairs are so comfy, look great in a sort of eclectic setting, and are made extremely well! The price was so low, I almost reconsidered, but I have been with Overstock so long, I knew they would be a quality product!", 
    "I have kids so this wasn't the smartest purchase. Look great but get dirty easily. Can stand up to lots of use by a little girl", 
    "looks awesome in my newly decorated modern living room. easy to put together and more comfortable than they look", 
    "These are truly as they appear, bright white with a slight pink tone to the wood legs. So easy to assemble, extremely comfortable and the quality is very good. They don't appear \"bargain\" at all. Paired with n aantique wood table they couldn't be more perfect.", 
    "Love these chairs! They were super easy to put together only took a few minutes!", 
    "Cute chairs for the money!", 
    "These chairs have held up great over the last 4 years. Comfortable too.", 
    "I really like the look of these and they were easy to put together. They seem like they will wear easily but look nice now.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Quick shipping.", 
    "Very comfortable and cute, retro look for my son's college apartment. Seems sturdy and comfy", 
    "I like em, they are sturdy and soundly constructed.", 
    "Very comfortable and has arm rests which we like. It also matches the white furniture and light colored wood flooring we have. I wish it would swivel, but for the price it was great!", 
    "Easy to put together, we're happy with them.", 
    "It heavy-duty plastic tops and metal rod legs. Looks neat & retro!", 
    "Difficult (but not impossible) to assemble alone, and would have been very easy to assemble with help. These chairs are comfortable -- they aren't too deep, and the curve feels very natural. I like having a little bit of an arm rest, and with a soft sheepskin throw over the back (I bought the sheepskin rug from Ikea for these), the look is textured and the chair is even more comfortable!", 
    "easy to assemble, looks like the original", 
    "Nice to the eyes. More flimsy than expected. But for the price they are a lot less than the *** chairs and do the job if you don't want to spend to much. The plastic is just not hugh quality. Not bad but when you have seen *** ones its far from the same quality. But they are much lower cost.", 
    "They are plastic, so don't be surprised ... that's what you're purchasing. They are nice design, easy assembly, look sharp. If you plan to use these for high volume use, you may want something sturdier. I use them in the bedroom as changing chairs. Great.", 
    "They look great for the price, just expected them to be bigger!", 
    "I bought these chairs for my office. They are modern and great quality. Fantastic purchase!", 
    "exactly as shown. They are perfect for my living room and clean up easily!", 
    "These chairs are made of plastic that feels cheaper than it looks. Really works well with my decor so I got over the texture. Added a couple of sheep skins on them and they look terrific. Pretty easy to put together.", 
    "We have had our chairs for two years now and still love them. They are not the high-quality of the original creators', but for the price, they are perfect. The molded plastic does have a texture to it, so if you are hoping for \"smooth\", these are not for you. Also, the plastic is somewhat flexible, which isn't a problem, but it is unlike the original fiberglass design. I would recommend these to anyone decorating their home on a budget!", 
    "Stylish, easy to assemble, good quality and a great deal. We bought the whole set for our vacation rental and they are perfect. Easy to clean too.", 
    "Love the chairs. Exactly the style I wanted. Packed well and protected. A little risky, the hardware was well wrapped but taped the the inside corner of the box. Red tape used to highlight. There were no instructions for attaching chair to legs. Rather than guess and get frustrated, I went to the Baxton Studio website for assembly instructions. This model is not there. I used DC-231A. Once I got started, I was able to assemble alone in less than 30 minutes. Great deal! Great chairs! I'll be using them as accent chairs in my home office.", 
    "Good Price. I have received the Items in the good condition and it has posted on time. one of the white plastic part has a scratch and I asked for replacement. They address my request quickly and shipped me a replacement on the timely manner. I am very happy about my shopping... I recommend Overstock because of their good costumer service", 
    "ordered 4 loved them ordered a noter 4 these are great ! well built", 
    "Easy to assemble and just the right touch to add a midcentury modern touch to our dinning area. Quality was great for the price!", 
    "Look beautiful, have held up well. I put a sheepskin throw over them for texture. The plastic is not super smooth (not like fiberglass). The construction is good, not excellent. A little tiny bit wobbly on one but overall for the price they can't be beat!", 
    "These give me the style for a great price and the light weight makes them perfect for staging.", 
    "Love everything about these chairs! So happy I purchased them as they look great in our bonus room.", 
    "Absolutely love thae chairs!! So pretty in any room!!", 
    "Have had these for a few years now, they still look as good as when we got them. We have them on wood floors and they do not leave marks. The size is nice and the look is great.", 
    "We actually put these outside by our pool and they've stood up really well! Great design! Love them", 
    "Love love love! Everyone asking where should they get them.", 
    "These are cool chairs but surprisingly hard to set up. We had trouble making the hole line up. They look nice though.", 
    "Quality, low cost replica of the original. Easy to assemble. Looks great.", 
    "Nice chair, a little low for a dinner table though.", 
    "Screws do not allign for proper installation", 
    "Great look and quality! Similar to chairs 3x the price !!", 
    "Easy to assemble (my nine yr old di it for me) and they've held up great! Clean easily with a magic eraser.", 
    "Beautiful, easy to put together, and a great price. Definitely recommend.", 
    "Chairs are supper easy to assemble and look great. Seem sturdy, but haven't had them long enough to judge yet.", 
    "These beauts are a great and affordable way to get that Eames look for less. Keep the alan wrench around to tighten the base bolts occasionally as the chairs settle into themselves. But so far we've had a dozen people sit in these - including two HUGE men (one 6'7\" and the other 350lbs!) - so far so good.", 
    "Love these chairs. Great quality, easy to put together and look fantastic in my office.", 
    "These chairs are perfect! I love everything about them. Probably my best furniture purchase from Overstock. They are easy to assemble, easy to clean, well constructed, and totally on-trend. If you like this style, you will be happy with these chairs!", 
    "Very pleased with the chairs. Easy to assemble and look just like the picture. We bought these for aesthetics but were surprised that they are fairly comfortable.", 
    "The look of the chairs are great. My only complaint is that there was a scratch on one \u2013 though it's subtle, it shows on the white. And while I was able to get the legs on one chair to fit perfectly, the second one was a challenge and the chair is now slightly off balance.", 
    "Great quality and price! These chairs are comfortable and sturdy. Beautiful addition to my dining room.", 
    "Strong, comfy, great look. Only downside is they get dirty quite easily.", 
    "They were nice looking, but the workmanship/pride in their product was not there. It's cheap, molded plastic that did not even screw together right (my holes were drilled incorrectly.) I forget the country that they came from, and perhaps that's best.", 
    "The chairs are ok. I ordered gray. Either the gray is taupe or I got the brown chairs instead. Sadly, I'm returning them and will continue my search for comfy retro basement seating.", 
    "Love these two. Sturdy and classic style.", 
    "They look way better in person than online. We used them for the study book/table and get lots of compliments on them. Definitely adds value to a space.. Really sturdy form and pretty good quality for the amazing price. This is such a steal! Looking into getting the rocker next.", 
    "Ordered these for a small area where I wanted seating to pair with a very modular small wood table. These are awesome and do the job nicely. They maintain a feeling of modern paired with an organic elemental space. Arrived quickly and surprisingly easy to assemble for this non handy single girl.", 
    "I used these chairs for extra seating in my small den. They are cool, sturdy, and comfortable. Very pleased with the purchase!", 
    "These chairs look great. Excellent value for money. Fairly straight forward to put together.", 
    "These chairs are outstanding. They are sturdy, well made and easy to clean!", 
    "I bought this set to go in my home office to replace two mismatched old rolling office chairs and I couldn't be happier. Surprisingly comfortable, sleek and stylish! They totally updated my office.", 
    "Comfortable and classic. Assembles easily. Love them!", 
    "I bought this for my daughter's new dinning table. She loves them.", 
    "These chairs were bought as a gift for my daughter. They were shipped directly to her so I have not seen the actual product. She is happy with them and the process of ordering and shipping was easy and timely.", 
    "they're a good knock-off. i recommend them...they're a good value.", 
    "I don't think you can beat this pair for the value. I decided to order them because you can't even get patio chairs for this price. I love the look!", 
    "I bought two pairs for my dinning room. They arrived so fast and quality is good. I love the look of them!", 
    "I was very excited to receive these chairs and am not disappointed. I bought them as accent chairs to my living room remodel because I wanted something modern, yet well-priced. You can't beat these chairs. For some reason mine came without instructions, but I looked them up on the internet - only because I wanted to be sure how to use the spacers versus the washers- but truly the assembly was easy and intuitive. A rigid plastic, it would seem that they might be flimsy, but not so. They are very sturdy. I'm very happy with them and they cleaned up easy with Windex when I saw a gray scuff on one of them. I highly recommend these as an attractively priced modern accent chair.", 
    "These chairs are very comfortable and fit your body nicely. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked them!", 
    "I bought these for my office because the reviews stated they were not very comfortable. Personally, I think they are comfortable, especially with a back pillow. However, most people that visit my office tell me they are a bit uncomfortable. That is okay too, it makes them get to point, arrive at a solution quickly and get right out. They look great and are pretty sturdy. I would highly recommend them for library, study, office etc.", 
    "I love these chairs! They are comfortable to sit on and look very stylish. But they are also a great price. :) That's a winning combination in my book.", 
    "Easy & quick to put together with clear instructions. Looks exactly like picture and is very light weight. Very comfortable and great for kids & adults with it's easy to clean plastic design. Fits perfectly under desk or around a table.", 
    "Lovely throw back chairs. Not exactly the most comfortable chairs but they do have a nice clean look, at least until they get dirty..Then they are not easily cleaned well, the material is slightly divited so the dirt grinds in and stays.", 
    "These chairs are really worth it. They look so modern yet they go with our eclectic style. The only problem I have is that the screws keep falling out and on occasion when I've forgot to put them back in, a guest has fallen off because the chair tipped over. Our chairs have gotten a lot of use and one already has a crack at the top of the leg... from over tightening the screw maybe.", 
    "I got these chairs a couple of days ago and since then I cannot stop looking at them. They are fabulous and very comfortable. It took me only 5 minutes to put them together (one chair comes in 2 pieces, top and bottom, with 4 screws for assembly) and the quality of the product is much much better than I expected. I read that people got their scratched or the wood didn't match or that the seat was too soft and was floppy. I am extremely happy with my pair and they are just as I expected or even better. I never saw the original chair but these look to me like a real deal. I highly recommend to buy them. If you're afraid they won't be what you're looking for order one pair at the beginning (as I did) and re-order more or return later. I love how they feel and look and I cannot wait to invite people over and entertain with my new dining chairs as a center piece :)", 
    "I really like the look, the material of the seat is rough, so maybe hard to clean!", 
    "These chairs came without instructions, but assembly was really easy to figure out on my own.The assembly was also really fast, as the bases were already assembled, so it was just a matter of securing the bases to the plastic seat. Easy!These chairs are stylish, I can't believe I picked them up for the low price that I did. The only reason I didn't give them a 5-star rating is because I have yet to see how they wear over time. I'd also like to get feedback from my guests re: comfort. Never the less, I'm really pleased with my purchase so far.", 
    "love the installation, love the look, the material is a great texture almost soft rubber feel but still hard and sturdy. Not cheap looking super awesome :) couldn't be better", 
    "Love these chairs! Unfortunately one of the two were extremely damaged from packaging mistakes. I called Overstock.com right away and they are sending me a replacement! Very happy with customer service. Just sad to see such a pretty chair damaged. Looking forward to completing my new living room! Thanks!", 
    "I bought 2 of these chairs and they are in my bedroom. Very comfortable and add a nice contemporary look in the room. Nice to have a comfortable chair to relax in. No maintenance and good looking.", 
    "I bought this to furnish our new home. It's a good quality replica of the ***** chair. It was easy to put together and the shipping was fast. I wish the seats were coated to prevent any stains. Overall, it seems pretty sturdy and I haven't had any problems with it.", 
    "Love these chairs. Beautiful and elegant. Perfect for my dining room.", 
    "I love these chairs, they are much more comfortable than you would image and they are super easy to put together. They are great accent chairs that go with anything!", 
    "These are just what I hoped they'd be. Wide to fit everyone, super stylish, easy to assemble, lightweight. I love them! Just what I needed for my office.", 
    "I love this product, it's hard plastic which is great for everyday living. The overall look is a perfect replica for what I wanted in a desk chair. it's sturdy plastic and great quality wooden legs. HOWEVER, my purchase only came with one chair the first time I placed my order but customer care was quick with a resolution and sent out the other part of my order within the week. Please be aware that your order may not come with screws to place the base on the chair nor might it come with an allen wrench to screw these pieces together once you've actually received the parts from Overstock. Overall this purchase was the most frustrating hassle i've ever had with any company and i'm usually pretty easy going when companies that make mistakes because everyone makes mistakes but this will have been the third time i've had to contact customer service about something as silly as screws which should be included.", 
    "I've had these chairs for about a year and a half and they've never held together -- the screws are constantly coming undone. Now one of the screws is stripped and the chair will be trashed. They were not cheap chairs but they're cheaply made and awful. Avoid!", 
    "I rated the quality as good instead of excellent because the base was misaligned on one chair which made assembly very difficult. The first chair was quick and easy, but the second was a 2-person project. That said, the chairs are sturdy, comfortable and look exactly as advertised. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "I am torn about these chairs. They are great looking and I love the wood bases. However, I have the real ones so I was a little shocked that the plastic was so thin. I am not sorry I bought them but wouldn't do it again.", 
    "I just received the chairs today. Took 10 minutes to put together. They look great in my little living room. Great buy!", 
    "These chairs are absolutely perfect as additional seating in our small, contemporary living room. They are gorgeous, stylish, surprisingly comfortable given that they are made of plastic. We use them often and love them. They were very easy to assemble and match the product description exactly.", 
    "I would have given this top score in every category. I love the look, feel, everything about these chairs. The little bit of assembly is incredibly simple And the quality seems quite good (haven't had them long enough to see how they hold up). My only complaint is that one of the screws to attache the leg section to the chair shell was horribly bent, to the point it couldn't be used. We had to temporarily go minus one screw, though it isn't like that is difficult or expensive to purchase.", 
    "Chairs look really cheap which was disappointing. They are also uncomfortable. I will use outside rather than inside.", 
    "These Chairs are a great find. The Texture of the mold is more of an eggshell texture. The size is small enough to easily move around. Perfect for a small apt. Received both chairs within a couple of days of ordering. Packaged well, and easy to assemble. They are very similar to Chairs that are outrageously expensive. They are easy to clean, just wipe with wet cloth.", 
    "These chairs fit and look great in my living room. I thought that they would keep at a cold temperature because they're plastic, but they stay room temperature. The reason I am mentioning this is because I dislike sitting on cold furniture. I dislike how the cold feels on my skin. The assembly of the chairs was self explanatory, so it did come with instructions. Overall, I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "These chairs are a perfect addition to our mid century style office. They are comfortable - not cozy but comfy and you can always get a throw pillow for them.", 
    "Very comfortable, easy to wipe clean and can be moved easily. Great value for money and super stylish.", 
    "I have them as accent chairs and they are so elegant yet modern and light in the way they look, I would not recommend those chairs for heavy use as the legs are rather skinny and would break easy if handled rough.", 
    "Product came all marked up, almost appeared used. Was disappointed coming from overstock Chairs themselves look nice but a little small.", 
    "We bought these chairs a year ago because I loved the look and didn't want to pay full price for the original model. I was happy when they arrived. They look great and are easy to put together. The plastic isn't super high quality and stains easily, but I didn't mind because they were so cheap. Until we started sitting in them frequently. After the initial 30 day return period, of course, I noticed that the chairs started pitching forward. At least one screw has fallen out of each chair and the brackets have completely broken. We'll be throwing these out. You get what you pay for, I guess. But really, don't buy these if you plan to sit inthem.", 
    "Easy to assemble and they look fantastic. Very crisp white. They really bring a whole new level of style to the living room.", 
    "I bought two of these chairs as the finishing touch to my listening room in my home. I wasn't sure they would be comfortable to sit in for a period of time, but they were totally the look I wanted so I gave it a shot. When I easily put them together (no instructions necessary--and took only minutes with the help of someone holding the base in place) and sat for the first time I was pleasantly surprised. This chair is quite comfortable and supports my lower back with its form. The plastic material is incredibly soft and allows it to give as you need, while remaining sturdy at the same time. Weird, but true. I also bought 2 of the similar \"Vinnie\" rocking chair versions like this at the same time and everyone so far has preferred this chair over those. THEY LOOK ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE in this room! I have chalk black walls with white trim and these pop magically. I will also bring these into the dining area when my nephews visit---even though they are white, these chairs are so easy to clean! KID-FRIENDLY IS A PLUS! I like the form of these visually and functionally. The slight curve of the arm rest allows for just the right amount of comfort and the back support I mentioned previously is great. If you're on the fence about this chair, I say take a leap and get it.", 
    "These are really cute chairs that add a lot of style and something different to a room. I expected the plastic to be smooth but it actually has little bumps all over it--not even quite bumps, just a very slight texture similar to the blue plastic chairs you probably used in grade school. I don't have a problem with the subtle texture, and it doesn't change the appearance of the chairs at all, it just isn't the super smooth acrylic like other more expensive versions. Anyways, these were very easy to assemble, you just have to attach the base to the seat with four little bolts. They look very sophisticated in a room and are surprisingly comfortable. I think I will add a sheepskin or a cashmere throw to mine for a little added softness, but you wouldn't have to. They are very cute and for the price, I think it is about the cheapest way to get Eames style in your home or office!", 
    "Get lots of compliments. Easy to put together and surprisingly comfortable chairs.", 
    "the chairs are both comfortable and add a modern touch to my office waiting room", 
    "Needed a new desk and/or occasional chair for living room. They look great, retro-contemporary (if there is such a thing). The chairs are single piece molded plastic. The legs are wood and metal. My set came without instructions of any kind, but it was easy enough to assemble. Assembly basically involves screwing 4 bolts to hold the legs to the base with a hex wrench. The bolts and washers come taped to the box lid. All-in-all very happy with the purchase. Great look, sturdy chairs, great value.", 
    "These chairs are a deal! I love the subtle texture the plastic has... like that of an egg. They are simple to put together, and seem really sturdy. The wood is more of a lighter wood color. Something on the line of a maple or beech. Overstock.com, has become my new favorite place to shop. Thank you!!!", 
    "Great chairs and excellent price! Delivery was quite fast.", 
    "Pleased with my purchase. These chairs were easy to put together, even though there were no instructions included. Took a minute or two of, \"huh, I guess this goes here\", but once put together, they're solid, and have quite an appealing look.", 
    "The manufacturer is Baxton Studios - had I known this, I would have purchased at Amazon, where it was going for $120 shipped. Luckily, they dropped the price significantly and gave me an adjustment. I love the way these chairs look - they are very stylish and surprisingly very comfortable to sit in. Assembly was tricky since there were no instructions, but an early review suggested the order. I think if you put the spring coil washer first on the screw, followed by the flat washer, and thread that in, it's correct. I haven't used these chairs too long to see what stains it. It's not a shiny plastic, but more like a matte finish, which I much more prefer. Happy with the purchase thus far.", 
    "I just love these chairs. I bought mine at the outlet at a steep discount and could not be happier about the quality. They can be used in almost any room in your house. I have already moved mine from the dinner table to the living room and even the master bedroom. I love furniture that can be bounced around depending on need. They are also surprisingly comfortable with some nice back support. I would highly recommend these chairs.", 
    "They shipped in less than a week, and I finally had time to put them together today (ie. screw in 4 screws). They're shorter than I expected-guess I should have looked at the measurements-but otherwise pretty awesome. I love how light they are so I can just move them around where extra seating is needed, and they're fairly comfortable for being a plastic chair!", 
    "Affordable midcentury knockoffs. We have them as accent chairs in our office and use them at the dining table when we have a lot of guests. Mostly they are for looks.", 
    "These chairs are real beauties. They were a piece of cake to assemble. A warning to pet owners: these chairs seem to be a magnet for pet hair. I anticipate having to wipe them down before guests come over. They look great though and I definitely don't regret the purchase.", 
    "I was a little scared ordering these chairs. I thought we were giving up comfort for design. These chairs are so comfortable! With a little circle cushion in them for a pop of color they are perfect for our modern office! Thinking about ordering a rocking chair in this design.", 
    "Pleasantly surprised. The white is very bold and crisp, so there is a nice contrast between the black,wood and white. My office has distressed wood floors and more modern furniture and these chairs were the perfect fit in the waiting room.", 
    "Love these chairs! Everyone that comes over asks me where I got them. Great price and amazingly comfortable.", 
    "Took a little longer to leave the warehouse than it should have. Arrived in good condition and needed about 5 minutes of assembly. Look sharp and are surprisingly comfortable considering the material. I have gotten a lot of compliments on them so far. The 4 bolts that hold the base to the chair keep coming loose though after a few days of wiggling around. Had to apply loc-tite. Would buy again.", 
    "Rec'd the chairs and they were super easy to assemble. The chairs were in perfect condition, no scuffs. Great style and comfy!", 
    "I bought these chairs for my daughter and she bought two more. They are in her kitchen and the last time I visited found them very comfortable. I highly recommend these chairs and would like a set for myself.", 
    "You just won't find Herman Miller style chairs at a better price. They are comfy and sturdy and look great. The only problem I had was that assembly was awkward because of the weigh distribution of the molded plastic piece. For something that only has two parts, you'd think assembly would be simpler. I'm handy, and it took me about 20 minutes per chair. After I was done, though, I knew the time was well worth it.", 
    "Get it. Well made. Feels and sits great. Easy to put together.", 
    "These chairs have to fit your design aesthetic. However, they are great knockoffs of a designer chair. They are made of plastic so they are not the kind of chair that you curl up into, but other than that, are great for accent chairs or kitchen chairs.", 
    "Amazing copies cats of the original design! The chairs look great in my studio and the quality is so worth the price!", 
    "I bought the same chair on Amazon.com and the quality was poor this is an excellent replica im very happy!", 
    "Great pieces to have in your apartment! Chairs are usually crazy expensive, but this is a great deal. The chairs came fast via FedEx and the color was great.", 
    "These chairs are absolutely gorgeous and very sturdy. Construction is solid and they are pretty easy to put together, just attach the legs to the seat with the provided screws. For the price I couldn't be happier.... and they are pretty comfortable too.", 
    "I was pleased with the overall quality of my chairs...until I got ready to assemble them. In reading the reviews I decided to paint them black to avoid having to constantly clean the white. After painting them, I began to assemble them. I assembled the first chair in about 15 minutes. When I got to the second chair, I realized it was missing one of the inner cylinders that the screw screws into to. So needless to say I am having to find an alternative method to get the screw to stay in so that I can use the chair. Had I not painted them first, I would definitely be returning them!!!", 
    "Bought six of these for my office and six more for my home! Absolutely love the design and the price is fantastic.", 
    "I purchased two Preben chair from IKEA, it contains woven fabric and it didn't took long before my cats torn them down. Eventually returned them and purchase these. Overall satisfied with the quality, still in doubt how well it can last the stains. I use these for my glass breakfast table and it matched very well. So far the cats shown no interest of the chairs so that is a good sign. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase.", 
    "I purchased these chairs to go along with a dining table we purchased at Crate and Barrel. We have a small bungalow-type home and do not have very much space for a large-scale table. We had space for about two chairs and I wanted to add a mixture of modern along with our furniture. These chairs came in a box with the legs unattached. An allen key was included in the shipment as well as screws and washers. It took all of two minutes to put together. I added the tables to our dining table and staged the table with a vase with white roses and sent the pic to an architect friend. He was impressed by the design of the chairs and much more impressed by the price. Great find for a frugal aspiring interior designer! I'm actually going to purchase another two to have available for dinner guests.", 
    "The hardware was not with the chairs so I can not assemble them. What's worse is that they ran out of stock so they can not even send me an extra hardware. but they gave me a 20 dollars discount so I can buy the hardwares myself.", 
    "Our chairs arrived yesterday and only took a few short minutes to assemble. Straight out of the box I could see that the plastic material used for the seat of the chairs is different than what you would find on a traditional Eames style chair. I don't love the slightly-textured matte white plastic, but wasn't expecting an exact replica, so I'm not unhappy with them. However I do think that the look of the plastic seat could be an issue for those looking for a more accurate Eames look, so it is worth noting. Overall the chairs are comfortable and for the price, a nice addition to our home.", 
    "The chairs are fun and whimsical. I used them as an accent to sit in front of a very classic-looking desk. The room that they are in is very traditional looking as well so the chairs added a bit of fun and style. The only thing I would change is to add some sheen to the white as the finish is dull (I knew this when I purchased them so I was not disappointed). Definitely a good buy.", 
    "Nice chairs, sturdy, comfortable. I have seen the same chair on other websites for much higher price", 
    "We bought a set of 2 chairs and they are great. Beautiful stark white color but easy to care for. Adds a unique look to our eclectic family room.", 
    "A timeless style that can create the right minimilistic look for a great mid century look", 
    "Everyone who sees them thinks they're so cute! Then when they sit on them they are even more impressed, as I was. The chair has good comfy back support and the arm height is just perfect. I love these chairs!", 
    "The plastic that the chairs are made from is thiner then expected , easy to get dirty, - but most of it washes off", 
    "I am happy with these chairs. I feel like I got good value for the price. They were easy to put together and good for accent chairs/ extra seating. I have one in my living room and one in my bedroom.", 
    "may want to invest a little more money in a better product. constructed the two chairs per instructions. one is fine, other fell apart. the metal housing in order to attach the legs to the chair body came out of the chair. after endless attempts to fix the problem, i contacted overstock. the product is out of stock, so they offered me partial refund and i can ATTEMPT to fix the chair, or i can send both back. not really a solution to my problem, but i guess they are doing what they can. i will be sending the chairs back and back on the hunt for chairs. customer service has been great, they are quick to try and fix the problem.", 
    "A little modern, a lot cool. I love that they are plastic and easily cleaned with a Magic Eraser.", 
    "The chairs look nice enough, but they would be low for most people and the quality of the plastic felt pretty cheap. Overall they didn't feel sturdy or very \"grown up\". I was disappointed in the quality, but I probably would have kept them - they were cheap, so I wasn't expecting anything amazing. Unfortunately they had shipped them without any nuts and bolts to put them together! I had to send them back since I had no way to assemble them.", 
    "pretty cool chairs. leg details are great. the seat is pretty comfortable.", 
    "Super comfortable and solid. Bought these for my new modern office. They are light weight and super comfortable and solve the problem of fitting larger people in a chair that needs to be put in a small space. The design is such fun. Affordable, easy to clean. What's not to like? A little tricky getting the screws to match up for installation but not much.", 
    "Great chairs for the money. Nice modern look and they can fit any where. Easy to clean.", 
    "I saw these chairs in an art gallery and the owner was kind enough to share his source. They are very comfortable as well as great looking.", 
    "I have wanted this style of chair forever, when I moved my office/art studio to a bigger room I was looking for a pair of chairs that wouldn't cost too much. These were the perfect style and size. Everyone is impressed with them. I finally have the style of room I always wanted.", 
    "considering you can get the look of the modern movement of the 60's without having to drop $700 on a Herman Miller. Just wish Overstock will get the rocking chair back in stock.", 
    "These chairs are awesome! really love it! I use this for my living room and every person that come to visit say something about the chairs!!", 
    "I absolutely love these chairs, I am so happy I purchased them! I get complements on them all the time. They are perfect and no one can tell that they are not an original!", 
    "I use one of these chairs as a desk chair in a studio loft and then pull it over to the dining table, if needed. As a desk chair, where I sit for a few hours at a time, it is surprisingly comfortable. I didn't expect it to be that way, so I'm really pleased with this product. Of course, it looks great, too.", 
    "I love these chairs! I am an interior designer, and used the armless version that Overstock carries for a recent project at a local hair salon. After 10 months of constant use, they are holding up great! Well I decided to get the ones with arms for my own home, & I just love them! Cool, retro look, and very comfortable to sit on! Lots of compliments already! Defiantly recommend these chairs!", 
    "I just received my two chairs and I must say that it was easy to assemble. The look is modern, simple and sheek if that is what you looking for. The chairs are lightweight and easy to move. Also, takes very lil space!", 
    "Of course they are plastic chairs when it comes right down to it, but the legs make them look much more upscale, and their resemblance to Eames chairs make them worth every penny. Great value for a great retro look.", 
    "We LOVE these chairs. They were a piece of cake to assemble, they look awesome, they are VERY Comfortable, and very sturdy. Plus you can NOT beat the price!!!! We are even considering buying the fabric 2 chair set. These chairs look awesome with the dining table we bought. They're very modern but still classic. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE CHAIRS!!!!! We were on a tight budget after relocating to NY from LA, but of course we wanted to still find something that looked upscale and had style, but also well made. That is a lot to try to accomplish, but these chairs do exactly that. Anyone who gives these chairs a bad review is clearly looking for something else, because they are exactly as pictured!!!!", 
    "The chairs arrived quickly. They add a great retro flare that adds to any decor. I have them tucked under an old barn wood table. Someone is always pulling them out to sit in. Love the style and a quality built chair.", 
    "I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about. My two chairs arrived on time and in excellent condition. All parts/hardware in box. No issues. These \"inspired\" design chairs are as close as you can get to originals. And the price for the set cant be beat. Chairs are white, legs are a light brown. easy to assemble. But no instructions. Hint: screw, then split washer and flat washer.", 
    "Comfortable and attractive. The fact that the chairs are plastic does not bother me, they fit our needs.", 
    "These chairs are great. They are made of plastic and the dowel legs are wood. They are not high quality furniture, but they are perfect as side chairs. I bought them for the aesthetic and not as furniture that would be used daily. They are art!", 
    "Ok, you'll just have to get over the fact that these aren't made in fiberglass anymore. You could get authentic production versions, which are also plastic, for 5 times the price. Or, you could get these, which are perfectly acceptable and great looking. Choice is yours!", 
    "Beautiful but the crews ome loose very easily. Maybe not meant for everyday use?", 
    "These are awesome chairs! We couldn't afford Herman Miller, found these and are super happy with them.", 
    "These are fantastic chairs. They're actually mat and are made out of a slightly rough plastic. Beautiful furniture, especially for the price.", 
    "Assembly a little tricky, but overall simple. Looks good", 
    "The chairs look beautiful in the room. No doubt. Closer inspection of the plastic though and you see dimples on the seat at the point of connection to the base and the curves at the arm show what is similar to stretch marks. Also I expected a smooth plastic but instead its a slightly matted texture which I am wondering how best to clean. I have two kids and wanted an easy wipeable finish so not what i expected in that regard. My fault for buying white. Any other color and this probably wouldn't have been an issue.", 
    "I am so happy I found these chairs as they were the last pieces to complete my coffee corner. The chairs are really unique in material and design combination, giving the retro and fresh look needed. They are cozy and comfortable, and really durable. I have never had plastic chairs but I adore these ones.", 
    "These chairs are amazing. They have a really great look and design, and the material combination is quite unusual for me. But the look was so amazing and I love new things and changes, so I ordered two sets. The chairs arrived in great quality and they are really comfortable and beautiful.", 
    "I am not surprised when seeing all the positive reviews as these chairs are amazing. I have never had plastic pieces, but these ones worth buying. They have a great and fresh look and are really cozy and comfortable. Unique look and design.", 
    "It is very smooth and comfortable to sit on. My my husband first saw it, he said \"plastic chairs\" what where you thinking. Then he sat on them and realized they were quite comfortable. The look is quite nice too...very contemporary. I liked them enough that I brought a second set!", 
    "Bought these chairs to use as end chairs at my industrial harvest top style dining/kitchen table. They are perfect fit to the style and surprisingly comfortable!!! Look great with the armless style ones I got for the side chairs which are also very comfortable. These chairs are sturdy, comfy, incredibly easy to clean (with a 3 year old and 1.5 year old that was key, and no stains yet!). One chair came with a slight scratch on the seat but is hardly noticeable. Chairs were very easy to assemble, took less than 10 mins for both. We LOVE them!!!!", 
    "Great chairs, easy to put together. I have them in my office as accent chairs and they work perfectly. I think at one point I was considering using them for my dining room table but I think they may be a tad too short. Otherwise, they're exactly as described on the page.", 
    "The shape of these chairs is what made me grab my credit card. I love funky, abstract furniture and this was a great addition to my home. The chair's unique shape makes it even more comfortable than your stand chair. You almost feel like you're cradled in the chair. Shipping was quick!", 
    "My husband and I bought these chairs for our new home. They are lightweight, look great and feel great. The chairs' overall look brighten up our patio and gives it a new-age feel. Spectacular price for two great chairs.", 
    "These chairs hug you and make sitting for extended periods of time worth it. One thing I love about them is that you can use them in your dining room, living room, office or patio. And since they're white they go with anything! I plan on purchasing another set after the new year.", 
    "These are some really great and cool looking chairs I ordered into my small living. They have the unique material combination that I needed and just that funky look as expected. the material is really durable and sturdy, the base is solid, while the shape of the seating matches with your body. really great deal made.", 
    "i love the design on the chair, but i am disappointed that the white finish is rubbing off after only having them for a few months.", 
    "These are the perfect chairs I was searching for. The unique design and material construction makes them so special and beautiful. The design is both classic and modern, bringing back the good old memories when I was young and restless. Price is really affordable, service and quality spotless, and the chairs comfortable. Thank you.", 
    "I am so happy I ordered these chairs as they match perfectly with the coffee table ordered. I placed them all on the winter porch where we sit with our friends and enjoy a lovely afternoon chat. The chairs have a great material construction and the unique shape gives the comfort factor we need. Really easy to clean and move around and really stable and durable. Thank you.", 
    "It's great style for the price. It was easy to assemble and came quickly as well.", 
    "These chairs look great. They are a bit cheap feeling, but I wasn't expecting more for the price point. They compliment our modern decor for a fraction of what we could have paid elsewhere.", 
    "Fabulous little creatures are these chairs. First when I saw them I thought \u0093if I sit in one of these, it will break\u0094. I did like the design but I was afraid they wouldn\u0092t last a day. My husband bought 2 sets, but instead of breaking, I was very surprised of how solid they are. It is absolutely great quality and it looks fantastic.", 
    "Very nice chairs. They seem solid but I think, to be fair, I would have to comment on their durability after some time. I think they will be fine as I placed them in a fairly low use area of my basement family room. They will be occasional chairs. Lovely and good quality moulding and the wood legs were good quality and nicely finished. I would recommend and buy again if I had a need.", 
    "These chairs are really great. I love the unique design and the leg style, the plastic and wood combination, the comfort and charm. I love everything about them, even the low price. I ordered two sets into my small winter porch area around the table, and this place became our favorite to sit down and talk for hours.", 
    "These chairs were incredibly easy to assemble (which is lucky since there were no instructions or diagrams). We've had them about a month, and we use them as office chairs for working from home. They are incredibly comfy; I'm shocked at how cozy they are since they're plastic. Definitely recommend these!", 
    "These chairs have a really unique and amazing look. I have never had plastic and wood combination pieces, mostly plastic as I never liked it. However these chairs look so retro and have a great feeling that I needed to order four. Every piece arrived in top quality and they are comfortable, solid and durable. Perfect to use both outdoors and indoors.", 
    "Love these chairs! They are very light weight but look amazing!", 
    "These were fine for a year, but the hardware has come loose, and the holes for the screws have become loose, so the screws simply fall out of the chair. The chair is completely useless now. I called Overstock, but because they were purchased a year ago, I'm ***. They have a partial return policy that I was told would likely get me 20% of my money back, which is what I'd pay just to ship the chairs to begin with. Terribly frustrating that Overstock would sell such poor quality items.", 
    "If you have a room or decor that matches, these chairs are a must-buy. I have them in a bright white sunroom with a round mid-century side table between them. They are surprisingly comfortable; it is easy to sit and read in one for an hour or more. I highly recommend these chairs, especially at this price. You will not be disappointed.", 
    "These are great budget pieces. Spot on Eames reproductions, but obviously not the real thing. Biggest drawback is plastic construction (true Eames are fiberglass), however, this is clearly noted in product description so am in no way disappointed in the product. Chairs are quite comfortable and look great. At first glance, look very similar to $900 designer productions at a FRACTION of the price. I bought to use as dining room chairs, and love them as such.", 
    "Love them! My balcony looks sweet! Great buy! I reccommend highly!", 
    "These are great chairs for the price (price of chair plus shipping). I read through many reviews on the site before buying and there are quite a few negative reviews on the quality of the material. There's no problem with the material if you understand what you're buying. These are knock-offs - they're not original Eames molded plastic chairs. You're getting two chairs for under $$$...of course the plastic isn't supreme quality. But it's good. We have a two-year old and a busy kitchen. I'm totally fine paying a low price for chairs that are going to take a beating. They look good, they're comfortable, they're sturdy. If you're looking for show pieces - go for the originals. That being said, I would caution one thing with the the plastic and having a kid. The material is not smooth - it has some texture. That makes it a bit harder to just wipe off - takes some scrubbing. Overall - I would recommend these.", 
    "i loved them so much when I got them i immediately ordered 2 more. They aren't top of the line furniture, but they aren't crap either. Only issue ive has is having to regularly tighten the bolts that hold the legs on. They get loose. Next time I think ill put some sort of adhesive in there so they dont loosen again.", 
    "These retro chairs go really well in our California ranch living room with the white brick fireplace. We love the design and are very pleased that they are such wonderful knock-offs of classic design.", 
    "Great chairs. Perfect for a small mid-century space. Not the most comfortable if you are expecting to lounge for hours, but as extra seating in a small room, they are wonderful. Great price too.", 
    "Some folks have stated the chair is difficult to assemble or that the molded plastic is not to their liking. My chairs were very easy to assemble, and look great. Are they as visually stunning as the original fiberglass models? No. Are they still amazing and affordable. YES! If you are looking for an Eames knockoff I highly recommend these chairs.", 
    "The chairs are what I was hoping they would be, but there was assembly needed and no instructions on how to put them together. One of them didn't go together as well as the other and is a bit wobbly.", 
    "Absoltely love the chairs. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.", 
    "Really cute chairs for a great price. They sit a little lower to the ground than normal chairs and seem small overall but they were quite comfortable to sit in for myself 5'3\" and petite, as well as my 6'2\" male coworker. Happy with this purchase.", 
    "These chairs look great. I wish there was an option to just get one, but that's my only complaint. I only needed one as a desk chair but ended up putting the other one in my teenager's room. You can't beat 2.95 delivery and they showed up on time. They give a cool modern look to the room!", 
    "bought these to use as end chairs with a set of real eames chairs I own and though they are not quite as solid as the real thing, they look great. I spray painted mine to add some color to the set, as I didn't want to paint my original chairs. Great deal for the price", 
    "I bought these chairs b/c I liked the look of them. Where I work, they have sets of the real thing so I could definitely tell the difference in quality with these chairs. These are definitely knock-offs, the plastic is very cheap, but, the chairs look good and are comfortable to sit. These are great if you'd like to acheive a certain look but on a budget.", 
    "Really easy to put together. Great quality. I didn't actually need 2 chairs but I'll find a use for the 2nd somewhere. A really beautiful design that is also comfortable.", 
    "These are confortable chairs for dining. Be patient when assembling--they're easy once you get the positioning correct. (No assembly instructions come with these chairs. )", 
    "The chairs are of better quality than I expected. The assembly is very simple, although the box not bring any kind of instructions. The chairs are sturdy and comfortable and aesthetic is very good. As interior designer I recommend these chairs to those who can't afford the $$$ for the one that Herman Miller produced but are in love with the good design by Charles and Ray Eames.", 
    "I love these retro chairs - they look great in my new house!", 
    "I LOVE these chairs! Assembly was simple and only requires the enclosed Allen Wrench. I expected there would be many parts and assembly would take a long time, but I was pleasantly surprised to find my assumptions were wrong. The base is already assembled and just requires four bolts with washers to attach to the chair mold. Once assembled, they are very sturdy and quite comfortable! They look exactly as pictured. I've received multiple compliments on the chairs and everyone who sits in them finds them comfortable.", 
    "These are OK, but if you are looking for high design, the materials give these away as only acceptable visual knock offs. They don't feel at all like the more typical fiberglass smooth and shiny originals. The wood legs have been machined with no real finishing (i.e., there is wood flash still around the routed out slots for the hardware to attach). Assembly was likewise not difficult, but not terribly easy either. Overall: Meh. I gave it four stars only because it DID say they were plastic, but didn't make clear the texture.", 
    "I love these chairs and have gotten so many compliments on them. For the price, they're definitely worth the purchase. It doesn't hurt that they're also comfortable and pretty sturdy.", 
    "Good product. Would be a five star if the plastic seat was of a higher quality or better yet fiberglass. Good value.", 
    "I have a mid-century house, decorating in that style. These chairs are perfect. I've had so many compliments already. Mid-century style at a great price. Looks so similar to the eames chairs except for triple the price. I have them at both ends of my dining table with bertola metal chairs on sides - very, very happy with my buy.", 
    "This set of chairs is great for the price. It's an obvious knock-off of some well known chairs, and I would say the perfect option for anyone who wants to add a touch of good design in their living space for a small price. The quality is good overall, no complain here. Screwing the legs in the plastic (some pre-drilled holes) wasn't super easy but not hard either (10 min for both chairs). The chairs look sturdy but we only had them for about a month now so I can't really judge. They are very confortable and thanks to the armrest feel solid enough (the plastic is a bit flexible but not too much). The materials used don't look super high-end but surprisingly not cheap eather, and thanks to the simplistic design of those chairs the result actually looks as good as the branded ones (unless maybe for design professionnals who are used to work with the originals). We bought only 1 pair (2 chairs) and use them on the 2 ends of our reclaimed-wood industrial table, they look fabulous. At this price, we're not too worried about using them every day for dinner or just seating with friends. The description on the overstock.com website + all the customer reviews really allowed us to make an informed decision. Maybe more pictures with a closer look at the chairs from different angles would have been nice.", 
    "The chairs are great, they look good and they are easy to assemble you just have to put the legs on which is really easy. I did think they would be bigger I was picturing huge chairs that were deep but they are medium size.", 
    "Great value for the price of 2 chairs. There were some light scratches on top of the seat, but only noticeable when looking on the side against the light...", 
    "These chairs are very inexpensive which is why the flexibility of the bucket hasn't been more of an issue. If only the material was denser such as some of the other retro-wire chairs here on overstock.com.", 
    "I love these chairs! They look just like the ones that cost a lot more on every other website. I was concerned that they would be smaller and they're not. We're using them as head chairs at the dining room table and they are a great size in relationship to the armless side chairs. It took about 5 minutes to put each chair together. I can't say enough about these chairs. They are just beautiful. And the price was incredible.", 
    "the product awesome and the purchasing was simple!", 
    "Got these chairs a few weeks back. Assembly was quick but a little tricky since I was not sure if the legs were supposed to be pegged in that close to one another as I feared they might add too much pressure when one sits. Also, the construction isn't the best in some areas - ie. under the seat where you assemble the legs. It seems like very poorly welded pieces, which you do not see. But that makes me question the durability of the chairs. I use them in my living room space and they look chic and modern. Will recommend to others for sure, esp for the price.", 
    "Love these chairs. Delivery was fast and it was easy to put them together. Have received compliments from friends who know furniture and when I tell them the price they agree it is a great price. The chairs fit perfectly into a modern design.. These are great comfortable chairs at a fraction of the cost compared to the designer brands.", 
    "I was looking for \"mid-century modern\" style furniture, without breaking the bank, that would be light enough to move around when cleaning/vacuuming and attractive at the same time. These chairs more than filled the bill, in a very classy and modern way, and I am very pleased. And the price simply can't be beat.", 
    "Love these chairs!!! Get lots of compliments and they are comfortable! take a few moments to really see how to put these together and you will be fine in no time! Wonderful chairs! Wish I had space for two more...", 
    "These look great and appear to be designer chairs for much less cost. Overall a great purchase and they are actually SO comfortable. I wasn't sure what to expect but I'm happy with these.", 
    "Nice, modern looking and durable chair - purchased for office...", 
    "I had been eying these chairs online for a while, but I was not convinced that they could possible look as good as they do in the photo. I decided to bite the bullet and buy them. When they arrived I was thrilled with how easy they were to put together and how nice they looked. This past weekend I thought I would amuse myself by doing the the designer NYC \"conran shop\" inside ABC Carpet. I don't know if I should be mocking ABC carpet or praising Overstock - these chairs are doppelgangers for the real eames molded chairs!!! details: The wood base is the same, the plastic thickness is the same. The overstock version is about 1/2 wider in the seat of the chair - which frankly makes it more comfy for your bottom!. Sure if you really need them in grey or bright orange, you can buy them at ABC carpet for $500 EACH!!!", 
    "I loved the look of these chairs on the site and they are exactly as described. I have one in each of my children's bedrooms and they have already been \"abused\" by kids and show no sign of wear at all. To soften the look they each have a throw pillow and blanket on them. I am surprised that they are as comfortable to sit in as they are cool & retro looking. These would easily fit in a playroom, living room or den. I think these will be used for years to come.", 
    "Perfect for the price. Plastic seat is a matte dimpled finish...not shiny fiberglass like the original eames, but i find this totally acceptable for the price. They look good.", 
    "If you are into a modern or mid-century design, these chairs can make your entire room, even over the table itself. Feel very sturdy, yet the plastic is comfortable enough where you won't need any kind of pad in the chair. If you've seen these Eames knock-offs in furniture stores before, you'll see they are usually $150+ PER CHAIR, so this is a steal. Easy to assemble. Only advice I'd add is 1) When you Allen wrench in the legs, the key is to put all 4 screws in just slightly, and then tighten them all, vs. fully tightening one at a time. The adjusters move around alot so it will make more sense once you see the chair. Clean-up: These do show dirt so you will need to wipe down a couple times a week for perfection but the plastic quality in general feels very nice.", 
    "These chairs have a really nice look with that wooden base. For some reason the kids adored them immediately. I guess that shape is really good to curl into. So from afar, all is well. But those seats a really plastic. They're staticy and all that. The finish is nothing at all like the molded fiberglass. That said, for the price, I don't know if better can be found. I bought these as extras to go with a set of vintage table and chairs. They look pretty different, but they sort of go with the theme of the place and work as extra seats for the kids, etc.", 
    "i was apprehensive about this purchase but after reading the positive reviews i decided to take a chance and place the order. the price is great for 2 chairs can't beat it. but if you are familiar with the glory of mid century modern design originals you will be very disappointed. this product is not for adults....it's dimensions and quality are very appropiate for teen's and college students or first apartment twenty year olds. i needed to replace an office chair and it really is not for me. also i think overstock (this website) should let you know the origin of make for all products they sell, this one is made in CHINA.", 
    "These are a little bit difficult to assemble - have to bend the frame slightly to get all the bolts to line up with their holes. Also, they need semi-frequent re-tightening. Other than that I love these chairs. They're one of our favorite purchases and couldn't be happier. They don't look like the original's fibreglass, but this isn't the 60's so the plastic looks great. Love them.", 
    "I purchased these chairs for my home office and couldn't be more pleased. They were very easy to assemble and are actually a little larger than I expected. I expected them to look great and provide less comfort; however, this chair is extremely comfortable and sturdy. I put a small sheepskin rug in the chair I use daily and can work all day without back or neck issues. I love these chairs and highly recommend them!", 
    "I kept looking at these chairs for months on \"O\". Each time I would decide to buy them, they were OUT OF STOCK (bummer). Finally, I received an email from \"O\" that they were back in stock so I ordered right away. I really only wanted one chair, but, ordered the set anyhow and now I am very happy that I got two instead of one! The chairs, once put together, are great. Unfortunately, mine came with no hardware so I had to make a few calls and emails to Overstock to get the missing pieces. They were helpful, but since it was going to take a week or so to receive the hardware, we decided to go to the local hardware store and purchase it ourselves. The outcome was fine and I would recommend them.", 
    "These chairs are made of a 'soft' molded plastic not the hard 'shell like' plastic of the original Eames chairs they emulate. In that sense they seem less sturdy then the original. However to the average person whose not a design maven they're pretty close. The wood on the legs are a laminate and easily chip at the ends but if handled with care in assembly they're functional and beautiful in a room. If you want to bring some mid-century modern design into your room and can't afford the original chairs as designed by Ray & Charles Eames (and which currently retail for circa $450 a piece) then these are more than adequate substitutions that brign a crisp, clean, and modern feel to your room.", 
    "Love them. I have 2 of these and 6 of the armless ones at my dinning table and we love them!!", 
    "Love, love, love these!!!!! So worth the $$ - great value.", 
    "These are great chairs. Attractive, comfortable, sturdy. They are a good size. There were no instructions to put them together, but it was easy enough to figure out. I am very happy with this purchase. Delivery was fast.", 
    "Being an architect, I was hesitant to purchase a knock of designy product but decided to pull the trigger after seeing the price of the originals. For the money these really can't be beat. They look great, arrived quickly, were incredibly easy to assemble and are comfortable. I would highly recommend these for any home looking for a modern or minimalist aesthetic.", 
    "An FYI's if you're thinking about buying these chairs. The finish is matte white without an additional barrier. So if anything should stain the chair, it will not wipe clean as easily as a gloss finish/barrier. Mine arrived with a ink spot in the middle of the chair. Attempting to clean it with a wet paper towel was a mistake as the colors from the paper towel floral print bled on to the chair. When cleaning the chairs, do so with an absolute white cloth. Also, mine did not arrive at all. It went to someone several blocks away. Granted this was around xmas time when couriers have seasonal staff. The courier was slow moving on figuring out what happened to the package. O.co was very prompt in correcting the matter. Once the kind neighbor brought the chairs over, I informed O.co and realize they we're already prepping to ship out replacements. I will certainly order again.", 
    "All in all,these chairs are an inexpensive way to have a mid - century look at a fraction of the cost.I was sad that the seats were not more smooth,but overall they are very nice and look great in my dining room! If you can't afford the real thing...they are a great buy! Happy and would tell a friend!", 
    "I love these chairs. They are an excellent value for the money. The material is high quality, the chairs are comfortable and beautiful. Putting them together was a snap.", 
    "THese chairs really brought an interesting change to our living room. I highly recommend!", 
    "I ordered these chairs for the very first time from overstock. They are so chic and look exactly the way as pictured. Totally love the retro feel and are also very comfortable.my only concern was that one of the chairs was not in the perfect condition so I called the customer service and they were so helpful and took care of it immediately after three days I received a new chair I was totally impressed by their service and would definitely order more things from overstock in future! Thanks overstock:)", 
    "I was cautious about ordering these chairs without seeing them in person first but I am thrilled I did. They arrived quickly and were very easy to put together. The chairs are eye catching and unique, providing a statement without smacking you in the face in my more traditional home. I flanked my fireplace with them and added a little throw pillow on each and they look fantastic! Even though they are plastic they are actually pretty comfy. I have received many compliments on them.", 
    "I bought two sets of it for my new apt! All retro style!! Love it... It pretty much is what it is as the website said... it just maybe i didn't read it carefully... i wasn't expecting a plastic one... but the quality is good. esp with this price. if you get the real one from herman miller, it costs $$$ each!! def a buck saver!!", 
    "Great pair of chairs. Very easy to put together and seem pretty sturdy. The texture isn't totally smooth , which is better for sitting on actually.", 
    "I would definitely recommend these chairs. Great knock off for the $$. Considering ordering another pair. Easy assembly, i was able to tackle it without needing an extra pair of hands. Speedy arrival & no issues with shipping.", 
    "These chairs are great. They are very comfortable and sturdy, and look great in my guest room. Attaching the legs was simple. Overall very happy with the purchase.", 
    "These chairs are a lot of fun. They have a perfect retro design and are easy to put together. We are having them wrapped in a plastic film They are going to be fabulous!", 
    "great chairs...easy to put together....try pricing these at design with in reach...you can buy four for the price of one with them", 
    "I loved this purchase. it looks great and it feels really comfy for plastic chairs.", 
    "Love the mid century modern look but on a budget? These are the perfect thing. They look exactly like the originals and are very sturdy. Easy to put together and VERY comfortable. Even my ultra picky 6'6\" son finds them comfy. These have made my living room!", 
    "These are making a very stylish (and affordable) addition to our home. I'm using them as my office chairs (one for me and one for a guest), and we'll move them to the ends of the dining room table when we have guests. Already considering the two side chairs too...love these!", 
    "these are really great. pop in my dark color scheme. good buy.", 
    "i bought these chairs for my dining room, but they are really meant to be comfortable accent chairs for the living room. thats why i choose them actually- i wanted dining chairs that were both unique looking and comfortable.", 
    "These chairs are so modern, even though they are made in a retro style. The bright white plastic gives off an almost industrial feel.", 
    "great pair of chairs. my wife and i placed them in our breakfast nook. we love them because they are both stylish and comfortable, which allows us to linger over our coffee in the morning.", 
    "I adore these chairs. I bought a set for my living room and they look superb!", 
    "These copycat chairs, which mimic a very chic brand's product, are very stylish. You think the picture looks good, what til you see them in person!", 
    "Wow. I adore these chairs. There are so modern and clean. When they first arrived at my house, I dropped everything and put them in place. My dining room now looks chic and I didn't even have to break open my kid's piggy bank.", 
    "love these chairs. suberb packing. arrived quickly", 
    "comfortable, stylish, easy to clean - what more do you need?", 
    "Theses chairs are fabulous! Great mod chairs at a fraction of the price of the designer originals! Would definitely recommend to anyone. They are sturdy, stylish and great!", 
    "really cool chairs, gives my game room a 70's vibe", 
    "I got chairs couple months ago. Still in good shape.", 
    "I have four sons so I bought these chairs for their playroom so they would have something to sit on for like homework and stuff. So easy to clean!", 
    "I really wanted some modern chairs for my dining area. These are absolutely perfect. They are sturdy and sleek! You will not be disappointed!", 
    "I love these chairs!!! Simple to put together and they look so stylish.", 
    "Not bad quality for that price, I assembled them myself in about 10 minutes. Comfortable. I am satisfied...", 
    "I order the chairs and received them three days later. I am 95% satisfied with the quality and color of the chairs. The 5% missing is that I couldn't put one screw on. The chair seems safe enough for anyone to sit. I love them and can't bit the price!", 
    "The chairs are great, but they take some time to put together, and there are no instructions. I'm no slouch at assembling things, as I buy a lot of stuff that needs to be put together, but this assembly stumped me for a few minutes. There are two types of screw collars included in the package, and I couldn't figure out what goes where. I hope that I got it right, we'll know I was wrong if the chairs give out. I'd have been much happier with some basic info on assembly. Chairs look nice and were delivered very well packaged, no damage at all.", 
    "The chairs are decent quality, for this price I wasn't expecting a lot but overall they are solid. I stripped a few screws putting them together, the quality of the Allen bolts could be better, since I stripped two on one chair I couldn't tighten the screws enough so it is less stable than the other chairs, but I can go to the hardware store and get new bolts.", 
    "These chairs are so very cool. They are everything I expected and more. My kids thought they looked a little weird at first but, now that we have them, they love them. We use them everyday in our game room. I plan to order more very soon! Great price point, super fast delivery (2 days), very easy to assemble, and excellent quality.", 
    "They are nice quality and easy to put together, but definitely plastic. I love the look, but I'm not fooling anyone with the originals.", 
    "The chairs arrived in great condition. Very easy to assemble. The legs simply need to be screwed into the base. Perfect accent chair! Added colorful accent pillows and the chairs really make a nice addition to my living space.", 
    "I was very pleased with this purchase. The chairs came quickly, and were easy to assemble.", 
    "These are super cute. I love the modern shape and wooden colored legs", 
    "These chairs are fantastic! They look great and that are super easy to wipe down when the kids spill food or stain it with their dirty fingers. One caveat in terms of safety: my toddlers and 4-year-old love sitting in these chairs. However, they have tipped backwards on occasion when they sit in the chair backwards and lean in. Just a warning for those with kids to not let them turn around in their chairs as they are prone to do!!!", 
    "These chairs are great. They look very cool and extremely close to the real thing. The exceptions are the finish on the seats and the legs. The real ones are fiberglass with a glossy gelcoat. These are hard, but flexible, plastic with a matte finish. The legs of these are also a little lighter wood color than I was expecting, but not bad. As a note, the overall width of the seats is wider than I expected, giving a little more room to lounge than I expected. I thought they could only be sat upon in one way. I was a little worried about assembly from reading other reviews, but it was a snap. The key is that you have to get all of the screws started before tightening them all of the way. The other thing I found is that it helps to get them tightened then have someone sit in the chair and tighten them again from underneath. This eliminates any squeaking.", 
    "We got these easy to assemble a mat white chair with wooden legs. Little nicks in the legs due to packing but easy to sand & oil out. Very comfortable but they do not match the Wood Leg White Accent Chairs (Set of 2) which are pearl.", 
    "I have loved this chair for a long time so when I found these at overstock for such a good price I was thrilled! The items came well packed and were easy to assemble. One of the chairs was missing 2 rubber protections that protect the leg from scratching the floor but overstock quickly solved the problem! They are wonderful and I have NO complaints about the quality. I couldn't find much difference between these and the ones sold by Vitra at a more expensive price!", 
    "I love these chairs. We bought them for the reception area in our office. They are nice and sturdy and pretty comfortable. They will be really easy to clean with a magic eraser too. They were way more affordable then the designer version.", 
    "Good reproduction....the original is molded fiberglass and these are a matte finish molded plastic. Easy assembly. Comfortable. The look is exactly what we wanted for our mid-century modern style. Another great purchase from Overstock.", 
    "I'm very pleased with the chairs. Ordered two sets of two for our kitchen dining set and they are surprisingly comfortable! I agree with other comments though that these chairs are not meant for heavy, overweight people. They look terrific and have the mid-century modern look I was going for. Think the price is great for what they are!", 
    "fast delivery. easy to put together. nice finish--molded plastic is sturdy and very comfortable; wooden legs are poly-urethaned with understated semi-gloss (almost satin) finish that is very stylish. The chairs do certainly look masterful and elegant! the chair-size is slightly a bit smaller than anticipated--and certainly smaller than an original Eames chair and it is for this reason that I cannot rate it as \"excellent\", but the measurements provided in the specifications are indeed accurate. And despite this minor point, I will be ordering a second pair.", 
    "These chairs are fabulous! So easy to assemble and they're very sturdy and solidly constructed. Really great price compared to similar products else where.", 
    "These chairs are great. They went together fairly easily (only took about 10 minutes for 2 chairs), and they look fantastic. And they are comfortable! I would definitely buy these again.", 
    "Again very happy - chairs look good mixed with traditional style table.", 
    "Love these Herman Miller knock offs. I was skeptical and afraid of the assembly, but it was a snap. No problem and good quality. Also fits nicely under a desk.", 
    "Love these chairs. They are exactly like the fiberglass originals. I would have given this a 5-star rating if assembling it was easier. The brackets on the legs did not line up right with where they were suppose to go. Should have been an easy assembly but turned into almost an hour of wrenching the brackets so that they would stay flat/flush against the holes.", 
    "I love these chairs! They were easy to assemble and look great in my office.", 
    "We love these chairs!! I have a bit of an Eames obsession and it is so great to find such an excellent representation of this classic design. We also have the blue rocker (2 of them) and found those at ****. These are an excellent compliment to them. They are so comfortable and they are very well made. Others are saying that they are difficult to put together, but my husband put them together in under ten minutes all my himself ;D so I really don't think they are difficult. Highly recommended!", 
    "These chairs are true white plastic, as described, and match the dimensions given. Although the chairs seem a little short they are actually no shorter than most regular chairs. They look GREAT in my guest bedroom and look much more expensive than they were. Assembly was easy and shipping was prompt. Overstock proves to be amazing once again!", 
    "love it! i can't believe that i didnt see these earlier. i like these better than the eiffle version.", 
    "I knew I couldn't go wrong when I first eyed these chairs on Overstock. They're amazing! I highly recommend them to anyone who appreciates modern design, but doesn't want to spend the amount of money that these designs go for elsewhere. As usual, I'm really happy that Overstock.com exists!", 
    "love the chairs! exactly the look I wanted :) The chairs arrived 4 days after I ordered them, I was very pleased with the very prompt service. only problem was that the hardware that came with the chairs were not the right fit. that was easily remedied with a trip to the hardware store.", 
    "The chairs are nice and comfortable, a little tricky to put together need two people one to hold the legs in place and one to screw them in. I think they look cool with my dinning room table.", 
    "The chairs were delivered fast and were easy to assemble. Both chairs came in one box. Only parts to assemble: leg unit and seat. No tools required since an allen wrench was included. The chairs are not too low and fit at my small dining table fine. The plastic seats and wood legs appear durable.", 
    "Totally worth buying especially if you have been coveting an original Eames chair but cannot afford the huge price tag! The quality and ease of assembling the chairs was surprisingly AMAZING! Anyone on the fence about purchasing these chairs, I say, buy them now before the prices go up! They look pretty darn swell in my house. Overstock shipped them pretty fast and if you don't like them, return them. I haven't had any issues with returns with Overstock in the past, in fact, I've experienced great customer service from Overstock and it's always my go to site for good deals. Seriously, for this price, you're gonna love these chairs!", 
    "Delivered earlier than expected. Easy Assembly. Look nice (as advertised) a bit smaller, shorter than I expected, but are comfy. Good replica to Eames models. NICE!", 
    "Overstock did not send me the bolts to attach the legs. Each chair needs four bolts, and I received none with the chairs. I contacted Customer Support and it took them a week to send me the bolts, which I thought was not unreasonable at the time, considering that they'd have to locate them in the warehouse . . . but then the bolts arrived and there were only enough for one chair! VERY annoying, obviously. I still have not received the second set of bolts; they're on the way. That said, the chairs are comfortable, and I think they're a great compromise for people who want a mid-century modern / Eames look but don't have the budget for the real thing. The legs are great; the plastic is not as nice as actual Eames chairs, of course, but it is nonetheless sturdy.", 
    "These chairs are just as they appear in the picture and were very easy to put together. I love the modern look, especially at this price. They are even more comfortable than I thought they would be!", 
    "Loved these chairs. Easy to put together and the quality is better than I expected. I've seen the \"original inspiration\" for this chair, and i have to say, Overstock's product comes very close. Very happy~", 
    "I was hesitant to order these chairs after reading some of the comments about installation troubles but they were extremely easy to assemble. I was expecting to have to put all the parts of the base together but the base itself is already assembled. You just have to screw it into the bottom of the chair. It took about five minutes to tighten it up and the chairs are ready to go. They feel sturdy and look great. The molded seat is very sculptural and the wood dowel legs are a nice touch. I'm sure you could tell a difference if you were to place this chair next to an original or even a new licensed reproduction but if I paid four to five times as much for a chair, then I'd expect some differences. Even so, these chairs look perfect in my '60s era home. They're versatile and I plan to use them as Living room seating as well as extra Dining chairs if needed. I highly recommend them.", 
    "I highly recommend these chairs for the modern design enthusiast who is looking for a focal point in their home. Easy to assemble, very comfortable, and great value when compared to the designer chairs.", 
    "Lovely chairs that will work great with my modern look. The chairs are a bit light but the quality is very good. Comfortable to seat on but I plan on adding cushions to the base and back. Will buy more.", 
    "These chairs are great. Simple, but elegant, full of style and class. The lines and curves, the whole construction is giving the retro atmosphere for the living room, and they match perfectly with the furniture. I thought because they are made of plastic will not be comfortable enough, but they are. These chairs are easy to move around and to clean and of course, great price for them.", 
    "A little tricky to put together. There is some bending involved. Once they are together, they look great! I'm sure the real one look better, but these were so cheap!", 
    "Great chairs! Look awesome in my office! Really good price!!", 
    "Love the chairs. Great price and very sturdy. Thinking to get one more set.", 
    "These chairs are nice enough for the price I suppose. Actually, when I first opened the box and took out the chair I thought that the quality could be better for chairs that are almost $**** each. But if what you're after is the vintage modern look without the high end price tag, then these are definitely what you're looking for. But if you lust after the original fiberglass versions, then I suggest saving your money for the real deal, because these don't have the same depth and character as the fiberglass (because they're molded plastic, obviously). The bases go on pretty quickly and they're definitely sturdier than they look, overall I'm pretty pleased.", 
    "these chairs are brilliant! sturdy, excellent quality and so close to the real thing! Great for those of us who love modern vintage style but can't afford a pair of $850 chairs! Love these!", 
    "I love these chairs! I have a small, modern living room and I needed some extra seating that wouldn't look cluttered. They're pretty comfortable, but I've added some small pillows so that someone could feel comfortable sitting in them for a TV watching party. They were really easy to put together and are a great knockoff of the Herman Miller Eames chairs---for about 1/5 the price! *LOVE*", 
    "easy to put together (and i am no ***** master, mind you). i can hardly afford the original fiberglass shells but these do just fine. Quite sturdy and what lookers! aw yeah!", 
    "I purchased 8 of these chairs not realizing they were in pairs but decided I could use them as accent chairs in my bedrooms. They look amazing. It was a very good purchase. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good modern design on a budget. Very easy to put together. The whole purchase came very quickly and we were able to enjoy for a dinner we had planned.", 
    "Overtsock is always my first stop for modern classic replica furniture. I have purchased many items before and have never been disappointed. I purchased these chairs for my condo balcony considering they were not \"outdoor\" pieces, the price was so great that I didn't mind replacing them in a few years if need be. Based on other reviews, I imagined they would be made of somewhat of a cheaper looking material, but I was VERY surpised to see the excellent quality of these chairs when I received them. It took me about 15 minutes total to put them together! They look so great, I am looking for an alternative place to put them. The best price online (believe me, I searched) for a great looking chair.", 
    "These chairs are great for the price. They look very close to the real thing.", 
    "I purchased these chairs as accent chairs for our bedrooms. It is nice to have a chair to sit in when getting dressed. They a terrific knock-off of much more expensive mid-century designs, and you really can't beat the price. Putting them together wasn't difficult, but I would have felt more confident if they had included instructions.", 
    "The chairs are cute but not too sturdy. I bought these for my kids desks, but if adults sit in them too often the bolts that connect the seat to the legs just pop right off. Even if using them for kids only, the bolts need to be tightened often.", 
    "I bought these chairs to provide some additional seating for when guests come over and was having trouble finding attractive, affordable accent chairs. The chairs came within three days of ordering and arrived exactly as advertised. They look just like picture. The plastic material is similar to that used for children's playground equipment, which was a little disappointing. These chairs are not very comfortable to sit in. However, I placed a small cushion on the seat and now they are comfortable enough for brief periods of time. The chairs really do look great and are a great value for the price. I'm happy with my purchase.", 
    "These look great, sturdy, they are very similar to $500 versions in other stores (DWR), they look just like the picture, took 5 mins to assemble the base to the chair", 
    "I love this set of retro chairs and you just can't beat this price!! They look great in my modern loft.... very simple and cool. Super easy to assemble!", 
    "We love the chairs. Just check the legs - we had one that was cracked on the pre-assembled part.", 
    "The plastic is incredibly cheap, somewhat like children's playground equipment from the early 90s. The wooden legs are lighter, not the walnut they appear to be in the pictures. They were incredibly easy to put together; I was just getting over the flu, and it still took me only 15 min total for both chairs.", 
    "First of all, I ordered these chairs Monday morning and I received them this afternoon (Wednesday); that is incredibly fast shipping! The chairs were packed well for shipping. Upon opening, it only took my husband and I less than 15 minutes to put both chairs together. Now that they are sitting in our living room they look perfect. They are very modern and bigger than I expected ( in a good way). They are also surprisingly comfortable to set in. I would definitely recommend these chairs. Since I am in the belt buckle of the midwest it is very difficult to find affordable modern/contemporary home furnishings. Thanks to overstock for offering great prices and fast, cheap shipping.", 
    "These roomy chairs look great and were easy to assemble. The chairs work well with an eclectic furniture mix.", 
    "The overall design of these chairs is above very good. Although some of the \"designer\" manufacturing would include fiberglass and stainless steel, this version is excellent. The plastic is high quality, the legs are 100% wood w/black chrome - very happy with the look. The assembly however, was very painful. For starters, no instructions whatsoever, and although you can figure out where the legs would go - it's virtually impossible to tightened the last leg. The chrome is attached to the wooden leg and cannot bend very well therefore requiring you to strain your wrist to get the tiny screw to attach the leg to the platform seat. I ended up placing the screw underneath the leg, which fit but wasn't designed that way. Perhaps the design was to have the legs tight enough to hold weight. Regardless, it should've come with instructions. Nice product though.", 
    "Love the chairs! I actually can't handle all the complements I'm getting! No seriously they are perfect for my Mid-Century designs.", 
    "These do not even compare to a real Eames chair or any other imitation I have seen. The plastic is awful quality - very cheap!",
