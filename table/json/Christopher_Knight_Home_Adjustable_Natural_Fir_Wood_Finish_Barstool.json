    "These stools - we got two - are decent and will do the job (and fit the aesthetic) in our kitchen. They're are sturdy. The seat width is extra wide, which won't leave your behind, behind. The adjuster-mechanism works and looks cool (quell the squeaks with oil). We decided to finish the seats with some tung oil we had, definitely warms up the grain of the wood (and hopefully will help condition the cracks on their undersides). The wood grade is definitely a \"budget\" grade - it's mixed-grain with visible knots and one seat is denser than the other. Had we had the budget, we would have gone with the real thing (handmade in the USA). These stools are a good substitute though.", 
    "I purchased 2 of these stools. The welds are solid. The only issue is the black metal banding around the wood seat is not flush, so there is a gap around the wood in some areas. I do not mind this, as the piece is supposed to be rustic and casual. Also, the wood seat is not sanded smooth, but again, the piece is rustic. It's not enough to give splinters. The stool also needed some oiling to avoid a hideous squeek when rotated. For me, none of these issues were a problem and I love the stools. They look great and have a nice balance of being large enough to have a 'presence,' but small enough so as not to overwhelm a space. They were also a FABULOUSLY cost effective option. You just can not compare the price range of these to similar items from more elite sites. When I purchased, they were sold out, so I put my name on the wait list. I received an email letting me know they were in stock again. I purchased them at 10:00 a.m. and by 4:00 p.m. they were sold out again!", 
    "Very attractive barstool and great quality. There was a defect with one stool that I ordered and the company easily and promptly sent me a new one to replace it.", 
    "I have been looking for bar stools for over a year, now. I had fallen in love with a reproduction style similar to these stools by another company and also have been watching the actual vintage items on an online auction site. The price on these stools is what drew my attention; easily 1/3 the price of anything else I have looked at. The stools shipped for free, and arrived at my doorstep 8 days after ordering them, exactly as promised (and in the middle of Christmas). I am overall pleased with the quality of these stools, they are quite heavy. The seats screw up and down to adjust the height and provide swivel. They are counter height when screwed all the way down, would accomodate bar height adjusted up. The site says that there is a laquer finish; this must be on the iron base (which looks to be a black distressed finish over a lighter base) . The unfinished wooden seats are heavily grooved but not splinter-y, and there is a small gap between the iron band around the seat and the seat itself (this may be a pain to clean after some time, but otherwise doesn't bother me aesthetically). I removed the seats and stained/polyurehaned them so they would stand up to dalily use and cleaning, and while the seats were off two of them split partways through. I see now in other reviews that seat-splitting happened to others and they exchanged them, but I didn't report the problem to Overstock. The quality of the seat is the major reason I am rating them 4 instead of 5 stars. My kids and several of their friends have commented on how comfortable the stools are--although this might be more of a comparison to the fold up, plastic things we have been eeking by with for the duration of my stool search. :) All-in-all these stools provide just the industrial/antique look that I was wanting to find, without the fussiness of an antique item--just right for family living.", 
    "I ordered these stools because I saw a similar item in a pricey publication. I saved $259 on each stool and the quality is excellent. They arrived completely assembled and are a very sturdy stool. I am very pleased. They are exactly what I wanted.", 
    "The look so cool - heavy industrail chic - in person, they were a disappointment. The metal looked cheaper than the picture and was lighter than expected and the wood tops/seats were so dry that one was split. Had to sen them back. As usual, dealing with Overstock Customer Service was a breeze.", 
    "We had been looking for bar stools like this on a number of other sites, but the price was much higher. Im not sure what else those stools have, because these stools are well made of steel and wood. I think they are the most sturdy piece of furniture we now have! The only comment would be that the base is pretty wide, wider than the seat- so if youre trying to squeeze them into an area, these might not be the stools for you.", 
    "We stayed at a well designed rental cabin several years ago, and among one of the most striking features were their bar stools. I had never appreciated the chic industrial look...until I saw those stools! I asked the proprietor where the stools were purchased (very high end restorative furniture store.) I proceeded to go online with all intentions of buying the stools -- until I nearly gagged at the price. Sorry! This middle class working girl can't justify that! So, I tried to forget about the stools. Two years later we bought a new house, and I HAD to have those stools! Scoured the Internet. Found these on Overstock. Couldn't be happier! And at 1/3 the price! I purchased two stools, and purchased a third several months later. The first two had the naked fir wood seat. This wasn't a problem for me, as I had planned on staining and sealing it a darker color, anyway. The third stool had a layer of polyurethane on it. It appeared to be just one layer; possibly applied after the stool was assembled. I lightly sanded all the stools and stained them. The third one needed more than a light sanding to remove all the polyurethane. As a result, it's a slightly different shade than the other two. This is not a big deal for me, as I appreciate the hand-wrought look. We placed silicone pads on the feet to remove the possibility of floor scratches. The frame is not iron, but sprayed steel to appear just like iron. (We'd pay a helluva lot more for iron.) They spin the seat round to the appropriate height. I'm a short-legged girl of 5' 5\" and like it at it's shortest, where the seat is resting on the legs. These are fun, industrial chic, stylish stools which we have received many compliments. We received them in typical quick, Overstock time, and they were packaged nicely, preventing any damage. Well-made, the stools should last a long-time and sure to add an element of sophistication and design to your room!", 
    "one top was broken.. but overstock replaced .. happy with product and service", 
    "I fell in luv with this barstool months ago,and it sold out before I got one.Overstock put me on the waiting list and when it was available I bought it.I use it as a small table,because the seat part is very large.I am going to purchace another one.", 
    "I ordered 4 of these barstools and had high hopes, based on the reviews. They arrived promptly, were well packaged and were fully assembled. The base is attractive, rustic and very solid. The turning spool mechanism works great, my kids love spinning around. And these are pretty heavy, not prone to tipping. But the wood top is really poor quality. It looked like plastic. My husband removed the tops, sanded and stained them, so that they look a little better, but now, just a few months later, 2 of the seats have split. We are pretty happy with the base, so we are going to cut new tops instead of returning them, but buyer beware. Unless you have a woodworker in the house to make you new seats, I would pass on these.", 
    "I was happy with the 2 stools I ordered. They are very \"pottery barn\" ish! The stool rims are a bit more rustic/rough than I would have liked but overall a very good stool.", 
    "Nice heavy barstool. Looks great in my rustic house. Very well packed. Awesome for the price, have seen them much higher priced.", 
    "I love these stools! The price is quite good for the quality that you get in these industrial stools. I agree with another reviewer... I have seen similar ones priced at $250-$350. They are very sturdy and heavy. I stained the wood top and coated them with polyurethane. They look great in my kitchen. I am so happy with this purchase and with the delivery and the experience with Overstock.com!", 
    "when the stools arrived i found them to be much larger than expected and so the scale was all wrong for our small kitchen counter. they are very sturdy and pretty rustic....that's what i expected and they are the color i expected. the two negatives were that they were way too big in our kitchen and the wood seat was cracked. i returned the stools and have not found anything else better yet. i cannot fault overstock for the size of the stool....it's difficult to tell from a picture.", 
    "We were looking for something that fits our industrial setting yet wanted something rustic....These fit the bill to the \"T\". The price was fantastic too....we looked at ****, I bought 4 stools from the \"O\" for the price of one of theirs and much better quality I think. Now the seats are bare wood...very rustic but I didn't mind.. I sanded them down a bit a placed my own color stain on them, then a coat of poly. The are now mahogany in color and the perfect seat for my apothecary bar. I'll wait until these go on sale again to pick up a few more.", 
    "These stools go perfectly in my home.. It was exactly as pictured and very very sturdy! I don't think they will fall apart anytime soon.", 
    "We built a cantina out back and bought eight of these to use as our bar stools. They are heavy duty, so they are great for holding up to the elements. Everyone loves that they can adjust their stool to their individual height, including the kids. I decided to varnish the seats each spring to keep them shiny and easy to clean. The wood seats cracked from the Colorado freeze and thaw and dryness but we're ok with that.", 
    "Exactly what we were looking for, and best price we could find", 
    "These stools are absolutely beautiful. They are sturdy and well made. The seat is a nice distressed wood look and the swivel is an added bonus. I placed them at your kitchen counter under Edison light pendants. Love them.", 
    "Too big for the space but nice stool.", 
    "bought three and just bought one more. Look nice and the fact they can be bar or counter height is wonderful", 
    "Well made need extra protection on feet when putting on wood floors to keep from scratching.", 
    "Love this piece for my wine room.", 
    "I love this barstool! It is comfortable, looks great and is very sturdy.", 
    "Big and cluncky looking. Chairs came scratched and had hardly no packing supplies.", 
    "Tired of reading reviews? I was! Disregarded all the nitpicking reviews and went with the positive ones, glad I did! Bought 3 of these and think they're great! Especially for the price.", 
    "Purchased 4 of these stools for our new home during construction. They look great in the house!", 
    "Nice base. Wood tops rough, less than desirable", 
    "Very sturdy great looking and adjustable! Great price also", 
    "I have 2 of these and absolutely love them. The seats are very large but comfy.", 
    "I wasn't expecting these to last forever but one of the barstools seat has cracked down the middle and we have only had them for 7 months. Really bummed since they are nice looking barstools.", 
    "These barstools look fantastic - very rustic & trendy. However, they aren't very comfortable (but thats to be expected with a wood top). They swivel, due to the adjustable feature, which can be kind of annoying.", 
    "This fit exactly what we were looking for. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the wood on the top is fairly rustic, they could have done a better job finishing it. But overall a solid stool for the money.", 
    "Love, love, love these barstools! We purchased 4 of these for our new home. The style is exactly what I was looking for. They are sturdy and have a nice size seat. I have no complaints. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "We love these bar stools. We have several at the counter in our retail store for customers to sit at and I just bought 4 for home. Very well made and they have the perfect rustic charm.", 
    "I purchased these stools to go with my kitchen counter bar top. The stools adjust so that both children and adults can sit comfortably and eat or do work at the bar. I am in love these and am so happy that I purchased them!", 
    "These are great looking stools and solid. One of the seats was cracked and continued to crack more over the 2 weeks that we owned them. Also, on of the welds broke underneath the seat. I called in and got GREAT customer service for a replacement. I would give customer service a 5+ rating!!", 
    "These are great--they're rustic, bold, and I'm sure will hold up well. They were a great purchase.", 
    "I have young grandsons who come over often, I can adjust the height of the stools to accommodate them. Beyond that, they like to twirl on them. Fun and function! Good looking, too.", 
    "T ordered 3 of these bar stools an they came quickly. The metal frames are heavy duty but the wood on the seat is very light weight and unfinished. The metal frames are black with a silver highlight. The seats came off easily so I stained and sealed them and I repainted the frame in an oil rubbed bronze. The seats adjust/spin easily. They are a good value for the price.", 
    "Sturdy, well built stools with a nice wide seat (15\"). Look great. They are adjustable so will fit at a counter or bar. This is the second house I have bought them for.", 
    "Love these stools---great value and very sturdy.", 
    "They arrived on time and in good condition. They updated my kitchen and are much easier for our grandchildren to get on and off than our old ones.", 
    "Great bar stools but they are big. More for in a camp house.", 
    "Love these barstools, they are adjustable and have so much character.", 
    "The look is exactly what I wanted and the price was a lot less than others I had seen similar in nature. I gave a 4 because I ordered two and the top are completely different wood colors. I kept them as I was going for a vintage look but others may not appreciate. Also one of the tops has cracked. Still useable but annoying.", 
    "Almost exactly how pictured -- seat is darker and a bit rough. Love the adjustable height.", 
    "Like this barstool so much I have FOUR!! Love the style and its stands up to daily wear very well!", 
    "I bought this for a Christmas gift to go with a \"hair cow rug\". It is in the guitar corner of my house and goes perfect with theme. It's good quality and comfortable.", 
    "Seat is comfortable and adjusts for any height as long as it fits under the counter.", 
    "Ordered three of these for our kitchen peninsula. Stools are very well made and have held up well to our three energetic boys. Love the industrial look.", 
    "Excellent quality, everyone loves my new look!", 
    "Like their rustic look. However, I think the wood slap still needs extra work. I'm actually taking them out to sand and paint them.", 
    "Solid addition to my kitchen. Well made and very sturdy", 
    "Come out of the box perfect! Adjustable and sturdy.Have purchased several times and love them.Finish is versatile for many styles.", 
    "Love that the seat isn't small like others similar to this. Very sturdy with rubber nubs on feet. May order a 3rd!", 
    "These were the same stools we saw at 2 stores here where we live for $250. VERY GREAT PRICE and good quality. You will be happy with what you get for the money.", 
    "Love this stool. Well made and large", 
    "Pretty stools. Don't really like the wood on top though. Looks kind of cheap & fake. Otherwise nice.", 
    "Love these stools! They arrived fast & in perfect condition. They are heavy-duty which is what I was looking for. They are larger than they appeared in picture & look nice in my kitchen. I would definitely recommend purchasing them!", 
    "These are great. The only thing we do wish the wooden parts of the seats were sealed. Easy enough for us to do ourselves. This height for a stool was hard to find. The metal construction looks even better in person.", 
    "Seat broke totally off within 1 year of purchase.", 
    "nice bar stool; sturdy; we liked that it is adjustable and works for a rather high bar area; seat is a good size but foot rest is too low.", 
    "This stool offers a large seat, it is sturdy beautiful and have had so many compliments!", 
    "Stylish but Uncomfortable. A few of our stools cracked, but we had them in a restaurant, so this may not happen in a residential setting .", 
    "love the stool, but the wood split in several areas causing a snag risk every time someone sits on it.", 
    "I love these stools, we have had them for quite awhile and would definitely buy them again. I like how they can be adjusted for each persons height.", 
    "Best price ever! Sturdy, works with many different decors. I like the ability to adjust the height of the seat.", 
    "I wasn't sure that the quality would be there when I ordered these stools but was pleasantly surprised. They are very sturdy, they are adjustable and just perfect for under counter island height that I was looking for all at a great price. They are very rustic and I love the foot rest bar. I'm not sure it's real wood on the seat base but seems to be very durable.", 
    "This stool works perfect for my desk. Stylish and very durable.", 
    "We found the stool to be a well crafted, light weight and comfortable piece.", 
    "These arrived fully assembled in the box which was great. They have a nice rustic look to them unlike some that I was seeing elsewhere. The tops are slightly darker than what is pictured and the wood definitely has a distressed/hand scraped texture. For the price of these, I'm quite impressed.", 
    "I received 3 stools and each was in very good condition, packed well and fully assembled. Much heavier than anticipated and seats larger than expected, which was a nice surprise. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "beautiful and well made looks like the wild wild west", 
    "Solid constructed and very attractive stool The seat is unfinished and catches on every material. Not for people concerned about snagging their clothes.", 
    "Loved that these came in once peice! Great sturdy stools, the feet have a soft bottom that is perfect for wood floors. Bought 4 stools - 1 has a crack in the seat but not bothersome enough to send back", 
    "Great Quality! Love these barstools...purchased for myself 2 yrs ago....purchased more for a gift!", 
    "Overall I'm happy with my purchase, although sitting for long periods of time tend to hurt.", 
    "Stylish rustic stool. No assembly required!", 
    "These chairs were exactly what I was looking for and are extremely sturdy. Color of wood and metal are perfect for and industrial/farm house style. Only down side is that the wood is not completely smooth so some fabrics are a tad sensitive sound stool top to snagging.", 
    "These stools look and function fantastic, but two of them have cracks in the wood tops (upon delivery)...I'm guessing from temperature changes. It's kind of annoying but would rather chalk it up as \"character\" rather than waste the time to send them back.", 
    "No one enters our kitchen without commenting on the fabulous stools at our counter. We love them and they were less expensive than less attractive options! Buy them", 
    "I do love this stool, it actually has a personality of its own. I am only giving 3 stars because the seat was cracked when delivered which was a disappointment.", 
    "Sturdy and look great. Can't ask for more. Adjustable.", 
    "I loved the stools, and after looking at several places, found theae were the best price. That said, I had to return them. It broke my heart, but they were too large, just wouldn't fit in my smallish kitchen. But the return was as painless as possible. I wanted them for a table ,they are counter stools.", 
    "I bought this to use as work bench stool. It is perfect !", 
    "Love them. Perfect for apartment and love adjustable height so if we move they can fit counter or bar height", 
    "Loved these industrial looking stools. Work well in kitchen area.", 
    "These stools look like they cost a lot more than I paid for them, but the welding on the seat is a bit sketchy. My husband, who is of average height and weight sat on one and it broke immediately. The other one has held up just fine.", 
    "This barstool was great. It is sturdy and the perfect height for my tall bar. It is a great price & definitely exceeded my expectations. I would definitely recommend this barstool to anyone who is wanting an industrial look!", 
    "good solid sturdy chairs, tops are nice and wide as well", 
    "I love it but the seat is cracked. I didn't want to send it back bc of how large it is.", 
    "They look wonderful in our home! Great quality!", 
    "I was very disappointed in these stools. Very cool in the picture, but when delivered the seats of the stools were very rough! Someone would definitely get a splinter or pick your clothes. One of them the seat was put on crooked, plus rough and splintery.", 
    "Great sturdy seating.Get compliments from everyone who sees them.", 
    "Absolutely perfect for our new home. They adjust high enough to fit the tall bar and look wonderful against granite, hickory cabinets and mahogany floors. We love them.", 
    "happy with my bar stools and especially happy with overstocks customer service! I would recommend", 
    "Sturdy, industrial looking. Exactly the ones we saw at a bar on hell's kitlen. Cool looking and excellent craftmanship!", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for at a great price. Exactly as described.", 
    "Great seat space, sturdy and a wonderful replica. Quite handy in the kitchen as a support for tired, arthritic legs.", 
    "Purchased this stool for a friend/teacher who has a problem on occasion standing. He loves it, finds it comfortable, stable, adjustable to his needs and a compatible design with different surroundings. Great purchase and would recommend to all.", 
    "We bought four of these stools a couple years ago and decided we needed two more. These industrial look stools are heavy-duty and we think are nicely made. Our home is a modern decor, with industrial accents (steel beams, etc.) however, the juxtaposition of the industrial stools against the modern elements of our kitchen look great. We are so very pleased and you will be too. Fast shipping adds 'icing to the cake.\"", 
    "Like all of my overstock purchases, perfect! Thank you so much for the quality of product and great service.", 
    "Still in the box but they look great!!", 
    "I loved these bar stools even more when I saw them in person! They are pretty comfortable and I get compliments on them all the time.", 
    "I absolutely love the look of these stools! They are big which is fine for the space I have them. I was a little worried about purchasing because of some of the other reviews saying the wood seats split. I bought them anyway because I really liked them and most of the reviews were good. The wood seats are a little rough. One of the seats did split already so I was a little disappointed. Over all they are great to look at but maybe not the best for use.", 
    "Very sturdy. I was going for country farmhouse, but I must say these are little bit on the country cowboy side for me. No one really notices it till I pointed out, so I stopped doing that of course. They're bigger than what they look so if you have a lot of heavy people coming over there great for that. Once again I feel like I got a really good deal from overstock, because the ones in the store are made very cheap.", 
    "Love the look of the stools. Looking forward to using them soon.", 
    "They are great!! Exactly as described!!", 
    "I LOVE these stools. The metal base is sturdy and attractive. The seats are wide and comfortable. The caveat... the wood is very low quality. I ordered 4 stools and 3 of the 4 seats were completely split down the middle. Customer service was great and they sent me 3 replacement seats. However, 2 of the 3 replacement seats were damaged. Customer service has been great again and they are sending me 2 more replacement seats. I recommend these chairs if you can stand the frustration of replacing any damaged seats. I will probably buy some higher quality wood in the future and replace all of the seats.", 
    "Love them! I can use them at a high bar, at the kitchen table (which is a little lower) or at the dining room table. Very versatile.", 
    "I bought these from Overstock before I had seen them anywhere. They are heavy, sturdily built and perfect sitting next to myFrench Country island. Now, I see them, everywhere, not the quality of mine, but I did like having something different. Kids love them because the seat spins around to adjust the height. These are by far the nicest stools of this style I have seen.", 
    "Fantastic for the price. Very heavy and well constructed.", 
    "I ordered two of these bar stools. They arrived in about a week, arrived in perfect condition with no assembly required. They are very study and high quality. Look just like the photo. I highly recommend these!", 
    "Very high quality for the price!", 
    "I am in love with these stools. I bought 3 of them for a tall bar- it is hard to find stools this tall. Pros: 1. Versatility: I like that they are versatile and easily change size and if we move to a house with a different size bar we don't have to buy new barstools. 2. Large seat accommodates various size backsides! They are very sturdy too ;) 3. When you roll it all the way up it stops, rather than continuing and having the top of the stool fall off. Anyone with kids can appreciate this feature. 4. Comes pre-assembled. woo hoo! I hate when you get a piece of furniture in tiny pieces you have to have a degree in engineering to assemble and stools can be especially difficult to get them to balance right. 5. It can go with many different kinds of decor. I have it in a modern farmhouse style room. I think it would go with farmhouse, french country, rustic, industrial, vintage, western and its trendy enough now to go with modern style. It is neutral enough to fit in with all these different styles but has enough unique detail to be interesting. 6. Customer service! One of mine arrived with a significant dent probably during shipping since there was a hole in the box and I contacted them and they took care of everything right away. They were amazing. 7. Price- these are very popular right now the price is very good for this item. Cons:1. The tops are rough enough to pull at delicate fabrics in clothing. They are rustic if you like the unfinished look this is something you can expect to deal with. They are finished a little bit it's not raw wood.2. Because they are adjustable they are constantly at different sizes and if you are OCD (like someone who has to itemize their customer review) this can drive you a little nuts! My solution is to keep them either all the way rolled up or all the way rolled down so they are even. 3. One squeaks a little when it rolls easy DIY fix.Overall I am very happy with these stools and would recommend them as a good product.", 
    "nice broad seat, solid base and heavy stool. Looks great in our kitchen!", 
    "You will not be disappointed if you are interested in this product.", 
    "They are beautiful, solid, and were priced below what I would have expected for the quality!", 
    "Heavy duty, real wood, 360 degrees swivel, perfect for the vintage look....love it!", 
    "Best looking and quality stools. Unfortunately, they were too tall for our area, so we had to return them.", 
    "Was so excited when the came!! Look amazing, feel so sturdy!! But after 3 days the wood split. Its not one solid piece and there is not any seal.", 
    "These arrived fully assembled, in perfect condition. Like others said, the tops seem like the only possible fragile part, but could easily be replaced. The base and step portion are very sturdy and well-made. I think these will stand up to the abuse of our pre-teen son and his friends better than our previous stools.", 
    "Love this bar Stools. Just as expected.", 
    "Look great and good quality", 
    "We absolutely love these bar stools! They are perfect and adjust to just about any level. They are very sturdy and perfect for a farm kitchen!", 
    "I looked at similar looking stools at Bed, Bath & Beyond, Target and TJ Maxx. All of those stores had sort of similar stools for less $ but all were of lesser quality. This Christopher Knight barstool is SOLID and the mechanism for making the seat go up or down works well.", 
    "These stools can double as end tables in smaller spaces avoiding the need to bring in extra seating for pop ins!", 
    "Look great in my kitchen.", 
    "I love these stools... stylish and great quality!!", 
    "In moving in to our new home I needed counter height bar stools. To get something that coyld handle constant use from a large family was a must. These bar stools are exactly what I was looking for!", 
    "Love the fact that these are adjustable..receive many compliments..wide seat and appear very sturdy.", 
    "Lee have been using these stools for over a year now with no complaints. Durable and well made.", 
    "too big! its good for a very spacious room", 
    "Great quality for the price and when one came damaged, Overstock was great to work with.", 
    "Love these barstools, very sturdy and just the right size for my bar space!", 
    "I love these bar stools, they look awesome in my kitchen. One of them had a split seat, but Overstock quickly sent me a UPS waybill for the return shipping, and I had a new barstool sent to me within a couple days. Great customer service, very happy with these stools.", 
    "Look Great! Love the price! 2 seats arrived cracked, had replacements in less than a week. Super pleased!", 
    "Awsome! Better than expected.", 
    "Just like the ones from the expensive magazines. They work well in our rustic devoted home. Love how you can adjust the height.", 
    "Such a great look and an even better price.", 
    "love them! great quality and really look nice by our granite island.", 
    "I love these barstools adjustable, high quality and comfortable - all for a great price too!", 
    "The stools are solid and sturdy. Just what we were looking for. Love the metal and wood look!", 
    "We have 5 of these stools and love them!", 
    "These stools are very sturdy and comfy. One came with slight ding on the wood, but I didn't feel like returning. They are very wide.", 
    "Stool came fully assembled. THANK YOU. We like the style and quality.", 
    "Love these stools as they fit perfect with my reclaimed wood gathering table! My kids love the fact they can make them the perfect height! Sturdy and not a tipping concern since there are 4 legs", 
    "Great stools for bars that are slightly high or low. I bought these to fit my bar that is 3\" taller than the standard and they are great. Nice rustic feel and very sturdy.", 
    "I love these bar stools. They are made very well-very sturdy and a little bit on the heavier side so as to not tip. They can adjust up or down according to the height that you need. The wood on top is made to be rustic. It appears to be rough but that is in appearance only. I have had no issues as to clothing being caught or \"picked\". The delivery was quick and the product was packed nicely. I would not hesitate to recommend these stools to anyone.", 
    "This barstool works great as an extra seat in my office. It raises and lowers with a spin, is well constructed and solid. Love it!", 
    "I love the barstools. They look great and better than expected.", 
    "Perfect for our kitchen bar & style....we stained the seats a darker, richer color.", 
    "Bought 2, liked so much, bought another 2! These are great since the are adjustable for the seating height. Nice size seating area, gives a very sturdy feel while seated.", 
    "So happy I ordered these stools. Far more substantial and beautiful than similar pieces I saw in various stores.", 
    "Love the look of these barstools! They are sturdy and have a great eye catching design. We did put a couple of coats of polyurethane on them just for extra protection against kids. Highly recommend;)", 
    "These were exactly as stated and I love how they look with my counter height island. Very comfy.", 
    "Wonderful bar stools. Well made, comfortable and sturdy. Really like the ease of adjusting the height. Upon arrival, there was a strong chemical smell from the finish which has since faded. One of the wooden seats has started to split which, from other reviews, I expected. But overall, they are functioning well, look great and I expect will hold up for a long time. Overstock customer service is very responsive. Shipping was fast.", 
    "VERY STURDY AND LOOKS NICE IN DININGROOM.", 
    "Came assembled and looked beautiful. Very comfortable and good size", 
    "Bought 10. One of the seat welds cracked/broke, almost causing injury to my guest who was sitting in it. On another chair, the wood seat is splitting. Other than that, these seats are GREAT! Nothing but the highest quality and work best when no one sits on them.", 
    "When shopping for counter stools, we were looking for something with an industrial look that wasn't completely made of cheap materials. Do not confuse these for wrought iron, they are definitely not that, however this stool definitely fits our needs.I was worried at first that they would be very light and thus cheap feeling. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the stools had some nice heft to them. Rugged enough to take a beating and various body types. Base:Didn't feel any buckling or creaking or wobbling of any sort, the stool supported weight just fine and felt very sturdy. The threaded swivel bar worked just fine, it has no give even if you raise it up super high. Each stool came with soft pads on the feet to prevent scratching which was nice. Top:The wood on the top is definitely cheap. You wouldn't know looking at them but if you tap on the top, the stool makes an almost bongo drum sound. The wood is very thin which explains why they have so many braces underneath the seat. At least they reinforced it correctly. Overall:Even though they are a bit bigger than we thought, they are still very nice stools. If you're looking for a mid range stool to hold you over for 5 years or so, these are perfect.", 
    "We LOVE these swivel stools in our new kitchen at the island. Got 1 and immediately ordered another one. Very sturdy.", 
    "Completely satisfied with these very sturdy and handsome looking bar stools.", 
    "Style fits great but it's a bit tall for the space - my fault - still like this impulse purchase", 
    "Great stool. Just as pictured. Not the most comfortable but it's more for looks.", 
    "They arrived quickly and fully assembled, which was convenient. They are a sturdy, resistant piece that looks exactly like the image shown. The fact that they adjust to height was perfect for me. I absolutely love my stools.", 
    "The barstool is well designed, built, and is highly attractive. If you want a rustic look, this stool will have it.", 
    "Great stool. Rustic and sturdy", 
    "I love these stools! After looking for months, I couldn't swallow spending $$$ per stool for a similar style. They are bigger than I was expecting and I was pleasantly surprised at how heavy and sturdy they are! I couldn't be happier with my decision. The wood seat does feel a bit unfinished, but it's not bad. They don't catch on my clothing which is what I was worried about. LOVE THEM!!", 
    "Needed an extra tall barstool and this one meet that well. Good quality, heavy and good looking.", 
    "Love these stools. They are a wider than expected so I was only able to use two. Also the ability to adjust the height is what sold me as I plan to redo my kitchen in the near future and know my bar counter will be lower. I did dislike the blonde wood so I stained an espresso color and they came out really well. If you use a wax after the stain, make sure its on a warm day so you can easily buff the wax out of the creases of the wood.", 
    "Very nice style and quality. Looks great in my game room.", 
    "Love, love these stools! They look great and are comfortable to sit on. Come completely assembled, so you just take out if the box. Very well made! Keepers!", 
    "Great stool. After buying three of the real wood seated stools from the same manufacturer I saved a few dollars and bought 6 of these. Has painted British flag on veneer fir. I carefully sanded off the paint (didn't want it to show through new paint job) and painted the seat to match d\u00e9cor of our kitchen. Veneer sanded easily but be careful on the edges...I sanded through the edge on one of them but it painted over nicely. Stools look fantastic and arrived carefully packaged individually wrapped in bubble wrap inside heavy cardboard box. Seats come off easily to sand and paint held on with about 10 wood screws. I've purchased 9 total stools from this manufacturer and all arrived in flawless, perfect condition.", 
    "These stools are very nice. Built well. We wanted something a little more rustic or industrial looking and they fit the bill. The wood seats are a bit rough but after a little use became more smooth but again they were what we were looking for.", 
    "Great bar stool. Same product as seen elsewhere for much higher price.", 
    "Sturdy, looks great and love how the height adjusts by easily swiveling the seat. Saw these same stools at high end retailer at twice the price. No assembly required just lifted out of box. Very happy with them", 
    "These bar stools have a unique rustic look that add character to our kitchen. I love the look, but underestimated the size. (the ONLY reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5). Great quality, and look great!", 
    "Solid build. Wood top is rustic rough, but easily replaced if ever necessary.", 
    "Absolutely LOVE my barstools! They are very sturdy and seem to be made VERY well (I've had them for several months now). I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box (in a good way)...the seat part was larger than I had expected. I get compliments on them all of the time. VERY good barstool especially when you find others that are similar, but not near as sturdy and cost more. GREAT value!!", 
    "I wanted to create a rustic and modern look in my kitchen. I chose these and bought three for my kitchen island. I LOVE how they look. They have a good size (comfortable for even the most ample bottoms) and weight. They arrive in separate boxes, with no assembly required. The wood seat tops are rustic and unfinished but not scratchy. I'm pleased with my purchase and highly recommend them. Excellent product!", 
    "These are absolutely the coolest barstools ever! They are more comfortable than they look and just add a nice touch to my kitchen", 
    "The stool is super stylish for the money. It comes fully assembled so there is nothing to do except take it out of the box and enjoy. The only problem I had was one of the wood tops was warped and had a little crack, but, as usual, overstock has amazing customer service and took care of it right away. My kids have the best time swiveling around on them. Very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "Quality as good or better then *** or similar stores - but at less than half their outlet price!", 
    "Amazing stools. Got so many compliments. Highly recommended!", 
    "We love these chairs in our kitchen. They slide right under our counter and are great for the kids too. They are comfortable too. We wanted fabric chairs but this was the best option with 3 little kids :)", 
    "I wanted a barstool , shabby chic look , and not too cumbersome with my bar in kitchen/ fam room. These fit the bill perfectly. I would as others recommend put a polyurethane or tung oil coat on the seat as it is slightly rough. Very sturdy, the seat area is large, and I even noticed they had something very similar in a model home near me, so even decorators went for the same look! Great price too, definitely recommend !", 
    "Good looking bar stools. They are sturdy and heavy. I was really pleased with how they look. They are exactly what I wanted. The top is rough jury like other reviewers stated. I haven't bothered to sand it, though.", 
    "I ordered 2 of these stools for my bar. They come assembled and are packaged well. They are heavy and well made, the seat is distressed wood and looks old and weathered, this is exactly the look I wanted. I have 6 teens who use these bar stools on a regular bases and they are holding up well. I will be ordering 2 more for the bar.Note: The metal feet have a small plastic cap to protect the flooring. I found that I needed to add the felt pads to the feet to minimize the scratching on my concrete floors.", 
    "I ordered 3 of these bar stools. The picture doesn't do them justice. They were fully assembled when they arrived. A plus for me! Nice and heavy with a large seat. Originally was looking for a stool with a back because I have 4 kids. Nicely surprised to find that it is VERY difficult for them to flip over it. They love the adjustable seat too so they can sit up higher if needed. The wood is unfinished, but it gives the overall look of rustic/industrial look, which worked perfectly for my kitchen. I will probably be putting on a clear coat varnish for easy cleanup. Bottom line: LOVE these stools! LOVE the industrial look! LOVE the price and quality!", 
    "Amazing stools! Love how fast they were delivered too! We get compliments on them everytime someone comes over to our home! Everyone thinks they are from restoration hardware because of the great quality! Awesome quality and price. So glad we found these and didn't have to pay 300 per stool at restoration. I hope they keep these in stock they are great! The kids love how they spin up and down too! They fit my husband comfortably and he's 6'2 215 lbs. great size seat!", 
    "While I love the look and style of these stools, (I purchased 5 of them) I have to admit I was a little disappointed in the condition/color of the wood seats. Out of the 5 I bought, 3 of them have deep cracks in the wood and the color is very inconsistent, none of the stools match each other. I think for the money, I was expecting a more \"refined\" finish on the wood, they are very rough and one even splintered at the edge. All in all, I wouldn't send them back, I love the style and they are beautiful in my kitchen, but I will end up either replacing or refinishing the wooden seats.", 
    "Make sure to read the reviews. If you're okay with what you read then you're all set! These are great stools and are exactly as pictured. They are solid construction, the medal is very thick and sturdy. I love the look of them. Basically the only downsides I've seen are things people have mentioned perviously but these were EXACTLY what I was looking for. A rustic industrial look for a fraction of the price you could find elsewhere.", 
    "I love these barstools, they are just what I wanted. They look just like they are pictured. The seat is rough so you might want to sand them, I haven't and no problems with clothes snagging. I bought these so I could raise them when our grandsons come to visit and this has worked out great for them.", 
    "I looked all over for some stools for my dining bar that would go with my farmhouse look and be sturdy enough for my BIG 22 year old son. These fit the bill exactly!", 
    "Exceeded my expectations in size , shape quality and price. I will definitely be looking to by more furniture and other products from overstock.com As I am in the Remodel business, I will also be referring all of my customers to do the same Very Satisfied Customer Hal M**** Edmond Deck & Patio Edmond Oklahoma", 
    "The barstools arrived promptly, boxes in good condition. Barstools easy to put together. Look fantastic at our basement bar. Very comfortable. The seats could be removed and stained - that is our plan eventually.", 
    "I bought this stool to serve as my only seat in a small kitchen, much like the product photo. It looks so great with the other rustic touches in my space, like industrial marquee lights and a hanging ladder, but also works well with my modern glass tiles and granite. This stool was a bit pricier than I wanted to spend, but it's high quality and I love that the seat is adjustable/swivels. Great buy!", 
    "Love the stools! There wasn't any assembling required, just pulled it out of the box, spin seat to height you want...easy! Looks great!", 
    "I purchase this stool to be used as a plant stand. It looks fabulous. I always get compliments. If you plan on using it as a stool you should pay attention to the other reviews that discuss the seat being unfinished wood.", 
    "They are perfect with my wooden spool table! Sturdy construction and very attractive!", 
    "For the price this is an excellant buy! I will be ordering more.I been wanting for one a long time to purchase this style and love it.. As stated before I will sand down the seat a bit. A little rough, other than that no problems. Looks awesome in my kitchen.", 
    "My wife and I saw these at a coffee shop located at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport (PHX) and loved them. They are heavy duty with a screw-type seat which can be used for both swivel and height adjustment. We bought two for our kitchen island .loved them so much that we bought a third. They are a good size for our counter-top level island and the fact that they don't have a seat back makes them blend in better. The adjustable height makes them fit any size counter ..low or high top. The only negative (if there is one) is the natural fir wood is rough. However, a bit of sanding will take care of that. Depending on the finish you're looking for, you could also put a stain or poly finish on it as well. Excellent buy!", 
    "We can not describe how happy we are with this bar stools . So glad we got it! :) and it was great price!", 
    "I LOVE my barstools! They are so well made and look INCREDIBLE in my kitchen! HIGH quality AND Overstock got them to me so quick! I would definitely recommend these to anyone for purchase. You will not be dissatisfied!", 
    "We bought this for a fold away desk we use for the kids homework. It is a little tall but very well made. It's very sturdy, heavy and has a roomy seat.", 
    "Simply love these barstools. Very comfortable. The color of the fir wood is a little darker than depicted in the picture but that is not a problem.", 
    "These barstools are NO ASSEMBLY= awesome! They are sturdy and wide, and can be adjusted to virtually any height to fit each person's needs. They look just like they are from Ballard designs or restoration hardware for a fraction of the price. LOVE!", 
    "I love the way the stools look, but the wood on one of them had a large crack and I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it. I would recommend it with a caveat.", 
    "Love our new bar stools. Really important that the height is adjustable", 
    "Looked at a number of alternatives. Ultimately decided on these and am very pleased. Well constructed, great value, great design.", 
    "These were delivered within 2 days. I stenciled \"frenchy\" numbers on them ( I bought 3 ) then lightly distressed the stenciiling. I get lots of compliments", 
    "After reading other reviews I believe they changed the wood for the seat as theres no roughness and it actually looks weathered and worn. Its stable and doesnt feel cheap.", 
    "This barstool looks great in our basement! I like the \"industrial\" look to it. I would recommend:)", 
    "I purchased this stool to use as a bedside table in a small space. Great quality , price and it looks AWESOME!", 
    "This style bar stool is a bargain here at overstock. Combined the already low price with a discount code and free shipping. No one could get near this bargain. Product is perfect. It's hard to find a stool that will adjust as high as this one", 
    "We have had these stools for a while now, and love them. They have a nice industrial look and it's great that the height adjusts. A couple of things to consider.... when the stool is at it's highest setting - bar stool height, the seat is a little wobbly, so I would recommend for counter height (lowest) for everyday use. Also the wood used for the seat isn't the best quality wood, but overall for the price, its a great stool and we get tons of compliments on it! I have recommended it to lots of friends and family.", 
    "I wanted something that would look industrial or at least old/rustic mechanical. Hard to describe, but my kitchen is craftsman-looking, and these just made it look like a country kitchen. I sent them back (which, unfortunately, was a pain). Customer service was confused by the return labels (kept sending me one label for the entire weigh of the two, rather than 2 labels). It was a pain, but they made it right.", 
    "I bought 2 of these stools and love them. The only problem was the wood in one of the stools split after about 2 weeks but overstock sent a new seat fast. I was watching these for a while and shopped around for a while but this was the best price I found. Great industrial look and comfortable.", 
    "Overall a great product. I ordered 2 to go with a tall bar table. The color of the wood is different on one of the stools. But I guess natural variation will happen on a natural material Overall, I am very happy with my purchase", 
    "These stools are great, they adjust to many different heights. Love the footrest at the bottom, my only concern is that I may have to put a layer of polyurethane on the seat it's self due to the fact you could possibly get a splinter. Great buy", 
    "What a great price & assembled straight out of the box!! Function great, just love these!", 
    "I purchased 2 stools - it goes well with my new bar.", 
    "These are sturdy, large, barstools that look great in our white modern farmhouse kitchen. (Great rustic elements) The wooden seat is not quite the natural color that it appears on the screen; it has a bit of an almost slight metallic sheen the only way I can think to describe it) but it goes great with the metal legs and also with the white kitchen cabinets and black cup pull handles in our kitchen. They do not wobble, feet are well padded for use on a hard wood floor. GREAT value for the price. We have 5 little ones and our furniture is put to the test on a daily basis---these will hold up well I believe.", 
    "Absolutely love them! They are sturdy and of good weight and I really like the vintage look.", 
    "These stools have the exact look I wanted for my island. The quality is great. I do think I will apply some oil to the seat or maybe a clear varnish. The wood is raw and should be sealed. The shipment came quickly and my overall experience was great. My husband and I are very happy with this purchase.", 
    "By and far the best price we could find on this kind of quality of stool. This same product anywhere would've been about triple the price. We are very pleased with the quality and craftsmanship. They are beautiful stools and sturdy enough to hold your heaviest visitors.", 
    "I love these stools! The metal is a little darker than in the picture, and like some other reviews, the wood is very unfinished and could stand to be sanded down a bit. Overall, I love the style of them and would purchase again.", 
    "Great barstools. They look great and are very functional. Overall great size. Would definitely buy again.", 
    "Love these stools. 5 out of the 6 ordered are perfect. The wood top on one is not in great shape, but we will deal with it. May need to sand and seal it again. Great value overall--I've seen the same chairs for hundreds more!", 
    "Beautiful. Rustic looking, sturdy and as my friend said, \" you can fit your whole bum on it.\"", 
    "This stool is well priced, super stylish and very sturdy!", 
    "I am loving this stool. It fit my desire for style and size exactly. I think that it is a really fabulous find for the price (i.e. economical), and is the perfect addition to my studio.", 
    "a friend of mine had similar stool they cost her $xxx.xx each, very sturdy, well made, nice wood top, love that the are adjustable. great product at great price!", 
    "I ordered three stools, upon arrival, I unpacked them, the top wooden portion of the stools were sticky. The iron portion looks exactly like the picture with variation in color. They have a very western masculine bar look. However, the wood portion is cheap looking and much darker than the blonde wood color shown in the picture.", 
    "HEAVY duty barstools, they arrive assembeled :) Awesome Product-- HIGHLY recommend!!", 
    "One of the seats was cracked, but Overstock shipped me a new one, and they are awesome. They don't squeak, they are sturdy and have the look I was searching for. I call it rustic industrial.", 
    "Looks good. The quality of the seat is terrible. I will need to replace them myself to be satisfied... For what I got I think I paid too much", 
    "We were looking for counter stools for our lower island area. We needed extra seating overall in our kitchen and these werea great fit.", 
    "As part of a total kitchen remodel I opted to make a huge butcher block table/work counter with the option to move it around as needed I looked ALL over for the right stools These were the ones to get (I did sand & re-stain the seats to match my lighter cabinets - but that is just a me thing)", 
    "I ordered a total of 6. The first 4 were great, the 2nd batch of 2 not so good. Had deep cracks in the wood, but I absolutely love the stools other than that. Exactly \"my\" style. Rustic and functional.", 
    "These are great, on trend barstools. The only issue would be the rough finish of the wood, but it doesn't seem to snag anything. They are about half the price of comparable items.", 
    "I like the look, but for the price I was surprised at the quality of the wood. There was a sizable split in one seat and both seats needed to be treated (with tung oil) to make them comfortable and durable. This was an additional, not insignificant cost.", 
    "I was very thankful that Overstock replaced my broken stool when it arrived. Very happy with customer service.", 
    "Love, love these. No assembly required which was a plus. Heavy and sturdy. They look really great in my kitchen!", 
    "these bar stools are unique. just what I wanted. similar ones in stores run $XXX-$XXX. they look like they will hold up a good long time. love! love! love!", 
    "Nice looking bar stools - like in some of the reviews - the wood seat had shrunk away from the metal a little - which wasn't a big deal except that there is a wood cross-slat that is on the bottom of the seat (likely to prevent cracking) which doesn't shrink so you can see it exposed about 1/8th of an inch when looking directly down at the stools. We bought 5 stools - one had a crack in it, which they promptly sent out a replacement seat. But overall this is a very minor flaw and not really noticeable. If it bothered me a lot, I would just remove the seat file it down, and replace the seats. I should also note we live in the desert - in more humid climates - likely the wood wouldn't do this. The stools have a great look, and I have a feeling to find a comparable stool that didn't have this minor defect would cost somewhere over $300 per stool... so overall I'm happy with the stools. The stools are sturdy, and not prone to tipping - which is important with kids. I like the height flexibility - can be used with a bar height or counter height pretty well. The welds are good and metal looks nice. Really all the manufacturer has to do to solve this minor problem is to kiln dry the wood better (to about 6%) and then seal it really well. Hope that helps!", 
    "We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the product...well constructed. We decided to buy more two more for second bar in the house. Were happy to see the stools were on sale so we saved a bit on the purchase of the additional 2 stools; however, since we bought 3 just days ago, we are of the opinion that Overstock should credit us the difference between what we paid for first set and second set....outside of that, our experience was good.", 
    "We just redid a kitchen with stainless steel appliances, white wood cabinets, dark granite eat at, counter and a new, wide plank wood floors. I was looking for something that incorporated, wood and metal in a unique way, for the bar stools on the other side of the granite counter and saw these on Overstock. It had everything I wanted and I ordered 4. They are swivel and the metal has grummets around the seat, and place for your feet, which to me is crucial. It was exactly what I envisioned. They arrived completely ready to go, and in such I short time, I was amazed. It actually \"makes\" the dining area side of the kitchen. Everyone asks where I got them, and they look like they're a fortune, but are SO well priced. The look is expensive, and for me, a REAL find. Thank you Overstock!!!", 
    "I ordered and received 2 of these. Upon opening box #1 the wood seat had a large separated crack running down the middle. Then I opened box #2 and found a similar but smaller crack running down 1 side of the wood seat. The glides on stool #1 looked as if it had been used. I really was disappointed because I like the overall look of these stools but I don't want to risk getting 2 more with the same defects so I am returning for a refund and will continue my search for stools. Return was easy enough--just a phone call", 
    "Very PBish but the seat did need sanding and recoating. Once done, it was just what I wanted. Don't buy if you don't want to modify the seat finishing.", 
    "Just redid my shaker/mission kitchen and this stool is perfect, although I think it would work stylistically with anything but art deco. The seat was not cracked as some others complained. This stool registers visually as all dark colored metal & allows the eye to focus on everything else in the kitchen -- you know, the cabinets, counters and floor you paid an arm and a leg for. It is a very wide seat, sturdy, comfortable and easily adjusts for any height. Since it's dark metal, you don't need to worry about scuffing up the foot rest rungs. To protect my floor, I fit its legs into 1-3/8 inch white plastic caps you use with patio furniture. It now slides effortlessly over my floor. Comes fully assembled, hallelujah. And this stool IS color coordinate-able: put a thick foam pad over the wood, sew a circular cover with a drawstring edge, insert a drawstring, cinch it tight underneath the stool seat and tie a bow. it really works!", 
    "I got two of these bar stools to pair with a rustic kitchen island. I had read other reviews about the poor quality of the wood seat and I decided to take my chances and purchase them anyway. The metal base is heavy and has an expensive look. However, the wood seats appear to be hollow and are thin and cheap looking. They came with a sticky film almost like sap. I sanded the wood seats down to remove almost all of the stain and now I really like them. They are still thin and hollow-sounding but look more rustic and distressed. I have had several people ask me if I got them on Pottery Barn or Restoration hardware. Overall worth the price - but you will have to sand them down and get rid of the plastic look.", 
    "returned them. They looked cheap. The wood is not as depicted in picture.", 
    "I bought these for our vacation home. I like the style of the stools however the quality of the stools are TERRIBLE!!!! The seat is rough. You are going to need to sand the seat. You shouldnt have to sand the seat for the amount of money you spend for one.", 
    "I love these stools. The seats are large--I find myself actually sitting cross legged on them sometimes, fully supported. One seat did have a gap in the wood when it arrived. Overstock was easy to work with. However, the company sent out just the wooden top part as the replacement, which required drilling the holes ourselves and fitting it to the metal band. Luckily, my father in law was happy to do this, but without help I would have found the replacement useless. So if you get a defective seat make sure to specify if you need the entire top half of the stool replaced (which you could just screw into the base) or just the wooden seat.", 
    "well designed and very sturdy..just what I needed for my guests...", 
    "I ordered two of these stools for my new home. This was my first purchase from Overstock so I wasn't sure what to expect. Wow! They are beautiful and fit my decor (rustic industrial) perfectly. I am ordering two more today for my outside kitchen area. They are sturdy, beautiful and it's so nice that they are adjustable. I have loved all of the \"industrial\" pieces that I have purchased from Overstock. I am one satisfied customer. :-) So happy with the quality that I don't know if I'll ever hit a department store for furniture ever again!", 
    "They wood is very rustic/distressed which add more to the look than I realized when i purchased the stools. They look great in my apartment and I could not be more satisfied with the purchase!", 
    "Love love love the style and comfort and that they are adjustable. Perfect for my grand daughter.", 
    "Stools are great - generous seat, sturdy, and the seat is easily turned. Great stools for the money.", 
    "Received this stool about 5 PM It comes with a dry, rough, unfinished wooden seat, so I applied a thin coat of linseed oil and set it aside to dry. Next morning, I discovered the seat had developed two considerable splits. It just reinforces the lack of quality in many Made in China products these days. I just now took a look at feedback about this product and saw that this wood sear splitting issue comes up over and over in reviews. Called the Overstock,com customer peopple and they are arranging a refund once they get the stool back at their expense, but what a hassle.", 
    "Walking into RH for my DREAM STOOLS My husband just about had a heart attack when he realized we needed x5 of them. To soften the Blow i reasoned that i will give Christopher Knight Barstool a try (the price was awesome and the style was very similar) I ordered 3 at first, thinking JUST INCASE i wasnt in love with them. The minute i opened the box and felt how Heavy duty the quality was, i was Sold!! The stools are IDENTICAL to RH the Rough Industrial/Vintage Style is EXACTLY what my heart desired! The stools are quite a large stool! NOT A DINKY TINY CHEAP TOP! I WAS SHOCKED WHAT A GREAT FIND THIS WAS! I ended up Ordering x2 more this same day. My 5th stool had a crack in the wooden top, customer service was ABOVE AND BEYOND HELPFUL and sent me a replacement top instantly. HIGHLY RECOMENDED! I HAVE x5 of THESE at my 10ft Island, they look Amazing! And my kids love adjusting them to fit their height. THANK YOU OVERSTOCK!!! (my husband is Very Pleased with the Price)", 
    "I was so wanting to love these stools. I ordered two and the seats arrived with shims holding them in place. It appears as if the wood seat was too small for the inset of the ironwork and they remedied it by shimming it with broken pieces of wood to make up the difference. One of the stools was scuffed, not sure if it was previously used, banged up in assembly or what. However overstock said they are taking care of my return and offered to replace, but, I tend to think if these two are shimmed the odds are pretty good the replacements would be as well. they also offered to help me find another set. I see another set similar but not enough reviews to judge out whether they have the same issue. Back to the drawing board :-(", 
    "The base of the barstool is incredibly sturdy and well made. The quality of the wood seat is disappointing in terms of thickness and particularly finish. I ordered 3 of these. 2 arrived fine and one arrived with a cracked seat even though the packaging was impressive. Overstock was great in getting it resolved. They shipped a new seat to me and save me the time and hassle of repacking and shipping the stool. If you need extra tall stools...you should def consider these.", 
    "I'm late in reviewing these, but actually it might be better that way as I've had over 6 months to use them. I purchased three of them last December to use at our kitchen counter. They have worked great, have sat even on the floor (no wobbling) and we like the fact that the seats are adjustable (makes it's easy when having small kids sitting at the counter.) Yes, the seats are unfinished. I've chosen to leave them that way for the time being, but might in the future seal them with a darker stain/poly. One of my sons poked at one of the seats with a pen, and did make several indentations on it (the wood seat is somewhat soft) but because of the distressed appearance of the stool seat in general, it's not obvious to anyone but me (and my son who was punished for his misbehavior.) :) I wanted an industrial-antique-y look (my home is cottage style) and these fit that requirement, and most importantly fit our budget. I would highly recommend if you are in a similar situation.", 
    "Others had said there is a problem with the seats cracking. They were right. I only kept them because my husband can fix most anything.", 
    "These barstools were exactly what me and my husband were looking for. They are spot on what the picture and description say. You will not be disappointed with your purchase at all!!!", 
    "The stool is very cool and the top of the chair came very smooth .looks great in my kitchen", 
    "I love these stools! I had been scouring many site for functional, good looking stools that would work well with my kids. These definitely fit the bill, and for the price you can't beat it! One feature that I love is that you can adjust the height so my 3 year old can sit comfortably at the counter alongside my older kids. Great buy!!", 
    "This was the other of the two I sent across the States.", 
    "One of the 3 stools arrived with a cracked base which I halfway expected from reading other reviews. A new stool was send immediately and I'm pleased with the purchase.", 
    "I only ordered one at first to ensure it would be a good option. My kitchen bar is higher than standard and my existing bar stools were a bit short. I love that these can be adjusted and they match well with my new industrial style coffee table and end tables from WM. I just ordered two more. Comes fully assembled as well!", 
    "I have been trying to be patient about the smell with the hopes it will lessen, but it has a skunky smell which I assume is the finish.", 
    "I ordered two of these for my kitchen island in our condo which is a renovated cotton mill built in 1895. They look so authentic and fit the industrial period of our home. Comfortable, too!", 
    "I ordered these stools because they went with the decor of my dining room. They are nice and sturdy but the craftmanship is a bit lacking. Significant gap between wood of seat and the metal surrounding it is just braced with a little wood chip. In the photos the wood appears to be a natural color but in person it is stained a medium, greyish color which makes it look like reclaimed barnwood, which is cool but not what I was planning on. I am actually considering sanding the stain off. Overall still a very stylish stool but not a great bargain.", 
    "These are great retro style stools which was perfect for the look were going for", 
    "Unfortunately, I ordered 2 of these stools - which are exactly what I was looking for - but they both arrived with the huge cracks down the wood. The cracks are from where the wood is glued together and sloppily joined. They weren't just cracks, but huge splits down the seat of the chair where you can see the unfinished wood and in some cases it was uneven (ouch!) with the rest of the stool. I sent them back, and Overstock's customer service took care of that and sent me 2 more. 1 of them was cracked out of the box as well, so I sent them both back as I'm certain the other will surely crack as well, and don't want to get stuck with them. It's unfortunate as the style is exactly what I wanted and I really really wanted these stools to work out.... but the craftsmanship of the wood is awful.", 
    "As others mentioned- rough seats, but they go with the hardware of the stools. i chose not to stain. No squeaking when stools twist! Love them!", 
    "These stools were exactly what I wanted for my industrial style game room by my pool table. I ordered 6 and 2 of the 6 had very obvious shims between the seat and the metal frame. I called and Overstock immediately said they would replace them. Unfortunately, the 2 they sent, both of the seats have cracks in the wood. I decided to just keep the 4 that were ok. Great product but they need to do a better job of checking to make sure all stools meet standards that are acceptable. The 4 I have, some have a pretty big gap between the seat and the frame, but I like the look so much, I can overlook that. Seat was a bit rough like others have said, I might sand them and re-stain them a darker color. Overall, I am glad I ordered them. Just received a catalog from a place I order, they had the same stools but for more money.", 
    "Good heavy duty stool. The price was much less than others I looked at but I think that is reflected in the quality of the wooden seat. Once I sanded and stain them they are OK, but of that's not your thing I would not order these. As I said, one came with a sizable crack in the seat, but I was able to fill and sand so it looks OK.", 
    "This stool is a nice compliment to an industrial or rustic decor. The base is completely metal (heavy) and very sturdy. The seat is a rough wood that smoothes and wears the more you sit on it. Other reviewers said theirs squeaked, ours do not, but we may not swivel ours as much. The seat is also about a foot and a half in diameter so there's plenty of room for one's bum. Even though they are wood, they are very comfortable. We are very pleased with this purchase and are looking at other Christopher Knight designs.", 
    "Overall the product is good. The \"wood\" just looks very fake and not at all like natural wood. I can't tell if these will hold up or not. I guess only time will tell. I would not however describe the wood as \"natural\" looking.", 
    "Ordered two stools, one seat was completely cracked in half when they arrived but I received good customer service and a replacement is on the way.", 
    "These stools are a perfect match for my outdoor whiskey barrel table. I could not find anything else like these stools after days of internet searches.", 
    "I have been looking for Bar Stools that my kids can't destroy. These look great and they are so well made. The price was even better. Saw almost same product in a decorating magazine for $1250.00 each!!", 
    "I ordered 2 of these barstools, but one of them arrived with a cracked seat. Overstock gets 5 stars for replacing the damaged stool hassle-free. As other reviewers stated, the wood seat is not the best of quality and poorly finished, even for a \"rustic\" look. I will be sanding and refinishing the seats. For the price paid, these are very nice.", 
    "These stools are the best things to enter my house! They are sturdy, and the seats are way larger than our old stools. They made my whole kitchen with the way they look industrial-chic. We absolutely love them and are contemplating buying another set to add to our wet bar. Don't hesitate to add these to your home. You will receive so many compliments!", 
    "Very nice stools. The wood seats were a little sappy but have since dried out.", 
    "Unique barstools ...... Certainly a conversation piece...can be adjusted in height and have a wide seating base that is very comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase. Would recommend to anyone who appreciates the unique", 
    "these stools are amazing. and the price was great. they are just like the picture shows and they are really sturdy.", 
    "We were very impressed when we received these stools. They are very sturdy and the seat is extra wide. Exactly what we were hoping for.", 
    "the wooden seats are to be desired. the stools are great for the price. well constructed", 
    "I am very please with these stools - I had found a very similar one at a local specialty store for twice the amount. I did not have any issues with the finish on the seats - it is smooth and other then using a furniture oil, I did nothing to them. I would definitely recommend them!", 
    "Okay, so I now have a new favorite seat in the house. I recently moved and bought two of these stools as a \"new place splurge\" and could not love them more. They have the funky, industrial aesthetic that I was after and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality--a real value for this price (and no assembly required)! Other reviewers mentioned having to sand the seat tops, but mine were smooth enough not to cause the dreaded splinter-in-the-butt, yet maintained a cool, rough texture. Also, I did not have the \"squeak\" problem others identified as annoying, so either the company responded to customer feedback or I got lucky. (But don't let these minor complaints keep you from ordering! This stool is awesome!) As for comfort, ummmmmm, it's a stool. Functional more so than luxurious, but that doesn't mean you won't linger over morning coffee because you can't stand being perched on it. Finally, a word to the wise: this stool sells out on this site quickly, so if you're even remotely considering a purchase, place your order!", 
    "Quality product for a good price. Great with the kids since each need a diifferent size to use the counter.", 
    "Love this stools. Imagine we will have them for years to come. (aka, not junk furniture that falls apart). The construction is quality & the aesthetic was exactly what we were looking for to bring some \"industrial\" style into our kitchen/dining/living great room. kids love to wind them up & down. we use them at counter height. but I think they would be plenty sturdy wound up for bar height. nice to have both options in one stool. As other reviewers mention. The wood on top is the only thing I would make a comment on. The finish isn't completely smooth, so I think we are going to sand them and polyurethane. I think it was a design choice to be \"rustic\".... but really I don't enjoy. For the price, there is NO WAY WE COULD BUY ANYTHING CLOSE to similar, so I still gave this stool 5 stars. Overstock continues to impress me... even though you have to wade through masses of goods & read reviews to be sure you're getting a quality product. Their service is fast & everything I've ever ordered has been spot on. cheers*", 
    "I compared these to the ones I saw another store and think these are way better looking. The seat is not a smooth polished wood as it is at the other store but I prefer that.", 
    "My wife and I love these barstools. For people who like more of a rustic or industrial look, these are perfect. Do not buy these if you like furniture that has a perfect finish because furniture of this type has a \"worn aged\" appearance. They are comfortable to sit on and have a very solid construction. We have shopped for this type of stool for quite some time and the ones we have found cost about three times as much as these. I definetly recommend buying these if this is the style you are looking for!", 
    "I am thrilled with these stools. They fit at my breakfast bar when the stool is at its lowest point. The top is wider than expected, they are heavy and extremely well made. The stools have rubber on the bottom so they don't scratch the floor. I am very happy with my purchase and I would buy them again in a second!", 
    "I have purchased a total of 5 for my husband's bar. We have gotten so many complements .I have compared the price to many other stores and this is the best price. I would highly recommend these stools.", 
    "We purchased these barstools for our new house that we have not moved in to yet. I did take one out of the box when they arrived to check the quality and I was very pleased with the look. Kind of rustic looking but very sturdy and functional. We really like the fact that they are adjustable. That was one our main requirements plus the sturdy construction. I was a little disappointed, but not surprised from reading other reviews, that the surface of the stool was a little rough. We will be lightly sanding and putting a good coat of polyurethane on them for protection. Overall very happy with the purchase.", 
    "I LOVE these bar stools! I have looked on other website and could not stomach the price per barstool price. These are perfect.", 
    "We love these stools. We had seen the exact stools in a shop here in Ottawa for more.These were a steal and they're absolutely beautiful. Already assembled and ready to use. The seat is quite generous and they're comfortable too! An excellent buy for sure!", 
    "We ordered 6 of these for our L shaped kitchen counter. They are even more perfect than I expected. Rustic, industrial, modern all rolled into one stool. I searched a while before picking these and they are well worth the money. They fit our modern mixed with rustic decor perfectly. Arrived Fed Ex wtih NO damage!!! Thank you OVERSTOCK!!!", 
    "We love our counter stools, they are admired by everyone who visits. Two them had a split in the wood but overstock replaced them with no hassle and all is well.", 
    "We have two countertops. One counter height and one bar height. These stools are perfect because they are adjustable and can be put under either one without having to buy extra stools for each height. Love the rustic look but really like the adjustable nature. Since bodies are not built the same, these stools adjust so knees don't have to be a problem if the person is short or tall. They arrived fully assembled and in excellent condition.", 
    "these are very nice bar stools at a good price. would recommend to a friend.", 
    "These are exactly what I wanted, and look even better than they look on the website.", 
    "I ordered three of these stools for my kitchen island, wanting the industrial look with the wood top. This is perfect! Really like the adjustable function, just twirl to raise or lower, which is great in our house with people of multiple heights. I stained the tops with a mahogany stain/polyurethane combo. Love them!", 
    "a good price for a good rustic stool. the top needs sealing and that is fine wiht use as we get to choose the finish.", 
    "Sturdy, well made stools with a rustic, industrial look. already standing up to use by kids. Because they are solidly built, they are not light weight so might be hard for small children to easily move.", 
    "I love the barstools! And so do my guests! I've had multiple friends order theirs afters they saw mine. I 100% recommend these!", 
    "The bar stools arrived on-time and looked as pictured and described. We stained the seats to match our trim. They took the stain just fine and look like they were custom made for our kitchen.", 
    "loved everthing about this purchase.. overstock delivered in 4 days.. two very large boxes, bar stools wrapped very well.. no assembly required.. stools adjust perfectly to desired height..completed my kitchen/island area... love love love these", 
    "love the stools, my only complaint would be the seats were darker colored wood than I would have liked and the metal was too solid black but overall very pleased with them", 
    "Great quality knobs. NIce weight and the whole lot was in perfect condition. They arrived very quickly. My only drawback is that the instillation screw were too short (but that seems to be the case with most handles and knobs).", 
    "They are heavy in construction and design,more than met our hopes, they far exceeded our expectations.", 
    "Testing, very good product. Testing, very good product.", 
    "I love old metal and wood. They are perfect in my kitchen. exactly what I have been looking for!!", 
    "I love my chairs! I had been looking for them in stores and could not find anything I liked. These were the ones!", 
    "These bar stools way exceeded my expectations. I bought two, then after seeing them in person, I bought two more. They are rustic, utilitarian and super unique. They look expensive too. Love them so much!!", 
    "Shipping was very fast. The stools were packaged well and arrived without damage. I have had them for a month now and so far they are very sturdy with no wobble. The large seat is not smooth and has some ridges which gives it a more rustic appearance. Yet its not so rough that you would be concerned about splinters. I purchased 4 barstools for a 9 ft raised panel cherry kitchen island. I followed the lead of another reviewer and stained them to match the island and then I put 4 coats of polyurithane sanding lightly with fine grit sandpaper between coats. They look great and I am absolutely thrilled with how they turned out. They provide just the right finishing touch to the kitchen remodel.", 
    "Love them, bought 4, great looking stool for the money, compare to stools costing 2 to 3 times more.", 
    "Love these stools!! They are unique and add an industrial touch to the kitchen. Stools are sturdy and comfortable to sit on. Though the wood seat is a little rough. A light sanding and a coat of polyurethane was all that they needed. Can see my family and friends sitting by the counter and enjoying a drink and casual conversation.", 
    "I saw these bar stools at a friends house, and loved them so much that I purchased 6 of them!!!!", 
    "I wanted something backless for our kitchen island and spent alot of time trying to find the perfect solution. These stools are great - they blend with lots of different decors and were a really good solution for our problem. I'm very satisfied with them.", 
    "We purchased 2 of these barstools, and are very happy with them. They are exactly as represented online. I'm not sure why there are bad reviews on here for these, unless they had product quality issues. They have a nice vintage look that really goes well anywhere. I would highly recommend these...you won't find anything with more character for the price.", 
    "They arrived within a few days after I ordered them. I did have to sand the tops of them. They look expensive and they go well with my stainless decor.", 
    "These stools are awesome, and a great price! We ordered 5 of these and one had a crack in the wood on top, when I notified overstock they replaced it immediately. I couldn't be happier with these stools.", 
    "The chairs arrived very quickly, fulling intact, and ready to sit on. Very nice, durable and exactly as described on the site. A really good deal.", 
    "Very comfortable stool.Very sturdy and looks great.", 
    "Great look for the rustic/western setting we have. Very solid piece!", 
    "I was very pleased with these bar stools. They look awesome and are heavy. The wood top is a little rough nothing a little sandpaper can't take care of. I would order them again. Love Overstock!!!!! Order many things from them and so far no problems with anything even easy returns!!!!! If you order these stools you will not be disappointed.", 
    "Bought two of these barstools and they look great, are solid and I've had so many compliments on them. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "Based on all the other positive reviews posted here, I decided to take the leap. My first purchase on Overstock.com I couldn't be more satisfied. The stools arrived in just four days after ordering. The price was 'hands down' the best I could find on the internet, someplaces by as much as 50% ! I lightly sanded the wood seats with #150 sandpaper and then applied a medium stain. The results were just fantastic. My kids will be fighting over these barstools when I'm gone. Before you buy, make sure to check the size against your available space. These barstools are slightly larger than you might think from looking at the photos. Otherwise, what are you waiting for? Make your purchase before they are all gone!", 
    "The barstools turned out great! Just what we wanted. Good quality for price.", 
    "I love these bar stools. They are perfect in my kitchen. I wish I had room for four more. They are so beautiful I can't say enough good things about them.", 
    "We took the wood off and stained with Minwax Red Oak t match our floors then topped with polyurethane. Everyone who comes over loves the stools and has no idea they are a reproduction and only cost a few hundred dollars (we bought 3 for our kitchen bar). Highly recommend.", 
    "I have been searching for months online and in stores for the perfect stools and these stools definitely fit the bill. I absolutely love them. I am very particular and wanted a certain look for my kitchen, so I shopped until I found what I was looking for. Was concerned about ordering online, but OMG the quality and elegance of the stools are just right.", 
    "Purchased (3) of these stool for our kitchen counter. Loved that the height as adjustable. The tops of the stools is made of a very light fir, which appears unfinished and rough. We carefully removed the tops, and stained them a shade darker than our cherry wood floors. They look great, and love the rustic look of the stools. Would highly recommend them.", 
    "I was very happy with the price & time frame that it was delivered.", 
    "Really nice bar stools. Large rustic wood seat suitable for ALL sizes. These stools are strong and steady. No wobbles at any height. They look very industrial is that's what you're going for. I have two in my NYC apartment. I love the metal. .", 
    "These same stools sell for ***.00 a piece at restoration hardware . These stools are great quality and glad we got them .", 
    "Our home was built in 1882 as a duplex/tenement and we are remodeling the kitchen. I wanted the products I use to be of the same \"ilk\" as the home - not dressy - just functional and comfortable. The turn of the century/industrial look was what I was looking for. These were absolutely perfect! I ordered two at first and then ordered two more. They are very sturdy and well made. As another customer had mentioned, we are sanding the top and will put a couple of coats of tung oil to seal them. Love these stools!", 
    "If you're looking for this type barstool, you won't find a better one than these! They're much more sturdy than the pricier ones that we checked out. The only thing that we'd change on them is put stain and or just a finish on the seats. That's just our personal preference. They look great as is if you want a little more rustic look.", 
    "seats need to be stained or shellaced for a more finished look, right now I think if something spilled they would stain or someone could get a sliver. arrived busting out of their boxes, one foot rest was scratched but my husband easily rubbed it out. seat is wider around than I expected but still fit under the island. stury and heavy so they won't tip or slip, over all very pleased, have gotten compliments on them. very rustic looking.", 
    "I love these barstools! They are so unique looking, very stable, easy to adjust the seat by just spinning it up or down and the seat is very comfortable, smooth wood. They feel like they will hold up to heavy use in my home.", 
    "arrived assembled, looks just like the pic on The O. I purchased this bar stool and two others. I like the other better and they are better quality.", 
    "These stools fit well in my kitchen and are a great deal for the cost. They look like a more expensive stool. They are very comfortable and they adjust in height.", 
    "I love these stools. They're handsome and very stylish. However, they're much larger than they appear in the picture. Don't get me wrong, they're GREAT, just quite large. The seat is nice and wide and will accommodate most behinds. The wood is a little rough and could use some sanding and a coat of poly or even a fun paint color. I sat on it wearing a skirt and pantyhose and the hose got picked a bit. Not a major issue at all; like I said, just needs a little sanding. Highly recommend these!", 
    "I bought two bar stools, and both look great. Friends have even assumed that they're from a nearby high end furniture store. However, the welding on one of the chairs is already damaged. On one of the chairs, there are four welded metal pieces that hold the foot bar in place, and one completely fell off. The foot ring is still in place, but now it's just not as sturdy.", 
    "i just closed my furniture/ home decor store in south jersey. to move to az. and i needed 3 stools for my kitchen. , ( so i am in the business. ) i ordered three of these stools. they where below wholesale. and way better then what i expected. so very happy they finished off my kitchen. i highly recommend from.- .J.S. P.S. They where delivered. in 4 days.\" prompt shipping too!\"", 
    "Beautiful bar stools for our kitchen. We just remodeled and they fit right in with the decor. Perfect look and fast delivery. Thank you!", 
    "These stools are very nice. The base is made of very sturdy steel construction. Would look good in either a very modern or a very rustic space. The only thing to keep in mind is the stool itself is wood and comes unfinished. We stained and finished to protect the wood. I guess you could leave it unfinished but in a kitchen that might not be a good idea.", 
    "These are great bar stools. We have an extra tall bar and these adjusted to the perfect height. Everyone who comes over asks where we bought them. The wood is unfinished, like many other reviewers have pointed out, but I like the way it looks.", 
    "Overall good quality although the wood seat should probably receive a polyurethane coat because it seems rather dry/unfinished and could splinter. Otherwise this is a good value for the price esp compared to other stores/sites offering a similar look stool. Like that the seat height can be adjusted.", 
    "Love these bar stools...the size and the quality. The only negative is that the metal around the wood seat top does not always make contact with that which leaves a gap in some areas...", 
    "As others have mentioned, the seat can be a little rough, but it was nothing a little sanding couldn't fix. I deepened the stain to match my kitchen cabinets and they turned out great.", 
    "The seats are made of plywood. Yes, technically they are made of fir but, fir does not appear \"naturally\" as plywood.", 
    "Surprisingly well made. Look like they will be able to withstand years of having men and kids plop down on them! They wood on the seats was a bit rough so I did sand them down a tad more. The heighth is perfect. I have looked at comparable bar stools for substantially more. I like these well enough that I am going ti order two more.", 
    "I was very pleased with this, however it was a lot large than I expected (due to my own lack of checking). I was in hopes of using this as a standard counter height stool, however it is intended for a bar height (so I am glad I only ordered 1 and not 6 like I originally planned). Though I under estimated the height, it will work great in my craft room. Very sturdy and quality built. The seat had a slight greyish wood tone to it. It is unfinished (which was perfect for me --- I added a medium/dark stain to darken it down. Perfect!) I am very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Color is a dark gray metal with a black wash - nice finish. Will stain the top to match my decor - love that option. Excellent quality for the low price.", 
    "The only negative I have is the quality of wood that was used for the seat. The wood was very rough without a finish. Once we sanded the tops down and added \"Emmets Good Stuff Wood Finish\" they are nice and smooth with a satin finish. The stools are definitely worth the price.", 
    "These are such cute and comfortable stools. I do agree with other reviewers that the tops might need to be sanded and stained. I'll work on that one of these days! But they're sturdy and I like that you can raise them up and down.", 
    "I had seen these barstools in a magazine and was happy to find them on overstock.com. I'm very pleased with the purchase and would definitely recommend them. They aren't fancy at all - and a little bigger than I expected them to be.", 
    "Barstools go great with our Western Theme. If you like nostalgia, you'll love tthese stools!!!!", 
    "LOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE ITLOVE IT", 
    "The stools are awesome. Substantial in size with very sturdy construction. I am thrilled with them. They arrived promptly, in great condition and fully assembeled. My biggest question was the color/finish as the two pictures on overstock seemed to represent two different possibilities. My best description is that they aren't grey, but instead are black with a very light silver brush stroke showing through.", 
    "the wooden seat is a little smaller than the round framing, which creates a little gap - thankfully, with the styling of this stool we weren't looking for perfection - very rustic....", 
    "I love this stool. It allows me to sit near the counter in the kitchen when I prepare meals. There is a crack in the seat that does not interfere with its use. Its not a reason to return it, but I will have it repaired anyway.", 
    "Very prompt delivery. The stool is very substantial with a generous seat. Like others have said ,the wood is rough and very light in color. I did sand and stain it...I just love how it came out. It matches my kitchen table perfectly. If you are looking for a rustic/industrial look, this is perfect. I also like how you can adjust the height of the stool. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "The barstool is sturdy and great looking! the wood seat was very rough and not stained...but i like that, a little sandpapeer an option to stain the color of your choice...perfect. just should be explained in product description. grat value...looks loke high end stool!", 
    "The bar stools are perfect for us. We wanted something industrial/rustic looking. We priced them elsewhere & they were at 2 to 3 times as much. The description is exactly what they look like. The wood seat was too light for my kitchen so I stained them with a black stain. But, I already knew the wood was too light when I purchased them. They turned out perfect! Couldn't be more pleased :).", 
    "This was the first time I purchased anything on overstock.com so I was a little apprehensive about what I would actually get compared to what I saw online. I read all the reviews and they were pretty consistent in their evaluations. Since I had been shopping for a while in town and comparing bar stools/prices/quality, I knew it was a good price and I liked the style better than any of the chairs I had seen so I took the chance and ordered them. I was not disappointed! They came within the time frame they said, looked good and are holding up well after 1 month so I can officially breath a sigh of relief. It was a good experience so I will purchase from here again.", 
    "I'm very impressed with the weight and strong construction. It will be used at a breakfast bar area and I'm sure it will hold up to the use.", 
    "The wood is unfinished but I think a little tung oil will fix it. Sturdy and comfy. Good purchase", 
    "Love the stools. They look like much more expensive stools. They only negative is that the wood is very rough and needs to be sanded a bit. It can \"catch\" on your clothes. But if you have a rustic kitchen or want an industrial accent piece this is the one for you!", 
    "My husband and I LOVE these. Have been looking for barstools \"just the right height\", for eight months. My husband and I disagree on what height that is. These are adjustable, and look GREAT. Got four, and since they are large, three fill my island fine, but the fourth I use elsewhere in the kitchen, and we have it in case we need to seat four. I had been planning on staining the wood (unfinished, as described in other reviews), but now I think it will age beautifully just as it came. VERY happy with them, and price was very reasonable.", 
    "arrived in a timely manner. now i need another because they also make really cute side table (but higher) next to my antique tub. very very pleased with purchase. one of the two that i ordered had a crack in the top wood, but overstock quickly sent a replacement. very very happy customer!", 
    "Love the chairs. Heads up, though....the seats are rough. It looks like they sawed the wood and put it right on without sanding it down smoothly. I sanded the wood and smoothed it out. I also stained it a darker color and it looks great. It is a perfect item if you have counter top table and a higher bar counter top because you can adjust the stools to the correct height as needed. It gives me more flexibility to use the stools at either location in mystic hen easily. Love it!", 
    "Love these barstools. They look great in our house and are very versatile, sturdy and stylish.", 
    "We had a custom table built out of bowling alley lane flooring for the top and said steelwork base with casters. Naturally finding stools to match the industrial style was difficult and posed to be very expensive at retail shops. After finding these wood/metal stools on Overstock, I will definitely look here first rather than anywhere else. The texture and color of the wood is perfect and the metal bases look and feel ust like stools i had located elsewhere ....but for half the price!", 
    "I bought 2 stools and one seat was split, for the price I just purchased minwax wood filler, sanded seats and stained with a cherry finish and a coat of urethane to match my kitchen. I love them and at a fraction of R.H. price! They are very sturdy and really like the fact that I can adjust for the grandkids eating at the counter.", 
    "These stools are great!! Despite their industrial look, our home is somewhat shabby chic meets Pottery Barn/Crate and Barrel and they add great character. I'm contemplating buying two more just to have for our future home, as we are renting now. These are a great buy if you do any comparisons. Love it!!!", 
    "If you stain/paint the seat top, and take it off the base, be careful for curling of the wood once it is out of the frame. It is a soft wood, made of several pieces that dont naturally stay flat when left on its own. Otherwise works great.", 
    "I was looking for stools similar to antique drafting stools---but I didn't want to pay $350 for each. I purchased these but when I got them I didn't like the finish. the vintage distressed looked fake to me--like sponge painting. No problem though. I removed the seats, taped up the \"seat pole\" to keep the paint off and spray painted the frame a fabulous green. NOW THEY MAKE A REAL STATEMENT IN MY KITCHEN. I LOVE THEM. These are substantial stools. Very sturdy and well made. If you don't like the color, 1 can of spray paint each will do the job. Make them yours.", 
    "nice sturdy industrial look bar stools...we like them!", 
    "bought 2 of these for my son's new house and they were exactly what we were looking for and at a bargain price!! They will look great with the \"industrial\" look we were going for. I love shopping at overstock!!!", 
    "I originally bought 2 and then ordered 3 more. I did sand the seats and stain them a color more compatible to my new house. It is unbelievable how many people comment on my bar stools! Especially the men. They just love them. We love the fact the height is adjustable to everyone. One seat was split but I can live with it. From reading other reviews it appears I coulld have returned it but I kind of like the imperfect look and goes well with the rustic eclectic style of my home.", 
    "Bought 2 for our daughter as a birthday gift for her new loft, they are a great accent to her place and just what she wanted Another A+ for Overstock!", 
    "Love these barstools. Didn't have to put anything together and we received them in less than a week.", 
    "Love them! I bought 4 to give the kitchen an industrial look facelift. These stools are much better than I expected. They have weight to them, a nice patina to the metal and the seat adjusts with a quick spin. Great look for a better than great price...I may go back for a few more:-)", 
    "Great Barstools. Solid construction. Definitely recommend.", 
    "what can I say? Exactly the same quality as restoration hardware, but half the price! We are totally in love with these stools!", 
    "For this price, compared to other retailers, I didn't expect these to be exactly what I was looking for. I was proved wrong. They certainly hold their own against any of those you see elsewhere for as much as triple the price. I am very happy!! :)", 
    "i liked this barstool enough to buy another, but they sold out! it's a great look for a reasonable amount of money. i love overstock!", 
    "Stools look amazing. Only problem was a few came with cracked tops. Overstock quickly replaced.", 
    "Stool is perfect. Would fit many types of decor, ie, country style, contemporary or traditional. Very little assembly required. Love the fact that it is adjustable to the bar to give comfortable fit to people of different height. I was amazed at the quality of this stool for the amount of money I paid for it. You will see these stools at high end vendors for much more money than the Big\"O\" and of course, the cost of shipping is another bargain.", 
    "Quality construction and interesting industrial/rustic look. We are planning to cover the bare wood seats with foam, polyfill and an upholstery weight leather-like fabric. The stools are a good juxtaposition to an eclectic traditional decor.", 
    "We love this even more than we thought we would. Very sturdy. Perfect blend of homey and industrial chic.", 
    "great quality, surprisingly extremely heavy, beautiful -- compare to restoration hardware 400 bar stools! what a deal! plus, shipped and arrived in 3 days!", 
    "I ordered two stools to check them out in terms of size and spacing before ordering two more. They just arrived and look great - not too heavy but still sturdy. The seats are unfinished but I knew this going in. They're plenty smooth to sit on without worrying about splinters. However, the seat of one stool had a pretty good sized split down the middle. Overstock immediately sent out a replacement stool, although it can only be shipped ground due to its size. Ugh. Overall, I'm happy and will order two more.", 
    "The wood seating is much more rustic then shown. Not finished, but it won't give you splinters either. The wood seating area is not a solid piece of wood, thus it can cause cracking. Two of ours cracked (and we are not heavy people) so we sent two back and got replacements, they haven't cracked yet. Overall, they are a smart looking bar stool.", 
    "I do love these stools (I bought 2). They match the dimensions and description perfectly. They are solid and seem like they will last. I believe my grandfather, rest his soul, would have approved. These stools really give the impression of having come from a very very old factory and work perfectly in my brick loft converted from a very old manufacturing building. I plan to use them with a breakfast bar custom made from a slab of aged cherry tree and iron plumbing pipe. As the seats are distressed but unfinished new wood, I am going to go over them with a bit of sandpaper and a dark cherry stain as I would prefer a more aged look to the wood. That said I have 3 minor complaints. 1. it is entirely my fault for not paying more attention to the dimensions in the description. The dimensions given are accurate .... I just didn't bother to actually measure out 15.5 inches to see how large a seat that would be. Needless to say, I have no worries about these stools holding the derrieres of even our largest guests! 2. the metal band around one of the wooden seats is slightly larger than the wood so it doesn't fit snugly as you would expect and appears awkward. I suppose it adds to the *rustic* quality though. 3. though I ordered the 2 of them at the same time, they arrived a day apart and one of the cardboard packing boxes was SOAKED through at one end with some kind of dirty oil. I was quite leery of opening the box but the oile was at the foot end of the stool and the whole thing was packaged in a few yards of bubble wrap (with Styrofoam to protect the seat) and everything was perfect inside the oily box.", 
    "I LOVE these stools! For the price, I cannot believe how sturdy and perfect they are. I have them in a farmhouse-style kitchen, so the aged finish and natural seat look great. My only complaint is that there were a couple of places where the metal was sharp or rough. Not sharp enough to hurt anyone, but snagged a pair of tights...it was easily fixed though!", 
    "Love it, though only one shipped. One problem, they are very tall even when screwed down to shortest height. We thought they could be use at a table but they are definitely counter height", 
    "The stools look just like the picture. They are nice and sturdy. The top is wood, we think. If it's not wood I don't know what it is. Pleased with the purchase.", 
    "I'd been watching these stools go out of stock for some time now, and while Christmas shopping on Overstock I noticed they had come back. I couldn't help it - I HAD to order them. I've been drooling over the vintage industrial looking stools for so long and had been eyeing them in shelter magazines and design websites. Everywhere I saw them, the price was horrendous and would have cost maybe a thousand dollars for just two! Overstock has gotten really great about carrying identical products to all of the trendy home products out on the market right now, but for an incredible price. I'm so happy with these, I can hardly stand it. The seat is comfortable and incredibly sturdy. No wobbling, and my boys are excited that they can twist up and down. The seat itself is a distressed wood, with an open like grain, but it's soft and there are no worries about splinters. It truly lends to the antique feeling of these. If you are into the vintage industrial look, get these. They are identical to other restoration type's, but a fraction of the cost. LOVE LOVE LOVE!", 
    "This is a rustic looking extremely well-made stool. There's nothing flimsy about it and I can see years of use ahead without worry. I love that it came assembled. Asssembly and the terrible instructions that usually accompany put-together furniture fill me with dread. No worries for me with this item. I pulled it out of box, removed the packing material, which was not overdone or filled with environmentally unfriendly styrofoam by the way. Opening the box to setting it under the counter took all of five minutes, I have an unusually high counter-top bar and the adjustability of the seat height was a huge plus and I was able to adjust the seat height to fit perfectly at my bar area. Defintely recommend this item. Very very pleased with this purchase."
