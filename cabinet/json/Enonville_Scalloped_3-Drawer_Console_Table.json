    "By looking at the picture it seems well finished. It is not. There are drip marks, brush marks, bubbles everywhere. And not cute character antique-ish looking ones. I mean homemade painted by a five year old paint marks/mistakes. I am sure people will ask me if I painted it myself at some point. Definitely not worth the price.", 
    "Love the style and the look. The quality is not as good as I expected, but I am overall very happy with how this piece looks and functions in my dining room.", 
    "This came with a few chips that I had to fix myself!! And not very level when put together!!"
