    "It is very nice looking furniture. I would not recommend this as something you would sit on daily. I have had it for about a month and already showing signs of aging. They used some sort of internal staple to adhere the back of the furniture. I am having to push it back together every other day. When it arrived I was very happy with the color and the comfort but overall I would say this will probably last less than 3 years and need replacing. I would expect furniture of this cost to last at least 8 to 10 years. There is also an issue with the stitching being too tight on the arm pillows. IF you have kids or anyone who likes to slide over the arm to sit down, do not buy this item! For me it fits but I have already moved it to a low use room.", 
    "We've had this furniture for a few months and it's just a gorgeous as the day it was delivered. It has worn well and is extremely comfortable and stylish. We saw an identical set a a located high-end furniture store and it was more than triple the price there. We get tons of compliments on it. Amazing deal!"
