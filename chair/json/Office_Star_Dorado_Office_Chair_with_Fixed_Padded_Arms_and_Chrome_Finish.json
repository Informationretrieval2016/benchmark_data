    "if you weigh more than 100 lbs dont buy this chair is better if you seat on the floor or concrete very poor design no cushion at all just metal and the cover i wasted my money", 
    "I loved this chair when i saw it on the screen! it was exactly what i was looking for, until I actually sat on it for an hour. This chair had NO Cushion or back support. It rocks and does not have a lock. I'm a bit on the short side (5'1\") and this chair is too high for me at its lowest setting. This is not a chair i can sit on for an extended period of time. Dear White chair, you look great, but we are just not working out. It's you not me. We must part our ways and this time i will not compromise comfort (you are not a sexy shoe). sigh.", 
    "I really do like this chair but it is not comfortable and I have to put a pillow in my lower back area. Other than that I really do like this chair. Goes nicely with my Cable Desk from Overstock.", 
    "Bought several of these for my office. Aside from being uncomfortable, the vinyl cracks and peels away in places. The back rest on one chair completely cracked open, and the arm rests on all of them started peeling from normal use. Also, the white chairs stain easily, if you wear blue jeans the edges of the chairs turn blue.They look nice enough, but i would not purchase if you actually plan on using them.", 
    "These chairs are very nice .... PROS: 1. Great design/architecture 2. Beautiful 3. Robust CONS: 1. Not for people over 5'8\" - ie they are too small 2. Not much cushion for your butt!! and therefore not ideal for all day sitting", 
    "I bought this chair for my home office to complement my modern black and chrome desk. I put it together in 10 minutes. It rolls well, it's comfortable (maybe not for an 8 hour day behind your desk) and it look's great. My girlfriend came over for a visit, she fell in love with the chair. I ended buying her one as a gift for watching my dog over the weekend. She loves it too.", 
    "Needed rolling chairs for the dining room so we could sit down with ease because of our bad knees, these work very well and don't take up a lot of room in our small dinette.", 
    "really nice, I would recommend purchasing this chair. It is sturdy and expensive looking", 
    "This chair is stylish and chic, it is very comfortable for office work.", 
    "Great product. I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "So far so good. Easy assembly", 
    "not as good as I though, one of the wheel broke within two weeks.", 
    "I bought 2 of them and they look fabulous, but there is know cushion on the seat or the back. This makes it hard to sit in this chair for any length of time without putting a cushion on the seat and a cushion to support your back.", 
    "Trim line and Sturdy ..... Love it !!", 
    "I was on a tight budget for my desk chair but I was quite pleased when I found this one because it actually looked nice too. It was very simple to assemble and it looks just as good in person as I was hoping it would. The only thing that would make it better is if the vinyl looked a little more like real leather, but not a big deal considering the price. I don't spend hours and hours at my desk at a time, but when I do use it it seems plenty comfortable to me.", 
    "I bought it to use in my son's room. Looks great.", 
    "Perfect! The chair is great!", 
    "Great looking but too hard seat.", 
    "Great value and style to complement our open office in our home!", 
    "This chair is hard as a rock, the lumbar is like a rod through my lower back. The padded arm rests are an inch wide with a half inch tube of padding, it's impossible to balance my elbow on them. Removing the arm rests all together. Maybe this is good for a college dorm, but nor a real home office.", 
    "The style of this chair is great. If you are planning to use it every day I would say this is not your chair. Color is pretty.", 
    "Smaller profile fits well in tighter space. Seat is roomy and pretty comfortable. Love the modern, sleek design.", 
    "Simple to assemble, very comfortable and a great look! What a deal.", 
    "I love this chair, I didn't put the arms, but it very comfortable", 
    "For the price? EXCELLENT.", 
    "If you want a comfortable and stylish chair, this is the one.", 
    "Good value, comfortable for short sitting periods, we will likely buy more for our office.Winnie and Bear", 
    "Love this chair! It's comfortable and fits in great with my other furniture.", 
    "bought the white one and it's a great addition to my smaller office space.", 
    "Not the most comfortable chair, but very sleek and contemporary. Great price as well.", 
    "Heavy, sturdy, great look! The white is more of a brigh than a muted white. Much like pictured. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Found the red chair fully assembled at a brick and mortar and snatched it up. Loved the look of it, liked the firmness of the hard seat, but found the back way too deep, and knew it would need lumbar support to make the grade. At the same brick and mortar, found a mesh, ***-dollar thinger that does the job and fits in with the chair's modern aesthetic. Around the house, I tend to use my phone and notebook more than my desktop, which is where this chair now resides. When I'm on the desktop, I'm usually working in 2 to 3 hour sessions, tops, and this chair with its aftermarket mod is great for that. In the office, I'm sitting in a thousand-dollar ***** that's been pro tweaked for my body, and honestly? It's not that much more rad than this sitch. To be frank, it seems that people are questing for ultra plush bed-chairs in which they intend to stare at screens and surrender their mobility for hours at a time, and that's disheartening, though I understand it's not all by choice. Still, a decent chain really need only support a body for a few hours at a time, before said body begins to feel a crumpled, suffering mess, at which point it's time to not be sitting, you know? (Esp because the 6 to 8+ hour comfy life in a tricked out bed-chair, is a bit hazardous to your life.)This chair surpasses that benchmark.", 
    "it lacks padding but i don't spend hours at a time in it - looks great!", 
    "I have two of these now, for 2 of my kids. Chairs were easy to assemble, sturdy, easy to clean, they are not cushy soft, but I was not looking for super soft seat. it is simple, sturdy, allegiant office chair. I bought one of my mother now. so total of three.", 
    "Easy to put together. Look nice. Semi comfortable. Reasonable price. Light weight. Sturdy.", 
    "easy to put together. look great!", 
    "I have bought at least 20 of these chairs over the past year to use in business centers in our apartment communities. To date, I have not had to replace one. The are AWESOME!", 
    "leather is great, size good, hardware sustainable.", 
    "a little hard to assemble, but its very nice", 
    "Although this chair is elegant and easy to assemble, I have noticed that the edge of the seat is separating. This surprises me as I do not put my feet up on my seats! It is quite minor, and do not anticipate having this chair fall a part. However, this is not a chair you will want to sit on for hours and hours at a time, for major office work you probably will need to spend a lot more for a fully padded office chair. It suits my style and it goes well with the \"Whitman Plus Office Desk,\" that I also purchased on Overstock.", 
    "The chairs arrived in no time. This set-up is easy and takes less four mints to put together. Great Buy:)", 
    "We just received these and they look great. However they are not very comfortable at all. Good system to keep meetings short.", 
    "This is a decent chair for the price. Stylish and light weight. Not bad, not bad at all.", 
    "I needed several several chairs for a new office set-up that would look modern and wear well. These chairs assemble easily and look great. There has not been a single issuse with any of them.", 
    "Even more Beautiful than on-line!! Very sturdy! I got RED as an accent color for my home office!! And looks contemporary & Grand!!!", 
    "this chair has a great look. That would be why we bought it... however, it is a very uncomfortable chair. The quality isn't what i thought it would be either...ts been in the home for a few months and not used terribly much, yet its already starting to show wear when it shouldn't be.", 
    "Exactly like the pictures. exactly what I wanted.", 
    "I've looked around for office chairs at a reasonable price. Although I don't use them very often, they seem to be sturdy, and they look great!", 
    "great quality...at a great price...sturdy, stylish and easy assembly", 
    "Loved it so much I am going to buy 2 more.", 
    "Love this chair. Accents my kitchen desk really, comfortable and sleek.", 
    "I have a \"girl cave\" and it fits right in with all of my other Buckeye paraphanalia!!! Great purchase and so easy to put together! Love it", 
    "I am please with the Chair", 
    "love the chair. looks awesome and comfortable.", 
    "Great size, easy to put together and very comfortable.", 
    "The chairs are beautiful and functional. And they are incredibly easy to put together. The one issue that we had was with the lift handle - several were broken upon arrival and we've had a couple break with minimal use.", 
    "This is a very handsome affordable chair. It is comfortable, however the chair seat could be less stiff or have a little pad. I will try to purchase a 17x17 cushion.", 
    "Came quickly and easy to put together. It looks great in my office but is a little uncomfortable. I would recommend this chair!", 
    "I would have given this product 5 stars if the manufacture had packaged a clean product. The metal and wheels were so dusty and dirty that I originally thought it was damaged. The bubble wrap and packaging it was in look as if someone has taken it out of the garbage, it was FILTHY! If I had not waited almost a month to get this package due to the horrible winter weather in the mid-Atlantic and if the box integrity wasnt damaged, I would have requested a replacement. PERIOD!Because this had my skin boiling, I literally had to wait a week or so to go into my office to wipe it down and assemble it.Also, the directions were minimal as in no words, just pictures which is fine if you are confident in assembly skills. Step 1 was the only thing that had me stumped, but the other 4 steps werent bad at all and self explanatory. Now the goooood! I love this chair...very mod/contemp look with clean lines. The quality of the materials used is of great quality, especially considering the price of this chair. I am 5'6 180lbs and the chair appears to hold up with no issues. It rises up pretty high which I would pressume would accommodate someone taller than me. However, my desk is only but so high, so it works for me. The chair allows you to tilt back but not lock the tilt in place. So its more of a rocking motion if you decide to release the tilt lever. I actually like this feature because I have anxiety issues and rocking kind of helps. lol The chair rolls smoothly which I was worried about because I had a similar chair that would get stuck on my carpet. This chair does not give me those issues. The brown is true to the picture, its very chocolate and in very low lighting, it appears blackish. It works perfect for my decor and function so Im happy with this purchase. Goes well with the desk that I also purchased from O.co", 
    "This is a great looking and comfortable chair at a good price. Contrary to several reviews...this chair telescopes up and down and does tilt back. You just have to be smart enough to work the adjustment lever. LOL! The chair is comfortable if you like a firmer chair...and I sit in it 8+ hours a day.", 
    "I am pleased with this chair.", 
    "recommend for any one, great product we are very satisfied", 
    "The chair looks GREAT! It was relatively easy to put together but is really uncomfortable. We ordered 6 and used them in our small conference room but they are so hard no one uses that room anymore if they can avoid it.", 
    "Great quality and great price! After spending months looking for the right product for the right price I found it!", 
    "Love this modern design. Found the first one at ****** . Have two desks in den--so needed a second chair. Found this one on line--matches perfectly. Love it, but have noticed the stitching on the armrest seems to be lifgtly coming off (???) Hard to describe--nothing major--but do hope the chair(s) hold up. They do look modern and great in my den, however.", 
    "You get what you pay for. Very uncomfortable, and looks good but not made for everyday.", 
    "My review is not really about quality - it's about comfort. We have these chairs in a small conference room at work, and while they are cool and contemporary looking, they are UNCOMFORTABLE!! No support at all and no cushion. After about 15 minutes, you're done.", 
    "This chair is very sexy and chic. I purchased the white with chrome and it compliments my white with chrome desk very well!!", 
    "I love this chair. It is comfortable. It is sleek. It fits perfectly.", 
    "I like this chair. The chair back frame is bent a tiny bit but not noticeable enough to send it back. Overall good quality, super easy assembly and perfect for a quick facelift to one's office.", 
    "I had been looking for months for a not too big white office chair. This one was a great price and very comfortable for me. (short, medium build, likes to sit straight). It came quickly, went together in about 15 or 20 minutes and looks great!", 
    "I am very pleased with this chair it is light weight and moves easily ,very comfortable and nice clean lines and appearance. I also found it very easy to put together. A lovely addition to my office.", 
    "Great chairs for the value. Great quality as well and it gives your conference room a professional look.", 
    "some of the screw was not good and I could not install it", 
    "Easy to assemble - very comfortable- perfect desk chair!!", 
    "I was not satisfied at all very poor quality. Very disappointed trying to decide If I should keep it and have two mismatched chairs or are it apart and send It back", 
    "I wanted a office chair that has some chrome look to it. The price is good, for that look. There's some other chairs that I look at before that has that chrome look but is real high price. I just didn't want anything that looks plain. It's not soft but I do like the look of it. My husband put it together with no problem.", 
    "I bought this chair to replace my old wooden chair I have had in my home office for years, this chair suits my needs. It was easy to assemble, only a few minutes and I was in business. Its a very quality chair and has a modern look. Its comfortable and adjustable. I work from home and sit it in for many hours without any issues. Good buy, thank you Overstock.", 
    "Good product, speedy delivery; good experience shopping online", 
    "As a senior (70+) I assembled the chair myself without any problems. The instructions were very clear. It is perfect with my white desk that I also purchased form you .", 
    "This is actually a second purchase for me. I moved and sold the first one, and liked the styling so much I purchased a second one. I love the availability of different colors; I just went with black but toyed with white quite a bit. The chair suits my needs well (but, I'm 5'6\" and don't really sit at the computer all that often). The chair has stiff lumbar support so if that's important to you, you may want to search for a product that has that adjustable. Here, it's just a metal bar built into the styling and frame. Nonetheless, I love the chair and styling and would recommend for a modern decor.", 
    "It has been just over a month that I purchased this chair and had not used it much, as I was just moving in to a new apartment and needed to settle. My wife sat on the chair today and stated that something was funny about it and wished to never sit on it again. As a result, I went to inspect the chair to see what was wrong with it and to my dismay the leg roller/tires broke. Now, this is chair cannot serve its' purpose. I demand a refund."
