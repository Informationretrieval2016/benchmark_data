    "The table is beautiful...the variation in grain makes it look very expensive. It appears very well made. I might add a coat of poly to make sure that the top doesn't get nicked up", 
    "We love our new table! Recommended by Customer Service after another table was out of stock, it is truly the perfect table for our family. It was a little tall compared to what we were used to, but we cut a few inches off the legs with a table saw and it's perfect now. It is dark and heavy but totally unconventional. Cuts a fine figure, bohos up that farmhouse style we have going on. Would highly recommend. (but measure your chairs first!)", 
    "This table is beautiful. Easy to put together and solid wood. only regret that I didn't get the 96' with the drop down leaves. But this will seat 8 and the chairs are pricey so more table length is more chairs. Either way, still love it and it's perfect"
