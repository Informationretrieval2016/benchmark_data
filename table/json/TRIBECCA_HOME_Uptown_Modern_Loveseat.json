    "Bought the sofa and the loveseat for my living room. This room doesn't get much use, so I didn't need a super set. Was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. Easy to put together. Took 10 bolts and several screws to assemble. Pay attention to the velcro cover at the bottom that hides where the bolts go. Peel it back and you're ready to go. It really looks fantastic! durable faux suede fabric. I have this fabric on my family room furniture and it is sooooo easy to clean. This would be perfect for a young couple getting started. I have received several compliments already. Just a tip, my UPS guy usually delivers in the afternoon, but because the boxes took up so much space, they came first thing in the morning to get them off the truck.", 
    "Very good for an accent piece or in a home office. Not sturdy enough for everyday use. Legs are not of quality. Noticed a large crack in one leg after a few months. Good value and look for the price. Just don't plan to use this in a living room that gets used everyday.", 
    "This love seat is cute and looks good in my livingroom. However putting it together was not easy from the directions. The directions are comprised of pictures only. In order to secure the back of the loveseat to the sides there is a velcro panel at the bottom of the back that can be pulled back to fasten the screws. It took a couple of hours before I figured that out. Otherwise I'm happy with the purchase.", 
    "I'm very disappointed in this couch. The color was right on, but it's very uncomfortable, the cushions are way to large they hang over and don't stay in place. If I had kept the box I would of returned it.", 
    "These couches are very cute but little. They could be more comfy as they are a bit stiff. Hopefully they soften up a bit with time. However, they look nice. I like the color and they are the right size for my small room.", 
    "I had some problems assemblying by myself. A little awkward. The directions could have been clearer. The sheet looked like it had been copied numerous times so was hard to read. Once it's together, I like it and it suits my needs. Overall, I like it a lot but would get help putting it together next time. It takes two, or one strong guy which I'm not.", 
    "I was in search of a very small sofa for my office -- it is pretty much impossible to find one in stores that's <60\" wide unless you buy a very high end product, I discovered, and I had more like just 58\" to work with. Though I've just assembled it -- no durability check to report -- it is a perfect buy for a modestly used, small-scale space (like my office). It is big enough for 2 folks to sit on, long enough for a mid-sized or smaller person to lie and take a nap. It is on the firmer side but not horribly so (it gives structure), and it looks very tailored and professional. I don't think it would hold up too well to active, bouncy kids (like mine!), but it really is a fine and affordable purchase for these other uses. Pretty straightforward to assemble, but remember 2 things: the flap that opens at the bottom of the middle piece (as other reviewers have noted) -- ingenious, but if you don't look for it you have no idea how to attach the sides (once you find it, you think, \"Wow, that was smart of them.\"). And though the pictoral directions don't make this super clear -- there are **3** bolts attaching each side to the back, not just 2 at the bottom. I missed the upper bolts (which really are important for stable assembly) until near the end of things, and it was a pain to get them screwed in at that point. But I did it, and now it's a charming addition to the space.", 
    "This loveseat doesn't come with any surprises. It has a nice contemporary look, the color is a little darker than online-- more of a camel, but still very nice. Although the directions were only pictures, it was a straight forward, 6-step assembly. Even on my own as a girl, I was able to put it together. The cushions are a little firm, but things only get softer over time. Seats two comfortably. Good for a small apartment or as extra seating in any room.", 
    "After searching for days for a sofa and love seat set for my apartment, I decided to go with the Uptown Collection Peat Sofa and the complimentary loveseat and they are just fantastic. The reviews of these pieces are also very accurate so I was not surprised with what I ended up with. As other reviews have stated the color is darker but not dark. It's a much richer color than depicted and is still definitely in the \"beige/light brown\" family. Assembly wasn't difficult after my room mate and I deciphered the directions (they are more like Ikea directions - pictures only; and I would venture to guess for some the pictures may be hard to understand). It took a little over an hour to put together the first, but the second went faster when we got the hang of it!", 
    "This was my first on-line furniture purchase and I am very pleased with the couch. It is comfortable and the right size for my office. It is not bulky. Thanks to all the previous reviews regarding the color and comfort. It helped me make my decision faster. Love it!!!", 
    "Due to space constraints, I needed a small loveseat. This does exactly that. This is a great sofa if you want something small. Shipping was fast and straightforward as well. The parts come in a (heavy) box, and you must assemble it yourself with a power drill. I definitely needed two people for assembly--the parts are too cumbersome for just one person. I am not crazy about the brown color, which is darker than in the photo on this site. Also, it is comfortable but not the most luxuriously soft sofa I've ever sat on. It is somewhat firm, good for back support. Because the quality of the product only seems fair, the sofa is functional for my purposes, but not a purchase I'm really excited about. Good, but not wonderful.", 
    "This sofa came in much darker than pictured on the website, but it's not a terrible, it's like a mocha color. The only thing i didn't like was that the couch was \"passsion suede\", that's what the tag on the couch said. It was very easy to put together, and they seem very sturdy, for such a light weight couch. They are a bit firm to sit on, and the arms are lower than normal but it still works and severs it's purpose. It's a great looking couch, except the cushions do over hang by about one & half inches over the front. I found it annoying at first but now i don't even notice it.", 
    "Looks good...feels less good. A bit firmer than I would have liked but for the price it does the job.", 
    "Although bought separately it is a perfect match with the chair and ottoman I purchased. A little time to assemble, but not difficult. I love it.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Placed in the master bedroom.", 
    "This sofa was easy to assemble, but it's a little hard. Maybe over time the cushions will give in more, but for now it's not that comfortable to sit on. The fabric is okay, but is more canvas like than linen.", 
    "easy to assemble, looks as good as the pictures", 
    "I won't except this when it comes. I did see the price as being that high I thought it was in the 200s not 400", 
    "It took a little while to assemble but looks just as the picture.", 
    "Good value for the price. Pretty solid construction...nice fabric...comfortable seating. Only have had loveseat for a few months but so far I'm happy.", 
    "Love the firm pillows, we won't sink into it. Seating pillows slide out a bit after sitting on it, but that is an easy fix.", 
    "I've had this sofa for 6 months now. The soft gets alot of use and is still as comfortable as it was from day one. This sofa is very easy to assemble.", 
    "Very poorly (cheaply) constructed.", 
    "Very nice in our living room.", 
    "thought this was going to be an amazing purchase,however i was sadly disappointed with the quality of this piece of furniture made in china.....to much effort to return.Looks like i am stuck with it tell i can afford new furniture again.buyer beware.....", 
    "I was trying to find a loveseat for my bedroom, one that didn't have loose back cushions. This one fit the bill.The only negative I have is with the seat cushions sitting on the cushions edge seems to break it down.", 
    "Not too difficult to put together. Nice and solid design", 
    "I was very hesitant to purchase furniture online, but finally decided to give it a try. The loveseat is lovely and I am enjoying it quite a bit. My only caveat is that it is a BEAST to assemble.", 
    "Love this! It is the perfect size for our little living room. And it is comfortable also. My husband had it put together in 15 minutes.", 
    "got this while waiting for my special order sofa, will probably sell", 
    "perfect size for my small living room, great color.", 
    "Love the look. Sofa is stiff but will soften with time. Size is perfect for small spaces. I purchased mine for an office...just the right size! Dark grey is almost charcoal colored.", 
    "This couch is comfortable and beautiful. Like other reviewers have said, the cushions stick out a little bit so be conscious of that before buying. Also the assembly is a bit of a pain, one of the holes wasn't in the right spot and my husband had to use a drill. All in all - worth more than the price we paid for it and we are so happy with our purchase. The 'grey linen' shade matches with everything and it is a great addition to our first living room as newlyweds.", 
    "Great quality and perfect small scale loveseat. Only comment is the nails that were sent were really dirty and got the white fabric dirty when I was assembling everything.", 
    "This loveseat is definitely more of a beige than white. I was picturing off-white or eggshell colored at the darkest, but it is much darker. It was not very hard to assemble. It only took about 30 minutes. The cushions don't seem to fit just right because they are not exactly the same shape. But this isn't very noticeable Other than that it is a nice little loveseat. I was able to make it work in the room by adding some accents that bring the white and beige together.", 
    "I got this loveseat in charcoal, but it definitely has a touch of a blueish hue in the grey. I personally love the color and think it's perfect, but just an FYI if you're matching a specific palette. That being said this is awesome! I use it in my therapy office and it's modern and stylish. It's comfy without being overly soft, which is great for my purposes. And it was easy to put together and very sturdy. Added bonus, it doesn't have that chemically \"new couch\" smell that a lot of new furniture has. I'm sensitive to chemicals and was worried about this, but I didn't have any issue with it.", 
    "This looks fabulous and gives us the style we love. It's in our more formal sitting room, and does the job for us as a young couple. Sometimes the legs turn a little bit, but that's a fix I can manage on my own.", 
    "This is exactly what is shown. I have it in microfiber and it's nice. But, it is pretty stiff. Hoping it will \"break-in\" and be a little bit more comfortable.", 
    "It's an ok loveseat. Material not the best. Glad I purchased when on sale.", 
    "Goes beautiful with other piece. Great qualify", 
    "I ordered the linen gray in this couch. However when it arrived it was much closer to chambray. It was enough of a discrepancy in color that we needed up reap king it and shipping it back. Luckily I ended up not putting together because I could immediately see the color was off. However, from what I could tell the quality and make of the sofa was very good. Just be aware that the color on your computer may not be a good representation of the actual color. And in the case of the gray linen. They need to not call it that because it looks just like a light chambray with gray undertones. The gray is there but you have to stand in the right light and right position to see any gray.", 
    "I was in need of a smaller sofa and love seat for a smaller room in my home. This set looks beautiful online. Although the scale is perfect the quality is far below what I expected considering cost. There is very little padding on the arms, I am continually having to adjust the cushions after use ( they move ). The fabric on the cushions also \"shift\" its not a tight fit. I'm disappointed and fear this set will not last.", 
    "Beautiful color with clean lines. A little firm but nice for extra seating that doesn't take up a lot of space.", 
    "Just received this loveseat. Looks nice. The quality is not worth the price.", 
    "Originally purchased the couch and loved how simple and elegant it was I purchased the matching loveseat. Easy to assemble however not the most comfortable thing.", 
    "Not comfortable and too small. Poorly made, it fell apart.", 
    "I just got this love seat yesterday and it is very nice looking, I got it in the linen gray and was very easy to assemble even though it took me like 45 min. It is also pretty comfortable- i hope it holds up and doesn't sink in. As far as other reviewers complaining about the cushions sticking out.... that is how it is supposed to be! That is just the look of it.The only reason I am giving it 4 stars not 5 is because it is pretty small but works very well for me in my small studio apartment.", 
    "Beautiful fabric in great color. Love seat was easy to put together and is perfect for our space. Quality product.", 
    "received in grey -- not very easy to assemble, the directions are not as easy as the 4 steps they listed. couch is VERY firm and cushions are oversized. Pros- was cheap and looks nice.", 
    "This loveseat is a great color and was easy to put together however, after 1 use, one of legs cracked down the middle. Not meant for 2 people or everyday use.", 
    "Appealing but not very comfortable.", 
    "Sturdy and well made. Looks like High-End piece", 
    "This little love seat was perfect for my needs, I had a very small space and needed a little couch. It arrived well packaged and was in good condition. It took about an hour to put it together. It looks very nice and I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "I ordered these because I wanted a classic style sofa for a good price. But it came in a million pieces, the quality is sketchy, its small, the cushions dont fit right (they stick out in the front past the base frame)", 
    "This Loveseat is very well made very easy to put it together, the only thing I was disapponted is the cushions sticks out 4 inches and it looks like to big for the loveseat, but when I look at the discrintersection description that's the way it is but I'm still disappointed", 
    "This little love seat is exactly as pictured. It is an occasional piece not a daily heavy use piece. I opened the box outside and carried each piece inside and up stairs. It was off the curb and put together in less than an hour and it's adorable. Perfect for my bedroom. I shopped around and couldn't find anything comparable price wise that didnt then tack on and extra $100 delivery. Free delivery and great price.", 
    "Have owned it for over a year and it is comfortable and sturdy", 
    "These are the nicest loveseats I have in my inventory. They look classy and yet are not huge and heavy. The lines and the fabric are very rich looking. Have several in my inventory.", 
    "I needed a small sofa or loveseat for my cozy downtown apartment. I searched for months and decided to take a chance with this one. All I can say is WOW! It is very sturdy, well built and to my surprise was not difficult to put together. I love the fabric. Very modern clean linen look and feel. The grey was exactly what I was looking for. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "Fairly easy to put together. Very light weight. Great for small spaces. My only issue is the cushions seems to slide forward a lot.", 
    "This is definitely a cute loveseat, but if I had to buy again I'd save my money for something sturdier. The main issue is that the bottom panel (the whole weight-bearing section of the sofa) is not anchored on much - the first time my friend and I sat on it after we had made it, it broke through! It's just poorly-designed and cheap quality. I am going to have to get more pieces of wood to fully support that bottom panel before I feel comfortable really using it. I am disappointed in the poor quality and probably would have returned it were it not such a pain to pack the whole thing up again. The only thing I like is that it is kind of comfortable and it is cute.", 
    "The loveseat did not disappoint - hard to know when you purchase sight unseen and felt and tried. It looks nice in the living room and a perfect size.", 
    "This is a wonderful little loveseat! It's the perfect size for my small space and it's very comfortable (I've even slept on it a few times). I'm happy I caught the gray version when it was in stock. It goes great with my decor. An overall wonderful purchase!", 
    "Once I figured out how to put it together it was relatively easy. The hardest part was figuring out the legs but again once I got it it was fine. Really was a two person operation. The price was great and it looks awesome. I also bought two matching chairs same issues.", 
    "This loveseat looks great in my living space, but it's not very comfortable. I just looked at the price again and I would not pay that much for this product if I had seen it in person first.", 
    "I read the reviews about having to assemble yourself. I always put things together in my house and while I would rather not have to assemble a loveseat/sofa, it really was not that bad. The instructions are only pictures which makes it really hard to see the very small print on some of it. It does not warn you \"not to tighten before this other piece goes on\" and things like that. But, I have put enough stuff together, it was not as hard as it could have been. For the money and free shipping, I didn't mind it at all. If you are shopping for furniture in the first place from Overstock.com, you are obviously looking for a bargain. I feel like this is a great price for what you get. If you want top quality, you need to go to a furniture store and even then, I have gotten worse than this at a furniture store already assembled and paid a hefty delivery charge.", 
    "I purchased the gray, linen loveseat, the matching chair and the ottoman for my bedroom. I had recently purchased a large, expensive, leather living room set. In comparison, the thought put into the bedroom set was far superior to that of the leather living room set! The Tribecca Home set was made with a lightweight wooden frame resulting in lightweight furniture. This is great when putting it together and moving it to where you want it but we have it sitting on a wooden floor and it does slide easily when sitting down. It is not a big deal to me but certainly worth noting. The material itself is wonderful! For those wondering if it is a gray microfiber it is not. I don't know if it is actual \"linen\" but I love it! The directions on how to put it together are only pictures and leave a lot to be desired. As other reviewers noted, you need to unzip in some inconspicuous places in order to put it together. Once you find where the screws go be warned that the picture only shows one screw that connects the arm to the base but there are two. There is one that attaches to the arm to the back. I had to go back and add that... sheesh! The legs are a little tricky to get them on so they are all facing the right direction. I would suggest paying attention to them before screwing adding the screws that hold them in place. All in all, I love this furniture. I am hoping that the padding will hold up nicely over time.", 
    "The color is more of a canvas blue, not a full blue but overall, good couch, great price. Very modern looking. Agree with other reviewers that cushions hang a bit over, look like they'll fall out but they're stable.", 
    "I bought this loveseat about a month ago and I absolutely love it! It was very easy to set up and looks sleek in my office. I read previous reviews that this loveseat was small, but in actually it is not noticeably smaller than any other loveseat I have previously owned. I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a loveseat.", 
    "This loveseat, and I would suspect the rest of 'Tribecca Home's' product line (it used to be Ethan Home) is utter garbage. When it arrived, it was obviously a piece of junk and Overstock offered to take it back, however, they required me to pay for return shipping, which would have been significant. It hasn't even lasted a year and the cushions are completely shot. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.", 
    "Again another item purchased through Overstock.com. It is easy to select items for your home, or as gifts from O.CO.", 
    "this product is of sturdy quality, comfortable, rich color, easily assembled, fully functional, and exactly as I expected, no surprises; thoroughly happy with product, delivery & price.", 
    "I read other's reviews so I knew the color was going to be a little off than what is pictured, and it is. It's more brown, like a light brown. I was very disappointed when it arrived because there were a lot more pieces than I thought there would be. My husband assembled it for me. After it was assembled, I was relieved to see how nice it looked. My only problem with this couch was assembly. But for the price, it's worth it. It wasn't difficult to put together for my husband. It's very classy looking. And it fits well in the small space I needed it for. So if you don't mind assembling this couch, it's worth it. Matching ottoman is a must.", 
    "This love seat looks nice, but shows tracks every time it is touched. It also is not to sturdy.", 
    "Looks fine, although certainly is not heavy duty. Extremely stiff to sit in, which was the preference of the person I purchased it for but is not to everyone's taste. You do not sink in at all but rather are kept at attention. :-)", 
    "I needed something that was neutral, basic, and not too big. It fit the bill perfectly. In fact, it looked better than I hoped it would. It filed a niche perfectly.", 
    "I needed a small loveseat for our guest bedroom that we were turning into a home office. After much research, I found this loveseat and it was perfect for the spot. Really happy with it.", 
    "Needed a small love seat and this was perfect for the price! Looks great.", 
    "I like this love seat. It is a good value for the price. We found it a limitless difficult to put together. It shipped from California and by the time it got here there was a hole in the box, which I did not notice and most of the hardware was missing. I think this was a problem with the shipper not the company. We were able to scrounge the house and find enough hardware.", 
    "Satisfied. I think it's a good value for the price. It had many parts to put together, but I had the assistance of some company workers.", 
    "The love seat is small, but enough room for two people to sit close. It is perfect for the space I wanted it for...just in case we have a few people over, the sofa and chairs we have might not be enough. It is small enough to go in corner by the fireplace. It came in a box, and the pieces had to be screwed together for the frame and legs, then the cushions sit on top. They do not hang over too much on my love seat, as I saw on an earlier review. The funny thing is our cat! He LOVES this seat. He sniffs it and runs around like it's catnip! He even tried to bite the bottom part of the frame. Weird! I wonder what is in the stuffing...", 
    "Please do not buy this piece of junk. It will fall apart every time you move it. Quality is terrible, pieces don't even fit well together. It's a shame they sell stuff like this, and we waste our precious money this way. This company should be ashamed.", 
    "Except for the cushions which extend 3 inches beyond the frame, we are pleased. The close up photos show this, but in reality it is more noticeable. We asked for replacement cushions but Overstock responded that the ones we received are correct and made a price adjustment. I will plan to have the cushions redesigned by an upholsterer. I was pleased with Overstock's immediate response and customer service and will continue to do business here.", 
    "Love this piece of furniture. Fits well in my loving room and a friend helped me to put it together and it wasn't too difficult.", 
    "This is a firm but comfortable loveseat. My husband built it with no problem. It took about 40 minutes to put together. The color is similar to a light brown/latte. I would have rated it 5 stars but the color was darker than I expected.", 
    "This loveseat is pretty comfortable and was easy to put together. The only thing is that the color of the fabric didn't match what was on the site. It still goes well with the color of my walls.", 
    "This is a nice little piece of furniture. Easy to put together.", 
    "Glad I read reviews 1st about velcro on back, that made it a peice of cake to put togeather. Only took me about 20 min. by myself. Would recommend to any one.Cleans up nicley, grand baby spit up 10 min. after complete cleaned up like a charm.", 
    "i needed a quality loveseat for my studio apartment and after a comparative search i narrowed my choices down to this sofa. it was the color i wanted, the size needed and the price was right. but one question remained: would it be comfortable? it arrived quickly, took about 1/2hr to assemble and it looks great. so, is it comfortable? well, the cushions initially felt a bit stiff but the more i sit on it, the more comfortable it becomes. plus, the material is nice and soft. some reviewers felt the peat color was off, that the real thing is darker than the photo. my opinion is that the color of my sofa is pretty dead on. its microfiber though, so depending on the way you brush the material, it may appear to be darker or lighter. other colors you could call it: light taupe, latte, dark khaki.", 
    "I ordered bot the sofa and loveseat and am very pleased with my purchase. The color is closer to a ginger brown, but still looks great with my olive-green living room walls. The style is simple and construction good. And I personally like the firmer cushions - easier to get up from!", 
    "Not the most comfortable Loveseat, but perfect for the playroom. It's the perfect size for a smaller space. It's a great deal for the price.", 
    "This is a great little-bitty sofa at a great price. Shipped super-quick and really not difficult to put together; I did it myself 'cuz hubby hates that kind of thing. I like puzzles, it took me an hour but I'm perhaps a bit slower than the average bear--and as I said, it was like a game! It 's the perfect little couch for my dining room. It is high enough and light enough to pull up to the table for additional seating, not too deep so it dosen't take up too much visual space; and it's comfy enough to lie on and throw my legs over the end to watch my husband wash the dishes!", 
    "I ended up buying the sage sofa, but they include color swatches and I can tell you the color is way off. It is much darker and more yellow-brown, more of a tobacco color.", 
    "we bought the loveseat for our new rv the one that came with the rig was so uncomfortable we couldn't set on it....so we had been looking for a new one, but it couldn't be any longer than 54 to 55 inches..which was almost impossible to find and when we did find one the price was REALLY expensive. so when i found this we were sooo excited it has worked out just perfect for us.", 
    "The loveseat serves its purpose. It is not terribly comfortable, but I didn't expect, or need, it to be. It is very nice looking and was easy to put together. I am satisfied.", 
    "I was really happy with this loveseat when it arrived. I live in a small town so I figured it would take a little longer to ship, but it arrived within 4 days of ordering. It was simple to put together as well, the only trick is to make sure you open the velcro underneath the back so you can insert the screws. I read that on another review that complained about the difficulty of assembly so I knew what to look for ahead of time. It took maybe a half hour or a little less to assemble and looks great with my tan microfiber couch. The color is darker than the picture makes it seem however, my couch is a light tan and the loveseat is more of a light-medium mocha. It's still very pretty so if that color coordinates with your furnishings I would definitely recommend it. It is a little firm but I wouldn't say its uncomfortable, I'm sure after some use it will soften. Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase, being military we didn't have a lot to spend on a loveseat and this fit perfectly into our budget!", 
    "This love seat is very nice for the price. The fabric is very easy to wipe clean, which is nice if you have kids. The assembly directions are not very clear and it took us awhile to put together. I'm not sure how well it will hold up over time but we have had it for 4 months and it still looks great. A good buy for the money.", 
    "Love this. Have 2 dogs who regularly jump on this wet & muddy. Just wiped clean. I have the tan color one."
