    "I was looking for a tv stand for my bedroom that was slim enough to fit between my bed and the wall while also having extra room for storage. This table did the trick. It is a cream color, not a true white and while my furniture is a light gray color since the cabinet is neutral in color, it works with my other furniture. If you are looking for an inexpensive option that looks more expensive than it is then this is perfect for you.", 
    "Cute and better quality than I was expecting for the low price. I like it!", 
    "The Vintage Accent Cabinet is just a great piece of furniture, I wanted an accent piece to fit in a space that wasn't bulky but gave a nice little touch and this did just that. The only complaint I have is that one of the bottom screws to the cabinet is sticking out and you are unable to screw it back in, Also it comes with a notice stating that the screws are not covered .To me the company seems to already know that their is a screw issue so they should just take care of it so that people don't complain. Other than that the cabinet is adorable.", 
    "Perfect cabinet for a small space. Lots of room in the compartments. Just what I was looking for.", 
    "The quality of this product is not a nice I would have like, but okay for the price I guess. I ordered two and one arrived damaged but I did not want to go through the hassle of returning.", 
    "I love it so much it came already put together iim so happy with it great price for it can't go wrong", 
    "Very functional and stylish addition to my entryway. Love the fact that it was already put together.", 
    "I purchased this accent cabinet as a TV stand but it also works as great storage in my bedroom. It's a great addition to my bedroom! Not to mention, I love that it was already assembled!", 
    "This is a great console, that came completely assembled which was a wonderful surprise. The scale of the piece is a bit small so be sure to read the measurements. I am using it for a coffee center in a hair salon. The door area on the cabinet is quite roomy. I have a spare coffee carafe in there along with about 6 coffee cups with room to spare. The drawers are plenty deep and glide nicely. The color is exactly as pictured on my monitor. Thanks overstock!", 
    ".. It works fine for the purpose I intended it for (extra bathroom storage. And although I'm glad that it arrived fully assembled, the top left corner was noticeably chipped (about 3\"). Not wanting to deal w the hassle of an exchange, I decided to keep it. It's obviously not a high quality piece of furniture, but for the price it isn't too bad", 
    "I have a small bedroom and this piece which is simple, but stylish is perfect for additional storage.", 
    "I had been looking for this for a while.",
