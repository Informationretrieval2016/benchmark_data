    "I ordered these tables with trepidation having had a bad experience previously with another site, but I was extremely pleased with them. They were exactly as advertised, beautiful and functional. Very easy to assemble with clear directions and tool provided. I've been looking for quite some time to find tables with storage I'd like, not an easy task, but these exceded my expectations. I would recommend these tables to anyone who wants a quality item with a practical use", 
    "I hesitated to buy this when I saw \"Assembly Required\" as I expected it to be one of those pressed-board kits with a million metal connector pieces (hinges, screws, handles, etc.) I gave it a try when another reviewer testified that it was really wood. I bought two of them for a living room. They arrived (free shipping) in 3 days! Imagine my surprise and delight when I opened the boxes to find that 1. they are really wood; 2. the wood parts (4 sides, top) were packed really well and in the order that I needed them for assembly; 3. all the connector parts were already attached! The handles were even already affixed to the front door. The four sides fit together with metal tabs (just tap them together tightly - I used a rubber mallet but it isn't necessary) and the only six screws were to attach the top to the frame. I had the first one completed in 20 minutes and the second one in ten! They look great and I would buy more from this manufacturer. If they had been made in USA instead of China, they'd be perfect.", 
    "Love the end table. Order came with the box kind of smashed on one end and noticed some damage to the table. Contacted Overstock and they replaced the table immediately. Not only is the table perfect but I give a 10 to Overstock for replacing the table so promptly. Good work. The table is exactly like the picture...the wood finish is beautiful, and the workmanship is great....not at all flimsy but a strong, well made heavy table.", 
    "This very handsome end table is an amazing buy, but it does have quality control issues. I bought two; one was perfect, the other needed adjustment to the assembly brackets on one side and lacked holes for the upper shelf hardware. Fortunately, with a screwdriver and a drill both issues were fixable. All in all, this is a fine-looking piece of furniture at a bargain price.", 
    "This is by no means a high end piece of furniture, but for the price, it's one of my favorite pieces - in fact, I just ordered a second one! I purchased one for our home office which has a double-sized sleep sofa. It's a large room, but not huge and I wanted something for the end of the sofa on which to set glasses, iPad, drinks, etc..while reading. This works perfectly and has the great feature of having great (hidden) storage - so your room can look a bit tidier. It doesn't take up much room width-wise which was important. It is a substantial piece of furniture, made primarily of wood (versus MDF) which was important - though veneers are used, but you really can't avoid that these days. It is well-built and solid. It was easy to put together - my husband did it in less than thirty minutes and the way it was packaged and shipped, I could have done it myself easily (you simply attach the legs and insert the shelf - voila!. II like the color, design, functionality, and stability of this cabinet. It is of fairly substantial weight, but not too heavy to move around if you like to rearrange! I think that this piece could be used in various rooms, for multiple functions. I looked at other pieces in this line and actually purchased a smaller oval table that matches, but it just didn't have the same visual appeal, so I am purchasing a second one from Overstock to achieve a more balanced look. Overstock had the best price on the Internet for this cabinet, with free shipping, an added bonus!", 
    "Great little side table. I was looking for something that was more narrow than the one I currently had due to space. Very good quality of wood and easy to put together.", 
    "Excellent quality and packaging was amazing", 
    "This end table arrived undamaged and in a timely manner, was easy to assemble and is a quality piece of furniture. It's fairly lightweight, too. It has a good amount of storage and looks great! I am very pleased with this product!", 
    "Easy to assemble and very sturdy. Just what I was looking for .", 
    "I was looking for an inexpensive table for my living room and this fit the bill. Fairly easy to assemble and it is nice and sturdy.", 
    "I like it so much I'm going to buy 2 more", 
    "This cabinet was even better than I expected. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It went together smoothly and in just minutes it was in place in being used. The finish is lovely - smooth and rich looking. I have already had several compliments on the piece. It fits perfectly in the space I had in mind for it and it looks great. i would highly recommend this side table.", 
    "I ordered one of these end tables a few years ago and just ordered another. I was glad to see they still had this end table I have new furniture and needed another. The original is still in perfect condition even with 3 grandchildren opening the door for their blankets. This is the easiest piece of furniture I ever put together and the sturdiest. Packaged well no scratches or nicks in wood. Door is already attached which is usually hardest part of assembly. Nice finish on dark oak stain. Looks great. Would recommend or buy again.", 
    "It is so nice that this table is made from real wood. I cant stand the mdf that tends to be used now a days. It is great side table. It hold plenty of thing inside. It is a nice looking table. I am very happy with my purchase. It works great beside my recliner. Just want I needed. I highly recommend it.", 
    "These end tables are beautiful. Very well made", 
    "Love the color and the solid wood construction. Easy to put together.", 
    "Nice cabinet. Very well built. Sturdy.", 
    "Product description was as advertised,Quality was very good and assembly wasn't hard. Delivery was fast and packaging was in good shape. Very satisfied with this piece of furniture.", 
    "I am very satisfied with the appearance and quality of these tables. I had no difficulty with assembly. They are small but that is exactly what I wanted. I have one between 2 recliners and one by the sofa. They look great in my family room.", 
    "Color is true to the color shown in picture. The end table is easy to put together and looks like it came assembled!!! Fits very well when space is a concern. Holds plenty behind the door. My only wish is that the door/shelves were actually drawers.", 
    "These tables are really nice! They have a beautiful finish on them! They are heavy & sturdy! Just what I was looking for!!!", 
    "The end tables are easy to assemble and blend with the rest of my Craftsmen living room. I find them to be just the right size and shape for my small house.", 
    "Nice to find something made out of solid wood. On the small side.", 
    "This table is very elegant but has simple lines. It is made of hardwood and assembles easily. Very solid piece!. Beautiful rich golden oak! We love it!!!", 
    "Bought two of these for end tables. They were perfect and looked like a table that would cost over $***. Bought another matchig piece for beside the recliner and will be purchasing another one for alongside a chair. Perfect tables for the family room! The wood is finished so nicely, I'd have never guessed it was made in China.", 
    "I purchased these to go by the chairs in TV room until I could afford . nicer ones. They are not the high end quality, but they are very nice . I still have not replaced them and they are very practical. If something get spilled I do not panic.. If you are looking for something inexpensive but nice looking. These fit the bill.", 
    "perfect fit nice wood great price", 
    "still have it good storage", 
    "High quality product, solid wood, excellent finish. Friends amazed with the tables.Prompt delivery of tables.", 
    "Looks good and is inexpensive. It is wood, real wood, something rarely seen in furniture that must be put together. This is a small end table that allows us to \"hide\" items in the cabinet. My husband put it together in less than a half hour. Some connectors were not precise enough and needed to be pried apart. He also had to use a hammer to fit the pieces together. The cabinet hook is a little too tight and it takes a good tug to get the door open. Hopefully that will loosen up over time of using the door. There was one small area damaged on the inside it does not affect it's function or looks so I chose not to send it back.The only change in size would be that it would be a couple of inches wider so a small file box could slide into it. I am in hopes it will corral all the things that we must have within reach easily enough to clear up the clutter that always seems to exist.", 
    "Looks expensive, great value.", 
    "Great product. Solid wood. Recommend for good sturdy end table.", 
    "Table is well worth the money. Looks like you paid much more. Beautiful couldn't be happier.", 
    "Table well made with attractive stain on the wood. It was just perfect for using chair-side in our den.", 
    "Wonderful quality and very easy to assemble. Beautiful looking end table.", 
    "I couldn't wait to review this table for several reasons. It is even more beautiful than the picture and it is solid wood. It's exactly the size I was looking for -- it's just perfect!! Assembly was fairly easy, the door is already hinged and hardware is on it. I was so thankful for this because I have a beautiful pantry I got from Overstock and I had to hang the door on it, and I hope I never have to hang another one! I absolutely love this table, and it is high quality. When it arrived, the back piece was damaged on one side -- the first time I've ever had an issue with something I've ordered. I got on a Live Chat with a customer rep who was very courteous and helpful. And that's all I did!! He forwarded the issue to the proper person , who immediately contacted me by email telling me what was going to be done. I then heard from someone else in Customer Service telling me the issue was being handled. They kept me totally apprised of the situation, they notified the warehouse, and in just a few days I had a perfect back piece delivered. I was totally awed and amazed at the quick response and awesome customer service. I have always been impressed with Overstock because I've ordered and received some wonderful products, but I had never dealt with their customer service. It is wonderful. All it took was one contact on my part, and they IMMEDIATELY got on it. I didn't have to go to the trouble of returning the damaged piece or anything else. I can't praise them highly enough, because they truly know how to do it right and they're all about their customers!!!! Wonderful job Overstock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "We purchased two of these to serve as end tables in a park model RV. They fit perfectly and look good. From the picture, you might expect there are two drawers, and there are indeed two handles, but there is only a single door that swings open to reveal two shelves. Not a big issues, but something to note. The assembly is really simple and no special tools are needed. The colour is exactly as described, and the finish is even and rich looking. Be sure to check the package when it arrives because one of our tables was damaged beyond salvaging and had to be replaced.", 
    "Table was as represented and it works well. Colors are true", 
    "came quickly, easy to put together, looks good and suits its purpose.", 
    "needed this item to fit between my recliner and the wife's recliner, just to say it fit perfect did not have to move chairs one bit could not find a better end table for the price we looked in several stores to no avail.", 
    "This is a very pretty solid wood end table and the perfect size when you want something a little narrower. Had some assembly but very easy to do so. I put together myself and was done in 20 min. tops. All hardware is very sturdy.", 
    "I did quite a bit of comparison shopping, and settled on this table because of the great reviews....they were right on! It is a very heavy, very solid piece that looks expensive, but the price was the best of all those I reviewed. Also, this table was probably the easiest assembly I have ever done - the \"slide together\" concept they use is amazing, and it's obvious that it will hold up very well. This table was a definite find!", 
    "Very attractive, with a rich-looking and beautiful finish and wonderful oak grain. Heavy and very sturdy. Assembly was super easy. All parts fit together well. If I were to criticize anything it would be the shelves ... very loose fit with gaps around all sides. Great value. May get another.", 
    "I purchased 2; and am VERY pleased with these tables. Very easy to assemble. All The color was right what I wanted; so was especially happy they were as pictured.",

    "I ordered 2 of these and couldn't be more pleased. I went to several furniture stores and couldn't find what I was looking for. These were perfect and lit only took my husband 10 to 15 min each to put together. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thank you Overstock.", 
    "Excellent little cabinet. Great quality. Nice cinnamon color.",

    "Perfect end table for my needs. Easy to put together. Great quality for the price. Looks wonderful next to my sofa in the living room so I'm going to order another one. Fast shipping. Couldn't be happier with my first purchase from Overstock.", 
    "It is a great bedtime stand. It is deep, but it great to store books in it and other stuff.", 
    "I got two of these color . The was same on ooth. The first one was a little difficult to assemble because one piece was a little off on hardware placement. but the second table took less than 15 minutes to assemble with everything well measured. They tables are solid wood . The cabinets are roomy with plenty of storage for such narrow tables. The tables are heavy. The stain is rich medium oak. These tables look like some I've seen in stores for about **** each..",

    "Needed a small table between two chairs and this fit perfectly. Great color and quality. My husband put it together in about 10 minutes. Similar tables were easily twice as much at the furniture stores.",

    "fits well into a small area. lots of storage space", 
    "I've purchased many things over the years online. This chair end table is ideal for a laptop or whatever you want to do beside your lounge chair. The height and size is perfect for most anyone's needs.", 
    "Would recommend this to anyone who was looking for an end table that was not wide but deep. It fits perfectly in my living room and has added so much to the ambiance (as well as storage space). Very happy with this choice as well as the delivery time - VERY HAPPY!", 
    "I shopped for a chair side table everywhere and this was by far the nicest at a great price. There is a little assembly which was no problem and took just a few minutes. It's the perfect size for an end table next to my recliner. Solid wood!! Don't see that very often! I'm very happy with it.", 
    "It is hard to find solid wood furniture at reasonable prices nowadays, but these fit the bill perfectly. We are very happy with them. I wasn't aware they would require assembly when they arrived, but it was easy enough to do and they look great.", 
    "went together quickly and easily. Not fine furniture but perfect for a family roon or as a nightstand", 
    "I was amazed to see how beautiful the wood was when I opened the box- this is a great bargain for what it cost (I think I paid around $XXX or so). It was very easy to put together and took me about half an hour (I'm a middle-aged woman- not a handy-man!). I'm so pleased with it- I'm trying to figure out where I can put another one!", 
    "I would have rated them Excellent but one of the two end tables had a defect in the workmanship. The front panel with the door had one hinge where the screw was too close to the edge so it was split and would not close properly. I got on-line with an Overstock rep and they sent me a new front panel to replace it. The process was very easy. The tables required some assembly but very easy to put together and they are a solid piece of furniture once assembled. I love the storage inside and the rich color of the wood. Very happy once the defect was quickly and efficiently taken care of by Overstock.", 
    "This was the easiest table to put together. I had it together in less than 30 minutes. My other tables in the room are all oak and this table comes very close to matching the oak wood. I would highly recommend this product.", 
    "Heavy piece of furniture and fits perfectly between recliners; instructions for assembly easy. Note: place pegs and shelves in while piece is still upside down.", 
    "I was so very pleased when I recieved my end tables. The wood was solid, just as it was advertised and I am so glad I thought to shop here. You won't be disappointed with this item. I have purchased other end tables from companies around our living area and the cost of those were twice as much. What a find, this site is!"
