    "I've been looking all over the place for a tufted sofa. I like one from Restoration hardware but it was over xxxx, a local retail store had some options but they were even more money and I had to wait like 10 weeks to get it. I was hesitant to buy this one from Overstock because it had no reviews but I am so happy with my sofa. Let me tell you, this is a quality sofa. The seams, the buttons all line up PERFECTLY. The quality shows everywhere. Seating is extremely comfortable not soft not hard which is typical for tufted sofa. I absolutely love this sofa and you just cant go wrong if this is the style you are looking for.", 
    "I had high hopes for this sofa. Everything I'd purchased at Overstock previously had more than met my expectations. However, this was a big disappointment. First, it arrived with a broken leg. My first thought was that we would have it fixed. Overstock was great in that they were willing to pay for the repair. However, once the sofa was moved in the house the problems grew. The listing said the sofa was 90\" long. It's actually 96\" and would not fit where I had planned to put it. It's probably just as well--it looks like a traditional Chesterfield design. However, the back of the sofa slopes back so dramatically that, without a throw pillow behind me, I felt as though I was in a recliner. Plus the seat was so deep my feet were at least 10\" off the floor. I'm 5' 4\" and I've never had that happen before. It does seem to be a fairly well made sofa. Unfortunately, the negatives kept adding up and we decided to return it.", 
    "I am a professional interior designer and my vendor, after 20 long weeks of waiting, failed to deliver a chesterfield sofa I ordered for my client in Boston. A colleague who had good experience with Overstock advised me to check for good quality deals. It took some time to find but I decided for this sofa which turned out to be exactly ****+ less money than the one I originally purchased. Yes!!! ****!!!!! The sofa arrived a couple of days after our install date but we manage to keep the client happy with the rest of everything she received. To the point girl! .The sofa sits in a light color office surrounded by vintage and modern white and vintage wood furniture and I must say that it looks every bit the price of the more expensive pieces is surrounded by. The tailoring is excellent, the fabric is good and fairly soft for being a linen. As with with all new tufted sofas of this kind, you need to have decorative pillows, and that is the only negative thing I saw and that is the manufacturer of this sofa should include pillows of a different color to add some color combination to the sofa. Other than that, I think it is an excellent buy!", 
    "Just received the 90 inch Patrick sofa in Oyster. First of all, the quality is superb, and I'm a stickler for details, for which this sofa has plenty. This is not your average box store sofa. For what we paid, I'm very pleased. The Oyster color is not really a light gray as some have said, it truly is Oyster, a cool neutral color. The fabric is linen-like, it lacks the luster and sheen some linens have. The material has a matte finish and is very good quality. One concern people have appears to be with the length, but I can assure you the 90 inch is in fact 90 inches, outside arm to outside arm. It sits fairly firm, but then again it's new. The back is not high at all, and slants back quite a bit. If you do not use the pillows behind you, you will need very long legs to sit comfortably. The only downside to using the pillows against the back is that all the tufted detail gets hidden. You'll have to improvise here... Was reluctant to buy a piece of furniture sight unseen, but honestly could not be happier with the purchase. It came with Gold service delivery. They brought it in, unboxed it, put the legs on, inspected it, and took all the cardboard with them. Couldn't have asked for more. Buy it, you will not regret it!", 
    "I ordered the 103\" sofa in Sand. Firstly, it is NOT 103\" - it is 97-98\" but is still plenty long. The fabric is a sturdy, thick linen blend which is beautiful quality and seems like it'll stand up over time. The sand color is a true beige color - not khaki, not cream, not tan.It is not an extremely soft sofa but it is comfortable. The depth of the sofa is fine for me and my husband (5'4\" and 5'11\") and the even-height arms and back allow for the perfect arm-prop. It is plenty deep - my husband and I can lay comfortably side-by-side with one of us on our side and one on our back (this is not as easy to find in a nice-looking, quality sofa as you may think!). The workmanship is excellent. Every detail is perfect. It came with 2 full sets of legs - one set is the legs shown in the product image, the other set is a 'squared at the corner' set which would sit a little lower to the floor. There were 4 wooden blocks stapled securely to the bottom which puzzled the delivery guys but they removed them effortlessly with a flat-head screwdriver without damaging the sofa. I'm very satisfied with the purchase!", 
    "I have been watching this sofa for 4 months now, and going back and forth in my mind on which color I prefer-the charcoal or gray linen. I am so glad I went with the charcoal. It's rich looking and should hold up with kids. The charcoal is actually diff. in person than in the pics. I had no luck in the q&A section here, so I went on a whim. The closer color match came from my IPhone, rather than my comp screen. I think it has more of a warmer olive-brown undertone with the gray-and it isn't as dark nor as cool gray as on the comp screen. It looks great with brighter pillows, to give it a pop of color. I got the largest size because I had the room for it, plus I like the idea of having 3 legs in front and 3 in back for more support on a big piece. It IS 103 inches exactly, as described. The sofa can seat 4 thinner people, which is a plus. My sofa came within 3 weeks, and it came with 4 pillows. Packaging- securely packaged with shipping blankets taped many times around. The blankets were scratched up and ripped but to my surprise, the durable plastic wrap was untouched. Comfort- I can truly say it's a comfy couch. This was my main worry as I've read otherwise in reviews. With extra pillows for the back, I like the firm seating but it's a comfortable firmness that I hope will break in somewhat but stay on the firmer side. .Before my purchase, I considered a RH chesterfield sofa, but I'm happy this is equal in quality, looks and half price. Time will tell if it holds up, I get a feeling it will. Well worth the money!", 
    "I started looking for a similar sofa about three months ago. I was torn between this sofa and a much cheaper one at Overstock. I decided for the cheaper one and when it arrived I was so dissapointed. The buttoning was such a poor quality, the legs were too high and the quality of the materials was simply not there. I returned it and immediately placed the order for this Patrick sofa. I got the sofa a week ago and I am still excited about it. The product is extremely well made it is somewhat deep but since it comes with pillows I would say it makes for a perfect sofa because my taller friends can remove the pillows and be comfortable. I chose the grey color and I wish it was a bit darker but no big deal, it is beautiful. All in all I could not be happier with my experience at Overstock.", 
    "I love the way these sofas transformed my family room. The chesterfield style really is a classic look. However, these sofas are too firm and beccause of the low back are not suitable for casual lounging. Sadly I will not be keeping them. Overstock customer service has helped make arrangements for them to be picked up (I do incur a $*** delivery p/u charge). If you are ok with a firm cushioned low back sofa, the Patrick sofa is a great choice. The quality is very impressive.", 
    "Love this sofa! I got the 90\" dark gray one. Beautiful, true to website color! I ordered on Novenber 5th and it was delivered on December 15. Was a bit frustrated trying to find out where in the U.S. It was, however. After receiving a shipment confirmation with tracking number, I was unable to track it the entire time. Huge problem for me when spending almost $****. After far too many emails back and forth with Overstock, I was given the name and number of the freight company that was shipping. Wish the communication had been better with such a large ticket item. I had been eyeing this sofa for almost a year and have always been happy with Overstock in the past. They did offer a bit of a refund for the inconvenience. Overall I am very happy with my beautiful new sofa. Top quality and very firm. Not a super lounger but big enough to curl up on with all the pillows. The delivery company was excellent. They carried it into my house and placed it exactly where I wanted it, even though I did not pay for White Glove delivery. I only wish I had ordered the bigger sofa, love this one, but a bigger one would mean even more greatness!", 
    "I love the style. The fabric pills a little but not bad. Overall I have been happy with this sofa.", 
    "The delivery took a lot longer than anticipated, but I'm quite happy with the product. I purchased the 103-inch sofa in grey linen fabric. It is definitely a stylish piece of furniture, and the color is what other reviewers may have mentioned as \"oyster\" --- it's a light grey color. It comes with 6 cushions, which are all very filled to the top, so they're not very comfortable. The sofa itself is very firm, too.As with the delivery service, there could be some improvement. The tracking information did not update and I could not figure out where the sofa was for a few weeks. The delivery company was not very flexible in terms of the dates and times, and when they came out to deliver the sofa inside my house (1st floor), they made several scratches on the wood floor as they \"hammered\" off the temporary wood blocks to replace with sofa legs. Overall, I'm satisfied with the sofa, but it's not a lounger where you can relax and unwind for hours.", 
    "I ordered the 96\" tufted sofa in gray. It arrived within 3 weeks of ordering it. I'm a huge PB & RH customer but I had another positive sofa experience with Overstock a few years ago and decided to try them out again. My expectations were met, actually, the sofa exceeds my expectations in style, quality, value, and comfort. The color gray (medium in color) is absolutely beautiful and versatile with any home color scheme. I'm extremely pleased with the product and service expereince!", 
    "Beautiful couch. I researched *********** ******** first. I didn't want to plop down ****. for a couch when my daughter just got a kitten. This is an almost matching version for **** less! Communication for delivery was excellent. The 103\" is very roomy for napping. Natural color was exactly what I was looking for. You can get the ********** ******** look for way less here. Although the cash back and discounts just make you want to buy MORE!! I only wanted to re do my family room, now with Overstock prices I am inching my way thru the whole house. AND....a bonus for me is they take paypal!!!! (I am an ****seller)", 
    "I had greatly debated purchasing this sofa - buying furniture online is a risk. I thought I had mitigated that risk by asking questions specifically about the color. You can look back and see me asking if oyster was in fact light grey and was assured that it was. And I don't think its overstock.com's fault either because there was a sticker on the box that said \"light grey.\" But this sofa is NOT light grey. It is a neutral/beige color - very much a natural linen. It is beautiful no doubt, but I think it is a misnomer to call it grey. It looks closer to the sand color than it does to oyster. My other issue with the sofa is that it is shorter than 90\". I saw that someone said it was larger and I was kind of hoping that was true but its not. Mine is closer to 86\".", 
    "Omg I LOVE this couch!!! I had been looking at a couch from Restoration Hardware but didnt want to spend the thousands they wanted for it! I purchased the 103 in sofa, and this length is hard to find wo it being custom. Lovely heavy linen upholstery, so comfy to sit or lay on. Seems to be very well made! And FREE DELIVERY! Very happy!", 
    "Had good expectations but I must confess this sofa kicks butt. It is going on a mountain home we have in Aspen. We did not want to go for leather because it is always cold and did not want to spend 5k. I think we got 5k worth of sofa but paid less than 2 thousand for it. This is def. value for your money and the quality of the fabric and the sofa shows everywhere. The buttoning is extremely well made. It is something that worried me well, it looks hot and totally high quality. The comfort is excellent BUT you must use pillows in the back. By the way, it comes with four pillows, not two as shown in the pix. So either we got two free extra pillows or the description on the sofa is wrong. The only down I see is that I would have purchased a love seat or chair if they had a matching set .", 
    "Other reviewers are spot on. I am commenting on the 103 inch version. It is a huge sofa and the delivery service had one heck of a time fitting it in my new home but they did a great job and even got a tip from me! lol!! Seriously the sofa is amazing, it sits medium to soft in your bottom and firmer in your back but you can play with decorative pillows and make it superbly comfortable. If you dont use back pillows and you are 6 feet plus, the sofa will sit deep but well which is my case. My girlfriend is much shorter and needs to use the pillows and loves the comfort. So basically the pillows are great and handy. If you dont need them they are perfect for pillow wars!! LOL The fabric is a nice grey and will change colors on you depending on natural versus artificial lighting. Mine goes from true grey during the day to blueish grey at night. All in all I am delighted with the product more so when I know how much I saved over other stores out there.", 
    "Ordered this couch on 12/30/15, received on 2/11/16. The couch exceeded my expectations. I ordered to 103 inch couch in charcoal. It is not exactly 103 inches, it's just shy of 100 inches from outer armrest to outer armrest, 30 inches high. The charcoal color is much nicer than it appears on the website, it actually has a blueish undertone and is quite lovely. The linen material is very nice and appears to be sturdy. The couch itself is well built and we find it comfortable. We are definitely happy that we took the chance on this couch!", 
    "Have owned this for about a year and a half. The color is kind of a bluish light gray, which wasn't exactly what we wanted and the material is not a smooth finish material. It is a think cloth type material that has developed fuzzballs over time. we are in the process of trying to figure out how to remove the fuzzballs. Additionally, the couch was initial very firm, but the cushions have broken down quickly to where it is now pretty uncomfortable. The couch already looks very old (and we are NOT heavy users of the couch and my wife weighs 100lbs and i weigh 175). I would definitely not buy again. In fact, i'm on overstock right now considering a replacement.", 
    "We love this sofa. It's classic and beautiful yet understated. The fabric is lovely, and it's very well made - especially for this price point. That said the delivery \"service\" was an absolute nightmare. The first one they sent made it to the local warehouse when they contacted me to let me know it was damaged and if I still wanted it - ummm no. When the second one arrived they sent one guy to deliver a sofa up two flights of stairs in the pouring rain, with black gloves on. Have you ever heard of \"black-glove\" service. Yea, there is a reason for that... Black handprints all over our new cream sofa - sigh. The hand prints mostly faded once they dried, and the company will have it professionally cleaned - but that's just another headache!", 
    "I love my sofa. Color and quality very good. I looked many places and even had one delivered from a big name store , but had to return due to wrong color. This was the best deal and meet my needs.", 
    "Torn about this gorgeous couch. We had a lot of problems getting it here. First one was broken, then out of stock, etc. But Overstock Customer Service was the best as always. We got the charcoal and it is fabulous. We accidentally got the light grey first time around and very light. The charcoal grey is fairly light as well. We get compliments all the time and it is a beautiful piece. BUT we have three young boys and we have only had it two years and it is definitely showing some wear. Cushions are pelting a bit which is the biggest annoyance. The tuft back still looks great.", 
    "Love it, Beautiful and elegant", 
    "Full disclosure, I've yet to receive the actual sofa however I wanted to share my purchase experience to caution other people considering this purchase. I placed my order for the 90\" sofa on January 27th and 6 weeks later (today) the sofa has yet to even leave the warehouse: I'm unsure if its ready to be picked up, but hasn't been yet or if it's simply not done being built yet. In addition to this, I'm told that it will take an additional 1-4 weeks for delivery from whenever the sofa is actually shipped out.I'll make sure to update this review once I've actually received the sofa to give it a fair review however if I knew it would take this long in advance and could do it over again I would not purchase this sofa again.", 
    "This is a very well made, very elegant sofa. I bought it for our new living room/playroom and it looks awesome! Thanks!", 
    "this couch has great quality. Firm, nice color and stylish. nice show piece.", 
    "nice couch disappointed in color"
