    "Very disappointed in this product. It's made from very cheap MDF fiberboard. This usually isn't a problem if the pieces are 1/2-5/8\". these are so thin that the \"floating shelf\" concept will fail.", 
    "I purchased two of these shelves and they look very attractive on the walls. They are made for light weight knick-knacks and that is exactly what I was looking for. I you are looking to display something heavier this isn't the one.", 
    "Double check the size. It's small", 
    "This shelf is in my foyer. The 6 inch shelves are the perfect depth. They are useful but not in the way.", 
    "Now this piece completed my home office. It adds a little something to the wall without being to overwhelming. Put some treasures on it and a clock so when I need a break from the computer my eyes go to this for a relaxing moment. Love the clean lines and the size is great. I did not want a big picture to distract from the monitor and this hangs to the right a little and is not distracting your eyes.", 
    "Very easy to assemble. Modern looking. Sturdy and solid!", 
    "This is a very nice, very heavy shelf that looks beautiful and modern. We put it in the living room where it is actually hiding a built in CD shelf that we could not get out! Looks great!", 
    "Worked nicely. Easy to hang", 
    "It's easy to put together and is a nice piece to add to the room.", 
    "smaller than I thought it would be", 
    "The 'black grain finish' part is nonexistent. It has a black, matte Formica-type finish which is over particle board. Very heavy. Convenient size, however. Nice if this is the look you want.", 
    "They look amazing snd easy to put together", 
    "Purchased 2. Was able to assembly myself. Very easy and only used a screw driver. However, I would recommend 2 people to properly hang the shelf. Volunteered my husband for that part. Overall, I love my shelf. Glad I bought 2. Only disappointment was that I didn't see it offered in white", 
    "This was very easy to put together and looks very nice on my wall", 
    "This was just what i was looking for to hang on each side of my tv. I purchased two. My bf put both of them together in less than 20 minutes. They seem sturdy and look good on my wall. The only complaint i have is that the silver screw head is visible when you look at the shelves and the only way to hide it is by getting an object tall enough to covet the screw but short enough to fit between the shelves. Kinda difficult task. Wish the shelves came with a black cap to make screws a lot less obvious.", 
    "Very sturdy, nice finish, easy assembly. Works in any room.", 
    "I ordered this shelf to help display smaller items in my living room. I don't notice a grain finish. It doesn't look like wood. It looks more of a textured finish. This shelf is very heavy and I still haven't hung it on my wall. I need to find something to secure it better to the wall. Well made though and looks exactly like the picture.", 
    "This shelf looks excellent in my living room and just goes well with everything else that I have in there.", 
    "Shelves are Slightly off to one side when assembled.", 
    "Its sturdy and easy to put together. looks great.", 
    "adds shelf space in unusual to fit spaces!", 
    "I love the way this Wall Shelf looks. It totally comes up to what I first thought it would look and work for!", 
    "I really do love this piece, but it was super hard to hang up. You have to put the anchor screw into the wall first and then it is hard to line it up perfectly due to the darkness behind the shelf once you get close to the wall (hope that makes sense).", 
    "Very easy to put together. Happy with the way it looks!", 
    "Beautiful shelves, great price", 
    "Sleek and clean look to display awards", 
    "It's sturdy and fits perfect for the space we wanted to put it on. Wish they made it in cappuccino color though. But overall it was a good buy."
