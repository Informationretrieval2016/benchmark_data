    "This closet it not as sturdy as I would have liked. I love the size and the outer casing but I actually added additional supports to the bottom to make it more sturdy,", 
    "Pretty easy to install, but would be plenty better with wheels. Install in exactly where you want to keep it.", 
    "It was hard to put together. The material ripped at the window zipper. Once all together it is sturdy but have to be very careful with zipper.", 
    "Perfect!! Serves its purpose! Very sturdy! Love it!", 
    "the cover was torn when received- size was good", 
    "Holds allot of stuff, hasn't broken!", 
    "easy to put together took 10 minutes", 
    "This closet is great when you have a lot of coats like I do and need that extra closet space. Very sturdy and easy to put together. I bought two.", 
    "its not a 1 woman assembly closet, 2 people would ensure you dont tear the covering. The covering is very fragile, that was my biggest problem with this closet.", 
    "Easy to put together and works well for what we needed it for. Storing clothes while moving.", 
    "Perfect, just what was needed.", 
    "Easy assembly, surprisingly sturdy & spacious. Great buy!", 
    "Love this priduct. Easy to assemble, sturdy and plenty of space. Better than more expensive models,",

    "We are waiting for our new house to be finished and these racks are great while we live temporarily at a family member's home. They are a nice size and are easy to put together. You can also stack things line sweaters in the soft bottom.",

    "This is exactly what I was looking for!"
