    "These are very pretty shelves and work well as a place to put photos, display items that aren't heavy, etc. We put one in my mom's room to free up the space on her dresser that was taken up by her DVD player and satellite receiver. It worked so well that we used the other one in the living room for the same purpose and added some of our decorative items to the other shelves. However, I mistakenly thought that a \"bookcase\" meant that you could store books on the shelves. These are not designed for that purpose. We had intended them to go into our home office to store reference books and office supplies and ended up having to rethink our plan. It worked out well but now I still need a bookcase for that.", 
    "I liked these to house pictures and nic nacs. Not great for books unless you have book ends but it is a sturdy peice.", 
    "I am so delighted with these shelving units. They are excellently made, extraordinarily sturdy, pleasing appearance. I rarely leave a review. That is unless I'm very displeased, but these units are so excellent I had to share my thoughts. I highly recommend them..", 
    "It was delivered timely and the Ups person brought it right to our porch. My husband has MS and was able to assemble it all by himself. I was away and he surprised me. He said they were well made. We put some of our electronics on the bottom shelf and pictures, vases and knick knacks on the other shelves. Can be changed for the different seasons. They accented our large screen tv. Very happy with the product..", 
    "The Altra Black Ladder Frame Bookcases are quite durable. The metal frames and the shelves are acceptable quality for the price. They are reasonably easy to assemble. The bookcases added an \"openness\" to the room, versus the previous bookcases I had in the room.", 
    "I've been looking for bookcases to plank each side of my tv for a while but kept finding ones that were too expensive. These bookcases look better than the expensive ones I've loved at big name furniture stores for a quarter of the price. The assembly instructions were super easy to follow. Highly recommend this product! Fabulous quality for the price.", 
    "Received this in a timely manner. Was very heavy and had a little problem getting in the house. I unpacked it to bring it inside. It had great directions and was easily put together. Most importantly is I love it Looks great and is a great addition to the front room. Very sturdy.", 
    "OMG i'm in love couldn't ask for a better deal. My teenager put it all together all by himself while i was at, and it took me by surprised when I got home and see them. They're heavy, sturdy and beautiful hold up to 5lbs on the shelves. OMG I'm so happy I bought these and for the price it's a steal", 
    "Love, Love, Love these!!! I have been looking all over for these and the ones I found were not as tall, or only came with one! I use them t display pictures of my children and grandchildren! I have had SO many compliments on them, and inquiries about where did I get them! Easy to put together and look fabulous!!!!!", 
    "These are solid and pretty. Metal frames with particle board shelves. One of supports for a shelf came broken but I glued it back together. I only wish it came with some touch up paint for situations like that and where the label sticker pealed off some paint.", 
    "Love these shelves. They look like something you spend 300 or more for.", 
    "A perfect fit in my family room. I have it between a SONY 4K TV and 90\" cadenza. I got great reviews from friends and family members. I totally love it.", 
    "I have a set of these shelves in my living room. They are surprisingly spacious. We are able to store almost all our \"core\" book collection on them. I like that compared to a lot of the other \"leaning\" bookshelves that looks like these, the Altra bookshelves are self-standing and not leaning against the wall. They are pretty sturdy, and because they can be split up, offers a lot of options for arranging them around the room.", 
    "The item was easy to put together, done while watching a football game. Very sturdy and works great with my TV stand, which was store bought, but a great match!", 
    "These are heavy shelves and look great in our office. I have them side by side and they look like very expensive shelves you would find at Pottery Barn. They are a great buy!", 
    "Very nice looking \"bookcase\" though being used more like a stand for audio equipment flanking both sides of the fireplace.", 
    "These bookcases were easy for my husband to assemble. They are very well made and the price for both of them was much less than anywhere else I looked. Because of their size, they fit well in small areas. Would recommend to anyone with no problems.", 
    "Bought these for my daughter's room and she loves them! They were easy to assemble and are very heavy and sturdy.", 
    "My first purchase with overstock and it is enough to make me come back again and again. The shelves are lovely and everyone who saw them love them. Great buy.", 
    "I was very excited to receive and assembled the black ladder frame bookcases ordered from Overstock in January 2013. Since the brackets are metal they are very sturdy and can hold a variety of items. I have 4 of these bookcases behind my desk in my home office and they offer great storage for work storage as well as display items. The black color matches nicely with the other decor in the room. I have seen similar items on other websites for more money so I think they are a great value.", 
    "I bought two sets (for a total of four bookcases) for my bedroom. I thought the ladder style would be more stable on carpet than traditional bookcases. Assembly was time-consuming but not difficult. They are very sturdy, and I really like the sides are made of metal. This is, by far, my favorite Overstock.com purchase!", 
    "very fine quality...love them", 
    "Wonderful shelf to help clean up my husbands office. Classy looking, but not frilly. We got 4 of them. Added a board across the top of all of them for an additional shelf.", 
    "I recommend these bookcases. They are easy to put together and look great!!", 
    "Had a bit of trouble in the beginning because several of the pieces were chipped. I contacted customer service and they sent a replacement set. Looks great!", 
    "Sturdy shelves, but smaller than they appear in the picture. Overall happy with the purchase though.", 
    "Great look, sturdy, love them! Exactly how they were pictured. Easy to put together and look great. We are using one underneath our new wine rack and one in a different room, but they look great together as well!", 
    "Easy to assemble, sturdy, attractive", 
    "Very nice for the price. Easy to put together. Looks great in my living room.", 
    "Out of two bookcases, we were able to put one together. Hoping to get replacement parts. Disappointing.", 
    "Nice shelves - sturdy, pretty easy to assemble. My concern was they might look too commercial with metal frames, but they don't. They are super nice. For the price, it's a great purchase!", 
    "Love these bookcases! Easy to put together and look really nice! I didn't realize there were two in a box, so had another set to use in our den/office\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d", 
    "I was a little concerned when other reviewers indicated that two people were required to assemble these bookcases. I assembled them myself with very little effort. They are very sturdy however I wouldn't overload them.", 
    "These were easy to put together and look great!!", 
    "Love my book shelves great investment", 
    "I'm a single girl and was able to quickly put these together and they look awesome. I have them on both sides of my fireplace.", 
    "Great deal for the price. Assembly was easy, and they are quite sturdy. The packaging looked perfect, but there were a few scrapes / dings on a few of the wooden boards.", 
    "These aren't the highest quality, but they look good, hold a lot of books and are modern looking. Would be hard to take apart, so if you are moving they will stay together for good!", 
    "Can't beat this deal. Still wonder why sold in 2's. I recd 2 and am using. In two different rooms. Kay Scott", 
    "Received as promised easy to put together great deal!!", 
    "great! easy to put together", 
    "Buyer beware of the advertisement. Not any special deal as comes packaged as a set. Small", 
    "4 of the shelf particle board pieces arrived cracked.Nothing matched. Not holes for nails or shelves. I ended up with a 3 shelf unit - very top shelf did not match up with holes; bottom shelf sits with the back part lower than the front. I should just return both pieces. I tried. I will never ever order furniture online again! Always the same junk and issues.", 
    "I love these two bookcases. I set up them at both sides of my tv stand. It looks amazing. And great price. Thanks", 
    "Good purchase worth the money", 
    "We received these items very quickly! Unfortunately, there was damage to 3 of the pieces. However, the Altra website had a form that was easily filled out. It has been three weeks, we have yet to recieve the replacement parts though. Despite all that, I am very happy with the product. It is very well built and easy to put together. (I put it together despite the damaged pieces for the meanwhile )They will be perfect in my home office! I would love to find the desk that goes with these bookcases!", 
    "The first time we ordered and got the set had one small broken piece that we McGyvered and re-created the broken piece out of wood and painted it. We were credited to which I turned around and ordered a second set as we needed it but that one came in looking like it somehow fell out of the box and pieces were scratched up and several more broken pieces - nothing I could do with the scratched up, gouged pieces, without doing some major wood work which I don't have that kind of expertise...else would have built my own shelves. :-) One little piece was a chore enough...and in this case it was some of the larger pieces were the ones gouged and scratched up....and two of the smaller pieces which is needed to put together were cracked in two. Seriously looked like at some point it fell out of the box and was thrown back in as even the packing stuff was broken unlike the first set and poorly taped. Not sure where the fault lay with that as it didn't look taped up well... and it is very heavy. But Overstock is awesome to work with as they sent out a replacement set asap. With the holidays I haven't yet had time to check to see if any pieces were broken with the new set... but I'm sure between the two sets I could make it work as needed if there is more broken pieces. Now with all that said... I love the look, and it is pretty sturdy despite it arriving with broken pieces...and with the fact that Overstock is quick to help remedy the issues I would recommend...and if needed more of them would re-order...but with hesitancy and with the awareness that it may not arrive in perfect order but that Overstock is more than willing to make it right....gotta have the time to be patient as you need to put it together yourself. Now with that said if I can put it together... anybody can put it together... instructions were extremely clear to me. :-) Minused 2 stars only due this last shipment had broken, gouged and scratched up pieces had it come with everything intact it would be 5 stars.", 
    "Good shelf system for my craft room. There was one broken piece, which I glued. A few scratches, but overall good value.", 
    "These cases are of great quality after to have constructed it. It came in many pieces and I was a little intimidated but was able to put them together by myself in a hour and a half. They are strong and made of wood and metal, you will like them.", 
    "Love love love this. Great item would buy again.", 
    "Just received them today. They were fairly easy to put together with two people. Seem to be sturdy, and look nice.", 
    "These shelves are just fine but they are medium quality. Very easy for one person to assemble and they do the job", 
    "Although I had (1) broken board the shelves are very sturdy and very easy to put together, I notified the company and have confirmation of a replacement part already on it's way !!!", 
    "The bookshelves went together easily for me and they have helped me organize my office area. I am totally pleased with the price and quality of these shelves.", 
    "Easy to assemble and attractive.", 
    "went together (did have to open holes up a little with screwdriver and hammer) they look great, just what I wanted", 
    "They look really nice on the sides of my fireplace.", 
    "Few scuffs on the wood shelves. Overall, decent for the price.", 
    "Excellent buy. Purchased for my grandsons room for displaying his Legos, models & Trophies. He really likes them. \"Perfect\" he says. I agree! Nice quality, sturdy and reasonably priced. Lots of surface area for displays. Super fast on time delivery. Great sturdy product.", 
    "Product looks just like pictures and works nicely in a room", 
    "THEY ARE MADE VERY STURDY AND VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER.", 
    "Exactly what I needed and wanted, great price", 
    "It would have been a good bookcase. Didn't really expect it to be metal/wood. Looks like it was opened previously, disassembled and shipped back. We received the bookcases slightly damaged, otherwise a good bookshelf.", 
    "I purchased these for my kitchen. I don't have a lot of cabinets, so this helps out a lot, they are very attractive and not to tall, they are about 5 ft., and pretty deep, I display my plates, wine glasses, serving bowls, pretty tea pot and on the bottom baking dishes. They are great I love the color. My son put them together he said it took him about a hour he did drill a lil too aggressively on the top shelf and we have protrusions but it doesn't detract from the overall look of the shelves, I still love them. They are very sturdy, they don't rock or lean or anything. We have had them for 6 months now no problems.", 
    "The only reason why this item didn't get 5 stars is because upon arrival, there was 1 damaged part. Although, it was packaged nicely 1 single piece prevented me from assembling one of the bookcases. Assembly was fairly easy, I did it alone. The problem I experienced was with customer service, initially when I called the part that I needed would be delivered right away. After not receiving a confirmation email of delivery I called again and was told that it would be sent. A couple of days later I called and was told that the party that I needed was out if stock and they will resend another 74 pound box and I can retrieve the part I need and return the 74 pound box. Very inconvenient! Apart from the customer service run around the tbookcase is of excellent quality and fits in my family room perfectly.", 
    "Loveee these and i all by myself was able to put them together even the part that said it will require two people from this point on. Very happy and very proud of myself for keeping my cool and accomplishing this on my own :-)", 
    "Don't get me wrong, once assembled it looks great especially from a distance but up close you can tell it's super cheap. One of the pieces came broken and then we accidentally dropped it about a foot from the floor and it broke off completely. I'll Magiver it somehow but it was upsetting and it's too large and heavy to go through a return. Overall I like it and it fits my decor, just be advised you get what you pay for.", 
    "Solid, as described. Finish peeled off but good value.", 
    "We had to ask for a replacement to use parts to fix the original two. They are very cute if they were packed more carefully and not shipped damaged. It takes a lot of time and effort to fix these things, which makes me not want to order from overstock anymore.", 
    "love the look, great quality.", 
    "The pictures don't do them justice. Very sturdy and easy to assembly. Would recommend to anyone looking for durable shelves.", 
    "Easy to put together, they look perfect in my new apartment!", 
    "These are nice sized and look good once put together. I would given them five stars, but there are a few scuff marks and not great looking places on the finish in places. Nothing major, but for picky people, it would be an issue. I also had a small broken part that was damaged in shipping. I called the company directly, and they had the piece to me in about a week.", 
    "As we were putting these book cases together we noticed several dings and blemishes to the finish. Also one of the pieces was broken. Trying to get everything back in the box to return it was nearly impossible so we're just going to deal with it.", 
    "Awesome bookcase. It looks high end and is very sturdy. I have family portraits and books on it and it fits in the living room perfectly. Very happy we purchased this bookcase and I would highly recommend it.", 
    "We bought these for our living room and I'll be honest, they are more heavy duty than I anticipated. We haven't fully furnished them with books yet but I'm confident that they will stand up to the task.", 
    "Gave as a gift to my daughter for her new home and they are great!", 
    "To be honest, once you've got these shelves put together they look ok. But in my opinion, they aren't worth it. I'm no novice when it comes to putting furniture together-I've put together couches, platform beds, more chairs than I care to count, dining room tables...but these bookcases were beyond the pale. The problem was the hardware that came with the shelves. It was odd. The screws fit perfectly, but either the quality of the shelves wasn't good enough or the screws weren't good enough-they just had no grip. I eventually had to go to my junk drawer and find some slightly bigger screws that were capable of holding their place. In hindsight I wish I had gone to a thrift store or something and bought some bookshelves.", 
    "I love these. They are perfect on both sides of the fireplace. They were fairly easy for my husband to put together and they look great. I recommend them for anyone that needs a pair for their space.", 
    "These take two people to assemble .. or one person and a lot of patience. They are INCREDIBLE sturdy pieces and I'm very happy with the purchase - well done Overstock!", 
    "These gave us more space in our office", 
    "Purchased for staging a house. The shelves were the only thing the buyers asked to keep.", 
    "The shelves are sturdy, fit perfectly in the space and are just what i needed.", 
    "These bookcases look great! They were easy to assemble and look amazing in our office.", 
    "Bought these for our bathrooms. Very easy to assemble. Very sturdy! Looks great!", 
    "I've been looking for a set of shelves to complete my TV area. Found these ordered them and I'm impressed with the finished product. Sturdy, nice wood finish that gives my living area an elegant look.", 
    "I really like this set. Simple, but very well built and roomy enough to use it for my fax and printer. It's true, that I would need bookends if I wanted to use it as a book shelf....", 
    "I bought these to replace my overflowing dresser (too many ironic hipster t-shirts). An unorthodox solution for clothing, but it works great, and they look terrific in the room. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I obviously didn't expect fine furniture when I ordered these trendy bookcases. The frames are metal so that makes them pretty sturdy. They look great after putting them together and adding baskets, etc. I am pleased with them. Not too hard to put together.", 
    "Nice for decorative pieces. Don't think they would hold up with too much weight but we have them in our dining room and they're perfect.", 
    "These are very nice and simple bookcases that go well in many rooms.", 
    "Very sturdy shelves, shorter than I would have liked but easy to put together. Delivered very promptly. The shelves easily hold books and knick knacks. Easy to clean and matching in color.", 
    "Easy to assemble, look fantastic, I love these shelves. In fact I ordered another set yesterday. They arrived well packed with no sign of a problem. However, one of the shelf supports was damaged. I contacted the manufacturer and was quickly sent a replacement.", 
    "Easy to put together. Perfect for the living room. Love them!", 
    "The two ladder shelves look fantastic in my redecorated living room. They were easy to assemble. The dark color of the wood/metal gives it a more \"expensive\" look, you know... the kind of item you'd find in a higher end furniture store that is double or triple the price paid here.", 
    "fairly easy to put together, very sturdy, look great on each side of a day bed", 
    "Items are extremely heavy which makes for solid bookcases that do not wobble on carpet. Assembly took awhile with me having to file one of the metal legs since there was a lump of metal that would not allow a piece to slide in. I'm quite happy with the product. one less star since I had to file the lump of metal away from a leg", 
    "the shelves are nice, just would have been less assembly time if the instructions would have been included.or a good color picture that shows the detail in the shelf backstop.", 
    "These shelves are nice and sturdy but we had several damaged pieces preventing us from having 2 full shelves. With the item sold out, we are out of luck now...", 
    "I am using these as shelves for photos and other decorative items. They took a while to put together and arrived with minor scratches and damage. Overall I am happy with my purchase!", 
    "The box came missing vital pieces to the bookshelves, and no instructions. the manufacturer had to send out an entire package just so i could dig one part and the instructions out of it, then i had to return it. what a mess. trying to get out the one piece i needed, then getting everything back into a heavy box and shipping it back out. What a pain in the butt. Bookshelves are great, however.........", 
    "These \"bookcases\" are very sturdy and were fairly easy to put together (although I did not receive directions and had to go on line to print them; but they were easy to find on line). I did put the two middle shelves on wrong at first so be careful about that (my stupid mistake) but I did assemble by myself even though it says you need two people. Agree with the bookcase name being a little misleading; they are really shelves, but I could see that from the picture when I bought them. For the price, they are a good buy and I am using them for office supplies and materials; I just purchased baskets to store what I needed.", 
    "I recommend these bookcases r rooms where you ouldave small children, they will not be able to pull them down on themselves", 
    "The materials are fair and look reasonable after a simple assembly. The real plus is that these cases are very sturdy and unlike many small cases will hold books and other heavy objects. They are quite heavy and sit well on carpet.", 
    "Love these shelves, cant beat the price and my only complaint would be the bottom shelves had like hairline scratches and one was chipped."
