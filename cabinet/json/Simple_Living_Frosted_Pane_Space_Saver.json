    "This item arrived safely, which I was nervous about because of the glass panes. I set it up alone, and it was easy for the most part. I had some issues once I was required to assemble it around my toilet. The instructions have you attach the top cabinet part to the legs before assembling around the toilet, however, I had to take the top cabinet off in order to screw on the backing, which came later in the instructions. My tip: Before adding the bottom support bar (which you must do around the toilet), try to finish most of the assembly for the top part (don't do the doors til the end). You honestly may not even need to install the bottom support bar if you are anchoring the cabinet to your wall (which is pretty much a must). Despite the slight difficulty during assembly, I love this cabinet!", 
    "Had we had a chance to look at this bathroom space-saver we probably would not have chosen to purchase it. The overall quality was limited, but several of the wooden shelves were damaged and had to be touched up. The biggest concerns were in the bent fasteners that made the cabinet unstable. The whole product was not even worth the Overstock reduced price. Shipping and service from Overstock were very good.", 
    "I have purchased over the tank space savers before and I have never had a problem with them fitting - until now. My husband assembled this product only to discover that, because of the width of the legs, it doesn't fit around our toilet tank! Annoying, as you can imagine. Now we have to take the product apart, repack, ship, and hope we get our money back. Also, the product was wobbly after assembly. For the quality, this item is overpriced.", 
    "With a sink on one side, and wall with baseboard heat on the other, we were depending on the site's description of the dimensions to be accurate. It fits just right. Straight forward assembly. Highly recommend screwing top edge to the wall for stability once in place.", 
    "This is a really pretty and useful addition to our little bathroom. My only complaint is that it was missing the first 5 pages of instructions.", 
    "This legs on this are not long enough to clear the tank top of a high rise toilet. Overstock.com pleasantly facilitated the return with no additional cost to me,", 
    "Cabinet looks great and was relatively easy to put together. My only suggestion is to work on the weight/balance issues as it must be anchored to a wall for stability.", 
    "I was delighted to find the style I wanted with frosted glass doors. The only problem I encountered was the need for patience and tolerance for reworking until the door matched perfectly.", 
    "Just put this together tonight,I live alone and knew it was going to be a challange, A couple of the items were miss numbered but I figured it out, Was disappointed to fing out that it would'nt clear the lid of the tank, so had to put in my master bath,can plainly see I'm going to have to anchor it some where, kinda top heavy.", 
    "The frosted cabinet is the perfect color , size , and style I was looking for. The delivery time was reasonable. The packaging of the product was great. The only flaw was on one of the glass doors. The wood that frames the glass wasn't totally fused or painted for the door to look perfect. That being said, I live in a very old home and everything is a little off,so the cabinet was a perfect addition", 
    "I bought this piece to go in a very small spare bathroom. It fits the space very well and gave me the storage I need that wasn't in that bath at all. Perfect size for small spaces and easy to put together. A tad difficult to put behind the toilet by yourself but finally got it done. Was worth the headache!!", 
    "I bought this because I hate my bathroom and did not think painting it would make a difference. I had one of those wire wall racks that you get and openly store items on there an it was really bringing the bathroom down to a level that I wanted to pull everything out which wasn't going to happen. I saw this and it got here FAST wow! Delivered and put together and installed in less than 1.5 hours and let me say that it has made such a difference in my bathroom - I'm not embarrassed when someone asks to use it now... Love it. if you are looking for a nice clean and upscale look this is the fix for you too!", 
    "The actual idea is great and I like the style of the cabinet. But if you need to service the tank you have to dismantle the cabinet because the top is bolted to the wall. A slight inconvenience on a nice looking product.", 
    "Missing parts couldn't put it together", 
    "This was fairly easy to assemble. My bathroom is tidier now with most of my toiletries hidden from view by the frosted glass cabinets.", 
    "i don't have any complaints, held up pretty well for the many years it's been in my bathroom!", 
    "Assembly not possible - parts were missing or not provided", 
    "Fits well and ample room to agglodaye toilet water supply.", 
    "got this because bought old home with very small bath, needed storage", 
    "I ordered this item in the process of moving. When I finally was able to assemble it, I found that it would not fit over the toilet and it was past the time to return it. The quality is less than I expected even if I could use it. The lock nuts are a joke and the back is made of cardboard.", 
    "Very wobbly. And the legs didn't fit over the tank.", 
    "Very nice it works just wright for my space not to big and lots of storage thank you very much", 
    "Exactly what we were looking for. Easy to put together, 45 min.", 
    "Very nice piece. It looks great in my bathroom and provides needed storage. A little tricky to put together but not seriously difficult.", 
    "Really nice piece Easy to assemble", 
    "easy to assemble fits nicely in my small bathroom needed the extra storage space", 
    "Functional and great looking. What could be better?", 
    "Easy assembly. Fits perfectly in the space.", 
    "I had to get some help with this one... And i've put together a bed frame by myself with no issues... The pilot holes for the doors were super off, so getting them to hang evenly and shut was basically impossible. Someone worked on it for me, but honestly they are still really hard to shut. You have to do them at the same time to get it to close all the way. Otherwise it looks really good, and if you don't use it much it works", 
    "You get what you pay for! Not sturdy and wiggly. The return fee is expensive\ud83d\ude21", 
    "Though the space saver went together quite easy it didn't clear the tank very well. It just barely makes it not allowing the bottom rail fit entirely together. Therefore not as steady as desired. I would of thought those are universal to the average BR tank.", 
    "Although I had asked the question about the color prior to purchase and was told it was white this cabinet is not a true white but more of an antique white. Luckily it worked with my bathroom. Also for stability purpose this cabinet truly needs to be attached to the wall. Other than those 2 facts being left out of the description I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "This will work for us - but it is not deep enough to hold towels like we had originally planned to use it for.", 
    "As some other reviewers have mentioned, the dimensions listed for this product doesn't mean that it will fit over the toilet you've measured. The legs are fairly thick, and reduces the available space for this product to fit. Only after having placed an order, receiving and building the product did we find out that the space saver did not fit over our toilet (even though the measurements according to the description should allow this product to fit the space we ordered it for). To add insult to injury, because we had opened the product, we were charged full shipping costs to send back and additional fees since the product was opened. Be warned when you are measuring your toilet and space. Additionally, the product seems to require to be 'half built', then placed over the toilet, and then completed (no mention of this in the instructions, but again other reviewers had mentioned this). once complete, the product does seem to wobble in the legs and doesn't seem too secure for the money.", 
    "This is my second one to order.", 
    "Make sure you measure de width of your toilet tank before you buy this. This ended up not fitting mine and I had to install with without the cross bar at the bottom of the shelf unit which makes it a bit unstable. I was not going to return it so I kept it. It hides all my bathroom stuff nicely and looks great. I highly recommend it you it's the right fit for your toilet.", 
    "Although this space saver fits perfectly into the space and looks good, it is not made from the best materials. I hope that with extra care it will last me a long time. Also recommend that it be bolted to the wall to avoid possibility of tipping forward.", 
    "This product was easy to assemble and works very well.", 
    "This suited my needs and budget perfectly. If you can't get the doors the close properly together you have the hinges on backwards. The directions are vague at best, particularly when you get to the door installation. This is far from a high end piece of furniture but it odes adequately serve its intended purpose.", 
    "I have a very small bathroom. I made the mistake of not noting the inside dimensions of the portion that goes over the toilet tank. It didn't fit. The instructions were very confusing on top of everything else, It was very difficult also to use most of the screws that came along with it with any of the screw drivers I had .. they were very small. Screws were provided to attach the back to the unit but there were no pre-drilled holes for them to go in which made it very difficult to attach especially since the screws were so tiny. I only attached the back with half the provided screws. After getting the unit together and then finding out that it didn't fit, I opted to use it in my bedroom for added storage. This unit is extremely top heavy so it must be anchored to a wall. I opted to use the drill through the 2 holes they provided in the unit to afix the anchors to the wall. because unless you are precise with tools and measurements .. the paper strip they provide you to measure the distance between the holes, only works if you have the exact height of where the pre drilled holes on the unit are. It was much easier to stick the appropriate drill bit through the holes in the unit and drill into the wall then attach it .. that part is a 2 person job .I wouldn't buy this again and I wouldn't recommend it.", 
    "easy to assemble. Too bad it wouldn't fit behind the toilet in the bathroom I wanted to use it in. The design makes it difficult to install if your toilet is really close to the wall.", 
    "Cheap made and impossible to put together then they charged me a $$ to ship it back", 
    "The item is average at best. Pressed wood and cardboard. It is attractive but I could have bought something of the same quality locally.", 
    "It's a very nice cabinet just I didn't realice the measure from the floor to the first shelve was way too short so it came on top of the water tank.Lucky me I had some wood to use it on the floor and fixed it.", 
    "This is not as sturdy as I had hoped however being it's not in a bathroom frequently used it works", 
    "All assembly required and the brackets and screws provided did not do the best job keeping the sides and shelves together. Needs better hardware to make this an excellent rating.", 
    "Loved this space saver, it was just the right touch for the bathroom and easy to assemble", 
    "This is the worst piece of 'furniture' I have ever had to put together. Cheap, Cheap,Cheap. Paper backing, nothing lines up to put the locking cams in and the wood is,I don't know what, other than cheap cheap cheap. Save some more money and get something that is worth your time,putting it together, and something that is not so shoddy and made with materials that belong in the trash bin. I am so disappointed I could spit nails. We ended up having to glue and brad nail this together. The cams are so cheap, 50% of them broke because the workmanship is so poor that none of the pins lined up with the cam holes. The directions would have been good if just half of the parts had been labeled. Everything about this is awful and this isn't my first rodeo putting ready made furniture together. What a piece of trash.", 
    "This is an OK Apt piece, but whose finish will wear out quickly. MDF is very heavy, the product is in the category of \"surface furniture,\" looks nice in pictures.", 
    "Since I rent my apartment, I was not looking for a very expensive / permanent solution and this was perfect. I would not say it's the most well made piece; the doors don't perfectly align. But it gets the job done and does provide a lot of storage. I like that the shelves are adjustable. The directions are a bit tough to follow, but I might be spoiled by IKEA's idiot-proof directions.", 
    "poorly made and wobbly. We bought this because we have an baby and needed to get the stuff off the floor in the bathroom. But she could pull this apart in about 5 seconds. Just creates another safety hazard for the baby. Cheap cheap cheap!", 
    "it's a cute lil' cabinet but really flimsy...parts were missing like only ONE magnet so the doors swing openit was missing a back panel to enclose all of it, so now it's just open to the back wallmissing pegs to hold up the ONE shelf and they seem a certain size that I can't find to replaceeasy to put together however...HOW do I get in touch with dealer to ask for the rest of my parts?", 
    "Went together pretty easy. Looks great in my bathroom, just what I needed.", 
    "It looks good after I put together, but I had to contact Overstock because it came without the assembly instruction and guess what... the top of the open shelf came with some numbers written on it by hand in blue ink, just like on a piece of paper. It looks like someone just used that piece of the shelf to write some code or something... It's frustrating, 'cause it's right the one shelf that are exposed. GrrrrI tried to get rid of it, but it didn't come off all the way... it's faded, but it's still there. So I put a piece of decoration on top and it helped! It's a good price, but you really don't get a very quality product.", 
    "It says its freestanding, its very flimsy when assembled, needs to be secured to the wall. If you pull the handle of the door there is a great chance that the cabinet will just come down on to you. Came bashed in few places, the back did not fit, also back consists of two pieces that hold together buy something similar to medical plaster!!! You can't see it on the pic, but the line btw two pieces is very defined at the front. its not sturdy construction. I falls apart while we were assembling it. The door with glass made so poorly that the frame needs to be glued additionally as in one place its nearly came off and when we tried to secure the glass, the little screw split the mdf apart. I am actually not sure how I will fix this... In overall -very very badly made. The appearance on the picture is lovely and the idea of having space used over the loo, but it could have been manufactured much better. I had it shipped to London so will not have a chance to return it, as also threw away the packaging, but certainly will ask customer services for some sort of discount.", 
    "Just make sure your measurements are correct. Product is measured from the extreme outside of the unit. Make sure your toilet bowl water reservoir will fit in between the legs of the unit. Each legs measures about 1 3/4\". My unit did not fit accordingly so Instead of returning product (because this is the best one in which I liked on the market), I improvised my making custom cutouts to accommodate the entire toilet bowl. Very sturdy unit!! Simple to assemble if you follow the instruction given. No more then one hour to assemble. Make sure you count and separate the hardware (for no missing parts) before attempting to assemble. My unit had exactly the correct number of parts. Definitely use the anchors supplied to fasten onto wall!! Enjoy!", 
    "This product is poorly produced. Enough parts(screws) are missing that the frosted doors can't be installed. The assembly instructions were written so poorly and parts so poorly labeled that I had to refer to the pictures and guess at parts. The instructions have you installing screws on the cabinet after its been installed and is supposed to against a wall, as seen in the picture. I could've gotten this at **** and if not for less, at least I would feel I would have some recourse.", 
    "Because I live in a mobile home, the ceilings are lower than average. After I had this all put together I couldn't put it over the toilet because of this so I dismantled it into two parts and added the top part to the bottom part after getting the latter in place first. Worked fine put had to devise a new plan to attach to wall, which you must do. Oh, it was a little bit of a challenge but I'm learning!", 
    "I'm happy with several purchases from Overstock.com. The space saver does the job. The color is a good, soft subtle cream and the doors look great. The instructions DO NOT take into account the fact that you are likely putting this together with your toilet already in place, so be award that you need to think ahead. Also, there is no extra hardware AND several of the pieces broke on me when I tried to secure them too tightly. Also, one of the cross boards started to crack when I tightened one of the screws. One of the doors arrived in the box with a 2\" strip of paint chipped off the door. If I had purchased this from a store locally, I would have returned it. I did not want to deal with the hassle of re-packaging and returning to Overstock, as I really need this piece in my bathroom. It is also the perfect size and fits great around my toilet. Once complete, it looks pretty great. Though another complaint is that the manufacturer does not provide enough covers for the large screws. I'll just have to get creative on that one.", 
    "I needed a white space saver for the bathroom that was conducive to the modern, minimalist spa theme I was working with. This space saver was perfect for my needs. Do read the assembly instructions carefully and take your time in assembling the unit for it is a little tricky. Especially when assembling the cross brace behind the toilet. Once I got it set up and aligned I used a long drill bit to mark the wall through the anchor holes at the back of the unit. I used 3 inch long wood screws that I got at the hardware store for this purpose. The unit is now as secure as possible.", 
    "For the price, this is a nice cabinet for a small batroom with limited storage. It took about an hour and a half to assemble. The construction is very similar to cabinets sold by Ikea. The quality is a little lower than Ikea products however.", 
    "Arrived quickly and was well packed - Thanks Overstock. However, it was not easy to assemble, especially since there were no instructions included. Once assembled, it did not fit over the toilet. The legs are very short and now we have to improvise to lengthen the legs. It is nice looking and the frosted glass keeps the shelved toiletry items private. Would only recommend if your toilet top is very low to the ground.", 
    "I purchased this as a gift for my niece and she loves it. It is very accommodating and fits the space perfectly over the toilet. It is quite sturdy for the price and well worth the buy. I do not think you would go wrong if you decide to buy it.", 
    "This product is what I needed in a bathroom with little storage in the medicine chest.", 
    "i love this piece in my bathroom, it looks nice. it was a bit shakey standing on its own, definitely secure it to the wall. also, i would suggest waiting to attach that small white bar across the bottom of the piece until you have it where you want it first. My husband built it and then had to take off that white bar because we didnt put it behind the toilet first.", 
    "This is a nice addition to small bathrooms, it's thinner than I thought it would , but still very nice.", 
    "Very useful storage for my tiny bathroom. Not hard to assemble though the instructions are a little unclear in places. Be aware that you need to assemble this item AROUND the toilet - the instructions make it seem as though you assemble and then place item behind toilet. And you will need a very short screwdriver (It will help if you're double-jointed too)", 
    "Overall what you would expect, very narrow space appropriate for a medicine cabinet more than storing towels, etc. Arrived in a sealed box with scratches on the outside of the doors. Finish also gets weird metallic marks on it if you accidentally run your screwdriver over it (not a scratch, a mark). Backing is one step up from cardboard, not sure how it will hold up in a humid bathroom. This is the only white frosted glass space saver in this price range I could find. Looks nice, quality is decent for the price although if you're expecting a piece of fine furniture this is not it.", 
    "This product was everything it appeared to be in the onlne presentation. Assembly of the product was very easy to do for one person. It complimented our bathroom decor and brought great appeal to it.", 
    "DO NOT BUY THIS! Horrible quality. It took about 2 hours to install. Extremely wobbly and measurements are incorrect. It will NOT fit above any normal sized toilet. The toilet has to be extremely small in order to fit. Top drawers are extremely slim. There is no way any towels fit here. I am so disappointed with the quality, size and overall experience. Way too expensive for this item.", 
    "This is perfect for a small bathroom that needs some extra storage, and has a simple, clean, nice design. The color and finishes work very well for a bathroom. I dont think this product would last a long time, but it's a great piece. The instructions are easy to follow. Only takes about half an hour to put together.", 
    "It took two shipments to get an unopened box. Knowing the pieces associated with this type of product I did not want to take a chance for missing, scratched or damaged parts. Overstock folks were great! They called warehouse and got an unopened box and told me to keep last one before I put new one together. The unopened box had all in tack but a slight scratch on glass pane. I switched it with the box that had to be returned as they told me to do that. For the money, a great product!"
