    "This wall mirror and shelf is just perfect for my small bathroom. It fits in with my other white decor and I love the fact that I have somewhere to lay my glasses etc. Great buy!", 
    "I'm torn here because I really love the look of this. The only problem is that the mirror is poor quality. I didn't notice this right away since it's in my spare bathroom so it's mounted, the box has long been recycled and I can't return it. I'm not sure I would return it either but that's only because it's in my spare bathroom and it looks nice. If it was in my main bathroom it would drive me nuts looking at myself and seeing slight warping. Other than that, the quality is good - it's well built.", 
    "I was disappointed in how small this was and how deep the shelf was for its size. It was the size stated. Appeared well made, but I returned it as it was far too small (and too much shelf) for our bathroom sink/vanity.", 
    "Well made and nice looking mirror. Gives the bathroom a cottage feel.", 
    "This mirror was the perfect thing to place above my makeup table. It's sturdy and looks great.", 
    "As stated above. I'm also done with Overstock. Their online chat help disconnects when the questions get tough. I reconnected 3 times and asked about returning the item. When the subject of a return came up they somehow \"lost connection\" each time.", 
    "perfect size well packed for shipping. Used my color palet to change from what to fit my bathroom colors.", 
    "Arrived fine and return was easy. Just didn't work in my space.", 
    "the amount it juts out was a little bit of trouble for where I was going to have it but it is fine.", 
    "Great small bathroom accessory. Looks good, finished look", 
    "I purchased this mirror for my powder room. The design of this mirror went perfectly with the crown molding in the bathroom and although I didn't require anything too big surprisingly is solid, heavy, sturdy & well made. The shelf is an added bonus.", 
    "It's a basic product but had no defects and suited our needs perfectly.", 
    "I looked everywhere for the best price on this product and overstock had it with reasonable shipping. This mirror was high quality and looked great. I was very pleased.", 
    "perfect for my new bathroom. looks great, just like the pic", 
    "This mirror is very small and would only work on a small side wall or small half/bath.", 
    "Really nice and easy to install. I would purchase another one.", 
    "Mirror image is distorted when standing more than a foot away.", 
    "This mirror has a baked-on white finish that arrived without a scratch on it. The mirror itself is small, but I have hung it so that people who are 5 feet tall, and people who are 6'3 can both see their faces in it while at the vanity. It fits perfectly in my very small bathroom, with my 21 inch vanity. The small shelf will support a toothbrush cup or a comb. I am very pleased with this purchase, as finding a mirror with the right mass for the small bathroom was a challenge.", 
    "I really like this mirror. I ordered two of them for placement over double sinks in the master bath. They are a nice alternative to the typical huge sheet mirror.", 
    "Love the style but the quality is poor. The reflection is a little warped/blurry. One day I will replace this mirror; we put it in our spare bathroom.", 
    "this mirror is warped, as other reviewers have said. it's for my kids' bathroom and it just makes you look wierd. I noticed it after we put it up and it was such a pain to get up I'm disinclined to take it down. get a better mirror.", 
    "I needed a small mirror with a shelf due to having a pedestal sink in a small third bath. I checked all the local stores and found them to be so expensive for what they were. This fit the bill perfectly, and at a price that can't be beat. It can be painted to match any color decor, and is the perfect size for a small tight space. The price is great, came in one piece and packed well. just pull out of box and hang", 
    "This was exactly what I needed for a tiny bathroom. The shelf added just a bit more space to make it useful!", 
    "Very clean and easy to install. I would diffently recommend this product to others.", 
    "Very tiny. The demensions they gave included every bit of the trim, leaving a small mirror that is an accessory mirror, not a bathroom one.", 
    "The wall mirror is very cute, good quality, and put together already with a good study shelf at the bottom. Exactly what I needed.", 
    "Nice mirror for a small powder room. Shelf is a good size. Looks fine above our small pedestal sink.", 
    "Great mirror and shelf combo. The shelf is very sturdy and wide enough to accomodate a number of items. We were going to hang a mirror with shelf under it, but this worked out even better. We're using it in a small bathroom and the style would fit with a wide range of decor styles and it would be nice in other rooms as well- bathroom, bedroom, entranceway. Great little buy!", 
    "Had looked at mirrors in PB that were ***, and found this...excellent quality, right size for my kids bathroom, and looks lovely!", 
    "This mirror is well made and was surprised by the quality of it! We have it in our small bathroom and looks so charming and old country looking which fits are decor perfectly! I LOVE it and is so reasonably priced!! It is a nice bright white and has a bit of a glossy sheen but not to glossy-perfect!", 
    "The mirror frame and shelf are exactly what I was looking for, but the mirror glass itself gives a sort of fun-house reflection. I think the glass is warped. I am still using it though, as it is just in our guest bathroom and no one is using the mirror for makeup or anything, I try not to look at it for too long since it can make you dizzy.", 
    "Decided to up-date our power room. Needed a mirror that would go with what we were doing to improve the space. This mirror was perfect. Our contractor was really impressed with the overall quality and was even more impressed when I told him how much it cost. I would highly recommend this mirror to anyone. You won't be sorry you bought it.", 
    "I wnated a white mirror with shelf to complement our 1/2 bathroom down stairs. We did the bathroom all over and originally installed a oval nickel medicine cabinet. However; even though it looked good, there was a certain look missing. We have white bead board half way up the walls which complement the pedestal sink and wood flooring. I've been looking at wall mirrors for about 6 months at all the local specialty houses, but ones with shelves were a 'special order' at twice the price of Overstock. The mirror was well protected with styrofoam and easy hanging instructions with a template to easily locate the mounting holes on the wall. Now my bathroom is complete and looks the way we envisioned it. Anotehr fine product from O.co.", 
    "No problems hanging it up! Looks good in our new bathroom.", 
    "This looks great in my small bathroom. Very good quality! It may be smaller than what competitors sell but it is the size I needed.", 
    "Great size mirror. I love the shelf. The color goes well with my trim. Love it, Love it Love it", 
    "This mirror is perfect for the space in my bathroom. The quality is amazing for the price!", 
    "While this mirror does not offer much function, only one shelf, it is exactly as you see it, well built, solid, nice finish. For the money, it is a very nice product.", 
    "The Kingston Wall Mirror with Shelf is beautifully well made - the shelf is attractive and functional, and the style matches with the window in the room. This is a quality piece for a great price!", 
    "I purchased this mirror to go over a small pedestal sink in a small bathroom. It is perfect, and the shelf is very handy. I am very pleased with the quality of the product.", 
    "very well made looks nice in our basement bathroom", 
    "This is a great looking mirror, and it arrived safely in great packaging. It hangs flat on the wall and looks great with the white trim of my room. The finish is also well done -- not too shiny. My favorite thing about the mirror is the ledge; it extends just far enough so that I can put candles and perfumes on it.", 
    "Works perfectly in our small bathroom with very little storage. We had a pedestal sink in there so it gives somewhere to put the hand soap. :)", 
    "This is a very, very nice little mirror. Yes, it is small but dimensions are provided and if you're worried it is too tiny, make a quick template to see how it would work in your space. I have a small powder room and it is plenty large for my purposes. It is well made, hasd no defects and came packaged VERY well. It has a glossy finish and I feared it might look a bit tacky but it does not. The ledge is is 5 inches wide so can hold candles, soap dishes, etc. or smaller knick-knacks. It is a brighter white but blends fine with white porcelain (as in sink & toilet).", 
    "I expected the frame/shelf on the mirror to be cheaper looking in person, more plastic like, but it was NOT at all! The shelf sits out farther than I thought, which was a pleasant surprise! I was a little disappointed though that the mirror seemed wider on the site then in person, but it gives space to put sconces on either side. We have the mirror in our bathroom and it works great, and gives the room a fresh feel. I was also worried with reading past reviews reading that the frame was chipped, but it came in perfect condition!", 
    "This mirror was a great price, exactly as described on website, arrived in perfect condition and just what I wanted. Saved me buying a separate shelf too.", 
    "I love looking at my 2 new mirrors in my guest bathroom. They were very easy to install and they've added a great deal to the appearance of the room -- a real improvement over my old plate glass mirror!", 
    "We put this mirror in our small half bath. It's height and width fit perfectly in the small space we have.", 
    "I needed a couple of mirrors to hang over the sinks in the guest bathroom. These were perfect - almost the exact width of the sinks plus the shelf was a real addition. The hanging templates also came in very handy.", 
    "Even though I measured the space where I wished to put this mirror, I thought with the dimensions listed online that it would be the right size for the space. It turned out to be too small for over my single sink small vanity - seemed more like a locker mirror - so we will try to use it somewhere else. It is nice and is just as described by the o.co site. I am a kinesthetic buyer and will probably need to purchase a mirror for this space from a store where I can see actual size rather than try to visualize the item in its space based on listed measurements.", 
    "The frame around the mirror and shelf are a very shiny white finish. The shelf is wider than I thought it would be. It fits perfectly in the space I purchased it for. It it super!", 
    "don't let the price fool you...this is a great looking mirror. perfect for a powder room. we love ours. very easy to install.", 
    "So happy with this purchase,very nice quality and is perfect for my small entryway bathroom-it's perfect!No assembly was required,I would totally recommend this to someone needing a mirror of this size and color.The price was amazing considering the fine quality that it is!", 
    "I would recommend this product. The quality is great for the price I paid. Looks great!", 
    "I PURCHASED THIS MIRROR FOR MY GUEST BATHROOM. I LIKE THE ATTACHED SHELF. THIS MIRROR IS PERFECT FOR SMALLER SPACES. I LOVED THE INCLUDED TEMPLATE FOR HANGING THE MIRROR. THAT MADE IT SO EASY TO PUT UP!", 
    "Mirror arrives in 1 piece. there was a little crack in between the shelf and the mirror, nothing that can't be touched up with calk. it was pretty much lighter than i thought it would be. Shelf is handy.", 
    "Looks great, and easy to install. They even give you a templet to help you out hanging the mirror.", 
    "easy to hang. sturdy after hung. having a shelf under the mirror is awesome.", 
    "I priced mirrors in a local furniture store and for a mirror this size it would have been over $100! I am using it in my entry of the house to hang over a small cabinet / wine rack combo. I'm sure it will look great when I hang it. I intend to \"rough\" it up a bit with sand paper to match the furniture item underneath.", 
    "I love this mirror. I have a small bathroom and this fits the scale perfect. Gives the room the crisp look I was looking for. Just what I was looking for.", 
    "In redoing my bath, I needed and new mirror. My order arrived quickly and in great condition. Although we found it a little difficult to hang, once we were able to secure it to the wall it looks great.", 
    "I hung 2 of these Kingston mirrors along with a Overstock medicine cabinet above double sinks. Against a taupe wall they are beautiful. The shelves are perfect for bottles, little jars, and my 4 month old kitty to sit on (not my idea). Mirrors are good - no distortion at all which one can find with inexpensive mirrors. Everyone who has seen them is impressed with the quality, beauty and price. Same exact item was $70 on Amazon.com.", 
    "This item was exactly the right proportions for our tiny powder room (30\" W)! It looks great against the pastel wallpaper and updated brushed nickel fixtures. Clean-looking. Easy to install. A great value.", 
    "We bought this mirror to use in our small basement bathroom. I read al the previous reviews saying it was a bit small, but since we have a small bathroom, I thought it would be ok. It is a great mirror, but definitely too small to use a bathroom mirror...no matter what size bathroom. It's more of a decorative hallway mirror. I'm still glad we got it, though.", 
    "Not amazing quality, but not shoddy. I thought the paper hanging guide was genius. I wish the mirror came in a bigger size, but I knew what I was getting into.", 
    "Although overall dimension were given,the mirror area is smaller than expected. I was in the market for black framed mirrors, so I purchased these in hopes of painting them myself. The next problem I had was that the mirror and backing board are glued to the frame. A little patience and painters tape, saved the day. All in all they look good.", 
    "The mirror was packaged very well which I was concerned about so it arrived in good condition. It was easy to hang. It is perfect in our small powder room. The shelf is nice to have to lay a brush or something on it. It looks expensive. We really like this mirror.", 
    "Great mirror for a small bathroom and great value for the money.", 
    "I bought this for our small guest room for over a dresser that doesn't have a mirror. It's really cute, love the little shelf for guests to use for their personal products. It might be smaller than I expected, but it is just what we needed.", 
    "Perfect size for our tiny bathrooms! We bought 2 of them. Shipped fast and safely packaged!", 
    "This Mirror was exactly what I was looking for. I put it up in my guest bathroom.", 
    "This is a great item for the price which lower than anywhere else I checked. Quality Product. Highly recommend this item.", 
    "I like this mirror but it was too small for the space I wanted to put it it.", 
    "I thought this would be difficult to hang but it was not because they provide you with a paper template. You simply use a level to position the top of the template where you want the top of this, then tape it to the wall and drill in the holes right through the template. And, unbelievably, it lines up and you just hang it! The shelf is shallow but deep enough for a pair of eyeglasses and a glass of water or comb and perfume or car keys and dark glasses. It has VERY clean lines and is well-proportioned. I am very pleased with the way this looks in the bedroom and would DEFINITELY buy it again.", 
    "This wall mirror is excellent. Feels very substantial, the shelf is a good size but the only problem I had with it was that it was shorter than i imagined. Even though the dimensions were correct as listed, It was shorter than I had calculated so it had to be hung a little higher which meant the shelf was higher above the sink than I thought it would be. At any rate, I have a small space and it fit perfectly and looks great.", 
    "This mirror is cute and pretty sturdy; however, I was hoping it would look fine in our main floor powder room and it really does not. It isn't wood painted white; it's a different composite-like material. No assembly required; however, getting the tape residue off the mirror took some time. This mirrow looks cute in our kids' jack n jill style bath areas, but a little too juvenile for the powder room.", 
    "Overall I am very pleased with the Kingston Mirror, but I thought it would be a bit bigger. I really like the shelf, it is deep and sturdy enough to display something on it.", 
    "This item came well packed and in good condition. I was impressed with the weight of the mirror and the ease of instructions for hanging it. It's sturdy, well built, and easy to clean due to the material. It's a very bright white - just what I wanted and I couldn't be more pleased for the price. I wish this supplier would make one a little bit bigger, but I couldn't find anything comparable for the price and I have been searching for a year before I decided to purchase this. Thank you so much! It made a huge difference updating my powder room!", 
    "We bought this for our half bathroom. I love the shelf, which is wide enough to put a knick knack or a bottle of hairspray on. The shelf is the nicest feature. It arrived at our home with no problems and it is put together beautifully. My husband put it together-it took him a little while, but he said it was made well.", 
    "Just repainted the powder room. This mirror worked great, and the installation stencil made it easy to install.", 
    "I love the look of this shelf and it's going in our powder room but I really wish it was just a few inches bigger - for the price. I did review the measurements, but it's hard to tell until you actually have it. Otherwise quality is wonderful, shipping was fairly quick.", 
    "This mirror is the best value for the money. The directions made it very very easy to install, plus you didn't need alot of tools...a hammer and a screwdriver. It was exactly what my bathroom need. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.", 
    "WE HAVE AN OLD HOUSE WITH A NEW ADDITION. ALL THE WOOD WORK IS WHITE. I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A MIRROR/SHELF TO PUT NEAR THE BACK DOOR. THIS MIRROR LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE FOR OUR \"MUD\" ROOM. COMES ASSEMBLED (ALWAYS A PLUS!) WITH PAPER TEMPLET TO MAKE HANGING IT VERY EASY.", 
    "The quality of the glass used in the mirror isn't great, giving it a subtle \"fun house\" mirror effect, and there is a bubble in the glass, but I didn't notice either issue until it was hanging on the wall. For these reasons, I can't give the mirror a good rating. The one thing I was concerned about before ordering -- the quality of material used for the border and shelf -- is the one thing I have no issue with. If I saw this in a store, I wouldn't have purchased it.", 
    "great mirror for the price I bought it to go in my bathroom but it was too small but it looks great in my entry hall!", 
    "The mirror looks better than it did online. I'm very happy with it's quality.Compared to similar mirrors this was a great deal!", 
    "This product looks good in my bathroom, which is very small. It matches nicely with the vanity and storage cabinet I purchased elsewhere. It arrived quickly, and intact. I'm pleased with the purchase overall, and enjoy seeing it when I enter my bathroom. However, it looks like it is constructed from plastic to me. The good news is it will resist moisture, which is what is needed in a bathroom.", 
    "It arrived in good shape and not difficult to install.", 
    "This product is packaged very well. However, it is encased in styrofoam. My husband threw the box away before I took it out of the styrofoam and when I did there was a crack in the mirror! I didn't try to contact overstock and since the mirror has a shelf, I was able to hide the crack (it is in the corner of the mirror). The frame and the shelf are built very well, and i am sure that had I contacted overstock they would have made it right. But I won't buy something so fragile online again.", 
    "Perfect size for my powder room which I completeley redid. It is a smaller mirror but that is what I wanted.", 
    "I wish that I would have marked out above my sink the size that I would need. 18x24 sounded like a good sized mirror, but this thing is laughably small. I have it hung above my pedestal sink and it just looks stupid. I will definitely be returning this item.", 
    "I am remodeling a small guest bath and wanted a traditional -- but updated look. The mirror is perfect and arrived on time in perfect condition. I order a lot of items from Over Stock.com and have never been disappointed. I recommend this site to anyone who is willing to take the time to do thier research and know what they want."
