    "I purchased this for a lavender room that had a silver/grey and lavender color theme going for it. However, the actual grey is too light and did not act as enough of a contrast as I had hoped. The more dramatic blue sofa might have been a better choice. So I covered the mattress in the dark blue and put large darker pillows against the seat back to make up for the lightness of the grey. Overall very comfy and stylish and has the sofa look I wanted but deep enough to sleep on. Very easy to put together but easier with 2 people.", 
    "Love the material and very easy to assemble....nice!!", 
    "This sofa bed is going to be the focal point for the spare bedroom that I'm redoing. I love it. The navy blue, rich velvety material is both chic and inviting. It was not difficult to put together & came with easy to understand illustrations.", 
    "This daybed is gorgeous. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because of the assembly.", 
    "I've had my day bed now for about 2-3 months & I love it. It wasn't hard to assemble but would be helpful to have 2 people when it comes to attaching the arms. I managed it by myself but it was a bit of a pain. Otherwise it went together easy. Seems to be very sturdy. I bought navy sheets & they match the fabric color perfectly. I decorated with a bunch of colorful throw pillows. I love it!", 
    "Quality, beautiful bed! Went together easily and love the detail!", 
    "Would have given it 5 stars but it was missing screws I had to go buy at a hardware store and match them up. Also attracts lint easily. However, looks beautiful and sleeps well."
