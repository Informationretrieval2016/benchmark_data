    "I was looking for a quick delivery and inexpensive sofa bed for my office. Did lots of research on few major websites and most of the sofa bed out there seems to be expensive and with soso quality. This item happened to be a favorable one so I tried my luck. It was very well packaged. One thing need to know, carefully when unwrapping and do not use sharp instrument as stated on the box, as you may accidentally cut the fabric inside. The chrome legs are a nice design and contemporary look is wonderful. Both sitting and laying down is comfortable, but this sofa bed is centainly not designed for tall person to sleep on, their legs will stick out. Happy with the product for the look and price.", 
    "I must have looked at least 300 hundred futon sofa/sleepers online and I'm so glad I made a great final decision! This arrived in 4 business days, well-packaged, and the UPS guy even carried the shipment to my 2nd level apartment! Assembling was easy: just put the 6 metal legs on and voil\u00e0! (tool provided) Looking very nice in my living room and the color (I would say a little towards light taupe mixed with ash gray) is neutral enough to match with any decor. I immediately fell asleep on it without putting changing the futon position to a sleeper. It's a very comfortable bed as well. Nice fabric. The only minor complaint I have is that the metal legs are pretty dirty. Make sure you clean your hands after assembling and before touching the cushion!", 
    "Beautiful modern style with great functionality! After looking everywhere online for a stylish convertible love seat/sofa to compliment our large sectional couch we settled on this one, and I'm so happy we did. Sleek and stylish, it doesn't take up a ton of room and looks great when not in use. Converting it to a sofa bed takes seconds! It is quite firm so I would recommend getting a feather bed or something similar for guests sleeping on it longer than a night or two. Also, this wouldn't be comfortable enough for a daily use sofa because it is so firm, but as this was just for extra seating in our large living room, it's perfect! Assembly took less than 5 minutes, all around a great and easy purchase!", 
    "This futon is perfect for our office, which functions as a guest room for us. It was easy to assemble and the fabric and styling look fantastic - it looks much more expensive than the purchase price. Our only complaint is the firmness of the cushions - it can be uncomfortable to sit on for long periods of time and would be very hard to sleep on without some kind of foam topper. All in all, we are very pleased with the purchase!", 
    "Very happy with purchase, quick delivery, easy to assemble. Fabric is of nice quality, looks much more expensive than the cost.", 
    "It was everything I was looking for for my new apartment. I have guests in from out of town and I have not much space to spare, so opting for an air mattress would've been a hassle. It takes two seconds to turn this into a futon and I've even slept on it and it was good. I see there are lots of colors/fabrics to choose from for this sofa bed model, but I choose this because I thought the color is great and fabric looks comfy, and it works out as expected.It's beautiful, compact, yet very functional and I'd highly recommend it to most people.", 
    "After reading the reviews I decided to get this futon/couch. As I had a guest arriving a few weeks later who was the first person to use it. It's hard to tell from the photos, but there is a fairly big indentation area when it's flat (where it folds). Enough that it's noticeable when sleeping. I personally haven't slept on it yet, but had another recent guest who said it wasn't the most comfortable piece he's ever slept on. I host many guests and was really hoping this couch would be a great solution for them to sleep on. Seems like it'll only be a so-so sleep experience for them.", 
    "Had this sofa bed for few months now and I am happy to share this review. It's as good as I expected and the price is just a bargain. The sofa is really sturdy due to the fact it has two center support legs where many others does not have. The material quality is good and proved durable. Sitting cushion is firm but still comfy. I really like it and high recommend to every one.", 
    "This is for our game room for mostly teenagers and works perfect. It is better looking in person. The gray is a little darker in person. We love the way it looks. It is fairly comfortable. It will totally fine for teens or kids to sleep on. I'm not sure that it would be all that comfortable for adults to sleep on though. I recommend this for college students or teens.", 
    "Very poor quality: uncomfortable to sit or lay. Asymmetric stitching on the seats, both position and tension. Asymmetric construction (if you look at it from the front, the left seat has a wooden bar in the middle, but the right seat does not). Impossible to seat in the middle (no cushioning at all). Even with a 2\" memory foam padding, it was impossible to sleep on, our guest moved to the floor instead. Also, note that all the positive reviews were written either on Jan 22-23 or on April 2-3.... isn't it strange?", 
    "Decent quality, easily folds", 
    "my daughter has a loft bed I placed this futon below it , her friends love to hang out and have sleepovers", 
    "looks nice and works well. did not realize the black underside of couch shows making it look cheaper.", 
    "The positive is that futon looks great and I was pretty easy to assemble. The negative is that it is not very comfortable.", 
    "works well for a sitting area in our basement, however would probably not be comfortable for an adult to sleep on due to the small size. It is also pretty firm. The material looks nice given how affordable it was.", 
    "I was a little disappointed that this Sleeper Sofa bed was so low to the floor and that the metal frame made it less than comfortable for sleeping. I have since purchased a 3 inch mattress topper (twin size) and it has proved to become an excellent bed as well as small couch.", 
    "Quality is great but it is a little short and not real comfortable for sleeping. Great for sitting or just lounging.", 
    "A broken spring snappedthe futon base. Had insurance but there was no way to fix the base. They refunded my insurance but had to get rid of the couch after a few months of use.", 
    "I was looking for something to put in my living room until i had time to upgrade. It Was simple to put together and I had it up within a hour. The color was perfect for what I was looking for. I am thinking about purchasing another to complete an L shape to my living room.", 
    "I haven't slept on this, but it is for a guest bedroom and looks great and is comfortable to sit in.", 
    "It looks good, and fine to sit on, but it is not comfortable to sleep on. Put guests on it who you don't want to return.", 
    "This fit perfectly in my small apartment and perfect for occasional overnight visitors! Has a much more classic-adult look than other futons.", 
    "Inexpensive, and the quality is very nice. I like how the individual halves fold down separately. Not much assembly and arrived in one box - pretty cool. Not devastatingly comfortable to sleep on, but I rarely fold it down. Perfect for my small, city apartment.", 
    "This is perfect for our office. We haven't had anyone sleep on it yet, but many have sat on it and all have complimented it. Looks and feels lovely. Classy, clean lines, and modern.", 
    "Looks great for price. Fabric is great quality.", 
    "Bought this couch to go in my guestroom. My house is modern style and this definitely fits with the home. It's very comfortable and easy to assemble. All I had to do was screw on the legs. Definitely would recommend.", 
    "I returned this couch because it was too hard and low.", 
    "The fabric looks nice and the futon is really comfortable. Fits twin sheets.", 
    "The couch fits perfectly in our space. I was worried about the quality given the price, but it is totally fine. We chose the couch for the aesthetic, not comfort. But it is rather comfortable too.", 
    "Good quality sofa, beautiful ash color fabric, comfortable. I wish it was a little longer for guests taller than 5.3'.", 
    "Great futon especially for the price! It's not like the old futons from college. Really nice looking and I love the fabric!", 
    "I really like the look and convenience of this product. Unfortunately, it is extremely uncomfortable to sleep and sit on after awhile. I have been using this as my primary choice for seating and it got to a point where it felt like I was sitting in a car, and sleeping on it was very uncomfortable and bad for the back. It also broke recently so there is a part of the futon that sinks down; disappointed but I guess **** for a futon is what you get.", 
    "It would've helped if it came with assembly instructions \u0097 but overall it wasn't too difficult to figure out. Two of the legs were crooked (the ones in the middle that aren't supposed to be) and I had to compensate for that by putting the washers under the metal instead of on top of it on one side. Love the way it looks but it's not very comfortable. Hopefully the cushions will soften with time and use.", 
    "Just a caveat. For us, the legs have been very difficult and the screws do not fit easily into the holes. One of the legs is crooked due to assembly mistake. We also didn't receive enough washers for the screws. It's taking a long time to put the legs in, but it can be done if you have the patience. It is a fair price for what it is, and it's pretty. But putting the legs on is not easy, nor is the underside of the piece put together well. But again, for the price, it's nice.", 
    "I am SO disappointed in this product. I searched for a queen sized futon and this one came up. It got mostly rave reviews, which is why I bought it. As for sitting on it, it is fine. Sleeping is another thing, and if your main reason to own this is to sleep, I advise against buying it. It arrived and it is definitely not a queen. It is actually not even as long as a twin (I am 5'6\" and my toes hang off of it). It is also extremely firm (too firm), and it is really uncomfortable to sleep in, given the seam running down the middle.", 
    "This is a nice piece of furniture. It was simply to assemble. My one note is that the storage space under the sofa (where the legs were placed) falls open when you sit on the couch. Definitely a design flaw. Not a sturdy item.", 
    "Color was to dark for us. We expected it to be a lighter gray but it was very gray We has to return it because the color did't work for us", 
    "Great option for a space needing a small couch/futon. The quality is what I expected for a piece of furnature that was under $$$. The fabric is great; much better than microfiber you typically find. It is comfortable to sit on and was incredibly easy to assembly. The futon folds down like a lawn chair- tilt it forwards all the way and then back. I would say that when it is laid out flat, it is just slightly smaller than a full sized bed.", 
    "First of all, UPS delivered it at 9:00 p.m. after I'd taken off work and waited all day for the couch to arrive. The futon came packaged in a box. It was relatively easy to assemble. The color is this weird greyish brown with purplish undertones, not the pale grey in the photo. I flopped down on it after I assembled it, and it is so hard. Unbelievably uncomfortable. It looks like something from IKEA that belongs in a dorm. The fabric is ill-fitting on the cushions and it is actually scratchy and shiny and has loose threads. It also has seams running right down the middle of all the cushions. I guess I'm going to have to box it up again and ship it back, which I'm really not looking forward to. I liked the clean lines but it looks cheap and dorm-y.", 
    "According to the description we were expecting a modern sofa with clean lines, like the site described...Also the other reviewer was super happy. I am sorry, but when you look at this sofa it just screams cheap. Maybe if it were $100-$200 it might be worth the money, but not $300-$400. If you are planning on using it for sleeping, don't bother...unless you are really short and you like a very hard bed. Even for sitting it wasn't comfortable. Coming into the room, it looked like you were looking at a miniature sofa. It was short (we did have the measurements), which is fine for sitting, but it was also very low. You can also see the black fabric in the front of the sofa...that is used for the underneath...not sure why they wanted it to show...that fabric is meant to just cover the undersides of upholstered furniture. Hope this helps..."
