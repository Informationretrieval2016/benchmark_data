    "Cute cabinet but if hanging ON wall leave the doors off as it is awkward trying to hang- definately two person job. Other than that the cabinet went together pretty well- some of the end pieces of wicker sort of stick out but not noticable once the cabinet is on wall and as others have noted- you can see in to the shelves through the little holes in the wicker. If it is an issue you could cover the inside with dark cloth or paper but it really is not an issue for me. Over all a great price for a cute cabinet!", 
    "I searched local stores and online for a bathroom wall cabinet and this was by far one of the nicest looking cabinets per the photos. This cabinet looks even nicer in person ! Many of the reviews stated that this cabinet was difficult to assemble, and although I am not particularly handy, I ordered it anyway because I loved the look of it. I am glad I bought it because I found the step by step pictures to be easy to follow and I did not have any problems assembling the cabinet. I did follow the advice of some of the other reviewers and used wood glue to secure the dowel connectors. I wanted the cabinet to be very sturdy since I will be using it to store very heavy shampoo bottles and other heavy items. Like some of the other reviewers, I did not want to be able to see the contents of the cabinet through the closed cabinet doors, so I simply cut two pieces of colored cardboard and popped them into place on the inside frame of the doors. It is a beautiful cabinet, with a very warm, rich color to the wood. I am very pleased with it. It definitely looks like a much., much higher priced unit.", 
    "Putting together this little cabinet was the most difficult project of its kind I have ever undertaken. Eventually I had to have my wife hold the whole thing together in an embrace so that I could screw in the two little clips that hold the whole thing together!! The materials are cheap, and poorly finished; I nearly scrapped the cabinet before I ever got it together. However, once assembled and hung on the wall in a guest bathroom, it looks quite nice and will do for a while.", 
    "Tried to put this together 5 times until I gave up and decided to send back to Overstock. Also, the cane front was discolored and not straight.", 
    "Did not expect a whole lot for the money but the quality control (or lack of) is horrible. Terrible uneven color finish.. Some surface areas looked spotted. Door notches were not cut straight. Doors would not line up. Honestly, it looked like something you would take out of your bathroom to replace with something nicer. Shipping back to Overstock who is handling the return terrifically.", 
    "The cabinet has a nice transitional look in the bathroom.Doors are very light weight.Cabinet is ok but doesn't provide much space.", 
    "Very nice cabinet. Some assembly required, but easy and straight forward if you take your time and follow the directions (took me about 30 minutes). As some of the other reviewers suggested, I used wood glue on the dowels and it seems very sturdy. Also recommend hanging the doors AFTER the cabinet is mounted on the wall. Very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "Needed a bathroom wall cabinet that was a particular size. This fits the bill. Nicely designed. Good color. Came totally unassembled-- so at first look we thought it was an Ikea type nightmare. But it was easy enough to assemble.", 
    "I am not impressed with this product at all. I thought it would look like a cheaper version of Tommy Bahama and I was dead wrong! It is inexpensive and looks it too. The color does not match espresso or white... it is dingy really. We bough the matching tower and that was a nightmare to put together...wood was torn and he had to rig the thing and it still doesn't look right... Bottom line.... there are better products out there... keep looking!", 
    "Putting this together was more like a jigsaw puzzle than a cabinet. Mainly because it is a virtual piece of crap. For the back there are three different places which need to be held together at once in order to complete the job. This is not the typical quality we think of when we think Overstock", 
    "should be a consumer protection law against imaccing cardboard for wood", 
    "Great cabinet for the money! I did have it reinforced on the wall with additional screws in the bottom corners. I wasn't comfortable that it was only hanging by 2 screws.... I wanted it super sturdy.", 
    "The color is beautiful, and the size is perfect for over the toilet. The only problem is that the screen front, on the one I received, is crooked. So the holes are slanted. Seems like cheap construction. I paid nearly $$$, but this should have been in an \"irregular\" bin at for about $$$. I still like it (mostly because I couldn't find anything better), but when I focus on the doors the way the screen is not put on properly is kind of annoying.", 
    "Cabinet is very attractive and seems to be good quality. My son put it together with no difficulty. Another review advised hanging cabinet on the wall prior to installing the doors, which we did and found the cabinet to be very easy to hang, and doors were easy to install once the cabinet had been hung on the wall. It looks great.", 
    "this would be a wonderful item if already together but the dowels did not fit I had to use glue and wait a day to put together, you couldn't keep it together", 
    "Looks good in the picture, looks OK in person... Poor design makes it really inconvenient to assemble, instructions are virtually useless regardless of your level of experience; Mounting holes are off here and there, leaving assembled product with a 1/4 inch gap between side wall and lower shelf. An attempt to tighten locking screw (with minimal force) resulted in a splitting of glued pieces (since the mounting whole was located right at the joint) making critical connection useless. Had to disassemble and to send it back... Waste of time and money. Yes, it's cheap, but you can get similar items cheaper from **** with the same lousy material quality but at least precisely manufactured so you won't get any problems with assembly.", 
    "This item was heavy and hard to put together (you will need 2 people to help hold together). There are only two areas to secure to the wall. We created an extra supports just to make sure it does not fall off the wall. If you have the patience then by all means purchase this item. The quality looks good but I wish I held out on a different cabinet.", 
    "It took done time to put together but, once assembled, perfect additional bathroom storage.", 
    "Nice detail, sadly it looks a bit cheap. Appropriate for the price.", 
    "Looks great.. Only complaints are that it is made of cheap material and is a bit difficult to assemble. White styrofoam packing material is a menace to say the least also. Nice size just not the most high quality material.", 
    "An attractive place for your extras. Really helped make a small bathroom more functional.", 
    "Took awhile to get cabinet together but it was worth it. Great price , looks more like the pricet cabinet in the big box stores.", 
    "Very well made and easy to hang.", 
    "Never thought it would be so difficult to put this cabinet together, but it still isn't together. The instructions are pictures, yes, I know any lst grader could probably assembly it with the pics, but this adult and her husband has had nothing but difficulties. Now over all, I think once it IS finished, it will be a nice piece for our bathroom. Just cross your fingers we get it there. :-)", 
    "I read the reviews...one poster said to glue it, I did, solid as a rock. Just what I needed to finish my flip in my spare bath. I would recommend, but glue it", 
    "Its very nice and pretty strong. Assembly not a breeze but not too hard either", 
    "Poorly made had to re glue bass after it was hung because it starting to drop down on one side serves it purpose as bathroom medicine cabinet but would be not purchase another also this was a replacement first one I ordered was delivered broken", 
    "This was easy to put together and I don't even mind that there are small holes in the wicker area. It looks beautiful over the toilet in my main bathroom.", 
    "Very easy to put together and nice looking. I'm very pleased!!", 
    "Made with real wood. Nice finish. Parts fit well. Went together without difficulty.", 
    "Machined parts were missing or not lined properly. Had to glue and add wood to make it fit together. Doors were crooked and would not line up. I got my $$ worth I guess but I'm not impressed.", 
    "The shelf is nice for a put together unit. The color is pretty much as shown. The only issue was when we put it together the doors did not match up evenly. The is an uneven space between them.", 
    "This is a solid piece of furniture, and looks nice overall, but it wasn't very easy to assemble and the wood look rattan panels came pre-installed crooked. (There is no way to fix it without dismantling and potentially destroying the frame.) The only reason why I kept this item is because I had guests visiting and I needed to immediately replace my old wall cabinet. What a disappointment. Where is quality control?", 
    "Thank you for making my bathroom beautiful", 
    "Assembling it took time but the product looks exactly as shown in the picture. Satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "great product, really enjoyed.", 
    "easy to put together and strong design", 
    "The reed lattice work in the center of the doors was crooked. It was very difficult for me to put together without help of 1 more person.", 
    "I should have listened to the reviews. Poor construction, stain on outside inconsistent, scratches on doors. Don't bother wasting your time on this!", 
    "The picture looks great, after that, all is downhill. Directions are not real clear...all pictures. Directions for use of screws was incorrect resulting in lack of screws. One set of screws was so small, you would have to use a screwdriver for eyeglasses. Finish is poor. Doors were so mismatched in stain color that I had to overstain one door to make it acceptable. Unfortunately, I ordered 2 of these. Way too many wood dowels used in assembly so that you have to have 2 people holding it together before you use the locking cams to hold it together. Run, don't walk away from this unless you are good with woodworking and have a variety of screws and drivers you can substitute.", 
    "This was for our basement bathroom. Wood was a little messed up.", 
    "I live in a 5th and there wasn't ANY cabinets in the bathroom and this is a brand new unit!! So this works so well above the toilet!!", 
    "I ordered this bathroom cabinet because it looks nice and has the wicker panels on the doors. Of course, it came unassembled. As I progressed to the assebly procedure, i realized that the parts fit loosely and will fall out if I didnt handle the pieces delicately. Once you get to the the final assembly stages, it ties in the other parts and the rest is gravy. Things that can help this problems is wood gluing the dowels as you assemble them or a tighter fit to hold the pieces in place.", 
    "I got this to sit on top of me desk against the wall. It was easy to assemble and looks great.", 
    "I am very happy with this cabinet. It has a beautiful, rich look; was easily assembled and is quite sturdy.", 
    "doors seem a little cheezy, but otherwise it serves our purpose.", 
    "I am very happy to have purchased this piece. It took me a little to build since I wanted to make sure all was well done. I also took the advise of a couple of people and used some glue when placing the little studs in their holes. Doors were put on after it was hung. I did all (a woman) and my son placed it on the wall which I help holding it. I recommend it. It is beautiful and the price is right.", 
    "Easy to assemble and beautiful.", 
    "I purchased 2 of these for extra s storage in 2 small bathrooms. They were easy to put together, probably one person could do it but having a 2nd set of hand as is best. So many cabinet/shelving have a flimsy panel( not much stronger than cardboard) in the back, not so in this case. This is described as being expression colored, which I think is more a dark brown to black. It is pretty close to the color in the picture.", 
    "One of the finest looking cabinets that I looked at before buying it, Very nice looking on the wall. A little challenging to put together , but no problem correcting you mistake.", 
    "Nice, warm brown color wood. Good product.", 
    "Maybe I got a lemon - I don't know, but this was a lot more trouble to put together and stay together than it should have been. The problem was with the bolts [listed as #1 - 8 pieces in the instructions] designed to hold the structure in place. The bolts would never stay in place even after turning them the recommended 45 degrees to tighten. I ended up using 8 finishing nails to keep the structure together and would have had no confidence in hanging this item without those nails. I recommend that glue also be used for the little wood connectors [#4 in the instructions]. The cabinet literally fell apart 20 times as I was trying to assemble it. After I found a way to make it whole with the finishing nails, the cabinet looks great in the bathroom and is serving its purpose as discreet storage.", 
    "Absolutely a piece of junk. It arrives in about 200 pieces and is impossible to assemble!!! The materials are like cardboard. I sent it back, don't make the same mistake as me, stay clear!!!!", 
    "Really fits the bill in our bathroom. Solved our extra storage problem. Assembly took two very patient people with goods since of humor! Final result.was worth it.", 
    "The only problem was with the directions....just separate your pieces and build it from the bottom up and you'll have no problem. Very satisified with the customer svc I received. Plan to make many more purchases during the year. The cabinet got the clutter off my vanities which is what I was trying to do.....this is my year for de-cluttering and organizing. Excellent price ...good looking cabinet....would have cost alot more at a store.", 
    "Although the wood was above average, not pre-fab material, the hardware include for assembly was not what I expected. The dowels were almost too small to hold the part together and would fall out while I was putting the unit together. Some of the holes that were suppose to be pre-drill were not drilled all the way through and I had to use a screw driver to complete the holes so I could finish putting the unit together. I used wood glue to strengthen the construction because I didn't trust the hardware to hold the unit together. The instruction were not very clear. I think this is going to look beautiful in my bathroom, love the color.", 
    "nice modern design in dark wood cubbies at bottom for hand towels qtips etc. door hide extra tissue lotions etc", 
    "Upon opening up the package, I observed a couple deep scratches on the face of one of the doors. We will need to touch them up. For the $, this is not a bad purchase but I wish it had been checked out before it was sent to us. It took my husband and I to put it together as it required two hands to hold certain parts in place to assemble.", 
    "This cabinet looked good online but when I received it I was a little disappointed by the quality. Kind of flimsy but it is on the wall over the toilet in the water closet and serves its purpose. Not something I would want to put in a bath that a lot of people use. The price was right, however. Overstock is still AWESOME and I know that had I decided to send it back there would not have been any hassles.", 
    "This item was difficult to put together. The cabinet fell apart before we mount it on the wall. This end up being a waste of money since a new cabinet had to be purchased.", 
    "I bought this for the look & added storage. I love it! It was easy to assemble and hang. They included a paper template to mark & level without having to use the cabinet itself. It made it so easy. The look is great & finishes off the bathroom with a sophisticated look.", 
    "Once we got it together, the cabinet looks great. However, we did have to purchase additional hardware to keep it together because the cam locks would not lock.", 
    "dowel pins are way to loose. Assembly would have been much easier if the pins fit more snug.", 
    "scrap no way to assemble this is not suitable for fire wood", 
    "Once I got it put together, I love it. Only problem is there are a ton of parts and it's not the easiest thing to put together. If you have patience, this is a perfect fit because it's the nicest one I found for the money.", 
    "This.cabinet is perfect for our new bathroom. It's beautiful as well as functional. I love the little cubbies for decorative items.", 
    "As with any piece that requires assembly, you must take your time and assemble carefully. Probably took about 20 minutes to assemble. For a novice at assembly, it may take an hour. But quality is acceptable and sturdy.", 
    "the assembly here is insane you have to hold this together with another person the way they instruct you or it keeps falling apart If you are good at assembling this stuff I recommend it, since it looks great , but it is poorly made and a pain.", 
    "Put the back on backwards - it still worked but had to adjust the screws so read the directions - just because something fots doesdn't mean it is in the right place! Looked great once it was up", 
    "I was very disappointed. Directions were very confusing. Pictures no words. Impossible to put together yourself. Could not be done in manner described on directions. Doors were labeled wrong or the magnets were put on the bottom of the doors instead of the tops where the magnet is to keep them closed. The design work on the doors was crooked. Once installed, cabinet is not level. This is the first time I have ever had a problem with overstock.con's products. Did not return as it was already installed in the master bath. Do not purchase this item.", 
    "Good buy for the money-looks good and was easy t0 put together. Very functional-glad I bought it!!", 
    "Fortunately, I read the reviews to note that the assembly instructions were difficult to interpret, (true) but, I was missing parts (I called for the missing corner part as we had the missing screws, didn't receive the correct corner part - just more screws!). Didn't expect the quality to be as bad as it was, cane on the doors is uneven, and the doors don't line up (not our fault as the holes for the doors are pre-drilled) which means that one door has to be removed and a toothpick put in the screw holes to raise the door to match the other door! Glad I read not to put the doors on the cabinet before mounting... While the cabinet was on sale, it should have been reduced further.", 
    "We needed an extra cabinet in our bathroom and this one was perfect. It was not too complicated to assembly and looked great once we hung it on the wall. It has an adjustable shelf inside the doors for even more storage space. We love it.", 
    "this is made of poor quality and directions to put together are sometimes sketchy at best. some parts are very poorly made.", 
    "I love this cabinet, it is exactly what I needed in both my bathrooms. A wonderful, sturdy cabinet. A great added touch. A great buy!", 
    "Nice,came quick.Followed other reviewers advice and used wood glue and bigger anchors for hanging.Looks good and with the extra precautions I feel totally confident filling it up.", 
    "My husband and I assembled this cabinet together with very little trouble (or arguing!). It looks very nice on the wall in the bathroom I bought it for. I'm glad I found it on Overstock!", 
    "I had no problem in assembling cabinet as I have put together items like this before. Wall screws supplied are not long enough for sure.", 
    "The hanging part is not that great...The photo has a lighter chocolate color than in real...This item would be great in white and/or honey color because of the rattan.", 
    "nice looking but wished I didn't have to put it together. took me a couple hrs.", 
    "i used 7 in bathrooms, and 1 in my bedroom. they are dark wood and wicker, attractive and functional. screw provided are too short; buy longer ones. that's why some people are compalining about falling and breaking.", 
    "This is a charming chest, with caning on doors. It was easy to assemble and looks great on my antique desk.", 
    "Other than terrible assembly instructions this is a pretty good cabinet. It fit perfectly in the space I needed it to.", 
    "Love the cabinet but for someone that has no one to put it together, we had to hire a carpenter to put it together and that costs as much as the cabinet did from Overstock. I do love the cabinet and its exactly what I thought it would be with the exception of the assembly.", 
    "This is a great bathroom cabinet. The color would go with almost anything and the quality is very good. Another great purchase from Overstock.", 
    "Was looking for something to put over the commode but did not want something with poles holding it up. I have always preferred the warm texture of wood to the sterile feel/look of metal. This product suited me, my bathroom and my needs.", 
    "I value other buyers' input. But sometimes one can get turned off by 1 or 2 bad reviews of a product out of many, and miss out on a great deal. If you've been eye-balling this cabinet, looking around and then coming back to this one over and over... buy it. Based on a few reviews, I felt a little like I was taking a chance w/this cabinet. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that those must have been anomalous experiences, because I have no complaints. A little on the small side? Sure, but that suited our small-bathroom purposes. Open-work weaving on the doors means some exposure of the contents inside? Yes, but less so than clear glass cabinets would show, and the product description doesn't hide this fact, so if that's not your thing, or not the look you're going for, then don't buy this cabinet. We were working w/a somewhat traditional-looking, reddish-brown stain sink vanity, and the woven-cane on the cabinet doors and overall warm color coordinates as well as we could hope for without being a matching set. It was relatively easy to for my man to put together (note: wood glue is a must, so have it handy) and except for the backing, all parts seem to be real wood, not some kind of thin-wood-laminate material. Once it was together, everything looked straight and true, no gaps or ill-fitting parts, and the right hardware and amount of hardware was included for assembly. I bought a bathroom wall cabinet from RH for about 4x the price of this one, ON SALE, also manufactured in some foreign country w/equally questionable quality control in it's factory, I'm sure . After 2 years, the bottom of that cabinet--attached only by dowels & wood glue to the sides and back--is falling off. I'll get back to you in 2 yrs and let you know how the Jasper is holding up, but so far, for the price and craftmanship, this was definitely the wiser purchase.", 
    "This product is not assembled at all; however, don't try to put it together without following the directions specifically. If you do that, you will have not problems. We did add additional screws to the wall to ensure stability. I love how it looks in our bathroom.", 
    "Nice cabinet, looks great on the wall. My husband and I are very handy people, but it was a little frustrating putting this cabinet together. With lots of liquid nails and patience, we finally got it together. Due to an issue with one of the screw pieces, the cabinet is a little uneven in one corner. I do not think it was worth what we paid though.", 
    "I'm in the process of assembling this shelf. It keeps falling apart since the dowels aren't big enough. I am using glue now but it's been frustrating and taken forever to put together. Otherwise, it seems like it will be a nice shelf as long as it stays together.", 
    "Matches our bathroom perfectly. Holds toilet paper, bath salts, body scrubs and looks nice. Definitely recommend.", 
    "This thing took about an hour to put together using 2 people. I read somone used wood glue, maybe that would've helped? I hung up this huge, heavy shelf in my bathroom, and one week later heard an awful crash! I walked in to find this thing in about 20 more pieces than it came with, in addition to all the products I'd put inside it! It looked like my bathroom was ransacked! I used the wall studs, not sure why it fell apart. It appeared that the insides of this thing ripped apart before it fell off the wall. It was expensive, hard to assemble, heavy, and also cheaply made! Do not buy this product, a ready made shelf would be a better bet!", 
    "Great cabinet for my powder room. I'm happy with the purchase.", 
    "I needed additional storage in a small bathroom. This was perfect for the price and it looks great with my bathroom vanity. It is deep enough to hold the necessaries of the room! Reviews indicated they used wood Glue to put together. I can understand why, but we did not at it when together well and is sturdy. I am happy with this purchase.", 
    "I was very surprised that the quality was so good. It is very sturdy and easy to assemble. I recommend it.", 
    "Purchased this for a new bathroom. Product needed assembly, but the parts were clearly marked and went together smoothly. The corners, doors all fit together nice and the item was easy to hang.", 
    "Every thing was great, product and delivery. I will recommens to my friend and I will buy possibly someting else", 
    "Easy to put together. Surprisingly solid when assembled. Its heavy too and it will take two people to hang it... Unless you are really strong.", 
    "This is a great small cabinet for a bathroom or small wall. I would recommend it. Very simple assembly. The only thing I didn't like was the wide weave in the door panel. I got a nice cardstock and placed it behind the panel so the cabinet contents can't be seen from the room.", 
    "This cabinet is very nice. I ordered 2 of these and am very pleased. I did need a little help with the first cabinet, but the second one was a breeze to put together. Everything fit together perfectly and I didn't have any problems with anything being off kilter. I love the color and this is a very expensive looking cabinet.", 
    "I really love this little cabinet. We bought it for an over the toilet cabinet in our newly remodeled bathroom and it looks great! Just the right depth and height. I love the look of the cane door (though the cane was installed a little crooked by the manufacturer) The one thing I didn't notice in the description, so was surprised when I saw the size of the box, was that you have to assemble it yourself. My son did it for me so not sure how easy it was but I think it was relatively simple. I recommend this great little cabinet especially for bathroom applications!", 
    "The cabinet itself is great. The assembly instructions could have been much better written and helpful. The measurements say the depth is 8 inches, but that is the top and bottom, including the flange. The shelf itself is only 7 1/2\" deep.", 
    "Assembly was a little tricky in one respect - the top is non-uniform, and the directions do not emphasize that the decorative slanted edge must face the front (perhaps a more observant guy would notice this, but not me - I had to take it apart and redo. But this was not difficult). We are happy with the cabinet, and it does what we want: look good above the toilet and hold wash cloths and medicines.", 
    "I love this piece. Pretty easy to put together no problems whatsoever and only took about 40 minutes. Looks great and serves the purpose.", 
    "I bought the matching tower to this piece and love the look of both together...it finishes the look to my bathroom. I wanted my storage pieces to look like furniture pieces and they did just that. My father-in-law did grumble about putting both together (he always grumbles though).", 
    "This cabinet was the finishing touch to our new bathroom. It was easy to put together - just follow the instructions. Took two of us less than an hour. Nice details. We love the look.", 
    "Saw an identical one on **** website for ***, this is a way better deal. Fits small baskets perfectly and I was able to install my hair dryer holder on the side. Fit mounted to the wall over the toilet perfectly. You can see through the mesh but not enough. Like it a lot.", 
    "Nice cabinet for the price. Assembly for me was easy and i am a woman.", 
    "The piece went together quickly, is sturdy, and looks very nice. Good price, good purchase. Bought the matching linen tower and I'm happy with both pieces.", 
    "The cabinet was a good value. It was a little tricky putting together by myself. It had a few places where the finish was rubbed off but easy to fix, Very classy looking. I'd recommend it to friends.", 
    "THIS WALL CABINET TURNED OUT TO BE EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED TO COMPLETE MY MAKEOVER FOR A SMALL BATHROOM. THE CRAFTSMANSHIP IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE. THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WAS TRYING TO TIGHTEN THE CAM LOCKS, MAYBE I DID NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AS PRINTED, BUT I DID MANAGE TO DO THIS IN ABOUT 2HRS BY MYSELF,", 
    "It's difficult to put together but once it is in place, looks very pretty.", 
    "This is actually a really nice, sturdy cabinet for the bathroom. It's a little tricky putting together, and it's easier if 2 people do it. The wall-mount screws are unfortunately way up high inside the cabinet, so it's rather difficult to get your tool in there to attach it to the wall. Otherwise, it's really pretty, heavy, and well made. We love it!", 
    "Took a little time to put together, but the directions were easy enough to follow and it was well worth it. I have a small bathroom and wanted a nice solution for storage.. this cabinet was PERFECT. I had looked all over the internet, at Target, Bed bath and beyond etc.. and found no other cabinet similar or as reasonably priced. Finish is true to photo.", 
    "This is a very nice cabinet and especially for the price. it does take some time to put together, but isn't too difficult. The hardest part was putting in the hindges because the directions were a little backwards. It is nice to have an extra hand to help, but one person can do the job. Color is beautiful and true to picture.", 
    "The reviews about the cumbersome assembly of this cabinet, as well as my uncertainty over whether the color would be the same as in the picture, did make me hesitate. But I went ahead anyway and am so glad I did! It did take me a long time to assemble, but the parts were well-labelled, the instructions fairly straightforward, and the parts all fit. (I've assembled things in the past where none of the above was true.) You just need to proceed calmly. And the color is EXACTLY as I expected, matching my new vanity perfectly. I posted a photo of the finished project on my Facebook page, and my friends thought it was beautiful. The materials overall appear to be high-quality and it looks quite classy, though, as my new bathroom isn't quite finished, it hasn't gone up on the wall yet. My only complaint is that the woven part looks a bit crooked. Still, I can't believe I got a cabinet like this for such a low price!", 
    "I love these 2 wall cabinets! I purchased one before and after my husband put it together and hung it up...that was it! We had to have two more. I was surprised that first one came as a kit. So when I ordered these, my husband had them together and up in a jiffy. They are outstanding. They are pleasant to the eye and spacious!", 
    "This cabinet is gorgeous and looks MUCH more expensive than it was. Some reviewers complained about assembly but I'm a twentysomething woman and I had it from box to wall in under an hour, no sweat. It's super solid and looks beautiful when put together. Extremely high quality! Would most definitely buy again. I almost purchased similar looking cabinets from BB&B and Target and am so glad I didn't, those pieces, while costing about the same, looked like you got them from Target (you know what I mean). This one looks like an upscale boutique purchase, very happy!!!", 
    "The unit looked great when it was assembled. The assembly was a bit tedious , but just follow the directions. Wish the hinges had been more of bronze rather than chrome, but overall very happy.", 
    "A wonderful cabinet for the price, high quality materials and appears much more expensive than it is. Keep in mind, however, that you must assemble; shipped completely in pieces. I am handy and have done similar projects before so it took me about an hour by myself.", 
    "I Love It...It makes my bathroom look all grown up.", 
    "I did not put this together, but my husband didn't feel it was difficult. This is a very nice piece. It's sturdy and out of quality materials. It appeared to me from the picture that the front panels were woven tightly enough to not see through, but you can see through them somewhat. Also, the shelves are not adjustable. Those are the only two surprises for us. Overall, we're very happy.", 
    "I love the way this cabinet looks and I had seen this very same cabinet on another site for $100 more than the Overstock price. That being said, this cabinet was a NIGHTMARE to put together. The directions and pictures were terrible and it probably took me 3 hours to put this together. If you buy this cabinet, go into the project with a lot of patience!", 
    "This item is nice, but hard to put together.", 
    "While the materials are good quality, the instructions were very poor. It started with no information on the tools needed to put it together. It then became a wrestling match to hold the pieces together until you could get the top and bottom pieces on to lock everything in place. It was physically impossible to put the bottom piece on according the instructions, so I had to take it all apart and do it in a different order. I put this together by myself, but it wouldn't have been any easier with two people. The finished product looks very nice on my wall, but it took much longer to assemble then it should have and I wouldn't recommend it to someone else.", 
    "In the end it's a decently constructed piece, and it looks good. Looking at it you would think that there are only a few pieces to put together, but there were far more parts than expected and building it will take more than a couple of minutes.Overall a nice looking piece that should hold up to daily use.", 
    "The other reviews were accurate in that my husband did need to add some wood glue to some of the joints for extra stability. We followed the advice of mounting the cabinet before putting on the doors. All went well and we are pleased with the look for the great price we paid.", 
    "Very god purchase and a reasonable price. Satisfied.", 
    "Great product for the price. Easy to put together and it looks nice on the wall. I would recommend it to a friend.", 
    "From the time I received this cabinet, it was together in 90 minutes. This included opening the package and reading the manual. Yes, read the manual, first. What struck me most was the material, very much like engineered floor. This was actually a wood product with stain. I am so used to having an laminated covering as the final surface. This cabinet really set off my new bathroom remodel. For this day and time this cabinet is rated a 10. Buy with confidence.", 
    "With Christmas the cabinet is still in the box unopened.", 
    "It was easy to assemble & looks nice in my bathroom.The quality of the cabinet is very good.", 
    "Love this cabinet! We have it in our bedroom and its espresso tone goes well with rest of the stuff in our house. :)", 
    "This is a quality cabinet at a great price. Price shopped many other sites and Overstock was the least expensive. Easy transaction, fast shipping and good customer service after the sale!", 
    "I love this cabinet. It was easy to assemble & looks nice in my bathroom.The quality of the cabinet is excellent. I liked it so much that I found a matching clothes hamper to use as well.", 
    "This cabinet was easy to put togetner with simple tools and took about 30 minutes for assembly. It looks like it came with the original mahogony cabinets which cost about $3000. It really completes the look of the bathroom and allowed me to stow a lot of small items out of sight. An excellent value, It was exactly what I was looking for, I would definitely have bought it in a store and paid more moey for it."
