    "Assembly took 2 adults around 2 hours. I adult could assemble it with some effort though.Instructions weren't too hard to get, not better or worse than IKEA. But the wood started to split when we were fitting one of the wood screws. The screw grooves weren't exactly aligning the beams at right angles. Good thing my friend is experienced in woodwork. He stopped immediately and sedated a wood clamp and adhesive.We got IKEA mattresses which worked great without needing slats.Didn't ship for 3 weeks even though the order confirmation said they bed would ship in up to 5 business days. Arrived 2-3 days after shipping though", 
    "Received the bed in early March of 2014. It is now June and it is broken due to our TWO year old sitting down to go down the slide and the upper frame broke. It is cheaply made and of very poor quality.", 
    "We purchased the white version and it looks very nice. It was easy to put together except for 2 parts. The boards that form the base for the mattress and the middle support for the back for not have predrilled holes for the nails! I had a contractor help out since he was here doing something else as not to ruin the frame but this was a huge disappointment. The rest of the bed was a pretty straight forward two person job all the materials and tools were together. We did not install the slide and left the fabric pieces off as they didn't match the colors in the room but both pieces seemed fine. Overall I would still purchase it again. Do be mindful with over tightening, I had I find a replacement bolt for that reason but that's more my fault than the manufacturer's.", 
    "Read the reviews for this bed so I saw more good reviews than bad. The adhesive on the tent isn't very durable but for the overall experience of the bed is AWESOME! My son loves it! The slide is pretty durable but my son isn't on the heavy side but he runs up it backwards and it's still standing. Overall I would have more kids just to purchase this bed again. My 13 year old son is soo jealous that he didn't get one of these growing up.", 
    "This bed took my husband and a friend about an hour or so to put together, I thought it might be too big for the space we had to put it in, but it was perfect! Some reviewers are saying the stick on velcro \"tent\" falls off, but that is an easy fix, if it does happen I will just have replacement tape and velcro. Haven't had a problem with it yet, because my 3 year old doesn't pull at it. Still trying to get him to stay in his own room overnight though...working on it. This bed is super fun and he really loves the slide. Great quality. I would say this bed will suit him until he is 7 or 8.", 
    "This bed is amazing and half the price as similar products in stores and the quality is excellent. Its not too high so my toddler wont be scared, but high enough to use the underneath for a fort/storage/nook...and it has a freakin' slide! I would have loved this as a kid!!", 
    "This is a nice bed for a younger kid. However, once put into the corner of the room, it is EXTREMELY difficult to put on and take off sheets, as you can't reach the corner without climbing on the bed. Having helped put it together, I feel uncomfortable climbing on it to make the bed when I wash sheets, as I know the stairs are held together with wooden dowels. I am a petite person, so I am not taxing the bed by climbing on it, but I do feel like it wasn't meant to support my weight. Also, the \"tent\" that goes under it - the fabric walls - do not stick with the tape/Velcro provided and keep falling down. We have to come up with another solution like stapling them to the bed to make them stay. Good for the price, but quality isn't there. Does not appear as though the slide can be mounted on either side either - it must be put together as pictured.", 
    "My fiancee's daughter loves it!! So does my nephew!!!The velcro needs to be redone as it's stickiness didn't keep the fabric up. I put it together myself in a few hours. I would say that the bolts need to be tightened every so often. But, Sophia loves her \"Slide Bed\".", 
    "My son loves the slide, I haven't had any issues with it. The drill holes were wrong and some screws were missing. I was fortunate enough to have a handy man! BUT, get the warranty. The wood is easy bent, dented and isn't the quality I am used to from Overstock.", 
    "My daughter unfortunately has not slept in this bed once. lol. Although she loves it - slide, great for playing/hiding underneath - there were some things that she expressed concerned ( as we did too actually) The wood slats holding the mattress could be a little stronger . Dont get me wrong, I think the bed is somewhat sturdy but the slats bending and such isnt comforting. Mind you the bed has a maximum weight ( I dont know what the industry standard is) but lets just say, you as an adult shouldnt be laying with your child on this . haThe slide is sturdy, no issues there but depending on your mattress height - it could be a dangerous situation when trying to slide off the mattress then onto the slide. For us, we had a mattress with a very thin pillow top and the safety rail barely covers it. I dont fault the bed for this matter but I do kind of wish the rails on the side would be much higher to accommodate the mattresses sold today. Another thing that kind of stinks is the area below. Really can do anything with it besides hide all the stuffed animals or use it as a hide/seek thing which clearly they had the same intentions with the curtains and fake window etc. Being said though, this is a entry level bed. Its held up but I can see long term there could be issues. The wood material isnt the strongest ( I can tell when screwing in the screws how \"easily\" they go in. Also be careful if using a powerdriver, if you go too much it can easily strip the screws and/or spin the hole in which there is no more traction (due to the soft wood/laminated wood ) The stairs hurt your feet, even my kids say so. In fact, they try to do a running head start and jump up just to avoid the stairs or they go up the slide. In conclusion, Nifty idea but was just wishing a little more. You may actually find similar material like beds at IKEA , if you really want some apples to apples comparison.", 
    "Good: I love this bed, it is very cool and fun. It isn't too high off the ground but not too low either. fun transition from crib to big boy bed. Bad: The curtain does not stay on it falls off. The bottom is a cool hide out but it is dark. leg may get caught in between the bars. takes up a lot of room", 
    "It was an absolute bear to put together. Took a couple of men half a day to get it all and now they are moving so we have to disassemble and move it. I can only hope the second time around is easier. But my grandson does love the slide.", 
    "was a little shorter than i had anticipated, shouldve realized the measurements and took into account the actual height underneath was shorter. but my daughter loves this bed, its beautiful, sturdy and good quality. i did buy a different tent for the underneath and its a little fancier and cuter now. overall great product and it was mostly everything we hoped for.", 
    "The bed came quickly and was exactly as described. I am very happy with it.", 
    "Great quality for the price of the bed. It looks beautiful and my daughter loves it.", 
    "My grandson absolutely loves it! So much fun for a child!", 
    "I love this bed! I purchased it for my then 4 year old as we were upgrading him from a tiny toddler bed into a more \"big boy\" bed. This bed frame is made for a twin matters and does not need a box frame. Let me just say that my son was estatic when we built it. When his friends come over they immidiatley migrate to his room and begin to play on his bed and under. I am a single mother and not a very handy person. I attempted to build it my self but had to call in reinforcements and it took aprox. 6 hours to build between grandma & grandpa. The only thing I did not like about the bed was the velcro stickers the underneath tent came with, they are cheap and dont last long, store bought velcro will need to be bought.", 
    "If it's about the kids. Get it. They have had a ball with it, kicking, hitting, jumping, top to bottom , inside & out,they are all over it. Heck they even sleep on it.", 
    "The tent doesn't stick well so I used a staple gun to keep the Velcro from falling off. Works well. We can't use the slide because the room is too narrow. The slide is made of thin board so even if we could use it we probably wouldn't because our child is 60lbs.", 
    "My son is in love with his new bed. I'm concerned that the slide may not last, but he is really enjoying it for now! I highly recommend. He loves playing in the fort too...set up is a bit difficult and two people would be better than one.", 
    "My son loves this bed, but he is getting too big to play under the bed. He is very tall for his age and when he sits under the bed, he almost bumps his head.", 
    "At first I was leery about buying this bed online. My grandson had been wanting this for over a year so I finally found it here at overstock for the price I was willing to pay. I thought extremely good for the bed I got. It was easy to put together and my 24 year old son and I had it put together in about 2 hrs. It is very very well made and all wood. The slide is not flimsy at all. Very sturdy and can handle a child that is 96 pds. with no problem. I am extremely happy with this bed and so is my grandson.", 
    "My son loves the bed!!!! It took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to assemble.", 
    "Prefect for little one if is leaving the toddler years! It's about 40\" off the floor so not a full - tall bunk /loft bed. The area underneath is a perfect \"fort\" or hide out. My daughter loves it! Just wish the curtains / walls for the fort area had a better way to attach. The double back velcro tape comes off allot. For the price and quality - perfect!", 
    "couldn't be happier with the product! My son is going to LOVE it!", 
    "This bed was reasonably priced, very easy to assemble and very sturdy. My daughter is 2 and she had no trouble transitioning from her crib to this slide bed. She loves being able to slide out of bed in the morning. She plays on it all day too.", 
    "The bed is made well and great for a child between 3-7 yrs old. The height is good, being lower than a bunk bed. My grandson loves it for sleeping and the tent area for playing. He is 2 yrs & 10ths, soon to be 3.", 
    "Nice solid feeling bed once assembled. The instructions were poorly translated to English so prepare yourself. Make sure to STUDY the diagrams closely for indications as to where each and every hole is. Other than that, great value. My boy loves it.", 
    "Wow this bed was the half the price of similar beds and the quality is great! My son loves the slide and had no problem going from a crib to this bed. The front rail is perfect and there is barely a gap from stairs and slide. Very pleased with this bed. I see its out of stock!!!!"
