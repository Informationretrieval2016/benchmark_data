    "It looks a lot bigger on here. I can sleep one comfortable and 2 very tight. Looks good and feels sturdy and is easy to adjust.", 
    "We bought this as we needed a sofa style bed in small space. It is not a sofa, it is a bench. Feels like a board, looks like a board. Very disappointed.", 
    "It wasn't at all obvious from the description that this is not a full size sofa bed. I needed something for two adult guest to sleep on and this is not even big enough for one average sized adult. It's also very hard.", 
    "The material is very rough and scratchy. The item is much smaller than expected. I was hoping family members could stay the night and feel comfortable on this item, however I am only 5 feet, 7 inches and my feet were hanging off. Very hard and ugly red feet."
