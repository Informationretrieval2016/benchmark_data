    "It took nearly 2 hours to assemble and required our own tools and screws to actually make it work. NO excuse for that. This was a nightmare to assemble for three reasons: 1) There were several holes that were not lined up correctly. We had to screw the back arm ourselves with a drill and screws because there was no way to use the enclosed screws w/allen wrench because the holes were misaligned. Annoying but not a total deal breaker. 2) There were no holes drilled for any of the four feet, not even any marking to show WHERE to screw them. Again, annoying but not a huge deal. 3) The instructions were terrible and failed to mention one HUGE part - to screw the back arm onto the base, you have to peel the fabric up from the bottom to access the screw holes underneath (the top is stitched but we eventually noticed that the bottom was velcro and therefore able to be pulled up). Because so many other holes were not aligned or missing altogether, we figured they forgot the put holes in the side arm fabric, so we cut through to access the holes only to discover, too late, that there was a way to pull up the fabric (and therefore we punctured the fabric unnecessarily). THAT should have been written or shown in the instructions. Thankfully that part is against the wall and not visible but we're ticked that we cut the fabric when it would have been so easy for the instructions to tell you/show you that the fabric can be pulled up from underneath.", 
    "It took over 4 hours of pure sweat to put this thing together. I felt like I was fighting the thing! One thing I wished I had was a power drill - I had to ask the handy man working on the rental to help me out. The holes did not match up and he helped me drill one of them so the screw would go in. 2 of the legs had hairline cracks in them likely when screws were put into them. I was able to arrange them in a way that is not too noticeable. There were no guides for where to screw in the legs and in 2 areas, the screws end up in thin air! The design is not good obviously as there is no possible way for you to screw all 4 corners of the leg in so I just did 3 and the legs seem stable enough. It looks nice in my living room - I do like the contemporary look and turns out even though the color is not white, but beige, it actually looks better than if I ended up with white (and much better for wear and tear since I have a 3 yr old). I would give it 4 stars for appearance but 1 star for build design. I gave 2 stars overall because I still have not recovered from my struggle. It was shear determination and stubborness on my part (not to return this thing) that got me through it!", 
    "I've been a fairly frequent customer on this website for the past several months, but most of my purchases have fallen into the categories of clothing, accessories, and housewares. This was my first furniture purchase from O.co, and I can now safely say that it will be my last. To begin with, I opened the box to find that the color of the chaise, in person, is vastly different from the color on the website. In the photo, the fabric looks solid white or off-white. In person, it is much darker, more of a light tan in color. Also, the fabric has a woven look and is very rough against the skin, which you would never guess based on the picture. Still, although it was not what I expected, I decided to go ahead and put it together anyway because I liked everything else about the contemporary style of this piece, and I figured I could always spruce it up and make it more comfortable with a soft throw blanket. Next, assembling this thing was a beast. The holes did not always line up well, and I constantly found myself having to unscrew bolts and re-screw them in in a different order to ensure that some of the bolts that were \"off\" would fit well enough that they could be tightened. On top of that, if you follow the instructions on where to screw in the legs, only 3 out of the 4 screws on the back two legs actually make contact with wood on the bottom of the chaise. The others hit... nothing but air. So, there was an issue with faulty design there, either with the instruction sheet or the construction itself. Finally, quality of the components is poor. 3 OUT OF 4 LEGS had huge cracks running from the top of the leg to the bottom. By the time I discovered this, I had already fiddled with the assembly for over an hour and had the rest of the chaise put together. I arranged the legs as best I could to hide the cracks and just as I finished screwing in the last leg and flipped it right side, the metal plate ATTACHED to the top of one of the wooden legs ripped off completely and the leg fell off. <SIGH> I screwed everything back in as tight as possible, but that leg still wobbles quite a bit, and I think if I shift too much while reading, I may end up on the floor. The only bright side is that I *think* customer service is going to be able to send me 3 new legs. I only hope they inspect them to ensure they're not broken before sending them out...", 
    "I live in a NYC studio with limited space. I was looking to either get a larger couch or put another piece of furniture next to my loveseat. This chaise is the perfect addition to my apartment. It has a neutral color that can have an addition of a colorful pillow. It is long enough to support my tall frame. I spend hours watching television laying in this chaise. Finally, the storage space was larger than I had imagined. I have two yoga mats, an exercise mat and all of my stretching and small weight equipment in the storage space in the chaise with space to spare. Good stuff!", 
    "We are happy with the appearance and utility of the lounge. However, the chair arrived with significant snags. Rather than deal with the hassle of returns, I was able to repair the snags to almost good as new, and we added pillows to hide any seams. Unfortunately, we've also noticed that the fabric absorbs stains dangerously well, which are not removed easily with fabric cleaner.", 
    "It certainly does not worth the price. It looks and feels cheap. The fabric is not that bad but the remaining material and the stitches are of poor quality, even defective. Besides, it doesn't look sturdy, it's as if it might not carry the weight of anyone leaning on the backside of the chaise. In short, don't waste your money on it.", 
    "I like the piece. It looks nice. Doesn't look designer, but doesn't look cheap either. It's respectable for most folks' purposes. It works great for decoration and for throwing clothes on it, and it's good for extra seating especially in a small or awkward space. But if you weigh much more than 100 pounds, be wary of plopping down on it with too much force. The cushions feel like partially deflated balloons. I sink right through them. And if you sit directly in the middle, you'll straddle a beam of wood just beneath the fabric that can do some damage to your tail bone if you're not careful. But as long as you're using it casually, it should be okay. I put mine next to an antique record player and I like to relax on it when I'm in the mood for some music at the end of the day. As long as you're not too rough on the thing, it's fine.", 
    "As a designer, I am thoughtful in finding just the right piece for a client. Scale and size is one of the most important factors to success. This chaise lounge is perfect for a bedroom. The fabric is a linen weave, the legs are stylish, and the storage seat an added bonus for bedding or pillows. It can be dressed casual or elegant by adding a contrasting throw pillow. The assembly was not difficult, all the hardware was enclosed. But as the previous reviews noted, the instructions fail to tell you that the back fabric panel has velcro closing. This must be pulled up to reveal the screw holes. Good value for the money. Enjoy!", 
    "I purchased this piece for general lounging around and it has exceeded my expectations of comfort, look, and ease of putting together. It may not be the most comfortable lounge out there, but for the price, it probably is. It took me, a girl, less than an hour to put together, and it was easy to do myself. The directions are explicit. The material of the lounge is slightly coarse, but throwing a blanket over it is easy enough to do. It is rarely unoccupied since I put it together. For the price, it is a jewel. I read all the reviews before I bought it, and the people who complain I think were expecting too much for the price. You don't go to a diner expecting the food to taste like fine cuisine; you don't buy this lounge expecting it to look like it belongs in a palace. But for general commonplace use, it's all star.", 
    "Bought this for my nursery. It is the perfect size - not too big, doesn't overwhelm the space but perfectly sized for either my husband or I to lay on or two people to sit on comfortably. I had read reviews prior to my purchase that people had difficulty assembling the piece. I put it together by myself 6 months pregnant - it was rather simple. Love the storage aspect of the piece. You'll definitely need to add a throw pillow for comfort - this is not a plush, fluffy couch but rather more like a padded bench. Accordingly I would not recommend this for everyday use in a den. I would recommend it for a foyer, bedroom, formal living room, etc. It is exactly what we were looking for in our nursery and well priced. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "Its been about 8 months since my husband and I purchased this and I want another one because its well made, affordable, and fits our decor perfectly.", 
    "This chaise is much nicer than I expected considering how affordable it is. My husband said it was easy to put together; and was impressed with the weight and sturdiness. The storage compartment is nice for your favorite throw blanket. I put this in my bedroom for watching TV, so it really helps save the bedding and adds a nice touch.", 
    "Tweedy beige color. Not well made, but good for my purpose. Nearly 2\" shorter than described. I have it in an alcove so the storage capability will be lost to me the way it is designed. It went together fine and the velcro opening was easy to find to attach the back.", 
    "I was so shocked that I was able to put this together - I'm such a girly girl and just knew I would need help. It was easy and it took me maybe 20 minutes. I had extra space in my master bedroom and this filled the corner perfectly. I get tons of compliments, it's comfortable, relaxing and I read a lot more since buying it. Most Saturday mornings are spent relaxing on this with my dog and a good book. It's actually cream - no where near white like the picture - and I love it. I bought it because all the reviews said it was cream because white would not have gone with my decor. Love it!", 
    "The chaise lounge arrived missing a leg. Also there were no assembly instructions. I have contacted overstock twice. They sent me a replacement leg but I STILL haven't received any assembly instructions. The ottoman has just been sitting here for a month in parts. Completely useless and super annoying.", 
    "Good quality but not as comfortable as I thought it would be. A little stiff and I can't get relaxed.", 
    "Love this chase! It finishes the room decor in my bedroom. Color and fabric texture are exactly as described. It's not only beautiful-it's very functional too.", 
    "The chair was really difficult to put together. I am usually really good at assembling things but the pre-drilled holes did not match up very well and the legs did not have pre-drilled holes, not a big real but it was really awkward screwing them in the space provided. I feel like I had to wrestle the thing to get it together! I do really like it over all. It's not the most comfy piece of furniture, but I love it in our office and it is really cute!", 
    "I had trouble with the assembly, but once I figured it out I love it. The back of the curved piece has a Velcro cover that isn't mentioned in the instructions. This hides the predrilled holes. Unfortunately, it doesn't open enough for one hole, and I had to punch one through the fabric to get it together. It's a firm seat. I'm somewhat concerned about the future wear of the seat cushion, but so far so good.", 
    "I wasnt expecting to have to assemble but it was pretty simple", 
    "Search for months for the perfect sitting arrangement for a small space facing our garden and pool. Thanks to Houzz where I saw the perfect chaise lounge that led me to Overstock that let me to purchase our wonderful chaise lounge with storage.", 
    "This lounge looks great in our loft and is a perfect size for 1 person and when you don't have a lot of room. It has a very nice, transitonal/modern look to it. It definitely needs a pillow to lean on (pillow doesn't come with it) but the cushion itself works for hanging out, working, for a few hours. It is not a cushion that you would necessarily sleep on all night and say, '\"wow, that was so cushiony\" but it is well worth the money. The feature of the storage underneath the cushion is great. The directions for putting it together were terrible but it still was totally fine in doing so.", 
    "Like many others, one of the legs just came out right after installation. The hole on the leg was either too large or the wood is not that solid, and the screw couldn't stay on. The customer service did an excellent job and I got a replacement within a couple of days. The replacement leg was fine. They must have checked it carefully before they shipped it out. Overall, I still think the chaise worths the money.", 
    "If all you want is a bench to sit on occasionally and look pretty, then this is your product. That is all I wanted so I am very happy with it. It is not useful as a storage bench because it does not open up enough to allow easy access. Also, it opens from the back of the cushion which is awkward. It is also not that comfy as the seat is kind of hard, not at all plushy. You need a power tool to drill the holes. You should read the directions all the way through before starting so you understand that the legs go on the side section and not on the seat section. Overall, it's a good product for the price and I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "I returned this item the color was wrong and I did not care for the low quality of it.", 
    "We really like this chaise lounge. It is neutral and looks great in our bedroom. The fabric is good quality and it is very comfortable. The price is very good compared to others on other sites--easy to assemble and arrived within two or three days. Very pleased.", 
    "Cheap-looking, does not seem sturdy, not very comfortable, BUT the storage is a great feature. You do not want this chaise if you are looking for a lovely, comfy piece of furniture. If you just need an inexpensive place for the occasional guest to park, it's fine.", 
    "I Love this looks beautiful in my bedroom!", 
    "This is a comfortable, low cost chaise.", 
    "Perfect size to add to a bedroom. Surprisingly comfy and not too difficult to put together.", 
    "Exactly what I wanted and even more comfortable than I expected!", 
    "The best addition to our bedroom. Easy to assemble. Storage is perfect.", 
    "Nice quality and love love storage inside", 
    "Exactly as described. It was easy to put together (I am a small, 40yr old female). It is durable and very comfortable. I love the storage. What a great price - I am thrilled I purchased it!", 
    "got it few weeks. really enjoying it. very comfortable and looks good", 
    "This is more of a taupe than an off white. Does not come with pillow or match my living room like i thought it would. I'm pretty disappointed...", 
    "this chaise looked cheap after putting it together. I wont' be ordering anymore furniture from overstock.", 
    "This was mailed to me in 2 big boxes. Took me like 2 hours to put it together. I love it... Looks and feel really nice.", 
    "Perfect glamorous addition to my daughters bedroom remodel! Needless to say a little challenging to complete solo, especially when handling the big pieces and there was the interesting assembly instructions that failed to tell me how to really put on the final bolts that attach the back to the bench. I actually had to make my own holes ?? Storage was nothing grand but enough for throw storage and other small treasures. But aside from that it was the absolute perfect touch to a glam remodel", 
    "Ok not quite the colour I wanted but good storage", 
    "Excellent quality, very easy assembly.", 
    "Shopping in overstock is easy. Chaise arrived on time. It is a nice piece of furniture, easy to put together, just the side and the back.", 
    "We purchased this sofa chair as a place to sit or read in in the front window of our home. It has become the dogs favorite spot to look out the window, my morning coffee and paper reading spot and my husbands \"catnap\" spot after work. It is an excellent buy for the price. The sofa is sturdy and easy to assemble, but the arm on the back is thin and likely couldn't hold \"significant\" weight, if needed. I would highly recommend for any of the purposes noted.", 
    "Looks great by our bay window", 
    "This chaiset is excellent, serves the purpose intended and is a real eye catcher to everyone who enters the room.", 
    "was easy to assemble, looks great!", 
    "Not very comfortable. Shallow storage inside.", 
    "Arrived with stains, legs aren't very sturdy", 
    "Not meant for weight or daily use. I also had to remove the hinges inside (installed backwards and one was bent) which was fine for how I'm using it. Looks pretty but it's dainty and not made super well. Sill kept it, works for me.", 
    "Looks good from the front. The back is another story. The fabric is not smooth at all. So if you are placing with the back in view, you need to drape it with a blanket. The legs were very hard to put on and don't look right, once they are. Not overly comfortable, a little stiff, but good enough. Keeping it, because I don't want to return it", 
    "This product is very nice in person. Very easy to put together and very nice quality for the price.", 
    "The color depicted in the picture is no where near the actual color in person. It has a yellow tint to it that you cannot see in the picture. The seams are also uneven at the top and very noticeable.", 
    "It's comfortable, looks simple, goes with a lot of other colors, and fits our small living room. It's a small chaise and is used by my 8- and 10-year-olds", 
    "Well constructed. Perfect for small places and sitting and reading or working on laptope. Very easy to put together.", 
    "I have purchased 2 of these lounges!Lovely.....It is not a real heavy piece, but for casual use, it is comfortable, and the storage space under the seat is great!!", 
    "Exactly what I needed and wanted .", 
    "nice item, sturdy and the storage area is perfect", 
    "We love this chaise with its storage chest feature. We have a view of the river and the chaise is perfect for comfort, seating and not blocking the view.", 
    "We were looking for a modern chaise lounge for our master bedroom and found the perfect piece in this item! Easy to assemble, well-made and the storage space is a huge added bonus...so great!", 
    "This looks great in my bedroom. It is very comfortable. My kids love it more than I do.", 
    "It's not very comfy for lounging, but I love the way it looks. The material is durable and I didn't even realize that the seat lifts for storage.", 
    "I was hesitant to buy this after reading some of the reviews, but after I did some more homework, I decided to go forward with it and I am glad I did. Many reviews said that it was very difficult to put together. I found that very far from the truth. I had it put together within 30 minutes. All the holes lined up and there were no issue at all. It is not the most plush piece of furniture in our house, but it gets the job done and is very sturdy for a piece of casual furniture in front of our fireplace, and I LOVE the storage. I highly recommend for the price!!", 
    "Bought this chaise to put in front of my bedroom window. Looks great! Just not very comfy.", 
    "It was exactly what I wanted!!!", 
    "Easy to put together looks nice and is sturdy", 
    "If you are looking for a comfort Chaise that`s the one. I could read the previous reviews regarding the installation and instructions but I had NO problem at all. Sincerely I strong recommend this product. I bought for my daughter`s room and she is really happy.", 
    "I returned it due to the legs that fell off. It is impossible to reach inside the way the hinges are installed, opening it towards the front.", 
    "This is a nice looking piece. I really liked the fabric - it is thicker than I expected. I would have given it a 5, but the stitching in the front cushion didn't line up well. It is almost as if the cushion should have been flipped and the front should have been the back where the back board piece covers the material. I still liked it and it is just what we needed for a reading nook in our master.", 
    "I had been looking for a storage bench or chase and this happened to pop up as I was looking at other items and it was just what I wanted. The quality is great it was easy to assemble the few steps. I love this and would definitely recommend it.", 
    "very good item and the storage is great. It is quite easy to assemble.", 
    "This is a nice piece of furniture. I originally bought this as part of staging my house for sale, but it has become the seat everyone wants to sit on. The seat is stiff because of the storage under it. However, the storage section holds a lot. Also it went together well. I did have to put pressure (lean against) the side arm to get the last screw to line up, but that was the only extra effort I needed.", 
    "Looks good, But could have been crafted with better materials.", 
    "its a perfect piece for decor and storage. No one really uses it because its in my dining room but i have laid in it and it is quiet comfortable i absolutely love this chair it looks great.", 
    "This product is great! High quality, relatively easy to put together, nice fabric, great storage. Overall, awesome purchase!", 
    "Makes a great addition to our decor. Comfy and nice looking.", 
    "Color: The oatmeal color complements my living room furniture.Fabric: Was hoping it was softer but probably will withstand dirt/stain better. Cushion: Not as firm as I'd like. Seems a bit too soft and won't hold up over time, and I'm 112 lbs.Quality: Could be more sturdier. We tightened everything but the sides could be held on tighter, but this is a design flaw since there are only 3 bolts on the bottom and 1 on the top. Thought the siderest is not really for leaning on as much as the backrest.Some holes did not align perfectly and we had to screw in at an angle. Some bolts were hard to get to because of the velcro cover getting in the way--couldn't lift it up enough to allow space for my hand to get in and screw in the bolt.Storage is just enough for 2 blankets.", 
    "For the price we paid, this was good for us. Fits perfectly in the space we need and is relatively comfortable to sit on. Not much storage space in the bench, but we didn't order it for that so it's just extra.", 
    "The furniture fit in the space that I had but the back arm was unfinished and the seat was not as firm as I would have liked. it was easy to put together.", 
    "After reading the reviews, I was somewhat skeptical, but went ahead with the order. I am SO glad I did. Ours was very easy to assemble. Yes, you do have to lift the fabric from the Velcro before screwing in the screws. Ours all lined up perfectly. It is not a real soft piece, but soft enough. Contemporary and yet I could see it in a traditional setting.", 
    "Instructions for assembly were poor. Two of the legs were split completely down the middle and would not hold much weight. Replacement of these legs was requested immediately. No one answered the 800 numbered, instructed to put request in online. Online request never acknowledged. Instructions stated replacement parts would be shipped in 2-3 days. Waited 2 weeks for replacements then remailed. STILL WAITING!!", 
    "I love this chaise lounge chair and it looks beautiful in the window nook. Very easy to put together, but we needed to make sure all the legs faced the same way. Husband thought the quality wasn't the best but felt it was nice overall for the price. The piping around the edge is not straight which is the the only reason I'm not giving it a perfect score. The secret compartment is a great way to get men to love this!", 
    "I love this chaise because it looks great in my home however it is not very stable and because of this it is not very comfortable. It serves its purpose for the price.", 
    "Where do I start? Fantastic delivery (only 2 days!). Assembly? Under an hour (I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about). Outside of a small nick in the back, the chaise is fantastic. I LOVE the storage. I love the size (I have a small living room, which has a baby grand and didn't know where I'd fit a sofa ... well , the chaise looks fantastic in it. I wasn't expecting a high end product (certainly not for the price), but the value is EXCELLENT.", 
    "I had read all the reviews and wasn't sure about this chaise, but I'm glad i ordered it. It was super easy to put together and it's very nice. If I had to find something wrong I would say it's a little stiff, but still comfy to me.", 
    "I purchased the chaise as an accent for my master bedroom and it worked outy perfectly it was everything i expected and more. So in love with this addition to my bedroom", 
    "This s great chair of you have a small space. It's simple. You can dress it up with a throw and some pillows for color, because the fabric is pretty bland. The hidden storage is a nice addition. One thing to note though. It's VERY firm, so if you don't like that you may find it uncomfortable. I personally like it.", 
    "Love the lounger it was extremely easy to assemble, I did it by myself in about 30 minutes. I have had several comments on the seat, I put it in a newly renevated florida room; looks great!", 
    "This item fit the bill for my small space and was fairly easy to assemble.", 
    "I really like this chaise. I was looking for a loveseat at first then found this and thought this would look nicer for my formal front room. I was very pleased how it looked in my room! Easy to assemble. The storage will come in handy I'm sure.", 
    "It arrived quickly and was pretty easy to put together. Its a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I decided to keep it anyways, wasn't worth having to ship it back. It is a decent piece for the price. The storage is a nice feature too!", 
    "I received my chair on the exact date promised. It was packed very well, there was some damage to the box from shipping but not to the items in the box. I put the chair together on my own in maybe 30 minutes - very easy. The storage compartment is not as deep as I would like but I still love my new chair.", 
    "loved this chaise. it fits at the bottom of my 4 poster bed just perfectly.", 
    "It only took me 30 minutes to put this together and it looks awesome! I love the storage under the cushion! I have a small condo and need all the extra storage space I can get. So I store my wrapping paper supplies in it, it's always hard to find a good spot for those log rolls. The fabric is really night and high quality. I prefer the light cream/beige/tan color over the white.", 
    "A little disappointed - but too expensive to return."
