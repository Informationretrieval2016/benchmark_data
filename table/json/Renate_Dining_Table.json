    "This table looks great out of the box. We had read the reviews that mentioned it came rusted, but did not mind. Ours also arrived with the metal parts rusted, but it added to the charm. The problem was with the top of the table, after just a couple months of use pieces of the veneer have peeled away exposing the wood below, it is such an eyesore, and beyond repair, that we're buying a different table already.", 
    "Bought is as a conference table for my home office. Works really nice, looks really nice too. The only thing is that the angled bar that runs under it can get in your way. So, if it's just me on one side, I tend to shift more to the middle to give my knees some room.", 
    "Pros;The style and the color of the table is nice. The surface seems easy to clean up. Cons:A small chunk of the table, possibly during delivery, chipped off. It seems like it would take too much effort to exchange it for a tiny chip so I kept it. The grain of the table top looks very cheap. I can only position the table in the dining room a certain way because the space where the two halves of the table join is too wide. It almost looks like a fold up table.", 
    "Great table, very sturdy base with a weathered looking top.", 
    "Great product for the price point.", 
    "Super easy to assemble. Gorgeous table and with the matching chairs you will NOT be disappointed. The whole set just makes me smile!!", 
    "we ordered chairs with this table, they were quite nice, table on the other hand is VERY low quality, there were chipped off pieces all around the corners and it is plywood NOT reclaimed wood. Top surface feels rubbery to touch.", 
    "The table was very easy to put together and it looks great!", 
    "Really love this table easy to put together single chick took one hour stable, great looking", 
    "I absolutely am loving this table. It was a breeze to assemble and it really looks great in my dining room. It is big enough to easily fit 6 people around the table comfortably.", 
    "Strong chemical odor (3 weeks and still stinks), the top \"wood\" part looks ok but feels terrible, mdf most likely with lamination, almost feels plastic. The \"iron\" legs have imperfections, seemed to be touched up by permanent marker. I got it for staging, would never keep it if it was going to be in my dining room. Would not want to eat any food off of it that's for sure. Save your money for a better quality table.", 
    "too heavy and photos were misleading", 
    "looks great, but when metal is hit, the top layer comes off and changes color", 
    "surprised - really like it -", 
    "Table already chipped very disappointed do not leave water on table ever", 
    "This is a nice looking table, but I wouldn't say I was overly impressed. The wood looks a little 'plastic-y,' though overall, it isn't bad. Set-up is a breeze, though I have a feeling that mine was a return originally that was sent out again because it was missing a few bolts, and already had the feet pad on it. That was a little disappointing.", 
    "i purchased this in the coffee color and love it. i also have the desk. material is solid and the look is fantastic. i put this together alone with no issues in 45 minutes. paired with the vintage tabouret chairs it looks amazing.", 
    "Great table for the price! I've searched high and low, others start at $800 plus. Packaged perfectly and easy assembly. The only con is definitely the smell. Like the other review the smell is a bit strong but nothing I would knock off stars for. I would absolutely recommend this table.", 
    "Love this table!! The finish has a grey washed look. It will work great in my kitchen. Large enough to to feed a crowd. Very easy to assemble....my husband and I assembled in quickly (and without any arguments!). Highly recommend this table....great value.", 
    "This piece has a nice design and was easy to assemble.The only problem I had with it was that the metal pieces had a strong pungent odor. It smelled like oil or gasoline. We tried cleaning those pieces with different scented cleaners but it would not go away. Needless to say it was difficult to be around the piece for at least a month.", 
    "The materials aren't great and the delivery package was messy, maybe that's why the product came damaged in several parts and with rusty legs. The table size is good and fits perfectly 6 chairs."
