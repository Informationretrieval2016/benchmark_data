    "I ordered this wingback headboard in the dark grey linen. It arrived very quickly and the color is very true to the picture as is the style. There is some assembly required, and I did have a discolored spot on the bottom of the headboard I got. I have a tall mattress, so it covers up the spot, so I wasn't worried about it. In the photo, it shows the mattress with a space before the headboard starts. With my tall mattress (16 inches), it comes up to the bottom row of buttons. With pillows, you only see the top two rows of buttons. Beside the discoloration, I found the two side pieces didn't line up perfectly with the back of the headboard. This could be due to the padding there, but one side is flush with the backboard, and the other side is about 1/2 an inch below it. I decided I can live with it. This headboard does come with 3 screw holes to attach a bed frame, which my frame didn't line up with, and also slots if you have that type of bed frame. I can only get one screw in, but it holds the headboard up. I'm not sure if you need a special frame, or if mine is just outdated..mine has 2 holes to screw in...so only one matches up to one holes. Also, the back of the headboard is open/ exposed when you get it so you can put it together. They have a black piece of fabric that velcros over it to cover it up, but as it's up against a wall, I didn't even bother to put that up. I was worried about the nail head trim...I've seen some unattractive pieces with cheap nailhead trim. This is the type that is long, made together, with an actual nail every 5-10 spots I'd say. Think real nail head...fake fake fake etc. The real nailheads are a little larger than the others, put its in a recurring pattern, so it looks nice...(not cheap like I was expecting). I'm happy with it, and hope it holds up over time.", 
    "We got this headboard because it was decently priced, looked nice and had good reviews. We're more than happy with it. The linen material is so cozy and inviting looking. Any time anyone walks into our room, it's the first thing they comment on. The instructions were a little wonky and left out a whole section about the screws attaching the headboard to the frame, but it's very self explanatory how it goes together. Love it!", 
    "I would love to leave a better review for the headboard BUT it doesn't fit any bed frame! I ordered one with it, and had to send back (pain in the butt) then I went to 3 stores to try and find one that would fit. At the end of the day, I found one that at least the screws fit into, but the holes were not aligned. So my headboard is mounted up on books to align with the frame. Not ideal. Overstock should have a frame that is recommended to come with this headboard because the specs seem pretty standard, and I'm not sure why this is so difficult to match.", 
    "our order arrived in two days. Easy to put together. The best is the quality, excellent!!!", 
    "Super easy to put together and added so much life to my guest room!", 
    "I thought it was more taller , but it is really nices , easy to assembly , all the part came properly, and overstock has the faster delivery ever for free .", 
    "Headboard itself is ok, but good luck trying to find a bed frame that will work with it. The holes for the bolts are at \"non-standard\" height from the floor so really NO way to make it work. I'd love to return it, but it seems like a real hassle to try to get taken apart and put back into a box! Overall, this one is a \"PASS\".", 
    "2 of the 6 screws to connect the side panels to the main headboard did not line up with the holes. Not even close. Off by inches. Extremely frustrating.", 
    "Great headboard at great price! My guest bedroom looks great! It was easy to assemble and package was manageable to handle. Quality is good.", 
    "Looks awesome in our guest room. Very beautiful woven gray tweed fabric. Good construction. The holes in the base didn't align with our frame so we have to rework the holes to make it attached correctly. I would recommend this to anyone looking nice for a nice cheaper option.", 
    "Handsome headboard. It arrived in excellent shape, no odors, no pilling of fabric after 6 months. You will need two people to handle the package and the installation. It sits well above a thick mattress. Thin profile, so takes up almost no space, but commands the room with the tufting, fabric texture, and the well-made nail head trim.", 
    "I ordered the grey linen by mistake. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. I do think the bed looks a little cheap up close, but it looks great from a distance. The \"nailheads\" aren't real, they are really cheap looking metal pieces (I don't think the metal is even real). I think the bed would look much better w/o the nailheads. The holes for the screws are off so it makes assembling a little nerve wrecking. If you have someone help you hold the bed and side post in place while the other person screws it's much easier.", 
    "This is exactly as pictured, but of the highest of quality and aesthetically very appealing. Would most certainly buy again!", 
    "The grey is lighter than it displays online. I was looking for a dark grey/charcoal. The headboard is not difficult to assemble but attaching it to a bed frame requires more tools and two people. It is a handsome headboard for the money.", 
    "Well constructed and easy to assemble. The color is less gray than it is a black and white tweed, but it still works with the d\u00e9cor.", 
    "Love the new look this headboard brings to my room. Seems like it should have always been there. The only negative is it didn't fit my metal frame very well so we had to compromise with the assembly. Not a disaster.", 
    "For the money, it is a decent piece, but one of the buttons was threadbare. I asked if it could be replaced and they sent me a button attached to a string. What am I supposed to do with that?!?Customer service told me to go ahead and throw away the original packaging and if I had to send back the entire headboard, later on that I could use my own box. Really?! As if I have a box laying around that size. I did toss (recycle) the box, while I waited for a response from customer service, as I don't have extra room in my apartment. While I waited to see if replacing the button was an option, they sent the button on a string with no instructions or real way to replace it. Ridiculous!", 
    "I received this bed without assembly instructions. I contacted customer service about this and still have not received the instructions.", 
    "Though I love the style and color of the bed and it feels pretty well made, don't be fooled by the nailhead design. They are plastic and one continuous piece versus the real thing. On line it looks fine but up close just cheap looking. If it wasn't such a hassle to return a large item (box already damaged) I'd probably return.", 
    "Headboard looks okay in person. Certainly a lot more grand in pictures online. More of a guest room piece (vs master bedroom). Arrived with a portion of the nailhead strip on top left side bent and out of place. It appears as though they were not nailed all the way in and bent when packed/shipped. Requires assembly.", 
    "This is the perfect headboard! Well constructed and so beautiful, not to mention comfy! I looked at so many similar headboards before I settled on this one and I couldn't be happier! Whoever said \"you can't have expensive taste on a shoestring budget\" never shopped on Overstock.com!", 
    "I just received this headboard and it was fairly easy to put together. It looks absolutely beautiful and it makes my queen guest bed look a little bigger than it is and it is the best part of the room. You can't beat the price and the quality seems to be really good as well. I got the dark grey and it's honestly just a little more denim/dark blue than I expected but still absolutely beautiful!", 
    "Just what I thought it would be, modern, stylish and very sophisticated.", 
    "This a beautiful piece, so much so I decided to update all of the furniture in the bedroom. It's sexy enough for a man while being elegance for a woman.", 
    "Arrived today. Matched the description. Easy to assemble. Just what I was looking for. Highly recommend. Thank You Overstock.", 
    "Beautiful headboard. Very massive and glamorous!", 
    "It's true there is an odor and I didn't open the package all the way. Reviews are critical but I took the gamble and not in my favor. Disappointed with the products from O.", 
    "I am disappointed with this product. The color is not as described. It was supposed to be grey linen and looks brown. The workmanship is poor. I would not recommend it.", 
    "Elegance and Quality for a great price.", 
    "Love the silver nail heads and the fabric, attention to detail on this headboard front and back was impressive. Easy to assemble too.", 
    "This headboard came with bed bugs!!!!! Overstock did NOTHING about it! This $*** headboard cost me $1100 in damages and extermination fees. Please be carefull when buying any apolstered items.", 
    "I am obsessed with this headboard. It looks pretty glam thanks to the dark gray color. I had been searching for one just like this for a long time and when I ordered it, I was very hesitant (we all know online purchases can be deceiving), but it is beautiful. Now we are upgrading to a King size bed and I'd like the whole bed, not just a headboard, but they don't have it! Kind of devastated that I have to let it go :( I'd definitely recommend it.", 
    "The head board does not line up with the bed frame. So you can't get a tight fit. This headboard was meant to be purchased with the rails that match.", 
    "this headboard is very pretty in real life and the photo is almost true to form. the color and nail-heads are beautiful actually. i have the same problem as other comments, however, aligning the screw holes with a standard metal queen bedframe. the headboard, in fact, has 3 holes on each side. One side I was able to insert 2 screws, the other 1 because it would not align. the screws provided also stripped very easily so I went to Home Depot to buy better quality ones. I plan on detaching the single-sided screw and attempting to realign so that 2 screws do actually go in.", 
    "Although this headboard is beautiful and well made, we had trouble attaching it to our existing bed frame. It is free-standing right now, which is fine. We purchased in cream-linen, and it looks beautiful. I would recommend this!", 
    "Well made and beautiful design. The only issue I have with this is the screws did not work well.", 
    "Headboard tilts backward because the screw holes are misaligned. It looks nice but you cant lean on it. Its so so ... Id give it a higer rating if I didn't have to go to home depot after buying it .", 
    "They sent in the box 2 right wingsnow have to wait weeks for a replacement.", 
    "I ordered a dark grey linen headboard and I love it! It looks exactly as shown in the picture. It makes my room look more beautiful and luxurious. I am satisfied with the quality of this product.", 
    "Purchased this headboard in beige linen and it is a very classic & sophisticated look!", 
    "Designer bed at fraction of price", 
    "I ordered this headboard on the cream linen for my guest room. It is very nice looking however the predrilled holes did not lline up with the standard queen bed frame I have. We could only get one of the two screws in so it is a bit wobbly. It also arrived with a a black smudgemark on the face of the headboard.", 
    "The grey linen is a little darker than shown in the picture. It's still looks really great. The holes didn't exactly line up to secure it with the queen size bed frame that I have. I love this headboard.", 
    "This head board is everything thing i thought it would be. All i needed for the finishing touch. Nothing more to say but sweet dreams.", 
    "Looks great! And very easy to attach legs and side pieces.", 
    "I love studs so this headboard was exactly what I was looking for; although I wish there was more padding and deeper tufting. Assembly was easy, I did it myself and I'm far from handy.", 
    "It set my room off like a match", 
    "I purchased this headboard for my guest room. Fairly easy to assemble. The look is exactly what I was hoping for. The tufting and the nailhead provides a level of sophistication that provides a statement for the room.", 
    "Love the product. Would have given 5 stars but the color was different from picture (dark grey linen looks more like blue grey Jean). But very happy with the look.", 
    "LOVE!!! BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!", 
    "I had to bond with this before submitting this review. The color (dark gray/charcoal-definitely NOT black) and the measurements are exactly as depicted and described, but the shiny/uneven nail heads and maligned holes for standard bed frames are a bit of a disappointment. Be advised, you need 2 people to put this together! This was purchased for our guest room (currently occupied by my adult son), and it is quite striking, as well as very comfortable to rest upright against. Once again, Overstock provided amazing support with a satisfaction guarantee. I am more than pleased with the price I paid, so it's a keeper! Thanks again, Overstock!", 
    "It looks amazing. Glad I bought it. Wish I could add a pic", 
    "Beautiful headboard; love the fabric!", 
    "I was mis-lead by one of the pictures and thought this was a bed FRAME instead of just the headboard. Other than that, it's a very glamorously chic addition to any room", 
    "Very pleased with quality and very easy to put together.", 
    "I simply love this headboard, I ordered the Dark Gray Linen, looks black, but that's OK, I love it!", 
    "Just make sure you pay attention to the screws while assembling.", 
    "Looks greatHoles didn't line up easily but it was fine. Took about 30 minutes to put together.", 
    "This headboard is great. It is stylish and is a quality piece. I'm pleased", 
    "This is a great headboard at a really good price. As good as advertised. Relatively easy to set up but one small glitch , one hole did not line up correctly with my bed frame.", 
    "I ordered a queen size and the headboard is for a king size. Now I have to figure a way to connect it to my frame. And the width will make it difficult to reach the bedside light.", 
    "Very elegant. The nail heads add just the right sparkle. When you stand your pillow shams up against the headboard, the headboard is the normal height. If you like them laying down as pictured, the headboard will look taller.", 
    "I really like it online but it is quite a bit lighter than the picture. Assembly was easy! However the hole drill spots were not perfectly even so it isn't flush as it should be. The hassle of the return was more than I wanted so I have it up and it's nice enough just not as thrilled as I hoped I would be from the picture", 
    "Look great in my bedroom and the quality is really nice.", 
    "Love it..Looks expensive for the price", 
    "I have been unable to assemble the headboard because no hardware was included in the packaging. I thought the fabric was one color but it has a slight pattern. As soon as I am able to assemble the headboard, there will be additional review of this product.", 
    "wish was taller but very nice", 
    "Would have been excellent except for an almost unnoticeable tear on the top of the headboard. This is one sexy headboard. Goes with my new Tempurpedic perfectly.Easy to assemble too.", 
    "This Bed headboard is great quality. It was very easy to assemble with all tools included. It is heavy once it is assembled. My daughter loved it! Glad we ordered it and a great price too! You will live it", 
    "I love this head board. I have received many compliments. I got the cream color. I gave a 4 star rating, because as others have stated, only a few of the nail heads are real, others are just for show. Overall, an excellent product for the price.", 
    "Great headboard! I was shopping around for a good wingback tufted style headboard and most started about about $$$-$$$, even for the most basic looking ones from places like ***** ******. We got the beige color of this since I like whites and warmer tones. It's perfected, and looks way more expensive than it was. They is a little manual labor involved, and you have to attach the sides but it wasn't a big deal to put the sides on and to attach to the bed frame. Great headboard and great price!", 
    "Easy to assemble and install! Perfect for my application, high quality!", 
    "A few nailheads were missing and it was difficult to put together since things didn't align ... Having said all that ~ Looks great!", 
    "The headboard works great in our guest bedroom. We had some issues with assembly because some of the screw wholes were done incorrectly so we has to do some retooling.", 
    "This item is just as pictured. Very sturdy and easy to assemble! Me and my husband love it!", 
    "I love my headboard, it makes my room look so elegant. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it. I didn't realize I would have to put it together, you know the wings are not attached you have to add them, ewwww, but it wasn't hard, and its great now. The headboard itself is wider/longer than my queen bed so its not attached. Plus, I couldn't figure out how to attach the blocks (I don't know the technical term) that fit onto the bed frame and then to the headboard. I got the deep grey color which kinda looks like denim but it's softer. I am sure I am not describing it correctly but, I really love the way it looks and its not bad to rest your head on while I am reading or watching tv, meaning it doesn't pull my hair out.", 
    "A beautiful accent in any bedroom...", 
    "We only cancelled this order because of the color choice. Good value for this quality piece.", 
    "This headboard is beautiful!! Shipped fast and easy assembly. My bedroom looks like it should be on TV!! Love it!!", 
    "Initial reaction, not what I expected. The Picture is not very clear. I thought it would be a flat light gray color, but turns out it has a grainy/lined texture look. After staring at it for a week, decided to keep it", 
    "We put this in our guest bedroom, so I don't have to look at it all of the time. At first glance, it's really chic and goes well with neutrals. But, if you look very closely, you'll notice that the nailhead or shiny buttons are not quite all lined up. Some stick out more than others. But, again, that's if you are looking at it and you have an eye for design. But, to a layman's eye, it looks just fine.", 
    "Appears taller in the picture than what it actually is but I absolutely love this headboard....gives my room a sleek hotel look. Great buy for the price.", 
    "Love it however the screws didn't fit for attaching to bed frame", 
    "As an interior designer, I am quite particular about quality. This is very well made and easily assembled. Nailheads are in perfect alignment as they are a strip applied in the seam. Looks really good though, not cheap. However, that being said, the dark gray is black. Much deeper than it appears on my monitor for sure. Truly a black linen with a hint of dark gray fibers. Beautiful, but does not appear gray as you walk into the room.", 
    "The headboard looks beautiful in person and much more expensive than it really is. Assembly was a little complicated due to some mistakes/mismeasurements in manufacturing but it all worked out. I'm very happy with my purchase. Although overstock customer service leaves much to be desired.", 
    "I did think it would be a little taller, but man it really makes a difference in the look of the room as a whole! Love it!!!", 
    "Inviting headboard. Comfortable and very nice looking!", 
    "every bit as beautiful as the picture and quality construction.", 
    "the headboard was put together by my handyman in about 15 minutes including unpacking time, so it must have been pretty simple. Allow more time to attach the headboard to the bed frame. the top right corner has a dark rusty looking stain but it is at the opposite end of my guest room so not too noticeable. The nail heads are super super shiny silver (kind of cheap looking actually) but for the price I can't complain too much. I would call the color more of an oatmeal than a beige....", 
    "Pictured a little different then in person, looks more like a midnight blue with grey in it. Shorter then expected but the studs caught my eye so I made it work with my room theme.", 
    "Great piece for a great price, I bought the darker gray because the lighter gray was on back order. I'm not disappointed. Fabric wraps around front and sides but back is a black panel that you Velcro to the back. Very easy to put together and looks great we've had it for 6 months now. Still looks like new, no fading.", 
    "I love the color and the details that it has each side. It makes it look glamorous.", 
    "We love it. It was a bit challenging to attach to the bed but I did it and it added an rich element to the room.", 
    "This headboard was at a wonderful price when I received it I was so pleased it look way more expensive than it was. It went great with my decor the matarial is great and it stand a little higher when you are sitting in the bed which is what i was looking for excellent buy", 
    "Great headboard for the money. It looks more expensive than the cost.", 
    "very classy, beautiful, quality piece", 
    "I absolutely love my headboard, I did not need any assistance with putting it together. It looks really nice and lux. I didn't think I would receive it so soon. Thanks Overstock \ud83d\ude0d", 
    "This headboard makes my bedroom look classy and \"adult\"!", 
    "NICE QUALITY; CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE!", 
    "This headboard is gorgeous for the price!", 
    "Amazing headboard. gave my bedroom that extra touch.", 
    "Makes my beach house look fab !! Easy to put together... LOVE LOVE LOVE", 
    "i ordered this in linen and am very please. it is a classy piece!", 
    "Great looking headboard. I bought the linen color and it is exactly as photo shows. Assembly was very easy. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "Easy to put together, good quality, great price!", 
    "Beautiful! Dark gray linen fabric is beautiful. Tufting is perfect. The wingback sides which go all the way to the floor are stunning. (The nail heads are done in a strip. Each fifth one is a real nail, the others are fake.) Definitely would recommend!", 
    "Nice piece. Great for guest room. As described only issue I have is I wished I would have noticed that it doesn't come with the \"rails\" as reflected in the pictures. It's just the h ad board. It does state in description that it's head board only but who actually reads that. You buy off the pictures. Other than that it's great", 
    "Once again Overstock shocked me with another great deal. The quality of this headboard is very good for the price. Per another review, the headboard also features a pattern of what looks like decorative nail heads along its trim. It is very hard to notice that the nails are actually glued on and only have a real nail every so often on the trim. Researched everywhere and could not find a deal like this with the price and quality offered. Cheers and rockets to Overstock for a good bargain!", 
    "Nice sturdy headboard my son helped me assemble it took us about an hour but it is a very nice item. I love it. Finishes off my bedroom w/style!", 
    "Totally worth it. The grey is A little on the dark side but very pretty...it matches pretty well with anything, and the price was excellent. I should've got this one first, but I thought I would try the more expensive inspire q Naples wing back button tufted upholstered headboard. I had to return that, it just didn't give me what I was looking for.....this did. I love it.", 
    "I liked the item but the nailhead trim could have been done a little straighter...", 
    "The design is wonderful. Yes, you can tell they are not individual nailheads, but they still look tasteful and don't take away from the over look. Installation was a little bit of a hassle since we were missing a couple of washers, but still took less than 20 minutes and fit our bed rails easily. Would definitely recommend and/or repurchase.", 
    "I really love the look of the headboard. It is exactly as described. However, my only complaint is that the holes didn't match up with my bed frame (which I assumed was \"standard\"). I am not sure if the problem lies within my bed frame or the headboard, but either way...the headboard is now raised a bit with old clothes which isn't ideal.", 
    "I could not wait to put this up!!!! It looks sssooooo good in my bedroom! All my Friends and Family Love IT Thank you Overstock !!!!", 
    "Arrived quickly and is even more beautiful than expected!! Surprisingly easy to put together in less than one hour. Very pleased.", 
    "Well appointed, sturdy, modern but yet stately. Used it in a guest bedroom with a chandelier, looks fab.", 
    "Great quality for an affordable price!", 
    "Very good quality and cute design.", 
    "Good heavy quality. Nice fabric.", 
    "Looks great,and was all put together. Only thing is, in some light looks a little on the dark blue side.", 
    "Easy to put together and install, very attractive headboard", 
    "The headboard was easy to set up. Good color", 
    "Item was better then what I expected. OnlyThing would be that the nail heads are not really embedded but rather a string of it. Still looks really nice and expensive", 
    "I am very pleased with this headboard. It looks modern and attached to my bed frame. I couldn't believe I could get an awesome headboard for this price.", 
    "Love Love Love it! Very easy to put together",
