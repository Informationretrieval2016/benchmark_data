    "Beautiful piece of furniture. Looks rich and is sturdy and perfect in my beach home. Looking to buy the tv cabinet to match.", 
    "Perfect for space saving..we used this in our baby's nursery and it's perfect since it is not too bulky. I have gotten many compliments on it", 
    "Very cheaply made. Looks good from a distance and will hold stuff but if you open the doors often and moce it too kuch, it will not hold up. One of the edges is loose (out of the box) so I'll need to super glue. Sad I wasted two hundred on this piece.", 
    "Poorly made. Very flimsy. Very difficult to put together. Very diss appointed and will not purchase another Kathy Ireland product.", 
    "We were looking for a matching bookcase for our office and this one fits perfectly. Also matches the desk and file cabinet we bought.", 
    "I thougth this was going to be a great bookshelf... the right side pannel was broken even thought it was securely packed... which meant it was broken from the manufacture. The building of this product is sketchy and not a secure product ... save your money...", 
    "These are beautiful books cases that look very rich -- they are the perfect size and look wonderful in our family room. The quality is great for the price."
