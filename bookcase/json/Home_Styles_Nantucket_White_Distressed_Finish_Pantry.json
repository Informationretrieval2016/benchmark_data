    "I am a vibrant woman, 73 yrs old and put this pantry together on my own. Directions were very easy to follow and I will enjoy this piece as it is of quality that I expected.", 
    "This piece works out perfect for my needs, it holds all my baking stuff with room in the bottom for my kitchen aid mixer and another larger kitchen appliance. It's great to have everything at your fingertips and the middle drawer is perfect for rolls of foil, plastic wrap etc. The distressing is obviously machine done, but the piece is nice and solid, I'm very pleased.", 
    "I ordered this because it was the perfect size for our laundry room while still adding a lot of storage space. I was a bit skeptical when I realized that I had to assemble it - it looked pretty overwhelming coming out of the box. But the assembly was really a breeze and the cabinet is very nice and quite solid. It took me about 2 hours to put together on my own - I assembled the bottom, put it in place; then I assembled the top and connected the two. No problem and I'm a very petite lady, so if I can do it you can too. I highly recommend it!", 
    "I loved this cabinet so much I ended up redoing my entire kitchen to match it! Putting this together was a cinch, but really requires 2 people because it is so heavy and tall. This is a quality piece of furniture with a distressed off-white finish and beautiful brushed nickle hardware and beadboard panels and crown molding. It hold a lot of stuff. The runners for the draw had to be adjusted slightly to get the drawer to close properly, but that was no big deal. I am a petite woman and put this together by myself, but needed help stacking the top on the bottom and moving it into the kitchen because it is heavy and tall. I am an interior designer and I am quite impressed with the quality of this piece. I highly recommend it.", 
    "Great product overall. There were a few missing drilled holes when we put it together, but it wasn't that big of a deal. The middle drawer catches when it is opened/closed. BUT other than that, it is a great product and looks great.", 
    "If you don't hate yourself, make sure you have someone around to help you put this together. It's nice that the pieces are carefully labelled and the instructions are very clear. It's just unwieldy sometimes. A couple other tips: keep something like a chopstick around to help you pop out the Cam Locks if they go in wrong (don't push them in all the way at first). When you get to steps 2 and 5 where you attach the Stretchers, Attach both H stretchers, then slide in one J Back Panel before you place the I Back Stretcher. It goes together the exact same way, it's just way easier (this will make sense when you have the directions).The four star rating is not because of the assembly quirks, however. It's because one of the darn cabinet doors pops open constantly. Don't have any idea how to correct that.", 
    "We needed extra storage in our utility room and this product fit the bill perfectly. It took my husband and me about two hours to assemble. This is only our second attempt at assembling anything. The instructions were very clear and easy for us to follow. We are very happy with the final product.", 
    "Love the way this cabinet looks in my kitchen! It was just what I was looking for. It has plenty of storage space for all my cereal boxes, school drinks, papers, and MUCH more! I couldn't be happier with the way it looks or the space. My only problem is the doors open wide and do not have stops on them like kitchen cabinets. We are just careful to hole the doors when we open them. Overall, nicely made.", 
    "I looked at this cabinet for several weeks before I finally ordered it. My husband put it together with no problem and actually pretty quickly. It is the perfect size for my kitchen and holds all of our food and paper products with ease. The white distressed color works nicely with my antique furniture and wood floors. I think the price I paid fits the quality - if we should move, this would go with us. It is a high quality product. Look around when purchasing this product, prices varied over $200. Overstock had the lowest price , no tax, and no shipping which made it the best deal.", 
    "We received the pantry in the expected time frame and everything was in the box; nothing was broken. We got it up and the only problem we had was that we could not get the doors to exactly align. This does not keep the doors from opening and closing, just a cosmetic issue. I was a bit disappointed with that aspect. However, in general I am pleased with the product. It is a nice looking pantry for the money.", 
    "I got this on sale. I like the overall look in my kitchen, not as white as the pic on the site though. If you like the antique look furniture, go for it! It will be much faster to get it together if you have a extra hand. Overall, I give it 4 stars because I am not really into distressed finish furniture. I guess I didn't pay an attention when I was ordering it. But I will keep it!", 
    "I purchased this item and was very disappointed when I received it. The door is warped and there are blue paintstrips on the doors and the front of the cabinet and the sides of the cabinet. When put together it looks very cheap. The top front door once it is shut does not open without force. Would return if it was not so much work. I will buy local the next time.", 
    "I love this pantry. It comes pre hooked so the top doors were not even. The middle drawer was s tad bit off. The bottom doors were not even. I had my handyman do some adjusting. I called overstock and asked them for 4 new doors and a drawer. This was before my handyman fixed it. I was surprised for how much money I spent that this cabinet had issues. They said we will send you a whole new cabinet. Take the doors and drawer out of it and send back the rest in 30 days or we will charge you. I loved the pantry so much I called and said can I buy this one to at a discount. They took $$$ off so now I have one in the kitchen and one in the dining room. Love them!", 
    "Looks just like the picture but thats about it. I've had this pantry for about 2 weeks now. Its good size but smaller than i thought. Very wobbly (most of the screws loosened after 2 days), doors are already loose, and the draw gets stuck. Wood seems pretty flimsy too. Definitely NOT worth the almost $$$ more like $$$. I would not buy this again and would not recommend it. You could probably build your own, bigger and with real solid wood for less.", 
    "I have been using this cabinet daily for over a year and it still stands up to constant use with no issues or signs of wear. Functional and a very nice looking piece of furniture.", 
    "It's an adequate cabinet. I expected a nicer cabinet. It is mostly MDF. It's pretty just not what I expected. certanky not an 800.00 cabinet.", 
    "The condo I recently moved to has no pantry and this piece is perfect. It was not difficult to assemble and holds what a closet pantry would hold. The drawers are quite handy. Have received several compliments on how well it matches the kitchen cabinets.", 
    "Rub marks, guess this is what they call distressed. Will need touch up paint, hope I can match.Base and top corner braces have no screws, brads with small glue strip. Two bottom corner braces fell off.Doors appear to be warped.", 
    "I had been waiting for this item to go on sale, as I had looked on it on multiple websites for the past couple of months. Finally I found the right price on Overstock. I was rather nervous to put this together, however, as I have a tendency to screw things up like this and it seemed like it would be rather complicated. I was surprised at how well-written the directions were; it took me 2 hours to put together. Some people have complained about the doors not fitting right, but I did not find that to be the case. The doors fit just fine and it is a nice, solid unit. I had looked at dozens of storage cabinets to use in my kitchen, but wanted something that looked decent without being thousands of dollars. This one fit the bill. My only complaint is the heavy chemical smell; since I'm putting food in there, I'm a little hesitant of putting anything other than canned food in there until the smell dissipates.", 
    "I just renovated my kitchen and lost some cabinet space. Cabinets and counter tops can be expensive to replace. I had to move my fridge to a new location and had the old space to fill, however did not want anything the size of the old fridge in its location. This pantry cabinet was perfect. It has wonderful looks and plenty of space! Very sturdy. I filled the old fridge space with something smaller and gained cabinet space. It is a win, win for me.", 
    "I read some of the critical reviews about this cabinet and was indeed surprised. This is a wonderful cabinet! It is very strong, has acommanding presence and holds a lot of stuff. When some people complain about it NOT being white, they should consider that the colorWHITE encompasses a wide range. Go to any paint store and you will see that there is NO single tone of white. This cabinettends to lean to a greenish tint of white however it is very pleasant! I'd purchase this piece again in a New York heart beat! And by the way,I am extremely critical about craftsmanship and this piece gets a 5 star rating!", 
    "We purchased this cabinet for extra storage in our beach cabana. After reading other reviews we were a little anxious about putting it together. My husband started to assemble the cabinet and found the instructions very easy to understand. Before I knew it I received a call to come down and fill it! The cabinet is very sturdy, attractive and perfect for our use! Free shipping on a 147lb was also a great deal.", 
    "We love this pantry and think it will last a long time. It is very well made and fairly easy to put together. one of the holes the Tamlock was to be screwed into had to be threaded as it had no threads but other than that it was fine. There was a bit of the paint rubbed off the top edge of the flag board above the draw, All the way around, Perhaps packed to tight and it wore the paint off. If you look quick you see it if not you do not. But the black marks are noticed, Other than that we love it and have put it to good use.", 
    "I read the description AND the reviews of this product. It is advertised as high quality wood. This is not the case. It is medium quality. I think I could have found something comparable for about ***. Paying over *** for this product makes me very upset. I regret purchasing it. Were it not already assembled, I would return it for a refund. Do not buy this unless they have it priced at *** or less. It is a cute pantry..but certainly not high-end.", 
    "We bought this for extra pantry space in our kitchen. This does require some patience in assembly- not hard just takes a while and you want to do it correctly. The finish on the outside is so pretty- picture doesn't do it justice. Very nice piece and get lots of compliments. The only reason i didn't give the quality excellent is b/c the bottom right door requires to lift it to be shut completely. no big deal but that is why. I also shopped this extensively online- same exact product and some websites were selling it close to $**** and overstock sold it to me for $*** plus I had a 10% off coupon and FREE SHIPPING!! I am very pleased with this cabinet and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a bit of additional pantry space!!", 
    "I love it! Looks great in my kitchen. Compliments my kitchen cabinets and hold so much stuff. I draw is big enough to hold placemats, kitchen towels and pot holders and it was a breeze to put together about an hour. I would recommend this panty to anyone who needs extra storage.", 
    "It is perfect for grocery items since my pantry is full.", 
    "I actually purchased two of these cupboards and they were exactly what I needed for my activity room. The quality and color were just as described. The directions for putting them together were easy to follow and all parts were included with both cupboards. I would highly recommend this cupboard.", 
    "Due to a small kitchen we decided to order this pantry. I have to say with a lot of searching we found this on overstock with a good price. It was very well packed, easy to put together, about 2 hours, and I feel it's of good quality. It really hold a lot. I am very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Ordered this cabinet for extra storage of food items, dry goods, etc. because our pantry was getting a little overloaded and disorganized. Cabinet has 2 adjustable 'feet' on the front which screw in and out to compensate for unleveled floor, or if you want to overcompensate and have the cabinet lean back toward a wall (minimizing the chance of falling forward, if say, a child were to try and climb up onto it). Comes in a LARGE delivery box which weighs ~140 lbs, so plan accordingly.. The \u0091antiquing\u0092 style is not very noticeable unless you are up close and can see that the off-white paint color on some of the edges has been rubbed off for an aged effect. Overall, the cabinet is very sturdy and an excellent buy for the price, was assembled in about 40 minutes (only required a screwdriver).", 
    "This was a snap to put together and looks great. Quality excellent, with the exception of one hairline crack running through one of the door panels. I will request a new one from the manufacturer.", 
    "We received two of the pantry's last week, and put them together over the weekend. The cabinets are very sturdy and attractive. The craftmanship was wonderful. It was easy to put together. It took about two hours to put one together. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.", 
    "It fits so well in the corner of what was once a nook -- I would love to get another one for the other corner -- the color is great -- & it serves its purpose so well. Yes, I highly recommend this cabinet. You can never have enough cabinet space.", 
    "Disappointed with this product. About an hour to assemble. The quality was far less than anticipated for the price. The pantry reminded me of something I could purchase at a discount store for half the price I paid. Would not recommend.", 
    "Did not take too long to assemble, great pantry for food.", 
    "These are not too time-consuming to put together, but nothing terribly complex. I would say it takes two people to do a good job. My daughter and I put two of them together in one evening. They are great for all the extra cans and kitchen things that my cabinets weren't holding. The distressed white is really attractive and I get lots of compliments on them!", 
    "EXCELLENT STORAGE IN THE KITCHENLOVE IT", 
    "Love, Love, Love!!! Placed on each side of TV, My buffet under the TV, Looks Beautiful. Its in dinning, family room. So I have room to place all the things out of the way for no clutter. Adds extra storage, and better price than I found anywhere. I am very happy with purchase!!!", 
    "We had no problems assembly the pantry. It took a couple hours but it was not difficult. It is sturdy and well made. I would recommend it.", 
    "Looks nice in our house. Has a antique white look to it. Sturdy and well built. Took me about 2 hours to assemble. Nothing too tricky.", 
    "My daughter and I were very proud of ourselves. We put this together in about two hours. It would have taken less time, but some of the holes the screws went into were very difficult to screw in. There should be more quality control when it comes to issues such as this. The cabinet looks great in the space I had designated it, and it fits a lot, so I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "Love this item and it was easy to put together. I wish there were more options for the height of the shelves", 
    "We have not put this together as of yet. It is going to be for our summer home in Maine. I am hoping all the pieces will be there when we finally get to open it. I have been looking at this for a long time on line and then saw it at a relatives house assembled i and loved it like I knew I would. Thank you overstock for selling such quality products at very reasonable prices.", 
    "The pantry is high quality construction and provides more space than anticipated. The flexible shelving is a real plus. We also purchased the matching island and the two pieces together really give our kitchen the 'wow' factor. Very pleased.", 
    "I bought this for extra storage in my kitchen in a 1920's beach house. It looks good. The box is about 200lbs. It was left at the bottom of my back porch stairs. My husband called over a neighbor to help get it in the house. Usually something this heavy would be packaged in 2 boxes. We just put it together. (and yes we are still speaking). 2 hours did it. My carpenter husband thought the quality was good and he is very fussy. The only thing he would ask for is Adjustable feet.", 
    "The assembled pantry is excellent at the price. The problems are (1) that it required assembly which I was unable to do. I had to have my son-in-law assemble it; (2) the shipped package was heavy and I had to open it on the porch and move the individual parts into the house; (3) there were some minor scratches at the bottom of the side\u2014probably caused by shipment.", 
    "great for oversize dishes, VERY ATTRACTIVE IN MY KITCHEN, fits beautifully in a small space.Was heavy to move. Box was very heavy.", 
    "The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the price. To be honest, this quality of this pantry is worth $*. The assembly instructions is very good and ALL the pieces are clearly labeled and they provided extra hardware, that's nice. It takes about 2 hours to assemble and 1 hour to unpack. Look out for the door hinges because my bottom left door keeps opening on it's own. Think about ordering different hinges to align up the doors better. Overall it's roomy and the center drawer is perfect for storing lids for tupperware dishes. Also, make sure you provide delivery instructions because they will just drop the package off at the end of your driveway. The package is heavy and I feel as though they should have be considerate and left it on my doorstep. Recommend unpacking it outside because their is a lot of packing debris that you will need to clean up. A good purchase, and good luck to all.......", 
    "The pantry was exactly as pictured. The quality was what I expected and it looks beautiful in my kitchen. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a well built cabinet. I LOVE IT!!!", 
    "this is a nice cabinet, easy to assemble and good quality...but after receiving the cabinet it is very over priced", 
    "Great luv it fits perfect in the kitchen an looks good", 
    "This cabinet is exactly what I have been looking for. Anything comparable, already put together, was twice the price of this. My husband assembled it in no time, and it was packaged perfectly. Good value, looks great.", 
    "Beautiful, well engineered and very functional. Looks far more expensive than it is!", 
    "This is well made, sturdy, and can hold a lot. It is not a bright white, but a very slight off weight and has a slight distressed finish, not really as dark as ivory. The bead board doors matched some pieces I already have. And my daughter and I put it together in about an hour and 15 minutes. The box is super heavy because it is not particle board, so you will need either a dolly or some help getting in inside (my UPS guy at least did put it inside my front door!). Even though it seems expensive, I bought a 15 inch, 67 inch similar cabinet for more than this cost, so for the size, it is a good buy.", 
    "We purchased this pantry for our home and it is great quality and is just as beautiful as pictured.", 
    "It took some time to put together, but the instructions were very well done. The quality of the piece is nice and sturdy.", 
    "Easy to put together. Looks great and pretty sturdy", 
    "A very strong and beautiful pantry, has lot of room. But has a very strong smell perhaps from the paint. It takes a long time for the smell to fade but it does not go away.", 
    "Very happy with how this pantry looks. My husband put it together in about an hour with no problems . Seems very sturdy. Love how it looks in my dining room!", 
    "Love it! Matches my cabinets almost exactly. My son had it put together in about an hour and he is in no way a carpenter! Fits perfectly in my mid size kitchen.", 
    "Great construction and easy to assemble. Great addition to our kitchen!", 
    "Beautiful Pantry that was so easy to assemble. Very nice and sturdy. Love it!", 
    "I moved into a house with no pantry! Bought this cabinet for next to my French door fridge and realized that if I turned it sideways, I could use TWO and they look like built-ins! These cabinets are well made; doors hang evenly and knobs are level. Thank goodness! Love them.", 
    "We love the look & durability of this piece of furniture! Highly recommend!", 
    "I love this pantry it really suits my needs", 
    "I absolutely love this. I needed some extra storage space in the kitchen. this is perfect. VERY EASY to put together! I put it together by myself - and I am a girly girl! No regrets!! It is very sturdy. It is pretty. makes a perfect pantry.", 
    "Worked out great in my kitchen sturdy piece of furniture wish u had a larger one", 
    "This is a beautiful and solid piece. It arrived well-packed, with clear, easy to understand instructions. I, a 58-yr-old woman, put it together by myself in less than 2 hrs with a Phillips head screwdriver. It fits perfectly next to my stove, replacing my messy baker's rack, and looks great!", 
    "A bit hard to assemble, but sturdy and great.", 
    "Not heavily distressed, but looks lovely. Easily put together by my handy husband.", 
    "It was love at first sight! The pantry cabinet is easy to assemble. It looks great and provides ample storage space.", 
    "Nice cabinet. Using it for a linen/medicine closet. A little wobbly. Took a while to put together.", 
    "Beautiful, easy to put together, and exactly as described! Great product!", 
    "We bought this for our kitchen that currently does not have a pantry. This works perfect for extra space for food storage. It is well built, sturdy and very nice in design. The price was great in comparison to other sites/stores as well.", 
    "Super easy to put together and it fits everything so well.", 
    "Looks great in my kitchen ! Doesn't take up too much space and adds to the character of the room. I'm using it to store spices, kitchen appliances and even a large Costco aluminum foil roll which can be used without pulling out of the cabinet. Not hard to put together but take pieces out a few at a time for ease of moving to its final place. Worth every dime !", 
    "Matched kitchen cupboards and very sturdy.", 
    "Beautiful cabinet, VERY well made! I LOVE it and have received many compliments on it. Great storage! Would definitely recommend!", 
    "Very happy with this pantry. No trouble assembling and finished product works as expected.", 
    "Looks great, has a small footprint, important for our small kitchen/living room.My wife and I put it together in two hours. All the pieces were there. Fit and finish were fine. Almost doubles the storage in our small kitchen that has limited cabinet space. It's important to actually study all the instructions, and follow them closely, agreeing with your helper on what it's telling you. Lay out the various pieces. I don't recommend using a battery driver/drill, unless it has an electric brake, and you can control it. Otherwise, you may strip or damage some parts. To get the door \"reveals\" to be even, I had to shim the two front corners with different layer of felt pads. That's not the fault of the product, just needed to compensate for flooring that was a bit uneven. Very satisfied. Just wish the matching rolling kitchen island in white would come back in stock. We would recommend this to others.", 
    "We love this cabinet - put in our bathroom to store towels, etc. Tons of room - well made!", 
    "Great quality for the price. Very durable and spacious enough to hold many pantry items. Excellent storage system for a kitchen lacking a built in pantry.", 
    "Just the right size for the kitchen dishes and silverware. Takes time to construct.", 
    "Was able to clear all the items off my kitchen counters and store in this cabinet. Well made and easy assembly!", 
    "love it. easy to put together", 
    "Great way to declutter counter tops very satisfied", 
    "The box for this cabinet came a little damaged which made me worry but it was packaged great. Every piece of wood was individually wrapped in foam so nothing was touching in the box. While there were a lot of pieces, this cabinet was surprisingly easy to put together and I had it put together in about an hour. It looks a lot more expensive than it was and I've received lots of compliments on it.", 
    "I bought 2. One for my bathroom and one for my kitchen. I have a storage problem and these have held up wonderfully. Even in moisture in the bathroom. LOVE THEM!!!!!", 
    "Great piece. Beautiful and practical. Contains lots of storage room and is nicely made. I have really enjoyed this pantry, and it fits perfectly with my antique, & shabby chic decor. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "This solved all of my food storage issues in the kitchen of the older condo I am renting. And when I move it will still be useful for so many thing. Looks good, not too big and not too small. Sturdy and was easy to put together by myself.", 
    "We bought this for an extra pantry and we love it! Well made, nice size and really cute!", 
    "While not 'heirloom quality', it is GOOD quality for the price. Def takes two to put together, but is not a difficult assembly. Wish it was in white and not antique, but I can always paint!", 
    "We've recently downsized into a much smaller home, and the bathroom didn't come with a closet. I knew that this would be the perfect solution for that problem. It was easy to assemble. Instructions are perfectly clear and all parts were available. I had one issue with a door not wanting to stay closed, and after a call to the company, they shipped me a new one immediately and it now closes perfectly. If I had the space, I would purchase another, it's a great cabinet and fits all our linen closet needs.", 
    "Very easy to assemble and the cabinet is very nice and quite solid. If you're looking for extra space storage I highly recommend this product.", 
    "The color is actually more cream than white. The doors do not always close perfectly the first time that you close them. Other than that, one of the best purchases ever. Ive actually considered buying another one for office supplies.", 
    "good item easy assembly works well in our mobile home for space and looks great...", 
    "Easy to put together. Looks awesome in my apartment. Doors are snug and drawer opens and closes with ease. I have a beach themed place and it fits right in. Also bought matching buffet with hutch.", 
    "Looks great; feels strong and sturdy; very easy assembly", 
    "I love the pantry. It is perfect in every way. I love it.", 
    "Great quality. Solid piece. Took a while to assemble because I did it by myself, but was still pretty easy.", 
    "We were surprised at the quality of this cabinet. We bought it t store towels in a summer rental. It has plenty of storage room and it looks great.", 
    "This cabinet was purchased for a cottage with little storage availability. It holds all of our food and linens in the drawer. It was fairly easy to assemble. The doors line up well. Only time will tell about its durability but so far I am very pleased with the purchase", 
    "Great for any of your storage needs and loved the distressed white look very nice for about any room.", 
    "Love this! Exactly like as shown. Highly recommend", 
    "Always hard to chance a purchase like this on the internet, but we were impressed with the quality. It was exactly what we needed for kitchen storage in a small home.", 
    "Exactly as I hoped it would be.", 
    "Beautifully engineered and masterfully fitted, this diy kit turns into a well built storage pantry. One thing you need to know before buying is Nantucket white is not white. It is a pale shade of minty green.", 
    "I don't normally post reviews but had to make an exception in this case. We ordered this pantry, but didn't open the box until some time had passed due to remodeling projects. Despite being well packed, we discovered one of the panels was defective and panicked. Customer service was fantastic and we had a replacement panel in seven days. Some of the instructions were a bit vague, but my husband was able to get the whole thing together in about 6 hours. The pantry is very solidly built, well designed and looks beautiful in our dining area. We are very pleased.", 
    "I have limited cupboard space and no pantry in my kitchen. I bought this and it has been wonderful. It holds a lot of items and has made my kitchen a lot more organized. It wasn't difficult to put together, but it is heavy, so it is helpful to have a second person to help with the upper cabinets.", 
    "This cabinet fits perfectly in the corner that I bought it for. It was easy to assemble,and looks great. The only problem I have with this or the island is the odor. I guess it is the paint, but when I open them the odor just hits me.", 
    "I ordered to use as towel cabinet. Received next day! Box was huge. When I opened was overwhelmed with all the peaces but...with the instruction it was easier to put together. It took about 2 hours for me. Was no missing tools or screws even was couple extra. Only one bottom door was not closed well. I contact the customer service and was resolved quich. Another way all peaces came well packed and not damaged. Very happy with my purchase. The same pantry on ********* is ***. Here it's the best price for this pantry.", 
    "Love this product, easy to put together, and holds everything well. Lots of room for different things. Looks great in our Kitchen! A must have!", 
    "This pantry is gorgeous. I bought 2, one for each side of a window. They arrived very fast, 2 or 3 days after ordering. The boxes they came in were HEAVY! I'm a very unfit older woman and I had to unload them where they were dropped off as I couldn't budge them. Each piece was wrapped in foam and the box was lined with Styrofoam so even tho there was a defect in the outer box, there was no damage to any of the pieces. Best packing job I've seen. The directions for putting it together were easy to follow. I did them both in an evening all by myself. It required a screw driver. I recommend having a good Phillips head as the back and drawer have screws. The one I have was not good so that was the hardest part. All the doors close well. Its not a bright white color, I would describe it almost as a cream color. There is the expected smell of paint that has lingered but its not bad. Once the weather is better I'll open the windows and air them out.The shelves are deep enough for 12 or 13 inch boxes, which is what I was looking for. The top of the unit is recessed about an inch and a half so to set stuff on top I used some of the Styrofoam that came in the box and now put things on top and can't tell it wasn't flat across.Overall I'm very happy with these pieces of furniture. I have no negative comments.", 
    "This is a very well made piece of furniture. The distressed finish is lovely. It's a great addition to my kitchen/dining area since my house was built without a pantry.", 
    "I saw this pantry online but dreaded assembly of it. Searched local furniture stores where along with not finding exactly what I wanted, prices were at least $*** more than what I paid overstock.com for it. It went together very easily. It fits my kitchen/dining area d\u00e9cor perfectly. The drawer glides smoothly, and the magnetic door closures are very strong. The only reason I rated it a '4' rather than a '5' is because a few back panels are manufactured material rather than wood. I knew that going into the purchase; just personal preference that it'd be 100% wood. I am very satisfied with this, my first overstock.com purchase.", 
    "This pantry was exactly what I had expected. It was fairly easy to assemble, and the wood is sturdy enough to hold heavier items. I like that it's just slightly distressed, and it isn't a shocking bright white.", 
    "Another great product we overstock.com samurai fast in tack and solid wood which was extremely happy about not cheap MDF cardboard but this was solid wood grain to sign", 
    "Another great product we overstock.com samurai fast in tack and solid wood which was extremely happy about not cheap MDF cardboard but this was solid wood grain to sign", 
    "We are so happy with this piece and we've had countless compliments from friends and family. Lacking storage space, this was the perfect solution. Had an initial issue with the hinges; contacted the manufacturer and two replacement parts later, we're in good shape. Rather simple to build; I'd say 2-3 hours. Please know that it is not truly white.", 
    "love this used it for a linen cabinet in my bathroom much cheaper here than homedepot just wish it had so close doors", 
    "This pantry is the perfect size for our new ADU and went together very easily, as some of it was pre-assembled. We have already received many compliments on it. It is very sturdy and stylish!", 
    "We put it together in less than an hour and looks great! Great pantry for the price!", 
    "Easy assembly instructions. Very nice look. Does not look cheap. Excellent packing to prevent damage (mechanical and water/rain).", 
    "I really enjoy how this cabinet turned out. I was looking for something to hold towels, cleaning supplies and other bathroom items. I didn't want an 'over the toilet' hutch and shelves wouldn't have been sufficient. But there's a huge storage space between my bathroom and living and I knew it would be perfect for a linen cabinet. I just needed to find the right one. This cabinet is it! My items arrived without incident or damage. I make a point of laying out and verifying all parts and pieces of hardware on anything I have to assemble. Everything I needed was there. Instructions recommend 2 people but I was able to do it by myself. I admit to working on it over several days because I'm still unpacking. But I also took the time to apply Gorilla wood glue and Gorilla Super Glue as an added step. This isn't the kind of thing I want to have to keep 'tightening up' over the coming months or years. Which is typical of so many 'needs assembly' furniture items. And the glue just adds that extra assurance and security that parts and pieces stay tight and connected.You definitely want to take the time to make sure the base is leveled. I'm in an apartment so imperfections in the floor are to be expected. There are screws on the feet of the base that can be adjusted. Take your time and make sure it's leveled front to back and side to side. If you've got that set and secure....anything you add on top will also be level. At 71 inches tall...it's a great height for me as well. I didn't want anything that was so tall that I'd need a step stool every time I wanted to put something on top of it. My interior is grey & white so the color works. But it would have been nice to have other color options.....even if it's 'Nantucket' style. A pale or sky blue perhaps. Just something other than white. I would also like to find different hardware for the doors and drawer. What they have works but a pop of color somewhere is ideal for me. That's proving a little difficult because the provided knobs come with a detached screw that you insert into the knob...and most knobs on the market have the screw built in and you secure it with a bolt from the back.Other than that....I'm thrilled with this piece overall. It took me a long time to find just the right cabinet.....right height, right size , right look, right price. And ordering online is always a risk. I'm glad I took the leap on this one.", 
    "While I like the style of this piece of furniture, it was not worth the $*** that I paid for it. I bought it as a replacement for a pantry that I don't have in my new home. It was smaller than it appeared online even though I did know the measurements of it. It 's something could probably get at I**A for half the price of the quality of materials and sturdiness of this product.. I'm disappointed in it but I can't possibly take it apart and sending it back some how. I guess that's what you risk buying stuff like this online. I will use it and hopefully get my money's worth out of it for a few years years fingers crossed.", 
    "Made really well , the quality is top notch. Very easy to assemble , the instructions are fully detailed . Fully satisfied with this purchase.The pantry holds all my canned goods , cereals and dry goods. I'm so pleased with this purchase . A beautiful piece of furniture.", 
    "I had a builtin pantry removed to make room for a washer/dryer. This pantry is just what I need. Very attractive and plenty of room. I am 80 years old and assembled it by myself. I took it out of the package and carried it in piece by piece because it is heavy. Follow the instructions and it is easy to assembly. I called Nantucket a couple of ties when I had a questions and the service reps were helpful and courteous.", 
    "This piece looks even better in person than it does in the pictures - a rarity with lower-end furniture. The knobs and cup pulls are a beautiful dark pewter and have some really nice detailing that doesn't show well in the pictures. The actual color of the piece is a pleasant ivory with very nicely done dark gray antiquing. It really looks like a handmade piece, not something that arrived in pieces. Speaking of the pieces, it was easy to put together and the instructions were easy to follow. It looks like a piece you'd find a a high-end store for a LOT more money.", 
    "This cabinet isn't as heavy as I would have liked, but it serves the purpose it was purchased for. It was easily assembled and only took about a half hour. All pieces fit perfectly together. I like it.", 
    "Very good quality, I just love it. More than I expected", 
    "For the price it is a pretty good deal. I shopped comparable items at some \"high end /more trendy\" furniture places and this is half the cost. Just be aware whoever is building it should have some skills. It came in a hundred different pieces and took my husband a long time to put together (probably 4 + hours) and he was super frustrated the entire time.This one is a creamy white, nice finish... If you are buying other Nantucket items..... be aware that the colors may not match.", 
    "My house is 125 years old, and the original pantry is now my laundry room - so this pantry makes an attractive substitute. It holds a lot and you can adjust its feet to safely accommodate any slope in the floor (which is a common issue for older homes). The distress that's added to it is a factory job, but you will probably be the only person to notice it. It really is a nice piece - you won't regret this purchase!", 
    "Seems to be well maid and easy instructions to put together.", 
    "LOVE this cabinet. It is exactly what I was looking forward. Good-looking, functional and high quality. My husband was able to put it together himself in about an hour. Very please with this purchase.", 
    "This was very easy to assemble, and it really looks great, I use it as a Linen Closet in my bathroom. I would say to anyone considering this that it is really worth the price, and honestly was the easiest piece of furniture that I ever assembled.", 
    "I did not have a lot of storage space or even a pantry the house I live in is very old and it was moved from where it was built and put on to a basement. So,I order this to fix the whole storage shortage and it has more room for storage. I don't have any complaints and it was even mark so,it could be put together easily.", 
    "This is a nice piece. My college-age daughter assembled it in two hours. She laid out all the pieces to mirror the diagram included. This allowed her to take inventory of the pieces and easily locate the piece needed at the the appropriate time. She occasionally needed my help to balance a piece so that it would easily line up and fit together. .", 
    "Needed extra storage in kitchen. Color and style looked to be at least close to my kitchen table/chairs. Delivery was one day early (surprised me!) and it was NOT shipped freight, but UPS, who left it at my door.Assembly was straightforward. Excellent instructions, and all the parts (the hardware) are CLEARLY labeled and bagged separately within the \"hardware packet\"--no having to try to figure out \"is this the short woodscrew or the long one?\" as you sort through a bag of parts all thrown together like many other \"assemble it yourself\" furniture seems to do.Two of the cams were a little fussy, but it went together with no colorful language needed. It's strong, sturdy, leveled perfectly and drawer and all doors hung exactly as they were intended.Visually the color was almost identical to the above mentioned table, so it looks like it is part of a set--which delights me a great deal--that's more than I was expecting. The color is not true white, sort of an aged white, and the piece is described as \"distressed\" so it had the obligatory \"wear\" marks on some edges.If I needed another one, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Very pleased.", 
    "I ordered this pantry for my newly decorated laundry room. It looks beautiful and really spruces up the area. It took us right at two hours to put it together. My husband followed behind and tightened everything up. The pantry was extremely well packed and arrived in perfect condition. We were also very pleasantly surprised to see that each piece was labeled. It isn't quite as white as I thought it would be but I'm still thrilled with it.", 
    "This pantry arrived in a timely manner and was not damaged in any way. My husband, who is extremely picky, put it together in about two hours and had nothing but good things to say about it. I am very pleased with the looks of it (just like the picture). It is roomier than I thought it would be. Overall, it seems to be a good quality piece of furniture. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "One of the doors is not perfectly aligned but it's not noticeable on an everyday use basis. Easy to assemble. The top of the cabinet has metal inserts like it could be used on the bottom. If so you could put wheels on it to make it easier to move around. Basically it's a great buy and does exactly what it was supposed to do for my needs - storage in a heavy duty attractive cabinet.", 
    "The cabinet looks awesome! It was easy to put together. Took me 1 hour and 15min. It longer to unpack, count all the peices, and clean up the packaging than to put it together. I would highly recommend this cabinet.", 
    "Bought 3 pantries. Love how they look. Excellent quality", 
    "Materials are good but smell like a rotten lemon or citrus of your choice. It isn't white which was a bad fit for my kitchen. To try to return this monster would be an insurmountable project so it is here. Stuck with it. Thank you Overstock for telling me the thing was white when it isn't!", 
    "This kitchen pantry was easy to put together, I did it by myself. I have it in my kitchen and it looks really nice. There is plenty of space to store food and whatever else needs to go into a kitchen pantry.", 
    "Decent pantry for the money. Looks nice in kitchen and provides ample storage for items I removed from an under-counter cabinet to install a dishwasher in our winter home. The drawer does not fit flush on one side and none of the adjustments I tried corrected that. Other than that, I'm pretty much satisfied with this purchase. Overstock had the best price for this product at the time I bought it (although **** now has it at a lower price).", 
    "I love this. It is just what I needed and it looks beautiful in my kitchen!", 
    "Since recently downsizing, I needed a small pantry and this fit the ticket. It took me about two hours to put it together. The instructions were clear and easy to follow, but there are quite a lot of pieces. I was glad I had a lot of room to spread them all out. Once assembled, it doesn't take up a lot of room and while it isn't a huge pantry, it serves its purpose quite well and it is good looking, too.", 
    "This cabinet is made of quality solid materials. It has heavy adjustable shelves and holds a lot of heavy cans, etc. Fits in a small space and it has a quality look. It was shipped in a very well padded container and was easier to assemble than it first appeared.", 
    "It was easy to put together, and was just what was advertised on the site. It looks beautiful in my kitchen as extra pantry space, but could also be used in a lovely bedroom as an armoir. Am super pleased with this purchase, and this item keeps me coming back to Overstock.", 
    "When I saw it I was very unhappy about the size and the terrible paint job. But putting it together wasn't that difficult, all the pieces were there, and I do like the product now that it's in use in my home.", 
    "This is a great little pantry. It's very attractive and can hold a fair amount. I do however feel that it is overpriced. The quality is good, but not $$$ dollars good.", 
    "Looks nice, seems sturdy enough. Wouldn't mind it it was a little bigger.", 
    "This is an excellent cabinet for my kitchen. Use it as a pantry. Holds all myfood. Love it. Very pretty and built well.", 
    "Looks great. I wish it wasn't made out of MDF (particle board). That makes it really heavy. One other bad thing - the doors don't line up because they are not exactly the same size, and the hinges don't fit perfectly when you assemble it. For the kind of money this thing cost, it should be just about perfect.", 
    "Love this Pantry,so roomy and it was easy to put together,I would recommend this to anyone ,it was for my kitchen how relived am I,put my food in it and had room for my bakeware. love It", 
    "It took about 2 hours to setup. Once fully assembled, it seems sturdy and well worth the price. Have no reservations recommending this one!", 
    "Assembly took about 4 hours. It looks great as a kitchen pantry. Plenty of space.", 
    "Assembly was easy but did take a while as there are a multitude of parts. As I recall it took a couple of hours. Everything lined up square and it sits well with no issue on the door alignment.", 
    "Exactly what we needed! Fairly easy to put together and holds quite a bit. A super bargain for a well-made nice looking piece!", 
    "Great cabinet for our storage needs, however it takes a while to assemble but worth it.", 
    "I love it. The box was delivered to my door and it was well packaged. I but the cabinet together within three hours. I must say it love it . I placed the cabinet in my kitchen for cereals and soda. I love the distress wood. Wow u can not go wrong in purchasing this product.", 
    "Wife assembled unit... Easy assembly......", 
    "Perfect. Exactly what I expected. Great quality and wonderful price!!!", 
    "Pantry arrived at specified time. Was left on my doorstep so took some maneuvering to get it into the house. Box was a little banged up, but no damage to the parts. Good instructions, put it together myself in just over 2 hours. Looks exactly as pictured. Magnets are very strong on the doors and the drawer catches most of the time, but love the additional storage I now have.", 
    "We received it fast ! Easy instructions to follow and put it together with very little or no problems at all !"
