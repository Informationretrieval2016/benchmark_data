    "I am recently widowed and a senior citizen. I donated a number of large items no longer needed including our old two pedestal large dining table. I read the reviews from everyone and decided I could put this together. The UPS delivery person did not knock on my door but left these two boxes right up against the open out door. I could barely get the door open and then trying to get them in was almost impossible, but I managed. Realizing the weight of these I decided I would need to hire someone to put it together. After attempts that failed and tired of seeing these boxes in my dining room, I tackled the chore head on. Instructions were very clear and I did it! It is absolutely charming and just the right size. I love it!", 
    "Nice quality table that was easy to assemble. One \"foot\" had a large crack in it, but was functional as a temporary support. The manufacturer sent me a replacement foot very quickly. The wood top matches my hardwood floors and the size fits perfectly in my breakfast nook. I sit at this table everyday and enjoy my coffee while reading the newspaper.", 
    "Would recommend to someone with a smaller kitchen. It really is too small for mine,but the wood is beautiful and the table is well made", 
    "The black finish with the dark distressed wood top makes a lovely combination. The table was easy to put together, but was packaged so securely it was difficult to remove the parts from the packaging. The size is perfect for a smaller kitchen space. I love the style.", 
    "Easy to assemble, very sturdy and looks beautiful. Glad I bought it.I would recommend anyone to buy.", 
    "I am so happy with my table. Perfect size, color, style. Reading all the reviews was very helpful to know what color to expect and the quality. All were right on. The only problem I had may have been my fault. I laid a cloth on the floor so I could lay the table top upside down to assemble it. A staple from the box apparently came out and was under the table top without my realizing it and scratched to top. I was ultimately able to find a wood marker to cover the scratch. So warning to new purchaser to make sure no staples are box staples loosen and fall under the table top.", 
    "great table, love the color, very stable", 
    "The table top matched my chairs perfectly. It is a smaller size round top, but seats four very nicely. Excellent for my small dining area. I love it.", 
    "This table is JUST what I've been searching for! Have been using it now for 2 weeks --- it's in my kitchen and I use the table every day for breakfast and reading the paper. It blends perfectly with my remodeled kitchen's off-white cabinets and wood flooring.", 
    "The top is much lighter than shown in the picture. Otherwise the table is beautiful.", 
    "Good quality, well made, easy to assemble, can seat up to four, highly recommended, very please with order.", 
    "Absolutely live this table. Easy to put together and quality is outstanding!", 
    "excellent table for my breakfast nook! good quality and package", 
    "The top is made of wood. However, the beveled or slated edge of the table is made of faux wood. You can see its not high quality wood.", 
    "Exactly what I wanted. Super easy to assemble.", 
    "Was very disappointed in the wood top. Looks cheap.", 
    "This is a well-made, quality wooden table. It is slightly smaller than I expected, but it actually goes really for the space we have. The aged wood top give it rich ambiance, but not intimidating. I am so glad I ordered it!", 
    "Super easy to assemble - great directions; very sturdy; looks beautiful!", 
    "I am very happy with this table. I bought it for my kitchen and it is better than I expected. It shipped promptly, is well made, and was assembled easily by my husband and I. I would definitely recommend this table for anyone who needs a sturdy and cute kitchen table for four, Oh, and the table can be leveled because there are screw adjustments on the bottom of the feet; very helpful for those of us who live in old houses.", 
    "I am well satisfied with this table, it meets all of my expectations. Looks great, is sturdy and well priced.",

    "We wanted to mix our breakfast table look up with this adorable table and industrial metal chairs. Paired well and looks great!", 
    "I got this table with the black base and it's a great table. Easy to wipe down (I have kids so that's important to me), the distressing is minimal so food and stuff doesn't get stuck in any grooves or anything. It's a sturdy table and great quality, especially for the amazing price on this table. I've had this table for a year and half with two kids and it still looks great.", 
    "Love this table! Looks just like the picture and super easy to put together!",

    "This table came very well packaged and in great condition. It was very easy to assemble and so far I am loving it!", 
    "Lovely, fits our small kitchen perfectly.", 
    "I ordered the white table for my kitchen and love it. The paperwork included, which described the table and how it was made, told of an unbelievable pride in their work. And, they were right.....their work is excellent and this is an exceptional table. Later, I ordered another table, in black, and used it in my small dining room. I love them both. I don't know which one I love better, because they are both so beautiful and so well made.", 
    "I love this little table. It is the perfect size for a small apartment we have renovated. Generally, I don't care much for the 'distressed' look, but this is very subtle and looks welcoming as well as quaint! I will be putting a custom cut glass top on it because Iike the rich brown stain so much that I never want it to get scratched. So happy I ordered this. I've been looking at it for months:)", 
    "This table was the perfect choice for my kitchen. The color was accurate to the picture. The top is a warm, rich, brown. The white antiqued legs & base also very nice. The piece is heavy & looks expensive. I added my own upholstered chairs, not the ones featured in the set. Only issue was in the delivery, I received the legs & no table top. Overstock looked into the problem immediately & the second piece came within 24 hrs. Excellent customer service. Very happy with this purchase & would highly recommend it.", 
    "Using this as a table in my large bedroom. Looks beautiful along with two upholstered chairs. Thank you for the safe and prompt delivery!", 
    "I love this table! Perfect size. Great addition to our small dining room. Well made great buy! Easy to put together. My son put it together in no time. It's heavy I couldn't lift it but he could. Great find and buy!!", 
    "Just as advertised. Very pleased with quality.", 
    "I can't believe the great price. I looked for a pedestal table for a long time. This is very well made and would cost much more some place else.", 
    "Really good value for the price. Looks great, assembly was easy.", 
    "Charming table perfect for two or four people. It was easy to assemble, with clear instructions. Although larger than I anticipated, it is still the perfect size and shape for my tiny dining/sun room. Well crafted with superb material, it is a welcome addition to the home.", 
    "Good quality easy to assemble", 
    "Easy to put together, looks very good", 
    "This table is the perfect size for my kitchen. The top of the table is just beautiful. Now I need chairs to match!", 
    "Great sturdy kitchen table. Came with slight chip on side , but decided to keep it. Fairly easy to assemble..(black and cherry combo)", 
    "I love this table. Affordable and very nice workmanship.", 
    "Love love love this table",

    "very nice table except for the fact it is not solid wood as advertised but is composite.", 
    "Everything we were looking for at the right price", 
    "We bought this table to replace a bigger table when we staged our house to sell. It fit the space perfectly and looked great. Excellent quality, sturdy.", 
    "this table is just the right size for my kitchen dinette, looks awesome and is built with quality.", 
    "I like the look of the black base table. It is sturdy & easy to put together. I bought four of the cherry hybrid chairs with faux black leather seats to go with. It looks good in my Kitchen with oak hardwood floors.", 
    "Looks good but I wish I had purchased higher quality.", 
    "Quick delivery,table as pictured. Easy assembly! What more could you ask for!!!", 
    "Table base is very sturdy. Only complaint is that table top isn't solid wood but laminate. A few chips around the edges. Scratches easily. Hoping that will just add character to the piece!", 
    "Perfect for a breakfast nook for two.", 
    "Went together well looks good. The top has some distressed places which I could have lived without but they are fine.", 
    "love the table durable and good quality", 
    "The table was of a better quality than I expected. I used Annie Sloan chalk paint on the base to give a more weathered look to the white parts, turned out fantastic!", 
    "Wanted a table for a small area and this fits perfect. Price was very good, and quality better than expected. This is the 3rd item I have purchased from Overstock. com, and was happy with every one. Items were always packed very well and arrived undamaged, in a speedy manner. Simple assembly and looks great.Thank you", 
    "This piece is beautifully made with a solid base and the curved legs make it look so elegant. It serves as both a smaller dining table in our kitchen area and coverts beautifully to a bar set-up when we have guests over. I absolutely love this table.", 
    "This table is a very good looking table. Loved it when it came out of the box. The only problem is the first night of using it marks were left on the table where our plates were. I'm not sure if it was because of the hot food or something else. Just beware of this problem. Easy to put together too.", 
    "Great. The wood and white painted area have some weathering which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but I thought both would be sold colors and not weathered here and there.", 
    "Beautiful Country French Table...very easy to assemble! I would have given it 5 stars except for the rim of the wooden top had a small knick that appeared white. I was puzzled since I thought the top was solid wood. Upon further inspection I realized the top of the table is solid wood but the rim is painted synthetic material that is painted to look like wood! I was able to paint over the spot where the paint had chipped off and it's perfect! In spite of that, I highly recommend purchasing this table!", 
    "This table is awesome. I have had many people ask me where I got it. And a great price!", 
    "Although the table is nice, the first table top arrived damaged. So much that I couldn't live with it. However customer service arranged for a new top after requesting pictures. A bit of a hassle.", 
    "Got this on sale, under $$$, with free shipping. I put it with four *********** ********* chairs and it spiffs it up quite a bit. A friend asked if it was vintage. The one problem is that the brown comes off on the top edge pretty easily revealing a white surface underneath. Not sure what this is made out of... :)", 
    "The table arrived with missing hardware. We made it work anyway and it looks great.", 
    "This table is very cute and well made. It's heavy and substantial. I love it and have gotten many compliments. I would definitely recommend it!", 
    "Very good quality. Only down mark would be that the picture shows the brown top as being a little darker than it actually is.", 
    "We have been looking for a new breakfast nook table for a long time. While exploring the internet, we came across the Overstock website that had this table. It was exactly what we wanted and the price for excellent. Plus, delivery was extremely fast and efficient .", 
    "So happy with this purchase. Easy to assemble and exactly what I was looking for in our kitchen. The table top color was a little lighter than I though it was but it still looks great in the space! Would definitely recommend!", 
    "I would have given 5 stars but wood had some dots in the center of the table..which I have covered with centerpiece..but imperfect wood top.", 
    "Used in a banquette in a small area. Great idea", 
    "The table is exactly as pictured. It arrived within a few days and was fairly easy to assemble. I bought it for my sun porch and it looks wonderful!", 
    "Love the distressed look of this table. Also purchased the Drake creme leather bench to go with it. Daughter loves the look!", 
    "keeping it even with nick in side of table (during shipping) since it is 'distressed' but will need to purchase a stain pen to cover it. ...still looks great...put together pretty fast and looks great in a smaller kitchen.", 
    "This is a very heavy and well made table! I found it very easy and quick to assemble (61 year old female). There is only one issue for me and that is the stain on the top is not uniform and a lighter than the pic. I will sand and restrain if this is something I can't live with. I would not hesitate to purchase this table.", 
    "This table arrived to me with a discolored spot on it. frustrating when you expect brand new furniture!!!", 
    "Love the way this looks in my kitchen. For the price it is a very nice table and of good size for a table of four to eat on.", 
    "Easy to put together with a strong helper. Very heavy!", 
    "As I wrote a review on the chairs and table. WE LOVE THEM!!!", 
    "When I received the table I was very happy. The picture was very accurate as to the product that I received. The piece is sturdy and solid. The color was slightly different than depicted. The wait was kind of yellowish. It looked is if there was a screw that was tightened too much in the initial construction of this table because it appeared as if the tip of the screw head slightly pushed from the bottom and upward and made a slight indentation on the top but not enough for me to send it back. We simply backed the screw out a bit and I am Living with it. There is a slight tomorrow on the outer edge of the table top as well. I have to say these are slight imperfections and I adore the table. I had a banker re built in the corner of my kitchen in the slides in perfect! And finishes the look off that I was looking for.", 
    "This is a beautiful table. It arrived quickly and the assembly was easy. The hardest, most time consuming part was getting it out of the box. But that also means it was packaged well. Exactly as described. I'm definitely pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I was really surprised at the quality of this table. It looks like it should cost mush more. The color is a soft white/cream, and the top is a medium brown. Just what I was looking for at a price better than expected!", 
    "The kitchen set was nicer than expected. Well made and very attractive. Fits so well in our Kitchen.", 
    "Sturdy and very pretty in the kitchen. Would buy again.", 
    "Great value for the price",

    "Very easy to put together. ..", 
    "This was a great buy, perfect for the space I needed it for and very easy to put together. Delivery was much faster than expected, had in just a few days.", 
    "I really like this table.It fits my small dinning area and the look goes with my end tables.Liked it so much I ordered chairs and a buffet to go with it.", 
    "Solid quality and representation", 
    "I wasn't sure I could put this together by myself(66 yr.old widow) but I did it in about 45 minutes. Perfect instructions,easy to follow and everything fit just right! I had a small dining space and this was ideal. Very good quality also! No scrapes ,dents or damage.",

    "Absolutely love this table, matches my chairs and looks so good in my French Country Inspired Kitchen. The perfect size with 4 cushioned chairs! Definitely a real value for the prize, solid table.", 
    "This table is excellent, sturdy construction and attractive. All parts to assemble we're in the 2 boxes, easy assembly. It took a while to pull out the staples in the bottom of the top of the table where they packed the legs and support. I used needle nose pliers. Once done, smooth sailing!", 
    "Pleased with the table overall. It's just the right size for a small dining area and 4 chairs fit nicely around it. The price was great. The only reason for the 4 stars was the \"wood\" finish on the top. It's too light for my taste. It looks darker it the pictures.", 
    "This is a lovely table. Perfect for four people. Bought the French Countryside dining chairs to pair with it and the whole set looks high end. Very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Assembly easy and quick. love the table!", 
    "This table is exactly what I was looking for. It is lightly distressed and is a very heavy, substantial table. It is very easy to assemble and came with all the correct assembly hardward, too. It gave the dining room the look I was aiming for - elegantly casual.", 
    "Very nice table. Looks more expensive than it is.", 
    "L O V E this table...fits perfectly in my small kitchen and is a classy item. Was surprised at the fast delivery and prompt response to my problem...badly damaged package. I was resent the item and it came in quickly and in good shape. I will order from this company again. Many tks.", 
    "I would recommend this dinning table to anyone; it is beautiful, very well made, and a great price! It arrived in 2 boxes and was easy to put together. I am very pleased with my purchase!", 
    "I bought this table for the dining area in my apartment. Very easy to put together (can't say the same for the matching chairs which I had to buy on another site). The color of the wood on top is a bit lighter in person than how it appears online - just be aware of that if you are trying to match it to other pieces.", 
    "The table was easy to assemble and looks lovely. There was one small area on the tabletop that has no stain/ varnish finish , but I am hoping to cover this defect with a matching stain.", 
    "The table fits perfectly in my breakfast room. It is well made and quite substantial. The assembly was easy.", 
    "I had no idea what \"rubber\" wood was but I will say this table works for me. It's stronger than pressed board and looks great in my dining area. I too thought the table top color would be a darker wood color, it's more like a Minwax color of Early American. Still, I like the shape and size and glad I went ahead and purchased. No children or people who may be harder on the furniture so I can't speak to the long term durability.", 
    "This table is well constructed and easy to put together. The finish and style are beautiful. It appears to be very sturdy.", 
    "This is a very sturdy well built table. As such it's a great value. I was surprised at the ease of assembly and the overall quality given the price. The finish is not as weathered/distressed as I would have liked", 
    "This table is awesome. Great detail with color. It was shipped without any damages and it was easy to put together. I recommend this table for any small space. Looks great.", 
    "I just love this table. I had another round table that was just beautiful but it was just too big for my dining area. I saw this one and ordered it and was very happy with the quality and how easy it was to put together. It is just perfect for 2 to 4 people and the finish is beautiful.", 
    "The table arrived promptly & in good condition. It was a bit too heavy for me to handle it alone. But, my son had no trouble assembling it.I love the size & the color of the table top. It is perfect for 2 or 3 people.Thank you Overstock for your prompt delivery service !Kay, California", 
    "The table works well for us. We wanted more space in the area, so this is smaller than the previous table. The top has a few distress marks in it and in one spot small holes but they don't detract from the tables style or use. All in all we are very pleased with our purchase.", 
    "I was able to bring the boxes inside on my own, though the table top box is a bit large and heavy (I'm only 5' tall). When I opened the base, it was cracked at the top and I was unable to put the nut on the screw that was sticking out due to thread damage. I called Home Style (the number is on the box) and they sent a replacement base immediately. I called Thursday or Friday and got the new one on Tuesday. Once I had a good base, putting it together was easy. I think the hardest part was removing the staples and straps from the table top (they stored the legs, hardware, and mounting square under the table top). It is exactly what I wanted and fits into my cottage-ish decor perfectly! A great table for the price!", 
    "This table is a bit smaller but still seats 4 comfortably. For a single or couple it's ideal.", 
    "This is a very nice table, very sturdy, impressive base. I ordered the black with the oak top, which is nice as the top doesn't show every finger print that a solid black top would have. Good price and value. It was well packaged and arrived quickly.", 
    "Love this table! Fits perfect in our living/dining area with four chairs around it. Very easy to put together without any major tools. My only gripe is (as someone previously mentioned), the packaging had industrial staples to the bottom of the table top that were almost impossible to get out.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Very cute table for our small space.", 
    "This is a durable well build round table that accommodates 4 chairs easily. I like the finish too. It is sturdy one too", 
    "Love the table for the price. Easy to assemble BUT they used heavy duty staples in thick cardboard on the underside of table for packing purposes and you had to damage the wood to remove. Not smart. Otherwise definitely recommend.", 
    "This table is very good east to put to gather . We are very happy with them and we are going to order two the net few days..", 
    "Chose the black/brown option. The construction is solid, and the table was quite easy to assemble. Beautifully enhances one\"s decor. So delighted with this purchase. Could certainly be a heirloom."
