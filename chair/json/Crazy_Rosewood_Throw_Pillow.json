    "I bought an ivory coverlet from Overstock and our bed needed some color. This pillow is perfect as it has many colors in it. Background is ivory but you can pull out the sage green( colors of our walls) or even the reddish rust tones. I got one 16x16 for for the bed and the lumbar roll for the chair. I probably could have gone a bit bigger for the bed but this works. All in all, just what I wanted!", 
    "These pillows are understated elegance.", 
    "Looks great! Have gotten a lot of compliments.", 
    "Very comfortable and pretty. Colors are true to photos. Nice quality brocade fabric. I selected the lumbar and just love it.", 
    "good quality. nice compliment to our decor", 
    "Well made pillows. Fabric is rich and durable. Colors are vibrant like shown on OS website.", 
    "Very nice pillow and well constructed. Wish it was bigger.", 
    "I bought the rectangular ones and they are great support for lower back and look great on my sofa. A little more rust in design than I thought. Wanted more burgundy but still love them!", 
    "I ordered the 18x18 but received the rectangular pillow. There was a warning that the pillow was low in stock but not out of stock. I would have returned it but it is an absolutely gorgeous pillow and I just wish that they had the 18x18.", 
    "Loved the pillows, matched with another set that I had pretty well!", 
    "great pricing, awesome print on pillow, quick shipping & made in the USA", 
    "I ordered 4 pillows for my new couch and loveseat. The colors are exactly as pictured and match perfectly. They are soft to touch and cuddle well too. Love them!"
