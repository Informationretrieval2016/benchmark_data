    "I really like the cabinet. It is perfect for what I needed it for. My only complaint is that the holes for the glass shelf supports do not line up the way they should which causes the shelves to be off balance a little. It is still functional though and after having painted it and mounting it wasn't worth making a fuss over.", 
    "very good instructions, excellent packing, nice wood, class purchase", 
    "Great small cabinet. Mounded it in between studs in my bathroom. Looks wonderful and holds a lot.", 
    "I needed a cabinet that would fit behind my bathroom door as my bathroom is very small. I had clutter on my vanity and this cabinet really did the trick. I like that I could stain it to match my woodwork. I plan on purchasing another like it and put it into the wall between the studs over the comode."
