    "Nice and sturdy, doesn't even look like a folding chair.", 
    "Very sturdy & comfortable", 
    "Nice, comfortable chairs. They do not fold very flat so storage was an issue but I'm not planning on folding them up. I use them at our vacation home in our small eating area and they are perfect. Will order more.", 
    "For the price and good for small spaces", 
    "I use them all over the house. I also got some with red seats. Very nice. They are extra seating to have on hand that you can put away when you don't want it. Quite sturdy and easy to fold and unfold.", 
    "Very comfortable, high quality, much better than a metal folding chair."
