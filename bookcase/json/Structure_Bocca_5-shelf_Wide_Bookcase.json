    "instructions were terrible and it was not that easy to put together. The back was very flimsy and makes it look cheap.", 
    "These are gorgeous, priced well and not cheap \"sullivan\" type furniture. Very heavy, you can anchor to the wall but almost not even necessary. Had some hiccups with being shipped duplicate parts in place of the needed parts from the manufacturer in the original sets (swapped an additional box B for a box C), but they replaced it nearly immediately. The wood grain is very believable and again, this is not an embarrassingly cheap looking set in any way. Love it, we bought several and two different sizes."
