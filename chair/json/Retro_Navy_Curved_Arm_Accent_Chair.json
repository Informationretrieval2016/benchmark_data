    "We purchased this accent chair for our bedroom and it's perfect for the space! Easy to assemble (just attach the legs). Very soft fabric. No complaints!", 
    "I purchased two of these for my living room. Assembly was very easy. Both have a little wobble I can't determine if it is my floor or uneven legs. Nothing a little felt adhesives can't cover though. Overall very happy. Beautiful rich color and soft fabric. Gave my drab room some color.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful! I bought two of them and really love them. The only negative thing I have to say is they are not very comfortable unless you have a nice pillow on them. But they truly are beautiful", 
    "I bought 2 chairs to go into our home office and I have to say I am very pleased. With the wrap around back makes these chairs cozy and very comfortable to sit in. The navy blue is true to color on the screen. I can see I will be spending a lot of time in here chatting with my husband while he works!", 
    "Not as sturdy as I would have liked, but it worked for what I needed it to.", 
    "the deep navy blue is gorgeous. it's sturdy and was super easy to put together.", 
    "Looks good in our retro family room. Fairly comfortable for a very reasonable price.", 
    "This chair is wonderful, well priced and presents well.", 
    "This chair is so gorgeous! The navy is very rich and striking! I am so happy with my purchase. I'm glad I purchased two. They are stunning in my living room! Very sleek!", 
    "I love these chairs they give my space a modern feel. The only downside is the chairs are short but they work great for my space. I purchased 2 of them."
