    "This cabinet was just perfect for behind my door in bedroom. I used it for spare medicines,odds and ends, cookbooks, and house and garden books, and miscellaneous items. It works just perfectly as a small bookcase and place to store items that can be hidden from view. The drawer is great for keeping coupons and correspondence . It serves as a filing cabinet and a closed bookcase. This would have been very difficult to find in a furniture store. Thank you Overstock for carrying just the right piece and providing measurements to insure the right fit.", 
    "***** furniture is better than this. This thing makes Ikea furniture look like Restoration Hardware quality. The laminate was peeling off the sides as soon as we took it out of the box! My husband put it together, he is quite handy and quite the perfectionist. When put together, it leans forward a good 1.5\" inches -- we have to trim down the back legs just to make this piece of garbage level. It's beyond rickety. I didn't have very high expectations for $*** and I know just shoes are going in here... but I definitely expected a little better than this.", 
    "For the quality of the wood, the price is a little high. The answer in the Q&A says it should fit 25-30 shoes but it definitely does not. Unless you are putting in kids shoes. I wear men's 9-9.5 and other shoes include women's sizes 6-9. We could only fit 3 and a half pairs on each shelf. That means17.5 pairs of shoes.", 
    "Just smaller than I hoped. Not great for high heels", 
    "Looks like plastic but does the job.", 
    "We are happy with this product! It did take a around 1-1/2 to put together while watching TV, but the product went together nice and looks great! Very happy with it.", 
    "not good quality wood, but it stores a lot of shoes", 
    "Though I like the height and overall style of this cabinet, I was very disappointed in the quality of the materials used in construction as well as a few noticeable scratches. I realize this isn't supposed to be a high-end piece of furniture but I didn't expect it to have scratches on it when it arrived. My hubby, who is very handy, said it was a hot mess to put together so I hate to take it apart and send it back for another one :( It's going in my new office bathroom to store toiletries so it's not like it'll be a focal point in a living room...if that is however, what a shopper is looking for, I'd say keep looking.", 
    "My husband put together & said its not for beginners. Very difficult to put together. Looks good but it is cheaply made. It was also not level so one leg has to have a piece of card board underneath it", 
    "nice place to \"hide\" all my shoes. i could fit 40 pair. I'm going to get three to hold most of my shoes. they look much nicer than the shelves i had holding the shoes.", 
    "It serves its purpose. Obviously it's not solid wood, but for particle board furniture it's pretty sturdy. Each of our shelves holds either 3 pairs of adult shoes, 2 pairs of adult shoes and 2 pairs of flip-flops, or 3 pairs of kid shoes and a pair of kid flip-flops. It cleared up our entryway just the way I wanted.", 
    "This shoe cabinet was everything I expected it fit perfectly in the area I wanted it to be. Everyone that comes into my house comments on it.", 
    "Luckily my husband put this together for me as assembly was required. The wood is very dark brown (just as pictured.) So far we are very happy with the quality of the piece (we've only had it a few weeks.) Pleasantly surprised by this nice piece of furniture at a very good price. Wish it came in a lighter brown.", 
    "Nice looking chest but too hard to put together!", 
    "Too big for my space, but was ok", 
    "Almost like a jigsaw puzzle to put together. I gave up and returned it.", 
    "Great item, it meet expectations. A bit difficult to put together . Instructions was not precised. End product beautiful.", 
    "I like how the cabinet looks. The materials are pretty inexpensive, and the piece is stabilized by the back which is quite flimsy. So far (about 2 weeks) the cabinet has held up fine, and it has my young daughters' art supplies in it. I appreciate being able to close the doors!", 
    "The quality of this pice is just ok. It's a pain to assemble and the instructions are lacking information. However, if you're slightly savvy you'll figure it out. It took a few adjustments to make the doors line up together and straight. Also the drawer sticks when closing sometimes. However once it's put together it looks pretty good and will work! Plus the price was right!", 
    "The cabinet is true to color and is a fairly nice size. It is rather weak though. I use it to store linen so nothing very heavy but I will probably only move it when necessary because its very flimsy. If you're not using this often and it wont take any daily abuse, it should last for a few years.", 
    "Exactly what I hoped it was!", 
    "I bought this for my foyer, not so much for my shoes. I put it together and agree with other reviewers that the assembly instructions leave much to be desired. After putting it together, I'm happy with the classic look but the drawer keeps sticking and needs some jiggling to get it back on track and the cabinet doors need adjusting to ensure their proper alignment. Am happy for the price and it is pretty.", 
    "It is a beautiful cabinet and quite functional. We had to put it together but it wasn't difficult. The directions were clear and understandable. We're very happy with the cabinet. A good deal!", 
    "The instructions were horrible! There were little to none instructions just a few pictures! It took us about 2 hours to put it together! It shouldn't of been that long!", 
    "Piece looks just like picture and was easy to put together.", 
    "the quality of the this piece was not what I was looking for. I returned the item.", 
    "Love, love, love the detail and look of this piece of furniture. It is heavy, solid, and the color is deep and rich. My higher heels fit in the top shelf. the other shelves are shorter, but accommodate medium heels well. Total number of shoes in the piece 26 dress shoes and 5 pair of flip flops stacked sideways! I ordered a second I love it so much! Takes some focus in putting it together, and two peeps are best. Me - wine glass in hand - watching husband and keeping quiet. I organized the pieces and interpreted the instruction. Husband - thankful I was occupied - had it put together in about 20 mins.", 
    "Great but difficult to put together!", 
    "Nice piece of furniture but quality not so great, assembly was easy but quality of item made the assembly difficult.", 
    "I love this item... I bought 2", 
    "This was a great item and was perfect for storing shoes, but I saw the same exact item for half the price on another site.", 
    "Assembly went well, bit I was missing one of the screws which made it a pain till I found another. The legs were completely uneven, but a couple felt pads solved the problem. The cabinets smell like some type of packing material and did take 2 weeks to dissipate.One the bright side, they look fantastic in the space and easily hold my size 11 shoes. You won't get the max number of shoes they say, but easily hold enough for our mud room. We also lined the shelves and the drawer with a colorful liner to brighten things up.", 
    "Product arrived on time, undamaged, and with detail assembly instructions. I needed a stylish and spacious cabinet for my shoes and this cabinet was exactly as described. I fit 4 (size 9) shoes per shelf. I recommend this product.", 
    "I knew I wasn't getting the greatest quality, but real wood was also double the price. This cabinet is however highly functional and will just require that you put it together carefully (my 5 year old and I did it together)!! It looks nice, fits lots of shoes and I can now keep matches together. I am so. Happy I got this. Wish I had it a year ago.", 
    "I love it because it looks very nice. However the product is made out of cheep pressed wood and it smells from the shoes inside, I had to make a hole to keep the air flow. over all pretty nice.", 
    "Poor instruction, poor package, had chips on the product, luckily the chips on back side. Until now, the cabinet still had bad smell from paint or chemical ( I bought it at 6/19/13). I was very disappointed, I don't know what should I do about it."
