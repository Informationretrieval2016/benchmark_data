    "Good but delicate to handle", 
    "I was a bit disappointed in the quality of this - it's made of cheap materials but that's on me for not reading the product details (all mdf). It looks fine but not sure how long it will last.", 
    "I love this! Shelves are very sturdy and it's a good size for a small nook. Very practical and the wood looks nice.", 
    "Well built for what it's designed for. Doors close well, shelves easily hold shoes and other small items. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Easy to install. Quickly shipped. Looks great", 
    "The unit looks good and holds about 12 pairs of shoes. Much needed in our foyer! The construction quality is decent, with that back panel being kinda hokey and not fitting perfectly. The doors are slightly misaligned with one another, but it's not noticeable unless you stare at it. All in all, we're very happy with it.", 
    "Works well for storage. I think you can store anything in it and it would work well.", 
    "It was easy to install and really nice looking. Goes with the modern look we have going on in the house. Would recommend it.", 
    "I was surprised how sturdy this cabinet is. I'm actually using it to put a fish tank on it and to store random things. If you are using it for shoes, I would say sneakers and flats is all that would fit in there as the shelf height is only a few inches.", 
    "Not a bad shoe cabinet for the price. Took me about 2 hours to assemble. Still standing a month later so can't complain. It looks really nice once assembled. Very sleek and modern design."
