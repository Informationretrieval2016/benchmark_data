    "Love this sofa. It only took about 20 minutes to put together by myself. Glad this is made here in the states, big reason I purchased. Great price. Took one star off because it is not up to heavy abuse i.e. jumping around on but we don't have kids so it suits our use just fine. Hope to get many years out of this sofa.", 
    "Fabric is quite nice - kind of a bronzy chenille (remember Captain and Chenille?...oh wait that was Tenille :) Arrived in one box - super easy to assemble with NO TOOLS - seriously. I thought - I don't know about a sofa that has to be put together and arrives in one box that doesn't look large enough to hold a sofa...but once assembled, this sofa is a thing of beauty! Keeping it real, this is more for a \"light duty\" application. With the super low price point, it's not built to withstand an on-cushion wrestling match or a sleeping spot for three 150 lb dogs - just sayin. I have two people in the household, so it will be perfect. This totally exceeded my expectations!", 
    "I really like the over all look of the couch. It goes with my living room well. The only thing I would say, which was said in the other reviews I read, is that it is not the sturdiest of couches. Very comfortable. The sad thing for me is that I haven't even had it a month and the metal slot on one of the arms, that the back slides into, had broken out of the wood and fabric. :( However, I will be contacting customer service to hopefully get that part replaced.", 
    "I ordered this sofa on my tablet because it showed the color to be just what I wanted. It showed the sofa to be a earthy beige with a little charcoal color in the mix. A few days later I showed my daughter the sofa from my home computer but it then showed the color to be a bone white color with a little charcoal. Not what I wanted so I called to cancel the order. Too late, it had already shipped. The good new is that it arrived yesterday and the color is most definitely an earthy beige. I love this sofa. It's beautiful. Easy to put together. It does have reversible seat cushions and back cushions. Paid no shipping. AWESOME DEAL!!!", 
    "Our sofa is everything we wanted it to be....We love it", 
    "The sofa arrived promptly and in great shape. Looks just like the picture. It's not my favorite color pattern, but I'm pleased overall. No complaints here.", 
    "Ordered 2 sofas, came in boxes easy to snap together and very strong and durable, color is a nice tone, I recommend this to others.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Would give 5 stars but the zipper on one of the back cushions parted while I was fluffing the cushion. Was able to carefully rezip.", 
    "Great for the price (under 450). Good looking, comfortable. My family really likes it.", 
    "This couch looks great (the pictures on the site do it justice!) and is very comfortable. It was my first \"adult\" purchase, in that it was the first thing I bought for my new apartment that I don't plan to trade for something better in the coming years. I couldn't have chosen a better couch!", 
    "Very lightweight sofa. It ships in four major components and when assembled, the overall construction is not sturdy when it comes together, particularly the sofa seatbox and the arm rest. It's okay for short-term use.", 
    "Sofa is very nice, soft and comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "I bought both the sofa and loveseat and I am very happy with my purchase. I searched far and wide for the nicest looking couch in this price range and I think this is the one. It was extremely easy to put together. Each couch only took me 15 minutes by myself and all the pieces fit together perfectly, it seems to have been very precisely constructed. They are both very comfortable and they don't look or feel like cheap couches (which they are). Shipping was fast, they both showed up in 3 days. I am very happy with the purchase.", 
    "Excellent product. Easy assembly and looks great. Most important to me is that it is made in America. Best Regards", 
    "The fabric is beautiful, soft, and comfortable. The seats are very thick and slightly firm which tells me that this sofa is going to last. I have had sofas that the seats are so soft within a matter of a month they are nearly thin as paper (slight over exaggeration but, they loose all body and just become a pocket rather than a seat). I usually purchase sofas with a firm yet giving seat because they tend to last. The back pillows and the accent pillows are quite soft and comfy. I was very surprised at the ease of assembly and how sturdy a sofa in a box can actually be. I was able to put it together by myself in about 20 minutes the longest time I spent doing anything was removing the packaging and wrapping. This sofa is a great buy for the price and my husband and dogs love it which is a plus!", 
    "Easy to assemble and comfortable. Not a high end but great for the money.", 
    "I love this couch. it is of extremely high quality and is very deep. It is so comfortable.", 
    "I realize you get what you pay for but this furniture is poor quality with a pretty wrapper. Could have found a comparable couch at Target."
