    "Just what I was looking for, a basic nice looking sofa! Great sofa for the price! It matches my living room perfectly, it's a beautiful olive green. Very happy with my purchase!", 
    "Went together well and the only problem was it needed to be picked up at UPS", 
    "This couch was delivered very quickly and was so easy to assemble. A++!", 
    "First couch ordered went missing for 5 days then was shipped back without being delivered because it was so damaged. This box arrived in terrible condition, torn, patched and barely held together with tape in many places but surprisingly the couch was fine. Went together very easily and is firm but comfortable. Nice material, looks more brown than green but quite attractive.", 
    "Appears to be comprised of sturdy materials. Glad that there are no springs to break or wear out. Nice color and fabric. Density of foam cushions seems to be of good quality. Pretty simple to put together, but took some time."
