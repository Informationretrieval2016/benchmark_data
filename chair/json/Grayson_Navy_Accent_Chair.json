    "For what I needed, its perfect, especially for the price. The material is nice, the cushion is comfy.", 
    "This chair is very nice. The color is fantastic and it is a great mid century reproduction. Only drawback is that the cushion is not reversible. It has Velcro on the bottom making it impossible to flip in order to keep the cushion shape longer.", 
    "I am very happy with this chair. Beautiful, comfortable, nice quality, easy to assemble. It's even more comfortable with low ottoman. Looks great in my living room.", 
    "Wonderful style, fabric is beautiful in texture and color, and super comfortable. Con: upholsterer should have left the chair's inside back's fabric a tiny bit less stretched so the fabric could lay a touch more flat against the frame. Great chair!", 
    "Very comfortable to sit in. Legs are sturdy but the chair has a slight wobble. It's a very light chair, so if you're on slick floors, I suggest getting rubber grippers for it.", 
    "Super cool, very sturdy - looks great in my family room. Kids love it too!", 
    "Love these chairs. Super easy to assemble. Comfortable and stylish.", 
    "Nice addition to my living room. Very comfortable. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Comfy for the type of chair it is. It was something that someone else returned and was clear that then they sent it to us. A little disappointed about that."
