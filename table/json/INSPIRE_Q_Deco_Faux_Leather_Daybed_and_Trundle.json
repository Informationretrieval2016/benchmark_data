    "First, let me say I am a veteran Overstock furniture buyer with A LOT of experience purchasing and putting together furniture. The back of this daybed is actually only a bar with a large open gap above the mattress where the wall shows through. Imagine a bench with only a top support bar across the back anchoring the two arms not like a sofa back as the photo appears. We had to re-build the back with a board to seal up the hole. The photo is very deceptive they covered up the gap with pillows. Virtually every drill hole for assembly was improperly drilled at an angel or in a way that the holes do not line up with the supplied brackets - luckily my husband and brother are cabinet makers and had the skills to rebuild and re-align the whole thing or it would have been neither safe nor sturdy enough to handle any use. There are other reviews reflecting the fact that this daybed did not stand up to use; now that we have assembled it I can understand why. If you do not have the skills to re-engineer and reinforce this daybed I can not imagine how it could possibly withstand any regular use. Additionally, multiple washers and screws for assembly were left out - again, we were experienced enough to compensate with our own materials. Now that it is assembled it looks ok and my son loves it, but considering it has no back and we had to re-engineer the whole thing it was definitely not worth what was paid.", 
    "My husband put this together easily and with NO problems. We've had the bed in my 14yr old sons room for aprox 6 weeks. He is a docile kid who only sleeps and plays video games in his room. He loves the look of the bed but it is already falling apart. When you sit on it it sways like one of the screws are loose or broken. This wasn't that inexpensive to only last a few weeks.", 
    "The overall look of this is great. However, the first time it was sent to me, instructions and pieces were missing. They did fix this immediately though. After a few times sitting on it (I'm 120 pounds), the slats broke. I am glad I didn't let my 200 pound father sleep on this. Very unsafe!", 
    "The only thing I would mention is that the trundle part of this day bed is sort of freestanding, so if you don't have it against a wall and you push the trundle under it will go past the back of the bed. This could be easily solved though with a couple of nails and some scrap wood. but if you have it against a wall it is a very nice piece.It looks great and for the money is very good quality. Of course up have to put it together - if you do this sort of thing often it won't take you long - maybe an hour or so. My nanny did it by herself in less than 60 min. :)", 
    "I searched around for awhile and was not able to find anything as nice as this daybed within this price range. It was easy to put together which was great- as a women I managed without help. It is a big piece of furniture but very attractive. I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "We were looking for a day bed for overnight guests, but didn't want something too frilly or too obviously a bed, since it's located in a room that doubles as an office. This was an excellent choice. It arrived quickly, and was not too difficult to assemble. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "Bed is solid and looks nice ...except the back support should come down to meet the seating/mattress...very cheesy way for the manufacture to save money", 
    "I am so glad that I purchased this trundle bed. Upon delivery, boxes were heavy, but not so much that I couldn't pull them into my house on my own. Assembly was reasonable. I am pleasantly surprised with how easy it is to pull out the lower bed. Although I am using it as a guest bed, it seems solid enough for daily use.", 
    "I was looking for a daybed that functioned as a sofa in a multi purpose room. This daybed is now my home office sofa and will work well for our daughter when she is home from college and the room becomes her bedroom. It is a bit high for a sofa, but is manageable. The trundle is great for an extra guest. It assembled quite easily and is sturdy. The vinyl does not look cheap as the color is dark and rich. One caution. Be sure to use the right length of screw. The first one I put in was too long (my own error) and it tore through the vinyl. Luckily it was a back piece which is against my wall. I quickly learned my lesson (to read the instructions more carefully) and the rest was quite easy to assemble. It took me a while to find the right piece of furniture for my purposes and I definitely am not disappointed!", 
    "Very happy with my purchase. I read reviews for anything I buy and this was no exception. I am adding another positive review for this item. Packaging was good, delivery was quick and assembly was a breeze for my husband and I. I purchased this for our 10yr old who was wanted to give his room and big boy makeover. He wanted a full size bed but his room is small and it would have overwhelmed the space so we compromised on this twin bed with pull out trundle. We liked the couch look and the modern, masculine look of it. It's definitely a piece that is sure to grow with him. The trundle wheels in and out smoothly on our thick carpet. We just have a twin air mattress on the trundle since its only used when he has a sleepover and that works just fine. If I ever replace his current mattress, I will put his old one on the trundle. I would definitely recommend this bed to a friend. Its well made, looks great and has totally transformed my sons bedroom. Thanks Overstock for the best price and shipping around.", 
    "This daybed is a winner! It feels sturdy and looks great. I am very pleased with wood slat design - superior over a spring platform (more comfortable and no squeaks). The faux-leather (vinyl) is perfect for our household - it's durable, cleans easily, and softer than a wood framed bed. The daybed was delivered earlier than expected. It took over an hour for me to put it together by myself, but that was expected based on other reviews. Assembly was straight-forward. I purchased 2 good quality 10\" inch mattresses at XXXXXX for both the bed and the trundle. Yes, a 10\" mattress does fit in the trundle, but it is a very tight fit. There is no room for bedding on the trundle with the 10\" mattress, but that's fine for us as we only keep a fitted sheet on the trundle mattress. My daughter sleeps on the bed every night. I've slept on both the bed and the trundle and had a great night's sleep in both cases. We pull the trundle out almost daily and it glides effortlessly on our carpet. I am so pleased with the ease of use, the overall look, and the value of this bed. The only thing that I'm not crazy about is that the back of the daybed does not go all the way down to the mattress platform, so there is a \"window\" along the back of the daybed just above the mattress. After shopping around at local furniture stores for daybeds and seeing poor quality beds at prices much higher than the cost of this daybed, I am definitely a very satisfied customer!!", 
    "Really poor quality but attractive once \"fixed.\" I needed to hire a good carpenter to replace the flimsy slats and to reposition the trundle casters with 1\" blocks because the trundle was too high with mattress to be pulled out.", 
    "Not impressed with the quality. It was cheaply built and is not sturdy at all.", 
    "The bed came in 3 boxes, we unpacked the first one with the side panels and immediately noticed that the bed was black. It actually looks pretty dark on the website, but we usually don't rely on the website pictures. We compared the color with anything black and dark brown we could find in the house taking flash and non flash photos along the way. In some pictures it could be seen that the black of the bed was a bit warmer than black of some other items, but it was black nevertheless. Much darker that the furniture form IKEA in color that they call \"Brown-Black\". The quality of the panel was so-so, the core didn't feel particularly solid, and in one spot we could feel a staple underneath the vinyl. We didn't unpack anything else, so I can't comment on the quality of the whole bed. We decided to ship it back, and overstock customer service was great with arrangements.", 
    "This is a great piece of furniture. It is used daily in my daughter's room and she loves it. Works great for company and doesn't take up very much room. She loves it!!!", 
    "The bed is fine and assembly was very easy. The only issue i had with is that I did not plan on putting it against a wall. My intention was to have 2 facing each other to serve as sofas and beds when necessary as I don't like pull out sofas to sleep on. The back of the bed is not finished and is VERY unattractive. Bottom line is if you plan on putting it against a wall you will be fine but that is really your only option.", 
    "It's just like the picture, easy to setup and great for guest room/office.", 
    "good..........................................", 
    "Love this bed, my daughter has used it so many times for sleep overs and it looks like a couch", 
    "Looks good, put together easy", 
    "I got this bed for my sons room. It looks great and allows for extra room. Trundle rolls out with ease. Putting it together was a breeze as well.", 
    "Beautiful, guest room worthy for sturdiness.", 
    "I've had it for 4 years and it holds up great.. looks very nice and modern", 
    "Bigger than I was expecting, very pleasantly surprised.Very sturdy and nice looking", 
    "It was missing half of the instructions. When I contacted the customer service department for assistance they couldn't help me in obtaining another assembly manual. I don't think I would want to buy any more items from Overstock if there customers service rep are not knowledgeable to assist with simple emailing of an assembly manual/instructions. Needless to say I had to search google to try to find the instructions as best as I could. Hence the reason they are receiving 2 stars for Poor Customer Service.", 
    "This bed is perfect for a small space and has a a chic upscale appearance.", 
    "love & was very easy to put together and if you buy the right size mattress you will not have a problem with the gap, I purchased my mattress after the bed was assembled to measure the height", 
    "Purchased for my niece, she loves it. Looks great when bed is made.", 
    "Best product I could've purchased. Priced well. Very comfortable.", 
    "11 year old daughter LOVES this bed. It definitely has gaps between the twin mattress and the bed frame. I put a 2\"foam topper on her mattress to bridge that gap. Also, a piece to put together the bed was missing when we received it, but Overstock sent the piece.", 
    "Looks elegant. Perfect addition to our basement", 
    "This bed was better than expected. It was originally purchased to be a guest bed until it became an unexpected Tenant's permanent bed and she loves it.", 
    "We purchased this bed for a 6 year old girl. We've had this bed for a little over 3 months; within 1 month the front support broke after she sat on her bed to put her shoes on leaving the bed unsupported and unable to sleep in. This wasn't a cheap purchase, but was cheaply made. Wouldn't recommend.", 
    "I like it. The color is perfect. I use it as a couch/over-sized chair in the media room...perfect for me.", 
    "We only have positives to say about this daybed and trundle. Impressive looking piece and our grandchildren love it.", 
    "I bought this for my teenage daughter's room about 2 years ago. It's a nice bed for her and love the trundle for when she has company.", 
    "Very pleased with Daybed. As described. Sturdy. Husband put it together quickly with no problems.", 
    "held my guest that was over weight so I was happy", 
    "Really like the look and the room for sleeping or sitting on top to watch tv.", 
    "My 13-year-old uses this bed every day and loves it. We did not have any difficulties putting it together in about 1 hour - the longest part is screwing the slats on the bed. Unlike other reviewers, I find the hole in the back very convenient to make the bed - also convenient for power cords to go thru. It's hidden behind cushions most fo the time. The trundle slides easily from under the bed so you can place it wherever you want in the room - and it is easy to vacuum under the bed. The quality is good enough for the price.", 
    "Depending on your assembly abilities, this will be a sturdy bed and trundle. It is, however, quite a large day bed if you have a small room, pay attention to the dimensions and be sure to buy mattresses that are big enough. The top really needs a pillow top in order to keep there from being a large gap between the back of the bed and the top of the bedding. They really should put a larger back piece on this. That's my only complaint. It looks great.", 
    "Just like other reviews said.....make sure you measure the space because this is very oversized and large. Very easy to put together. I am a 41 year old single female and put together in less than 2 hours. The boxes are heavy but goes together with little effort. It is very nice and a great value and would recommend this to anyone.", 
    "I bought this to replace a futon. GREAT CHOICE!! It was very easy to assemble - it arrived in 3 boxes, pictured instructions were included but very easy to follow. Really, 2 sides and a back. . . screw them together. Easy!! It took two of us to since the back frame was so long it was hard to hold it in place to screw it together. That made it really (really) easy!! It looks really good in my husbands office that transitions to an extra bedroom when needed. . . and far more comfortable than the futon we replaced!!", 
    "Looks good and great to have for guests!", 
    "It looks great. Need lots of pillows for it to be used anything like a couch. The beam across the front broke in half during my daughters sleep over party. 5 skinny teenagers sitting on the bed and it broke. The slats under the bed also broke. We took a metal plate and bolted the front board back together and replaced the slats with a piece of strong plywood and turned the support frame for the top around so the broken board faces the back. You can't even tell it's been broken. Also, the side to side (left to right) movement is significant. The back support beam will not hold much. It needs to be up against a wall. It's a nice looking daybed but not designed to handle much weight or activity.", 
    "Bought this for our guest bedroom, and it is perfect. I put decorative pillows across the back and it is so pretty. I've used several time, and even my 99 year old grandmother loved it. The trundle pull out is perfect when you have a couple of kids visiting. It is a big piece of furniture, so make sure you have room for it, but the trundle moves smoothly across the floor to access it, and the look is very expensive. I recommend you buy this if you're in the market for this style of bed. Love it!!!!", 
    "But in fact, it's ivory. May not sound like a big deal but I'm furnishing an apartment in all white. Now this is the only piece that doesn't match and its too much of a hassle to return it. Really annoying..but the daybed is nice. Another downside you can't see in the picture is that the backboard of the daybed isn't solid. There's like a 5-6\" gap from the backboard to the mattress (I put an 8\" memory foam mattress). Not a huge deal but it needs to be covered with enough pillows for it to look alright. I'm annoyed because you can't see it on the picture and it's misleading. For the price however, it's fine I guess.", 
    "it was very easy to put together. Very solid and looks very nice. So far very happy with the looks and stability.", 
    "Made an excellent choice, bed looks great", 
    "I ordered the tribecca bed the color is not dark brown it is black but I called customer service and they said it does not come in black..It is black also there was a bracket missing so my son has half a bed but together until we get the other bracket in the mail!!!!", 
    "Very big lol but loved it", 
    "This sold out before I could get it but it is worth every penny. Cost $1500 for Daybed of its kind elsewhere. Get lots of complements of bed. I can fit across bed and I am 6 foot 2 inches tall. Easy to put together. Took less than an hour. This sold out twice when I tried to order it before so don't miss out. They don't always get items back in stock as I have learned the hard way.", 
    "Bought this for a guest room. It looks great and is fairly sturdy. I bought the 10 inch memory foam mattresses for it and they work perfectly! My only complaint is the mattress support slats seem a bit flimsy, which I have noticed with a lot of platform beds. I really love the hideaway trundle. It's quite a space saver - easy to roll out when needed, while the rest of the time it is hidden and you have a great \"couch\" on which to sit and read or watch tv.", 
    "We purchased this trundle in white for a room that is navy with white trim. We needed extra beds for guests, but we did not want a sleeper sofa, again. This looks like a sofa, which fits out needs perfectly in our home office, while giving us extra beds. So excited to find something in white that did not look like a bed!", 
    "I thought this bed was going to be a nightmare to put togther by myself. It was a lot easier than I thought! It would be better with 2 people so you can hold the pieces up to screw in. It looked great when I was finished. Nice quality for the price, comes in 3 large boxes. The trundle is not attached to the main bed so you can push it where ever you want!", 
    "We redid my daughters bedroom. She loves the new daybed! It gives the room a grown-up look with the kid like fun of having someone be able to spend the night. The product was easy to put together and looks great!", 
    "Great product for the price. Larger than we thought,so be careful when oredering.", 
    "If I had to do it again, I would not buy such a large piece. Although, with trundle beds, it's par for the course.This trundle bed has withstood kids climbing and jumping on it... walking on it, like the arms are a balance beam... lol.. and it still looks good and functions well. :)Listing reads 'Dark Brown', but it is close to black -- as shown in the image. The style was really cool for a couple of weeks. My mistake.", 
    "I got this bed frame for my daughter's room for when she has sleepovers. The bed frame was easy to put together that my 9 year old daughter helped me.", 
    "It's really a beautiful classy piece of furniture....my son, who's 16 years old put it together, I just handed him the screws. It very easy and quick to put together.... the only thing that concerns me is the wood slats, not sure of sturdiness...so may head to *** for a few more.But I am totally satisfied...", 
    "This looks terrific in my husband's office. It being an office we didn't want the traditional daybed look. This worked perfect with the dark brown faux leather, fits in beautifully. The quality was better than I thought it was going to be and it was assembled fairly easily. We did not put a mattress in the trundle but rather put extra pillows, blankets, etc. there for when we do need to use the guest bed.", 
    "Good bed but the trunal does not pop up I did not know this when ordered but still nice", 
    "We needed a bed for the guest room. It was easy to put together and looks great.", 
    "Awesome. You can buy it with no doubt. It's beautiful. Comfortable. I love my new daybed.", 
    "We purchased this for the game room for sleepovers. It looks nice but isn't as sturdy as I would have thought. But overall we are happy :)", 
    "I purchased this for a spare bedroom. Which the kids use as a tv room but also used when we have sleep overs and for quests. It looks beautiful. I put a ton of mix and match pillows on it so it doubles as a huge sofa. I put it together myself ( a smaller sized woman) and had no problems at all. The trundle bed slides out nicely every time it's used. Which I thought might be a problem on the rug. Overall this is a great value and looks very rich. Love it.", 
    "Very nice, sturdy and attractive", 
    "Perfect bed for Paris theme bedroom. I am happy with the quality and believe this bed will last for years. The style is versitile enough to keep after my daughter leaves for college.", 
    "Looks beautiful for a beautiful price", 
    "good looking and nice quality. I will definitely buy more products from overstock.com", 
    "Love this and it is perfect for college student, doesn't need to make the bed, makes his room a comfy lounge area", 
    "This bed is great for a teenage boys room.. Looks good and has style!", 
    "Love the look! Very sleek. Not loving the gap between the mattress and the head board but pillows cover that up. Looks wonderful in my 2nd bedroom.", 
    "Great value, and style. Functional, and decorative .", 
    "Arrived on time, some assembly required. this daybed will only be used for out of town company, not on a daily basis. i think it will hold up to those standards.", 
    "Very sturdy Daybed. The faux leather does not look plastic like some others do. Put this together by myself in about 4 hours.", 
    "Great Daybed, very sturdy and stylish. Unfortunately mine arrived with a cracked leg and the trundle sat crooked. They gave me a full refund.", 
    "Love how it looks in the guest room. Paired with a green apple cover that highlights the dark brown leather.", 
    "I was looking for a guest room daybed that didn't look like a daybed. This is it! A family member had a split king bed that was made up of two twin mattresses. They gave us the mattresses because they no longer needed the bed. They were pillow top and we already had a regular twin mattress. The regular mattress fit into the trundle, no problem. The very plush, pillow top fits on the couch part and is snug long ways. It also makes this couch VERY high. I have to practically jump into it. Eventually, we'll get a lower mattress so it doesn't look so odd. We're also using this in a small bedroom and it takes up the entire wall. It looks out of place in there but hopefully once we decorate the rest of the room, it won't be so bad. I'm sure there are measurements on the page for this, so you should mark it out on the floor and walls with tape to see if it will overpower your room.The slats that people complain about were thicker than I was expecting. It only took me an hour or so to put this together and I did need a 2nd person to help me hold one end of the frame together while I screwed the other side in. In the absence of a friend, I would have just put the other end's rail on a stack of books and it would have been fine. You just need the right 2 of the long board elevated to the correct height when you are screwing in the left side. I took the advice of other reviewers and used a allen wrench drill bit and it made this bed go together very quickly. I probably put the whole frame together (24 screws) in the time it would take someone to screw in 2 of them with the allen wrench they provide.It looks exactly like I hoped and expected. It arrived in 3 boxes. None are exceptionally heavy, they are just too long/big for a person to move comfortably by themselves. They were well packaged in the boxes and nothing was damaged upon shipping. It is bigger than I expected, but I still like it!", 
    "It was easy to assemble. It is helpful if you use a drill versus the little allen wrench. It goes faster. It is an easy design and adds a simple style to the room. It is neat and clean. Does not need box springs and it is very comfortable. It is just what I thought it was and better.", 
    "Good for 9\" mattress. Mine is 10\" so I had to make it little higher and there is gap in the front due to that.", 
    "This is a very nice looking daybed. It took my husband about an hour to put it together but it is very sharp looking. I am using an airbed for the trundle for now.", 
    "I bought this for my spare bedroom for extra sleeping space and could not be happier! It looks great in the room and is easy to assemble.", 
    "This is a great bed & trundle. It looks great if it is placed against a wall, but if you want it free-standing in the middle of a room, it won't have a nice aesthetic quality, due to the \"window\" underneath where the trundle fits. There is no back to it. My adult-size son sleeps on it daily and is very sturdy. The trundle is very sturdy as well and slides effortlessly over our carpet. We love it.", 
    "Took a couple hours to put together. Fits the XL mattress that we bought. My son loves it.", 
    "I am very pleased with the purchase. I've allredy recomended to my friends.Comparing with some of the other daybeds I've seen on the local furniture stores it is by far better quality and price.", 
    "This bed is perfect for my teenage son! He only had a couch before and not so comfortable for sleeping so i got this for him. its great! the best of both worlds... a couch and a bed all in one. nice quality and looks more expensive. the storage underneath is great.", 
    "It is very big and does not include the mattress. You cannot sit on it and reach the floor without the mattress - so do not buy it if you intend to use it as a couch which is weird since it is a nice looking as a couch but impossible to use it as one.", 
    "Instructions didn't come with it I had to wait a week for them to come to me that there was screws missing the customer service was rude all the products that I have received from overstock calm was not as advertised and was a waste of my money I wasted a lot of money on products that they refused to have replaced because they are falling apart and I had them for less than a month when I started complaining I finally gave up and now all they asked me to write a review it I don't think that", 
    "I was going to rave about the service and fast delivery until I tried to put the bed together and the parts to the day bed were missing. I called right away and was told it would take 1-2 business days for the parts people to call me.... They never did so I called. I was told that the parts were found and were to be delivered. Good I thought..... I even received an email with a tracking number. I kept checking the tracking number and it kept telling me processed and ready for UPS. A week later I finally called again and they could not find the package Of parts. The person I talked to was on it and did a lot of work and finally got the parts off to the UPS. The problem is. It has now been over 2 weeks I've been with out the parts and my house guest which I got the bed for was coming the next day. I ended up having to go to **** ***** (3-4 times) to find some sort of compatible parts to but the bed together so my first had a bed. Parts still are not here..... SOMEONE REALLY DROPPED THE BALL! The person who did finally get me the parts delivered was great and she did offer me some credits which i appreciated.", 
    "We were looking for an affordable, sofa-like daybed that would not require a bed skirt. After quite a bit of research, this seemed to be the best option that wasn't outrageously expensive. The daybed arrived within a week of purchase, was easy to put together, and looks exactly as it does on the website. The fabric is not very high quality, but that is to be expected for the price. Since the fabric will not take direct impact, this shouldn't be an issue. Overall, a great bargain that would be hard to beat!"
