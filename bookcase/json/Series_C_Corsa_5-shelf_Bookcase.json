    "This set of shelves is great for my narrow space - it uses the wall space up for storing many books. A couple of notes on putting it together - yes, the instructions are horrible, yes, the entire box was quite heave, and, yes, there was a little side damage toward the back. However, the shelves and sides are very sturdy, it was possible to open the box on the porch and carry the pieces in separately and the damage doesn't show, at least in my circumstance. 1) Parts D and G do not connect to one another regardless of what you think the picture is trying to represent. They each connect to the long side independently. 2) There are holes that are not used in the sides - the first picture looks like you are installing a whole bunch of screws, many of those are actually installing the little plastic plugs for the holes - I found this out the hard way and had to remove many of the screws:( 3) Otherwise, things are pretty straight forward.", 
    "I bought this bookshelf bacause I had too much \"stuff\" and needed to get organized... with little space to do it in... and it was not too difficult to assemble, but when it was done, it is quite a nice piece. It holds a ton of stuff and fits just about anywhere!", 
    "It's a sturdy bookshelf with clear building instructions and nice color selections. Buy it.", 
    "The bookcase was purchased to hold old LPs to create convenient handling. The finish selected was fairly true the online display. Once the cabinet was assembled it was very heavy and sturdy. My only complaint is that the direction for the assembly were rathere vague and somewhat difficult to figure out as the long sides were exactly a like.", 
    "Assembly directions left something to be desired. And one set or screw holes did not line up, but the book shelf is sturdy and does what I wanted it to do. It is good value for the cost.", 
    "The shelf unit looks beautiful and it worked so well I am getting another one for another room very similar.", 
    "Easy to assemble and everything fit perfectly. Very heavy in package but movable with 2 people. Shade of oak was well represented by picture.", 
    "This was fairly easy to assemble - took about 45 min. Extremely heavy. Very simple looking book case - purchased for a girl's room. Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase. There were a few blemishes on the book case, but I'm guessing that was from shipping. Not worth returning it for that - just touched it up a little.", 
    "I am pleased with my purchase! There was no damage to the book case during shipping and all of the parts were included! It was very easy to put together and it fits nicely in the space I had picked out for it! It is very well built and my daughter will be able to grow into the size of it!", 
    "i havent put this together yet.. but it was SUPER heavy getting it into the house when the delivery guy dropped it off.. even he had a tough time! looks like its going to work great in my family room!", 
    "Not sure if I got a dud but the quality of the product was so poor that it arrived with pings and dents even though I didn't see any significant packaging issues. I returned it.", 
    "I like this bookcase - it's very sturdy. It came a bit banged up in two corners. I called Overstock customer service and received $XX off the price. There were not enough screws enclosed to put the bookcase together, so I called the company and got very good customer service - XXXXX helped me to understand the directions and assures me the screws will come in the mail Tuesday of next week (today is Thursday). It's too bad I can't put the book case together now, but I need some practice with being patient anyway. ;)", 
    "I really like this bookcase. It arrived very quickly, as usual with Overstock. It was in one big long box. The bookcase is very sturdy. The backing for bottom half of it is MDF and not cardboard as is usual, so it makes it sturdier, I think. The top part of the backing is cardboard stuff. The only minus was that the bookcase smelled funky for the first few days, but then the smell went away.", 
    "This is basically a nice and very convenient bookcase for the money. I found it easy to assemble myself and that the finish was as advertised (I had the dark cherry). The problem with the product was that the way it was handled during shipping resulted in the shelves arriving with some significant dents and places where the veneer had been shaved off. I am using these in an area that is forgiving and I was able to refinish, but this took extra work. The product itself was very good and I would recommend it.", 
    "I have been used to HUGE bookcases my entire life. being a book worm, who is just recently married to a graphic novel nut, we needed to but our first bookcase for our first place. I will admit at first i felt it may have been to narrow (meaning the width of the shelves). But upon getting it today and putting it together and filling it up...i LOVE IT! its classy, adjustable and looks great in my living room :D I may order another for my bed room once our library expands :D PLUS: ordered it monday and got it thursday! SUPER FAST SHIPPING! this was a great buy. Thanks O", 
    "It is important to follow the directions for placement of the toggles and screws-if the toggles are placed before the screws it is impossible to get them out, making correcting wrong placement difficult. I ended up with 5 extra screws yet the bookcase is still stable enough to withstand my large cat jumping into the third shelf. I would have given the item 5 *'s if the directions and securing items were more conventional. Still, it is perfect for the small space in my house it was intended for -a nice looking bookcase.", 
    "Overall, nice bookcase. Assembly instructions easy to follow, pieces clearly marked. The back piece of the bookcase wasn't wood --- it basically is a piece of cardboard covered with contact paper, and it was folded in half in the packaging. So right down the middle was a nice seam to view. Pretty chintzy. For us it became on optional piece which we just didn't install in the bookcase. Without it, it looks great, the rest of the bookcase is very nice.", 
    "Actual color and size were true to website, and the assembly process was easy. HOWEVER, two of the pre-drilled holes were in the wrong place and did not line up properly. They were each off about 2 inches. There are 6 pegs with locking mechanisms holding the sides and back of the unit to the base--and the problem was with the 2 holes for the back of the unit to the base. Drilling new holes did not appear to be an option. I ended up just using the 4 pegs that worked--and crossing my fingers that it will be stable. I have it positioned in a corner, and I think that it will be OK.", 
    "I looked other places for a bookcase for a specifically narrow place and found it on your site. I have been very pleased with the other things that I had ordered from the O, so I ordered in confidence. I am generally pleased with it, but as it is quite heavy, I had to have a guy friend put it together (with help from me). It was damaged a little bit on three corners, but I intended to paint it white to match my trim. I spackled the damage, sanded and painted it. You cannot tell where the damage was. It seems sturdy and I am happy. I wish one of the options had been in white; it would have saved me a lot of time.", 
    "The product arrived damaged in more than one place. I kept it because it was going into a back corner and people won't see it...but it was still disappointing.", 
    "Customers should have a choice to buy the bookcase already assembled. This was delivered by Fedex and left in the lobby., so I had to bring it up to my apt by myself. I live by myself and am only 5'1\". It was very heavy and I could have injured my back. Assembling it also turned out to be difficult as the pieces were very heavy. Also, the bookcase came apart when I moved it. The joints cannot be secured and bookcase is held together by a piece of cupboard!!", 
    "i needed a bookcase exactly this size. the wood is good quality, i wish the back piece was wood its cardboard(top half0 otherwise a great piece", 
    "We ordered 2 of these bookcases because of their size. They were easy to put together and serve their purpose in a bedroom that is used as an office. I was disapointed that both were slightly damaged in the same spot. It looks like a packaging strap was pulled to tight when they were shipped in bundles from the factory. If you are looking for fine furniture, this is not it, but if you never have enough bookcases and have a spare room to put them in, then it is a good buy.", 
    "Perfect for narrow spaces, easy to put together, very sturdy. Deep shelves and beautiful finish. Alittle heavier than expected and a few viisible scratches I had to hide, but otherwise a great buy.", 
    "I ordered this book case to fit in a narrow space near a window and it does the job perfectly. Assembly instructions were very clear and each piece was labeled so setup went smoothly. The bookcase is solid and not wobbly. My only 2 demerits are a) this is a laminate veneer and it shows, and b) for some reason the manufacturer decided not to supply a solid back. The bottom half is solid but the top half back is nothing more than cardboard. All things considered, for the price and unique size, I would order this again.", 
    "I bought this bookcase based on the previous 5 star reviews. It arrived and was particially damaged, i.e., scratched, etc. When my son put the case together, the holes were not drilled correctly thus didn't line up and we were unable to attach the bottom as directed. We made do, but I was disappointed because the reviews had been so good. It fits my need for an inexpensive bookcase, but it is certainly not a 5 star item.", 
    "This bookcase was easy to put together and it fits just right in a small space. I wanted something for bigger books and notebooks and this bookcase fits all oversized books nicely. Instead of simple brackets, there are grooves on the bottom of the book shelves that fit over the screws on the sides of the bookcase. What a great way to be sure the shelves don't move! The only thing I wish they had done differently is to make the back out of wood instead of thin particle board. For the price this was a great deal!", 
    "I purchased this shelf unit for a very small space in my son and daughter in-law's town home. It fits perfectly, gives them more storage space, and exactly matches their kitchen cabinets. Great price!", 
    "I found this to be perfect size for the small space I havr", 
    "Very large, heavy box. It was dented on corner upon arrival but looked OK. Assembly instructions were not very good with only poor pictures. After assembling 1/2 of it I noticed that the top left corner was damaged. This is a very obvious defect that shows the MDF which detracts from the finish. I would have shipped it back but it was too heavy and partially assembled. This is very frustrating because it is the second time I have received damaged furniture from Overstock! Do not know if I would advise buying from them. Very disappointed.", 
    "This is a solid book case. Assembly was easy after deciphering the pictures for assembly. Excellent value for the price. Really like the width and depth.", 
    "Very easy to assemble and sturdy. The finish around the pre-drilled holes chipped a bit during assembly.", 
    "This match the color and size of the Murphy bed, and with deep shelves, I was able to squeeze in a few extra books, would recommend this assembled by man 78 lady 85 and it was a joy.", 
    "still in great condition and sold. I move it around constantly", 
    "Instruction could have been better-small issue. Absolutely beautiful. Sturdy. Stands solid on plush carpet. Sturdy heavy product. Was questioning due to reasonable price. Well worth the price. Great value. measurements right on. Perfect", 
    "Easy to put together even without the instructions. Very classy looking book case.", 
    "This bookshelf is serviceable and does what I need it to. It's okay, but pretty plain. Nothing special.", 
    "This is a very solid and somewhat heavy bookcase. Great size for a small space. Took an hour to put it together. Instructions could be clearer though it was quite straightforward once I figured out the screw/clamp mechanism.", 
    "Went together like a charm. Well designed. Fit perfectly. Wife loves it.", 
    "We bought this to house vintage books and turned it on its side for a low horizontal bookshelf under a window. Works great in both positions (no weird lips or overhangs to prevent this) so its super versatile. High quality, heavy (!) and good looking. A keeper.", 
    "Great size for small space and very sturdy to handle the weight of books.", 
    "I ordered two sets of Series C Corsa 5 shelf Bookcases. I am so pleased with the Bookcases. The quality of the material is excellent. The size is perfect since my house is kind of compact. I would definitely recommend this Bookcase to anyone who needs additional shelves or just as an added decor as I put along both sides of my Fireplace. The price was very reasonable as I have looked for a long time to finally find these that are both well made and size perfect. These shelves can go in just about any room and be a stylist addition.", 
    "The veneer on this bookshelf was damaged upon arrival. The tight shipping bands that held the box together seem to have dug into the particle board. Shoddy material aside, once assembled, the shelf was not as stable nor as well constructed as I had hoped. There are gaps between the shelves and sides, and the whole bookshelf teeters slightly. Not a piece designed for longevity.", 
    "Over priced and this is partial board laminate product.not a wood bookcase as per item description Holes don't match . I request to return this item and I was told they would charge me *****. the same type of bookcase is sold at ****** for *****. It also says Material WoodFurniture Frame Material WoodNo it is not wood Bookcase. misleading", 
    "Perfect! Just what was needed. Is in a boy's room against a short wall. Holds a lot of books, very sturdy and good looking.-", 
    "The shelf is lovely. Exactly what we needed and expected. The packaging was adequate for the item.", 
    "Heavy and sturdy book case. The colour matches our existing bookcase. The size was just right to fit beside our 3 piece bookcase in my husband's office. It had plenty of room to accommodate his additional books that were previously boxed up in the garage. Good value for the money.I thought the bookcase was solid wood but there appears to be some \"chip\" board. Pretty heavy though and very easy to put together. Price, quality, ease of assembly, capacity, & fast delivery all make for good value. As usual, well done overstock!", 
    "A little hard to put together,but i knew that from other reviews. I do like the quality and height of this shelf perpect fit for a small space", 
    "I got the red oak and the color and finish are excellent. I was a bit worried it would be some kind of particle board, but not! Very sturdy, it does state that the very top holds 50 lb max. I have it loaded with books and a plant and a couple other things on the very top, no problem. Very tall. Want at least one more!", 
    "I bought this product to place in my husbands closet for extra shelving. The quality is very nice - a heavy piece. It was easy to put together too. We are very happy with this product....too bad it's hiding in a closet! LOL", 
    "I loved this.. it fit perfect and its tall.. with so much space.. and deep.. i loved it.. my husband loved it and its easy to assemble.. its perfect in my bookworm's son's room... perfect.. THANK YOU.. :-)", 
    "The bookcases were easy to put together, affordable and perfect for the space we put them in. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "It was easy to put together and looks nice in my family room. It fits the space I bought it for and matches close to my other pieces.", 
    "The color of shelving was accurate. The bookcase is sturdy.", 
    "My shelves arrived this past weekend, and I am so thrilled with how they look. I purchased 2 of these shelves for our sons nursery. The quality is great as they feel heavy and sturdy. I put together both shelves by myself and had them both together in an hour and a half. I would highly recommend these shelves to anyone. The 5 shelves will allow us ample space to store all sorts of baby toys/books/clothes/etc. Another great purchase from Overstock.", 
    "Great quality for the price. Recommend it highly anyone.", 
    "Received this book case in record time. Did not take long to assemble if you have two people! Extremely sturdy and did the job for me!", 
    "This tower bookcase was purchased for an application not related to display or book storeage. I am not a great assembler, but with help I got this unit together! There were strap indentations on the boards and a few crunched corners but it still suited my needs. It is being used by an adult who needs to visually see items and it worked out great! Each shelf is designated for clothing of the same type and it's easy to get t, T-shirts in top shelf, sweatshirts on 2nd, jeans on 3rd and slip-on shoe in bottom! No more fumbling with drawer pulls! He likes it!", 
    "What a nice addition to our living room. The look is sophisticated and the slim build doesn't take up much space. We also bought the double tier wider bookcase. We love them.", 
    "WE bought this one and the double one. Works perfectly in my office and goes together easily!", 
    "This bookcase is tall and heavy with the center of gravity low, making it not tippy. It was exactly perfect for a narrow space I had by my desk and I keep my reference books and such in it because the space between the shelves is high, perfect for tall big books, and it's also deep. Tall, narrow, deep. It had a ding on the bottom which keeps it from being 5 Star, but it went together easily, is solid, and looks great in my room. I love Overstock because they ship fast, the price is right, and I like the CEO... he's the bomb. :-)", 
    "I was definately impressed with this bookcase despite the price. I thought for sure it would be flimsy but it is really well made and looks great. This would be a piece of furniture I keep for a long time."
