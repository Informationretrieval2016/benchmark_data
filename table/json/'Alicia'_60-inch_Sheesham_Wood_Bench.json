  "reviews": [
    "This bench is a gorgeous wood with its grain showing. It's an unusual shape, neither explicitly modern nor in any way traditional. We get compliments on it all the time. I expect it to last as long as we retain this style (decades?). It completely compliments the table it matches.", 
    "Bench is beautiful wood, sturdy and exactly as expected.", 
    "We use ours (which matches the sheesham dining table) as a bench at the table, or next to the door for people to sit on to get in and out of winter clothes. Looks very nice, gets a lot of comments.", 
    "I also have the matching table. The wood is amazingly rich & really good quality. Came quickly, well packaged. Wish the matching chairs would stay in stock.", 
    "This table is beautiful. Not too wide and the finish is beautiful.", 
    "This is a nice and solid bench. Wood grain is beautiful if you like contrast and patterns (medium brown color). The legs have a few minor dents, but it is not unusual for a large furniture. I bought this to match the 80 inches Alicia dining table."
