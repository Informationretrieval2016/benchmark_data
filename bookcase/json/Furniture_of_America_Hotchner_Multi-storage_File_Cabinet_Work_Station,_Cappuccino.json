    "I love this piece. I do feel like it was little overpriced $XXX+) but it was easy to put together (the directions are very ********). I love the hanging files, that's why I purchased this. It's tiny ... I knew this when I purchased it (needed something for a small space). But it's worth mentioning because my kids thought it was for them when they saw it. The laminate on the edges is very thin in some places so handle with care.", 
    "I would recommend this but clear the day to put it together. It took me 7 hours. I am pretty good at assembling furniture. I ran into a couple of problems - In Step #12, I put piece # 20 in backwards and had to take it all apart to switch it. (The drawers would not have gone in if I hadn't)I still haven't gotten the bottom file cabinet drawer in. There are no instructions. I'll post a question and see if someone can help.The box was missing the metal strips that you hang the file folders on, they are going to ship them to me. The instructions really could be better. Some of the pictures are not accurate, so you're not sure which way the piece goes (as in what happened in Step #12). They do number the pieces (which is helpful) but I couldn't read some of the numbers, so I used process of elimination to figure out what number they were. It wasn't easy to put together, but I did it :)Good luck.", 
    "...very hard to assemble. The directions are very clear and the pieces were all labelled really well. There were just so many steps involved. It took me about 3 straight hours of scratching my head. Plus one of the top drawer rails was lined up wrong and I had to move it.But in the end, what really matters is it looks really good and came out very sturdy. The space up top is perfect for all my office supplies. The file drawer is also a perfect size. Plus, I love how's there's a divider in the middle so I can easily separate files between me and my fiance.", 
    "Product looks black - not brown as shown. Height is not as high as it says - ordered to meet a specific height and it the top height of the cabinet (not including additional shelf) is less than would be expected based on spec picture. after putting together using pre-drilled holes the drawers don't look square with the frame. Really messed up my plans based on height and color but after spending time to put it together it isn't worth sending it back. very dissatisfied.", 
    "I love this multi-storage work station. Only problem is it says that it fits letter and legal files, but it only fits LETTER SIZE. Still this is a piece of furniture that will take a small space, but will provide you with lots of space to organize your office.", 
    "This is a nice, smaller piece to fill an empty spot in a room. It is pretty short and thin, but it was easy to assemble and is sturdy.", 
    "I just got this Storage File Cabinet and there are 38 pieces which will take two people to put it together which doesn't include all the nuts, bolts and screws. It is made from compress wood. The bottom of the draws are so flimsy they won't hold any thing that is heavy. I'm am very disappointed with this product, which by the way was made in China. I'm going to check with Overstock to see if I can get my money back. What a disappointment. Don't buy it.", 
    "Loved the idea of this but the actual piece isn't great. First the instructions were really difficult to follow and it took several hours to put together. Secondly, it is really a dangerous piece of furniture. I had the bottom drawer open yesterday and I was standing right next to the cabinet. (FYI- I have a normal amount of files in the bottom drawer) Anyway, suddenly the entire cabinet fell over and nearly crushed my cat and myself. I was glad that my cat wasn't hurt and I was able to move quick enough. Luckily nothing broke on the cabinet either but I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone especially with kids.", 
    "This piece goes great in my bedroom where I also have my desk. It blends in perfect with the rest of my furniture and the storage for my files is very large and roomy. Everything I wanted & expected. Very good for price.", 
    "It looks great and is super sturdy! Perfect little storage unit but looked nice enough to put in my dining room. My only complaint is the metal piece to hold the hanging files was missing but I wasn't using the drawer for that anyway.", 
    "this is a perfect file cabinet to organize all stuff in my office/kitchen!", 
    "Other reviews are correct that this is a huge effort to put together but if you like projects and have a free day (yes a whole day), the instructions are easy to follow. It's just a lot of work. There was one blocked hole and one poorly drilled but both were managable. Otherwise all the pieces were there and the end product is as pictured, seems pretty sturdy. For the price, I wasn't expecting it to be super high quality so I would say it is as described. Looks as pictured, serves the purpose I bought it for.", 
    "This piece was a bit hard to put together. I thought the instructions were lacking. However I thought the finished product looks great. It's very heavy, not cheaply made at all. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "the assembly instructions were very difficult to follow.", 
    "As I mentioned above, this is a small and effective storage option for the mail or paper/bills that need to be organized.", 
    "I am very happy with this filing cabinet. It has a lot of storage space with the filing drawer and two top drawers used as storage. The piece looks great in my office as well. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "This little desk is smaller than the picture but it is perfect for my needs. I have no complaints.", 
    "This is a beautiful piece of furniture and very solid but I bought this mainly for the function of having it as my file cabinet and they forgot the insert for the file folders to hang from. I am trying to figure out who to ask to send the missing piece.Also it is a difficult piece to put together but because it is solid I think that is worth it.", 
    "Good condition, easy to assemble and looks like I expected.", 
    "Instruction were at times hard to follow..", 
    "great products, love the way it was built", 
    "I love it, easy to put together.", 
    "This file cabinet looks nice and seems ok (it's a gift so hasn't been used yet). It was awful to put together - holes didn't line up, 3 holes were too big for the pieces to fit in (and actually fell inside the boards) and one piece was cut wrong. Very disappointed in how it went together. Hope it holds up.", 
    "I like the look but it is really small. Truthfully looks like doll house furniture.", 
    "Easy to put together, looks nice. Sturdy.", 
    "If you are looking for a file cabinet with some style this is the one.BUY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT", 
    "Difficult to put together! Quality is average,but price was good.Assembly directions are vague", 
    "I\u0092ve made many furniture purchases recently, because we bought a new home. I have put together 3 bookcases, 2 end tables, console table, coffee table, and dining room table in the last few months, so I know what I\u0092m doing. This new purchase has left me on the verge of tears. The quality is the absolute worst I have ever seen! Almost all the drill holes were drilled incorrectly then re-filled and drilled again and painted over to hide it. It is the cheapest particle board covered with the thinnest sticker type material. The drawers don\u0092t line up properly and don\u0092t fit correctly on the glides. I can\u0092t even count how many pieces split while putting in the screws! This is by far the worst purchase I have ever made from Overstock. I literally spent hours putting this together and now that it\u0092s 90% complete I just want to throw it in the trash, I wouldn\u0092t even give this to Goodwill, it\u0092s that BAD! The thought of having to tear it all down and try to get all the pieces repackage into the boxes it came in makes me ill, especially after wasting hours of my time!"
