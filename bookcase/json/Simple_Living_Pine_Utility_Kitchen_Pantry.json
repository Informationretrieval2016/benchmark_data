    "I love Overstock, but I hate this cabnet. The instructions were generic, screws were missing, the wood split in places, and the \"white wash\" paint job was sloppy. My husband put it together in only 4 short hours. Do Not buy this item unless you need a place to store your matchbox cars. The shelf height is short, which I knew. What I didn't know was that you can not remove any of the shelves to make more room. Stock up on bandaids for all the nicks and cuts you'll get. I wanted to return it but the hubby is bound and determined to use it for something after all his hard work.", 
    "Don't do it. I know this cabinet looks cute, and it seems like a good price for real wood. And maybe like me you are very experienced with assembling furniture, that's why I ignored the negative comments. Unfortunately the negative comments are absolutely accurate, and I am furious about the time I am having to put into this piece to make it workable. It's wood, all right, but it is many pieces of laminated wood with many, many obvious \"finger joints\", plus a lot of black blotching. The holes are too big for the dowels, and I used most of an 8-ounce bottle of glue to help stabilize this thing (glue not included). The cams (no extra) are pot metal and will crack if much force applied. There are an enormous number of pieces, which would be OK if you ended up with a solid product. But because there is only a cardboard back board, the sides are a bit wobbly even after I used metal braces top and bottom, so now I am going to have to get some plywood and screws and replace the cardboard back. I've spent hours painting this already to cover up the obvious joints and ugly wood. When I am finally done I will have a nice spice cabinet which is what I wanted this for, but something I bought to make life easier has been more hellish to deal with than the dressers I have built. Worst Overstock purchase I have ever made. Sad to say I have MDF pieces better engineered and designed than this.", 
    "Utility pantry appeared much larger online. I was disappointed when I received it as to how small it was. I was planning to store all of my canned goods in it but can only use it to store my seasonings!", 
    "Door shelves are functional,, but pantry is extremely small and short. Can only fit 3 soup cans on one shelf door. Pantry is also extremely difficult to put together with a lot of small parts, and the diagrams in the instructions are not very descriptive on top/bottom.", 
    "I purchased this pantry - first, I received the wrong color; I ordered the Oak, and received the color Sage. Assembling, its not really hard, but it takes a lot of guess work, the instructions are not that clear. The worst part, the storage space is really small, it was designed to store away cans and small bottles, nothing else. If you need a good food pantry with a lot of space to store food items, this is not it. There is not much you can put in it.I ddn't return it because I figured its not worth it, I would have to spend more money for shipping it back.", 
    "The quality of this unit is poor. Although the doors were put together properly, the hardware holding the parts slipped when the doors are opened, so they do not hang properly or open and close easily.The knobs were uneven; although the appearance is generally good, the uneven knobs make it look cheap.I would not advise that anyone purchase this pantry.", 
    "This was a pain to put together the directions are very unclear- it looks good - it took 7 hours to assemble.", 
    "LOOKS GREAT WHEN ASSEMBLED. LOTS AND LOTS OF PIECES. SPREAD IT OUT AND TAKE YOUR TIME. USE A SCREW GUN IF POSSIBLE. IT LOOKS AS GOOD AS THE PICTURE BUT TAKE YOUR TIME. I ASSEMBLED ONE OF THE DOORS WRONG AND HAD TO DRILL NEW HOLES FOR THE HINGES. (NO ONE HAS NOTICED MY MISTAKE) EVERYTHING IS GLUED TOGETHER AND ONCE ASSEMBLED IT DOES NOT COME APART :o)", 
    "Assembly is somewhat difficult; checking position of shelves crucial. Unit comes out well if you have a bit of assembly experience. Stable even when filled to capacity.", 
    "This product took about 2 hours to put to together and it is cheap and flimsy. I had all the parts and they were labeled, otherwise, I would never have been able to put this kit together. The instruction kit was only pictures, and extremely poorly written. This product was made in China and cheap. I would not recommend this to anyone.", 
    "First of all I thinik this product is way too small and doesn't hold much like a pantry should. It was all scratched up when we received it & took about 2 hours to assemble. When we finally assembled it, we noticed that the pantry rocks when you touch it (doesn't sit flat). I am definitely returining this product.", 
    "The product was very difficult to assemble as it is held together with grommet type screws that hold the bolts. The tops of the grommets were easy to strip and they had to be redone over and over again. It took a week to finally get it assembled and then it fell apart when we moved it into the specific area. The instructions are only pictures and are fair bu the difficulty is not worth it. Eventually it will have to be redone and perhaps glued as well as treated with hammer and nails. We assembled several other sets of furniture between started because this one was so difficult.", 
    "The instructions were not very well designed and there were a couple errors with numbers. Assembly took almost four hours with a couple minor breaks. Two of the shelves were not drilled for pin placement, so I had to drill and position as required. The plastic holders/pins for the adjustable shelves continually fell out and I will have to try and modify that due to the fear that they will not properIy hold items placed in them. I feel the price for this particular item is overpriced for the quality. If I were in a store to buy this item with it already assembled, I would not purchase the item.", 
    "Already removed from service, its awkward and wobbly so there is always a chance when you get in it that things on the center shelf will fall out. Keep in mind, we have a large family with 5 children. It may be fine if your storage pieces take less abuse, but if you have a large active family, this is not the item for you. I am using it for cosmetic storage in my bedroom at the moment and it is okay for that.", 
    "I ordered this pine cupboard, because of the unique shelves on the doors and specifically to use for spices, cooking wines and things of that nature. The measurements are accurate and it was not difficult to put together, if you take things one step at a time, using a drill and gluing the dowels. Yes, it does take some time to put together, but once together it is a nice looking cabinet and holds a lot, as long as you are not under the impression that it is a full size pantry. I plan on adding to it, by having the husband build a 24 inch cabinet extension on the bottom, for cans of broth and other things, with 2 shelves. This will bring my spices and cooking needs eye level and keep it all in one place. This is a great cabinet and sturdy, with a lot of storage space for the right things, with fast shipping time.", 
    "I saw the \"assembly required\" note in the ad for this item Since the cabinet is small, I thought the assembly would be minimal. Boy was I wrong. it took hours and I am still not certain I did it right. It is a nice looking piece though", 
    "Far too many pieces and parts to figure out with a diagram that left us guessing at times (not perfectly clear). As a result, our kitchen pantry is somewhat wobbly and some parts do not fit properly. It looks good, but that's about it. This pantry is also too small. Shelf space is extremely limited (you can fit 3-4 average-sized cans on one shelf). Bottles (oil, vinegar, etc.) are usually too tall for the shelves in the cabinet and inside the doors. We should have opted for the larger, taller version. Too late!", 
    "i got one that fitts the description of the product.real wood n solid.i use it for mostly cans and i put it next to the refrigerator", 
    "My disappointment parallels the reviews I read after the fact. Despite reading and even measuring my space, I was surprised at how small the cabinet was, how long it took to put together, and how small the shelves were. I ordered two and sent one back. However, the one I assembled works really well for my daughter's small toys--if you have a kid into organizing lego or knex or playmobil this is perfect, because it creates a \"store\" where she can take toys in and out easily. We'll see how long the organization lasts.", 
    "I needed a small cabinet I could use as a kitchen catch all. It took be about 3 hours to assemble, but I was cooking dinner and watching TV. I used a drill with an Allen tip to tighten everything, which made things go a little faster. Be careful on your torque! This cabinet is so cute. I did eliminate some shelves so I could store larger items. Fits well in a small space and a \"15 flat panel TV sits every well on the top. Excellent but for the money!", 
    "I really like my pantry but it will help out a lot if the actual size is visible next to the product. I am happy with my product thou. Thanks to overstock, I am starting to change lots of stuffs in my house slowly", 
    "We were so excited to find this thinkiing it would work out great, holding cans on the doors, but the shelf is so short, larger cans fall right out. The shelves themselves are not very wide at all and we can hardly fit anything on them! One of the handles was stripped when we recieved it so we had to get a replacement one right away, as we put it together one of the doors had a long crack in it. The handles both fell off within a couple of days. We were not at all impressed with this product and would not recommend it to anyone!!!!", 
    "The product looks cute but it takes a long time to assemble. Too many pieces and parts to put together. Irritating. It also does not look strong enough.", 
    "I should have checked the size before purchasing as a gift. I find myself embarrassed that I gave such a short cabinet. Who thought you would have to squat down to use it. The construction is fine, just embarrassingly small. Still apologizing for it", 
    "I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. This is much smaller than I was expecting, and not a study as I had hoped.", 
    "This is a great storage space. it was the perfect size.", 
    "Ideal for kitchen! Great product!", 
    "This is a cute cabinet, but it is only good for canned goods, spices or small items. It does not hold a lot, and you have to make room for the doors to be able to open, so you can not set it close to anything. I am using it in my pantry, and it suits me well for that room. I ordered 2, and both of them had broken shelves, missing hardware, and one had a scratched door. Overstock.com was very helpful in getting me new parts, and they communicated with me every day until my order was filled satisfactorily.", 
    "Had a hard time getting it to stay together when putting it together. Pins for the shelves wouldn't even hold the shelves when empty. Then the other day it just collapsed.", 
    "This cabinet is beautiful. However it's a pain in the butt to put together. It came to us with some missing screws. W3 had to compromise. And some of thr wood was warped. After about 6 hours we finally got it together. Now that it's together we love it.", 
    "I received this this yesterday. I really like it! It is exactly what I was hoping for! Only complaint is the directions. Didn't have to much of a problem but they are a bit deceiving! Pay close attention to them. Other then that, I am greatly pleased with it!", 
    "This piece of furniture is horrible. I usually like to assemble a piece but this was mostly Cam-loc and those a usually great! However the if the holes aren't drilled properly for the cam-loc to fit/ you will not a get a solid piece. I laid all of the parts out and by the time I knew it wasn't going to fit, there was no way to send it back. So now I have all the pieces and nothing to do with it. It makes me think twice before ordering from O again.", 
    "This is the worst piece of furniture I have ever purchased. The instructions were more than difficult to decipher and once it was put together, it immediately started to loosen and one of the bolts fell right out. Can't put anything remotely heavy in it, because it is so unstable. This is going in the garbage as soon as I purchase something of better quality.", 
    "I received the item in a few days sand had it put together fairly easy and it looks nice.", 
    "I like the color and the fact that it's wood, not laminate. It is a little wobbly which is the reason I gave it four stars instead of five.", 
    "This item was the right size for what I wanted. I put it in my bathroom for lotions, hair care, makeup...etc. It has a lot to the assembly but if you stay calm and concentrate it's not bad. I'm a 62 year old woman and did it myself in a little over an hour. Would have been nice to have an extra hand to hold the doors while screwing the hinges but I 'chocked' it and managed. There was a small area on the door where the paint finish had sort of chipped off but I put a little glue under the paint chip and taped it till it dried. It's not particularly sturdy and I can see if used as a pantry with canned goods in the doors that it may not be the best. I put anything with weight in the main part of the cabinet and lighter items in the doors. In hindsight as I assembled it I would have used some wood glue or even construction adhesive on every piece just to tighten it up better. For the price it was exactly what I needed for the area I needed it.", 
    "Not very happy,not much room for any heavy items but looks cute as a small piece of furniture in a sitting room.Shoddy wood,most shelves split when putting together.Too hard to return but this is the only thing that a long time Overstock customer has been unhappy with!", 
    "This cabinet holds a lot, with everything right up front, so easy to find what you want. I have two, and they hold everything I need in a pantry.", 
    "This is a nice looking piece. It functions pretty well for cans and some boxed foods however be aware of the shelve height, many larger sized items will not fit. The overall build is also wobbly, especially when filling the doors. The doors sometime release from their magnetic locks when the doors get too heavy. Also nothing heavy can sit on top of the cabinet due to the wobbling at the base. Materials are basic, not high grade, but for the $100 you pay for it, it does its job.", 
    "It was difficult to put this item together and then the doors don't want to swing right due to the weight of them.", 
    "Really like this cabinet. It fits in a small space and has a ton of storage space. We use ours to hold all our teas and coffees. Looks great in our kitchen", 
    "Very poor quality. Falls apart during assembly. Sorry instructions", 
    "Took some time to put together but it is just what I needed", 
    "Easy to put together! Works well as a spice cabinet and small pantry", 
    "Very hard to find product Just the right size for my new condo", 
    "The directions are horribly written and illustrated. It took me 4 hours to out it together only to realize the shelves were wrong. I have up minkin 2I would send it back but that would cost me too much money so I'm stuck with it. 02lo o", 
    "Except for a little trouble with the top, it went together well and I'm very happy with it. It holds a lot!", 
    "works great in our one room cabin. Very easy to put together.", 
    "Despite the bad reviews I still somehow thought I could get it to work. It's much too flimsy to hold canned foods. It's laughably small and cheap.", 
    "A small, very cute cabinet. Looks very good in my kitchen.", 
    "waste of money, just a piece of junk", 
    "I received this and began putting it together. The directions were worse than those from the Scandanavian furniture company. I got the main cabinet completed, and the right door. Tried assembling the left door, only to discover I had two right doors and no left. There was no manufacturer name, address or phone anywhere and no model number. I contacted Overstock. They wanted a model number. I sent pictures of the wrong parts, pictures of the assembly booklet and explanation that I needed all the parts for the left door. I heard back quickly, after a few days I got an email saying the parts had been mailed/shipped. Then I got another email saying they were checking warehouses for the part. A week later I received the correct wood parts and no hardware. (I had to dig ou cams and unscrew and reuse screws. ) I finished it, but the two doors don't hang evenly. I'm afraid to see what happens when I put things in the cabinet. Also the trip pieces that keep things on the shelves were broken off on two shelves, and I had to glue them back on. All this and I received no price reduction on this. Thanks, but no thanks; I'll stick to the Scandanavian company in the future.", 
    "took some time putting together. did not like the actual shape when it was completed.", 
    "This is too small , and very difficult to assemble, looks cheap", 
    "I love this piece. It gave my tiny kitchen a whole lot of storage I didn't have before. It was really simple to put together, as well.", 
    "This pantry was very small and did not worth the time and effort to put it together. Waste of money.", 
    "This pantry is great. I love it, it's the perfect size for my kitchen. Not too big not too small. Great product.", 
    "Way too small for what I needed. Looks roomier than it is. I did not keep it long before I went on to bigger and better things...not worth the money for me.", 
    "The package arried in good condition. I opened the box and liked the color and product. Now I have to wait somebody to put it together.", 
    "Don't waste your money on this thing. A big POS. Will have to add support. Sways back and forth. Doors don't close properly.", 
    "upon opening the box this came in, as i was attempting to assemble this cabinet, I noticed scratches, One of the side panels was spliced together, as i went to pick it up, it came apart in my hands. this product, was very difficult to put together, it diffentely isn't a one person project.", 
    "This cabinet does provide good storage capacity. It is hard to assemble. 2 pieces were not number labeled and caused some frustrationlThe top was warped so required a replacement. The replacement was also defective with screw anchors in the wrong places. The cabinet does not feel sturdy, wiggles when used. A good cabinet idea, but needs to have better construction. I will not order assembly items ever again from Overstock.", 
    "I should've listened to the reviews I read. This item took me about 4-5 solid hours to put together, and judging by the lack of sturdiness you would've thought it was built out of matchsticks. they should honestly take this item off the site. It was the very first item I bought through overstock, and I hope that the others aren't as poorly misrepresented as this one is. There are way too many small parts when putting this together(i.e. screws, toggle nuts, etc...) and they don't secure the parts together all that well. After building the pantry, and I use that term loosely, its more like an oversized spice rack, the unit lists to one side each time you attempt to open the doors. Then the doors don't stay opened when they are open. I was hoping to create more space for my cabinets to be used for dishes, pots, pans, etc...Well that idea has gone to the dogs. As a previously stated reviews says, don't think you can fit items 2 deep on the shelves, \"that ain't happening\"! Only one deep and about 3-4 items across, as long as they are the standard sized cans. I could go on, but I think you can pretty much get the point that you shouldn't buy this item. I am hoping they will let me return this sad excuse for a pantry. this is a perfect example of let the buyer beware, in an item.", 
    "You will need a PhD in Engineering to even attempt to put this thing together I have ordered things from Overstock and have always been very pleased. I have had several friends try and help me to no avail so I have decided to use it to roast marshmallows.. Best use for it we can come up with.", 
    "Great Product. I was sent 2 left doors. I called and a right door was sent in a very timely manner. They called each day to keep me informed. Thank you for excellent customer service", 
    "dont buy this if you want to keep your sanity. The directions were 100% wrong, for example it would tell you the letter label that was supposed to be a piece of wood was labeled on a screw. Made NO sense, holes werent drilled out completely so we had to use a drill to actually make a hole ourselves, and its much smaller than you think in size. We ended up using our own screws to be able to even get this thing up.", 
    "I ordered this item because it looked so nice in the picture and the size is perfect for my small kitchen. When it arrived had all the hardware and wood pieces but half of the wood pieces were rough to touch and discolored. There was no problem returning and getting another package sent out. Putting it together was a nightmare. I sorted the hardware and part lists- everything there. Directions were pictures only- 14 frames. All the dowels seemed to go in too deep- ended up using wood glue. In Step 4 I could not screw the camlock bolt in part #7 where indicated as there was no hard gel material in it like the other boards- I checked the board 7 from the 1st package and it had same error. In Step 5, board 6 looked like board 3's picture and vise versa. Because of the problem with the loose camlock bolt on board 7 attaching board 17 was unstable - we tried glue and pressure for a few days. Just a few mm's difference is causing the door on one side to scrape when opening. There were little gaps in multiple areas so we used a lot of wood glue. I am not sure how long this little pantry will last.", 
    "This pantry was the most difficult thing I ever put together. After months of back and forth bickering with the manufacturer over missing parts, (they sent the wrong parts three times), I finally had enough to put this darn thing together - WHICH WAS NOT EASY! The customer service was non-existent. The instructions were all in pictures, which were mirror images of what they should have been. The specs for the screws were all wrong. I finally have this piece of junk together after four months! Do not PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!! This was my first bad experience with OS.", 
    "This is a Very Good Product for people who need help staying Organized, and don't have the space to do it. This product has not only helped organize my kitchen but gets much of the Clutter out of sight", 
    "This is exactly what we have been looking for. It had to be sturdy, so it would last for years to come. We also wanted it to look nice and be affordable.This cabinet fits all 3 of our criteria.", 
    "The instructions are vague and there are lots of parts...very discouraging. Lucky for me my boyfriend is very patient, handy and was determined. Had to disassemble some parts a couple times. In terms of quality, ehhh, it's sturdy enough to support my needs the doors often need some help (two hands) to shut. There also were some cosmetic defects only noticeable if you look really close, but enough to bother me but I'm anal about stuff like that. All in all it's surving it's purpose...should be half the price though.", 
    "It's not the product so much as the hassle to get it together. pegs and toggles or whatever they are. It's a pain in the brain trying to figure it out. Too small, hard to put together, Otherwise O.K. Not what I expected.", 
    "This was advertised as all wood, and it is not- I actually purchased two pieces and returned the one I did not open and assemble. This was a ridiculous headache to assemble, took two people over an hour, trying to hold together the parts to install the odd little cap screws into the manufactured wood product, many of which would not hold. The cabinet lists to one side and I had to add corner brackets to keep ti from falling apart. Sicne it sas such a pain to put together and we needed something in which to keep our goods, we kept this one, but it still lists to one side, even propped against a wall and with wood slats holding up one end. Screws continue to fall out. Doors are difficult to open and clkose when fully loaded with goods. This design is great- wish it were made of wood! Do not buy this or related products, nto worth the money or trouble!", 
    "This product is hard to assemble. The screws do not always align properly, as a result, the finished product is structurally unstable. Although it looks nice, it is poorly constructed, poor quality and absolutely not worth the money. Do NOT buy this product, it may cost over a ****, but has the quality of a*** item.", 
    "I purchased this for my son, however, it cannot be assembled. Panels and holes for connecting them do not line up. It would take hours to try to re-drill holes in the proper places to attempt to assemble this product. My son has crafted cages, and chicken coops and other things from his own designs so it's not for lack of ability to assemble this item, it is badly manufactured or wrong products were in the box. A replacement product is being sent out. Hopefully, it will be possible to assemble on complete unit between the two that are sent out. It is a large piece and is taking up a lot of space where it was being assembled. So far, I'm not too happy with this item, but if the new unit can be assembled. I will change my review.", 
    "Product looks wonderful but upon receiving it discovered half the hardware was missing. Overstock worked with me and it took almost two weeks, I think, to get the parts. Assembling directions are ridiculous. No writing, just pictures. Leaves a lot of guess work. Pieces all marked wrong per picture sheets, very slipshod work on wood. Some pieces required sanding to smooth out and then after working continuously for over a week when it was almost together, discovered that I don't have four camlocks to fit four holes to attach the top to the cabinet. I have looked everywhere and cannot find them. I am at a loss and don't know how to finish assembling this cabinet. Very, very disappointed. I have always been very pleased with my Overstock purchases, but this one takes the cake for disappointment.", 
    "This cabinet has a lot going for it. It is a great size and design for spices and baking ingredients. It also can be really attractive and super-sturdy. Everything you need to have a wonderful little cabinet is there - - except a feasible assembly plan. If you are even the least bit confused when assembling things, you may want to skip this purchase. BUT, if you are somewhat creative and have an adventurous spirit, you could end up with a wonderful piece of furniture, as I did. A few tips: Don't bother with the metal \"screws\" or whatever they are called. They work well in several places but are a source of frustration in most place, and completely unnecessary. You have solid wood pieces and wooden pegs. This is a time-tested method for building furniture. Get a big tube of really good adhesive (I used that loc tight super grippy construction adhesive that you use in a caulk gun.). Look at the pictures. You can see what the thing should look like. It's obvious which piece is which. Just connect everything with pegs that you glue in as you go. It will be super sturdy this way. Prior to putting the doors on the hinges, I stood on each door - with the little door shelves holding my weight. Not a creak or crack. There will be no problem holding whatever I can fit on the shelves! I used the remaining glue in the caulk gun to \"caulk\" all the seems. It could not be any more solid! Finally, I used a satin white spray paint to create a beautiful finish. The finish that comes on the wood is awful. I also purchased a decorative clasp to keep the doors closed, as I wasn't thrilled with the idea of the magnets. So I do have a great cabinet, but I did have to buy adhesive, quite a few cans of spray paint, and hardware. I also put in quite a few hours making this project work. So, I can't in good conscience recommend this to the average consumer. But being willing to go the extra mile (or ten miles) gave me a very attractive, useful piece of furniture.", 
    "After assembly, the cabinet does not stand firm. The joints do not adequately hold the pieces together. The doors do not stay closed due to poor quality of magnets and improper weight distribution. This cabinet is a joke and quickly made it to my garage instead of occupying a corner in the kitchen. Waste of money.", 
    "Way too many pieces, not easy to assemble the pieces don't line up It took hours to put together.'Once assembled, it doesn't sit level.", 
    "IT'S A BIT COMPLICATED TO ASSEMBLE LOTS AND LOTS OF PARTS BUT WORTH IT. I NEEDEDTHE EXTRA SPACE.", 
    "I ordered this piece for a small area in my kitchen and it fits perfectly. I would say to check the measurements before you order. I searched to find the dimensions on the site and was pleased that they met my needs. It does hold cans nicely but nothing much thicker than a can or cracker box. If I had read the reviews before I ordered, I may have changed my mind because almost everyone commented on the difficulty of putting it together. My husband I worked on it together, read the directions carefully and were able to complete it in about 2 1/2 hours. It seems to be well constructed.", 
    "If I had wanted a \"put together\" project I would have gone to Ikea with better results. I have worked with his for 3 days now and it is no closer to completion. Dowel holes improperly gauged so the dowels fall out.. The product should clearly state that the product need full assembly.", 
    "I was really excited to find an inexpensive wood pantry to place in the kitchen. It was the perfect size for my purposes and the sizing listed is accurate. All of the wood pieces were mislabeled. Some even had multiple labels on them! It took a long time to figure out which piece was which. I like putting furniture together and even when I have challenges with pieces and instructions, some items I will still recommend. This unit is not one of them. It is not very stable when the doors are opened. The piece is very wobbly and I have concern for small children. I used the pre-drilled holes when attaching the doors and both doors rub on the bottom. I have lift up on the handle to open and close. Again, it looks nice, but I don't think it is very functional nor do I think it will last very long.", 
    "I had planned to put our Bunn coffeemaker on the top and use the \"pantry\" for small items. I added extra long screws to the bottom to try to stabilize it. It's made of twist cams and wooden pegs. That's just not enough. we wound up putting it against a wall to get some stability, and now we can't open the right door. Just don't buy it. There's more wrong than I care to relate here. I was so disappointed. The doors wouldn't both shut at the same time and be flush with the cabinet. I love to assemble things, but this was just not adequate. There are screws coming down into the top shelf because the cam system wasn't enough to support any weight.", 
    "This cabinet was very difficult to put together and was missing some of the parts. The directions were quite poor as well. Finally, once put together, we had to put an elastic on the knobs to keep the cabinet closed and it wobbles anytime someone walks past it. I will use it only as long as it takes my husband to build me a new cabinet. In the effort to save some time and money, I purchased this extremely poorly made product. Do not buy this!", 
    "never in my life have I ever commented on anything ever. this thing is such a piece of crap, I felt it was my duty. first, all these parts were poorly packed and were all over the box when I opened it. they are also crap as well. the screw locks were such crap they broke when attempting to tighten them. the boards were marked incorrectly and the instructions were inaccurate. I have built many products and never had the trouble I had with this one. it took two days to get it built with many restarts because I made the mistake of trying to follow the directions. now that it is finally built, I hate it even more. it is super cheap looking where they have spackled holes in the wood grain as well as very wobbly. the doors do not stay shut without force and they are not flush with each other. now I have to take the stupid thing back apart to send this piece of crap back to overstock. I have lost two days of my life that I will never get back. for nothing. only good thing I can say is o.com is paying for me to ship it back.", 
    "There was no way even two people could put this together. It has too many pieces to keep together at the sametime.", 
    "I bought 2 of these to go side by side, but found that that cannot happen because I would have to separate them by a minimum of 4\" (you can only open one side at a time). I'm going to re-purpose them to my jewelry studio.", 
    "The cabinet is in a million pieces.......the doors say they are #10 and there are approx 8-10 small pieces that have the #10 on them..I need to return this item!!!! I have purchased several items from you and this one was very dissapointing! I need you to pick this up. My husband is disabled therefore we can not lift it to take it to the post office or UPS.", 
    "I wasn't sure if i would like this cabinet when i ordered it. The doors open allowing access to many items that cluttered open spaces. I really like it.", 
    "Make sure you check the dimensions - I like the size, but it may be smaller than it appears. The directions for assembling this thing are ridiculous. It takes FOREVER to put together because of this. However, it's a nifty little pantry that will provide some extra storage for cans and smaller goods. I'm happy with it.", 
    "This would be a nice pantry if the design was better. Very hard to put together and the pieces do not go together properly for it to be stable. Falls apart if moved.", 
    "This cabinet is ok, not great. It's very small, and doesn't hold very much. It works well for what I wanted and for the price. It IS wood, but it's wood pieces patchworked together kind of like patchworked leather. I'm using it, but I wouldn't buy another one.", 
    "All and all the construction was extremely poor. My husband was an assembler but there was no hope for this project. One of the handles fell off the same night we put it together. The whole thing swayed from side to side. A very dissapointing overstock buy especially for the price.", 
    "This seemed very nice and had a lot of storage. The main issue was that it was IMPOSSIBLE to put together. It was never sturdy in the end, because I don't think it was ever assembled correctly", 
    "This was the perfect size for a spice cabinet. In fact, I even put 6\" legs on the bottom to raise it off the floor a bit. My wife loves it and she has showed it to everyone who comes over. The title of a \"pantry\" is misleading, however. It 's too small for a pantry and I have seen some complaints from people who think they are getting a pantry, perceiving it to be larger than it is. \"Spice Cabinet\" would be a better term to use.", 
    "It was just average. I knew it would be small that's why I ordered it. But the doors didn't close right and I made my own adjustments. Now with my finishing touches it's great", 
    "As some other reviews read, the directions aren't super-clear. However, I put this together with another person and we were able to get it done in a couple of hours. It solved my lack-of-storage-in-a-tiny-kitchen problem. The pantry is true to dimensions listed on the website.", 
    "The picture didn't do justice for the product. It was much smaller than the photo showed. I wished it was wider than it actually is. I couldn't get all the canned goods in my product.", 
    "This cabinet took my husband 2 hours to put together, the pre-drilled holes for the screws were not lined up so he had to drill new ones, to make the front of the doors even at the top. Also there was no wood glue included for the wooden pegs and they kept coming loose, so we had to buy some glue.", 
    "As everyone else stated, it did take a while to put together but so worth it! This is perfect for all my spices and everything is in clear view. Nice, neat, and compact.", 
    "Unless you love puzzles with lots of pieces (some of which are mislabeled), few instructions and have hours and hours to devote to the project, don't buy this article. If you ever get it finished, it does look good though.", 
    "I was very disappointed with this purchase because of the quality, bad instructions and pieces either missing or not drilled completely. The parts did not go together easily, holes didn't line up. However, I will say that after calling Customer Service, they did replace the missing or bad pieces within a short time.", 
    "I'm pretty savy when it comes to putting things together, several trips to ikea have made me quite the pro, but this pantry was by far the hardest thing I've built. Everything is mirrored and the pictures on the instructions don't match up with the actual pieces. Several holes for the wooden pegs weren't even drilled. I wanted to use this as a little extra storage for my spices and dried goods, but several standard packages will not fit on the shelves. And the magnetics used to hold the doors together are not strong enough and the doors keep falling open. Overall, I would not buy this again.", 
    "I searched all over the internet for a smallish freestanding pantry that could fit in a nook of my kitchen. I got this one ultimately because I liked the shelves in the doors. They are great for spices and small dried goods. The main problem is that the unit is not sturdy. Once it is filled, if you open a door it leans to that side. Also, the space inside is split between the door shelves and the main shelves. So the upshot is that the main shelves are not very deep at all. There is just enough space on one row to hold 3 packages of flour/sugar. It took a long time to put together, mainly because of all the shelves in the door. The directions aren't great and it just isn't that well made. I agree with the other posters about that. It fills my needs for now - it looks cute and provides much needed storage. But it probably won't be traveling with me next time I move.", 
    "I read the reviews on this product before purchasing it. But they were also misleading. It was hard to put together, and the quality of this product is crap. It wobbles, and doesn't hold all of my food. It's half the size the dimensions I read were. I was also missing pieces as well. I wouldn't recommend buying this \"pantry\" at all. In fact, you can go down to your local ***** and grab one for 3 times less, and end up with the same quality but better storage. I'm very disappointed with my purchase.", 
    "Very cute on the outside and holds a large amount of cans/spices. Very useful for small kitchens with limited cabinet space! Instructions stink though for putting it together.", 
    "The cabinet had nice wood, but is way too small for the use I wanted it for. Most of the instructions were missing, making it impossible to put together. That is why I am returning it.", 
    "The cabinet wasn't too difficult to put together as some others had said, it took two of us at times to make sure all the dowels connected, but all the parts fit. In the directions there were some discrepancies about where a dowel may go according to the picture, picture can be misleading. On the metal dowels just put them all in the holes with the plastic ring, don't go by the picture, otherwise all okay. Looks real nice all together.", 
    "This pantry is a bit over-priced for the quality of the unit. We had some issues with mislabeling on the boards, and by the time we discovered they had reversed the letters it was too late to take it apart and start over. They had hand written a correction on the diagram - but that wasn't corrected until a later step. That made a huge difference as we had to drill new holes for the handles or notch for the hinges because the doors had to be reversed. We elected to drill new holes. It seems to wobble at the base so perhaps this is an area that needs some glue. It is the right size for small cans and the door shelves work well for that. The shelves in the body of the unit are narrow, so smaller items only can be stored there. It serves the purpose I purchased it for- but would have liked it to be a bit sturdier. Especially where the body of the unit attaches to the base. The pine finish is nice and the wood itself is of good quality.", 
    "Good product, but the pantry was very time consuming to put together. I have never put anything together that had so many pieces. Live and learn.", 
    "This \"pantry\" is very small and can barley fit items", 
    "This is a cute and functional unit. The instructions are vague to say the least. Prepare to spend at least 2 hours assembling it. The components are well indentified. A tip for assembling, use wood glue for securing dowels. The hole diameters vary, mostly too large for the dowels to function correctly. Watch out for locating the magnetic strike plates. Instructions or manufacturing, have them in the wrong location.", 
    "For the price, I expected for this piece to be a higher quality. It if so rickety and the wood if so flawed (can see seams where the wood is manufactured poorly and the paint is very uneven - not white washed). The instructions for assembly were confusing. My husband is a carpenter and we had a difficult time putting it together. It took us two hours. If it wouldn't have been a chore to return this, we would have. We are going to repaint it and my husband said he will use wood glue to reinforce it so that we can use it for the intended purpose - to hold cans in our kitchen. I would encourage you to check out **** before purchasing this and I think that **** sells the worst quality furniture! Based on the reviews, I wasn't expecting high quality but this is pretty ridiculous! This piece is worth more like $** tops.", 
    "Putting this together was extremely difficult. It is put together with 164 wood dowels and 34 cam locks which do not work well. when I finally got it together the top wood piece was warped in a downward direction so when I went to close the doors they wouldn't close. I had to get my jig saw out and try to trim the top of the doors so they would shut. I spent alot of time trying to put it together and it fit the spot I needed it to be, so I kept it otherwise I would have returned it. It is a attractive wood cabinet that is the only positive thing I can say. I recently also put together a wood kitchen cart the construction was great. They used screws to put it together so it only took me an hour. The manufacturer of this cabinet need to change how there cabinets are put together.", 
    "The wood looks like scrap wood and is not not smooth on the front. The shelves wobble. You have to put it together with dowel pins. It also does not sit very stable. It looks nice in the picture but I would not buy it. I purchased two and I am returning one. I would have returned both but the first was already out of the box.", 
    "Too many pre-driilled holes were NOT where they were supposed to be and many screws missing. It's together, after 3 days of working on it, taking it back apart, and loads of frustration. There are 2 extra holes in the finished product and screw points sticking through the wood ... but it's TOGETHER and usable. If I could, I'd give it NO stars!", 
    "The pantry has given me a lot of extra storage space. I had the option of buying the real pine wood from Overstock or a MDF of the exact same product at another website and am so glad I chose the real wood - it can be painted should I change my color scheme. The shelf adjustment is rather limited and the bottom of the shelves aren't routed out where they sit on the pins so the shelves are unstable when empty, but other than than I'm extremely happy with my purchase.", 
    "Nice product but it was missing a part and a screw was not threaded that came with the pantry making it difficult to complete the assembly.", 
    "INSTRUCTIONS WERE RIDICULOUS TO FIGURE OUT NOT TO MENTION BACKWARDS THIS THING HOLDS NOTHING IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. DON'T BUY IT! YOU'LL REGRET IT!", 
    "I was skeptical at first after reading previously posted review whether to order the panty. I decide to order it because it is such a bargain piece compare to our local sale similar item price. To my surprise, the pantry quality and design is much better than I expected. It is definitely well made. Putting together was easy. Great product!!!!!!!", 
    "It\"s a very nice pantry, Good size, I am not handy, but I had no problem putting together. It was delivering much sooner than expected. I am definitely recommending this furniture.", 
    "The good part of the cabinet is that it is all solid pine, except the back panel. The workmanship is good. A little difficult to put together and the instructions were very basic. We lacked ten of a certain type of screw so had to get more. Overall I am satisfied with the product. What I feel is wrong is the price. For the size it is way too expensive. A fair price would be &70-&80.00, and on Overstock you would think it would be more reasonable.", 
    "Everything about this is convenient and cute, however putting it together took about 3 hours and we put things together all the time.", 
    "just wanted to say it is way smaller than it looks in the picture... Not great quality. But it is okay.", 
    "I love them. They are light weight and easily moved, loaded and have helped me organize my kitchen.My husband was a little less satisfied, however he is a carpenter. He says the doors need a little more clearance when opening and closing, there is a slight rubbing if you have some weight like cans on them.", 
    "The assembly was a bit difficult as some of the screw type nuts would not go into place. Frustrating, but after a while of moving them from place to place they fit. Over all am VERY pleased with product and service. The look of the cabinets is clean and pleasing to the eye.", 
    "I bought this recently, in the white-wash finish, since my new kitchen didn't have a pantry to speak of for food storage. It is small, each shelf area hold 2-3 cans of soup, not mixing bowls and cereal boxes as I had intended.It came flat and needed to be assembled. It wasn't especially difficult to build except that in one case, the second big piece I was supposed to use was mislabeled, so it took some backtracking to figure that out. Also, some of the holes weren't drilled deeply enough, so I had to rig up other ways to assemble it. Many people in that situation would be frustrated.Overall, it will suffice.",
