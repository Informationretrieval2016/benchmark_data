    "Very pleased with this sofa. Very easy to assemble. I'm 80 and did it be myself in about 1/2 hour. Looks good and is very comfortable.", 
    "Love the color and the size is perfect for my little den. It sits a little high and I'm short so my feet don't touch the floor. Otherwise, very comfortable.", 
    "I purchased the couch and love seat together. They are very soft and comfortable. The cushions are slightly different in color. I have moved them around but I can see a difference. They also are not firm at all. When you sit on the cushions they flatten to almost nothing. They're comfortable but I have to rearrange them everytime someone gets up because they flatten and shift so the couch looks frumpy.", 
    "very cheaply made, do not buy any of this stuff.", 
    "Not at all what I thought I was purchasing. Required total assembly and did not seem very good quality. Returned! Customer service was very helpful with the process and our disappointment.", 
    "The color shown was gray; the color I received has much more brown in it. It seemed to be so much hassle to return - the assembly was quite a job. I'm just dealing with the \"off\" color.", 
    "Easy to put together and very comfortable. The fabric feels great on your skin. Great for lounging in and watching TV", 
    "If you are looking for grey, this is not grey, it's putty. Nice for the den", 
    "Nice enough looking, but expected higher quality for the price. With the way the arms attach, it feels a bit flimsy. The back cushions are still compressed after two weeks out of the box, sot they look frumpy. The color is good; the fabric is OK, but nothing special. Would not order again."
