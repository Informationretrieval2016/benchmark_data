    "The chair is pretty comfortable and nice. It ships assembled in one big box. It is not genuine leather, looks more like bonded but decent quality.", 
    "This chair looks and feels like something from a high end designer showroomr in Beverly Hills! The chairs are sooooooooo comfortable and look perfect in our mid-century modern Palm Springs home. The wrapping and shipping was unbelievable. I had just hit sumbit on the order and received an email they were being shipped. Right out of the box and in place in minutes. EXCELLENT service! Now if we could get a couch/love seat to match it would be perfect! Thank you overstock, this was a FANTASTIC purchase", 
    "This chair is more than I hoped for! The leather is beautiful and pure white. It is extremely comfortable and just plain awesome. Looks great with the white Andalucia bench, white Zuo ball and white Parsons table. All of which I give 5 stars. Never been disappointed with any purchase from Overstock. Loved that this chair needed no assembly. Just open the box and place it where you want it.", 
    "I was hell-bent on purchasing a classic \"Barcelona\" chair of which the genuine version runs for about $5,000. The knock-offs, depending on their quality I've seen priced anywhere from $350 to $1,500. I couldn't bring myself to buy a counterfeit chair so I looked for something similar that was classy, modern, edgy and sophisticated enough to hold its own against the inevitable comparison to the classic \"Barcelona\" chair. This chair is a beautiful piece or furniture that certainly looks far more expensive than what I paid. There is no attempt at using tricky verbiage to describe the material as anything other than genuine leather. It certainly feels like very soft, nicely grained and sewn well. I'm certain this is genuine leather (not bonded leather.) The tufting is symmetrical and beautiful and appears to be flawless. Again, a design feature that could have gone horribly `wrong, but in fact, impresses me very much. It was delivered well-wrapped and protected in one piece. I simply had to take it out of the box. What a treat compared to the nightmare Ikea furniture debacles. I am so pleased with my purchase and have no regrets about not getting the \"Barcelona\" knock-off. I highly recommend this chair.", 
    "This was my first furniture purchase on Overstock so I was skeptical but the chairs came and I was extremely pleased! They were already assembled, packaged neatly, and are super comfortable. The leather is soft, not cheap vinyl. They are well built and sturdy too!! Completes my modern living room!", 
    "Love love love!!! Exceeded all of my expectations! Comfy, stylish, well built. It's a must buy if you like this style!", 
    "I do alot of Design work and took a chance on these chairs! Could they really be Fabulous for this small amount of money? The answer is YES! They look amazing! Great buy!!!", 
    "Please purchase this chair. It is beautiful, comfortable, high-design and a great value", 
    "Comfortable and sleek modern. High quality.", 
    "This Guy has a eye of great design and put quality in the pieces. I will buy more of Christopher Knight furniture.", 
    "Love these chairs. For the price, they are a really nice quality leather. They look very sleek and contemporary in my living room...just what we were looking for. They came already put together and packaged very well. Quick shipment.", 
    "I ordered 2 chairs. The package arrived in good shape. The chairs arrived fully assembled. All I had to do was unpack and the chairs were ready to go(in under 10 minutes. we loved that part). The chairs look fantastic. In fact better than we anticipated. Workmanship seems to be on high quality. Firm and comfortable to sit on. These are not the soft sink in type. We have a white 3 seater sofa and these chairs compliment the sofa neatly. Its been only 3 days since we got it so I cant really comment on durability, but it does look like it will hold for a while if handled with reasonable care. overall, pleased with the purchase.", 
    "very smart looking, leather is good quality, well made, came wrapped beautifully, good value, comfortable and easy to get out of", 
    "We needed a chair to pair with a white leather couch for our small cabin living room. After a lot of furniture shopping online and in stores (what a drag) we decided on this one. Very happy with the result. It came in one box so no assembly (yay!) and it looks very high end. It's quite comfy too, I like a small back pillow with it but I have a bad back. We paired it with a Christopher Knight ottoman and it's perfect. So far our guests have been very impressed with the look of that chair, often thinking it's way more expensive than it actually was. It's a great design and quality for the price. Highly recommend.", 
    "You really need to add an ottoman to make it comfortable to sit in. Otherwise, this is a very good looking chair!", 
    "Sits low, simple, comfortable, no assembly.", 
    "Bought these for my enteryway and they look amazing!!! Even my friends 7 yr old boy told me those are some nice chairs!!! LOL great purchase and came fully assembled and packaged well.", 
    "I love this chair! It looks as described and looks more expensive than it is. I have no complaints. Ships assembled.", 
    "Love them! Updated the playroom and they are perfect for a teen hangout.", 
    "What a great chair which also came fully assembled!! I am redoing my living room and this chair is perfection I also did buy two of them", 
    "This chair is awesome. It's well constructed and comfortable. There was NO assembly required, which is practically unheard of with online purchases. There was also great care taken with packing.I love it!", 
    "I love the chair! Will be ordering from this designer again..", 
    "It's lower then it says. I Liked the chair", 
    "This chair is awesome. Very solid, sturdy and extremely good looking and comfortable to boot.", 
    "We bought two of these for the living room. We have a modern/contemporary decor. These fit in perfect. Easily cleaned with soap and water. A nice subtle white, not neon white. Sturdy. Lots of positive comments from friends.", 
    "Very pleasantly surprised that the item is EXACTLY as pictured. The craftsmanship is great, and it's very comfortable. Originally I was drawn to the Barcelona style chair, but they were completely out of my price range. This is stylish, modern and gives that same \"feel\". My only regret is that it does not come with a matching ottoman. Can you persuade the C. Knight Company to add this to their line?", 
    "Husband loved that it came fully assembled. I love that it's wide (fits me and my dog) and comfortable. Looks just as pictured. Elegant. Whites can be tricky; this is a very true white without being stark. Works well both against the super white wall and the off-white sofa.", 
    "it is beautiful and is a great quality chair. I saw one almost identical at a contemporary store and it was $****. This chair is white and looks exactly the way the picture looks....great buy!", 
    "Ordered because it was great looking to go with my modern sofa, based only on the look. It turned out to be more comfortable than I expected which was a plus.", 
    "Love it! Just as I expected!", 
    "I was so pleased in the static when I receive my chair today it is absolutely fabulous first time I ever ordered furniture online that overstuff you got it right I am very very pleased it is perfect just what I wanted in the delivery was so right on time Thank you overstock.com", 
    "nice stile and soft . I gave it 4 stars since it is not real leather.", 
    "Two thumbs up. Great service. Happy Purchase!", 
    "I purchased two of these chairs. These affordable chairs have a great modern design and they are quite comfortable. But don't expect a high-end quality chairs. As long as you have realistic expectations given the low price point of these chairs, you should be fine. The leather especially looks extremely cheap next to the rest of our living room furniture. If you're used to IKEA or other low-end furniture, it could be considered nice. I will keep them for now but I should've invested in Barcelona chairs instead.", 
    "This chair is of great quality and is exactly as shown. The fake leather looks real and the color is white.", 
    "Solid design, White color is slightly off white, not pure snow white. Chrome is sturdy, shiny and smooth welds. Very comfortable for a modern style chair.", 
    "Soft material and love that they arrived at my front door well packed and assembled. Ordered 2 and they look nice side by side. Very comfortable too.", 
    "Great chair. Comfortable and stylish..love it.", 
    "Chair arrived on time. Looks exactly like the photo. Loved it so much I ordered a second one!!", 
    "Love this chair! High quality, chrome details help to set it off nicely. It looks great in my living room. I definitely recommend!", 
    "These look great in our lobby", 
    "Two chairs arrived very quickly and surprise.......fully assembled!They look really nice in my modern themed livingroom,and as a substitute for pricey Barcelona chairs I consider this a good buy.Strong chemical smell initially from the \"leather\".Seems to be fading with time.Hopefully will eventually be gone.", 
    "Excellent perceived value, a lot of bang for the buck!", 
    "This chair arrived timely and perfectly wrapped and appears very well made. A striking addition to the den.", 
    "I was reluctant to buy furniture on the Internet , but after reading all the positive reviews I took a chance and purchased two for the living area in my townhome. They arrived within about a week. They were packed well and damage-free. The chrome base is clean (no sloppy welds), the stitching is nicely done, and they are not so low to the ground that it's difficult to get out of them. The leather is not as soft as some reviewers indicated, but it will probably be more durable over time. I love these chairs and highly recommend them.", 
    "Loved it right out of the box...no assembly. I adore the style, and the ergo fit that makes it very comfortable to me; because it cradles your lower half. The color is not bright white, which is good, due to make sofa being the same shade of off white. It is beautiful, and looks way more expensive than what I paid. I just wish I had bought more than one, because I can;t find another white chair as modern as this one.", 
    "This is the perfect chair for my new home. It's stylish, and comfortable. The workmanship and qulity is good. It competes with high end leather chairs without busting my budget. Delighted!", 
    "I absolutely LOVE this chair. It is well worth the price and the chair is very comfortable......it's simple but elegant.", 
    "I just got this tonight so I might be reviewing too soon however, at first sight I LOVE it! It's super contemporary and very sleek. It came fully assembled and was easy to get out of the box and unwrapped. I love the style of this chair and know I would have paid a lot more elsewhere. So far it's a great purchase. Super happy!!!!! :)", 
    "The chair looks great on my living room. It's very comfy and eye catch!", 
    "The chairs are beautiful and very comfortable. Well worth the price. Contemporary and versatile", 
    "This chair was as good, if not better, than it showed in the picture. Arrived in great condition and right on schedule. It fit in so perfectly with our contemporary decor that we ordered a second one!! .", 
    "Great style, great price. It looks like a much more expensive chair.", 
    "This chair is classy and elegant, and fits perfectly in my modern home. I put somewhat firm which I find very comfortable. The leather feels soft. This was a great buy and I bought a second one too.", 
    "The chairs are awesome and fit perfectly with our modern look in the vacation rental. Check out the chairs in our posted pictures on vrbo 592870! Chairs arrived well packaged and fully assembled. White leather is good quality. Chairs feel sturdy and comfortable.", 
    "love it love it i would recommended highly comfortable nice style and I am very pick", 
    "I love the look of this chair in the space we used it. It brings in a clean, comfortable and contemporary look into the room that blends well with our other furniture, which is an eclectic mix of contemporary & transitional pieces. I would buy it again.", 
    "Looks stunning, Absolutely love it. Great quality on the fabric. Check your chrome as with all furniture in this price range. There was a minor blemish on one tiuny part but you can never notice it. this chair is great!", 
    "Nice looking chair. Looks great with anything and not bulky like old style chairs. I wanted clean lines and less bulky furniture.", 
    "I must admit I read the reviews and thought well these chairs might be worth looking into, however I have to say that these chairs far exceed my expectations. They are stylish, soft and so comfortable to sit in... They look amazing in my living room and I can't stop looking at them. I love my two new chairs and I highly recommend them.", 
    "This is a wonderfully comfortable chair. It looks very high end and really is, despite the very affordable price. I always check Overstock first for the best items. You won't go wrong buying this chair.", 
    "Love this chair, extremely soft and comfortable. Looks very expensive. Should have ordered two at the same time, now I am waiting for it to return to stock so I can get a second one. Can't beat the value and comfort, Read a review that looks like came from boutique on Rodeo, it's true, certainly not a 200 dollar looking chair."
