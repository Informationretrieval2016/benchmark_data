    "I really like this table; however, packaging is very flimsy. The table was received with a dinged corner, as well as a ding on the edge. This table was purchased as a \"play\" table for my grandson to assemble his lego's on. I did not return it, even though Overstock.com has a friendly return policy. It is destined for some rough use and the dings are not really important for my use; but, would be undesirable for other uses. The packaging issue should be addressed, as I noticed this seems to be a continuing theme in the reviews. The table is sturdy and quick and easy to assemble.", 
    "I've had this table for about 5 months now and we've been wiping it off with some cleaning products and now the color seems to be fading a bit. Other than that, I don't have any other complaints about it.", 
    "The product would have been great, had it been packaged properly. When it was received the packaging and tape where coming off and the box was falling apart. The table arrived damaged with several nicks, dents and damage to the edges, corners and middle of the table. Average costs, average quality and very easily damaged.", 
    "I'm broke! Like most people are, and this table was really the bang for it's buck. I wanted a bigger table, and this one was the perfect size. So easy to put together, took all of 15 mins. I didn't even need to use the instructions. The table really looks great. It's sturdy, easy to clean, and very sleek and elegant. Only this I would say is to remember to use a coaster for your drinks as there is a veneer over the woods so it might leave rings! Recommend this table by far though!", 
    "This is a beautiful table, just wished the chairs and bench came with it.", 
    "The first one arrived damaged in transit, however the customer service was superb; they sent a replacement right away. It is a very nice table, a breeze to put together. It looks great with the 4 leather chairs I purchased earlier! Thank you Overstock!", 
    "Great buy for the money. Large, stable dining room table. One drawback is that the top if very heavy and you cannot lean the weight of the top on any single leg to leverage it up without threatening to snap the leg joint. You must lift it up by the heavy top and place it firmly on four legs and it is a wonderful piece of furniture, unbeatable for the price.", 
    "Very classy, extremely sturdy and very easy to assemble! My first one came with a very tiny dent, when i told overstock they sent me a new one the same week, so now I have two!", 
    "I have had this table for over a year, it has help up nicely with daily use.", 
    "Super Quality! Heavy and sturdy!! I purchased this table for my husbands desk in his office! Rich in color and a real BUY!!", 
    "Beautiful table but it had numerous dings and dents when it arrived. Since it was not expensive I decided it was not worth it to send back. I don't think I will purchase another table online. Even with the damage it is still nice.", 
    "Table came with scratches on two sides of the table top support pieces, near screw holes connecting the sides to the top. They look like someone had slipped with an electric screw driver, leaving jagged gouges in the wood. But worse is one corner support that the legs screw into was split in two. I had no way of knowing this before opening the box. Now I an stuck with a damaged table. First Overstock purchase I have been disappointed with.", 
    "The table and 4 chairs I received were great. The color accented the room perfectly. They are not only comfortable but sturdy too.", 
    "We spent hours assembling the chairs that go with this table only to take the table out and find the corner bashed in! Clearly this was due to handling either through delivery or shipping (one lonely guy delivered the table!). Trying now to work things out with customer service as the table is no longer in stock!", 
    "I LOVE this table!!! I cannot imagine my dining room without it. It's very nice, sturdy & functional. I have a bench & 4 chairs to go with it. I bought 2 sets of the Bettega Parson chairs & the Rubberwood Cherry Finish bench. What I paid for everything was a lot less than most of the sets I've seen. I wish I could upload a picture.", 
    "Should have read other reviews first: table is NOT 'solid rubberwood' as listed, the top is clearly MDF. (legs are solid wood.) It looks OK, at least right out of the box, but is a much lower-quality table than I thought I was buying. Plus I am still trying to figure out how to get all the staples out of the bottom of the table where they attached the box of legs/hardware.", 
    "The table arrived and was very easy to assemble. The only issue is that after a week I can already see some light scratches on top.", 
    "Table was delivered today, 3/25/16...in perfect condition. It has been put together and in my sewing room. I am going to use it as a cutting table for my quilt/sewing projects. It is perfect for that purpose. There was one small problem...FedEx driver pulled into neighbor's driveway and delivered to neighbor...411 Brookfield Court instead of 413 Brookfield Court. The neighbor hand trucked it over...", 
    "Shipped fast and in great shape. Love it.", 
    "Easy to assemble, love the wood grain, no damage during shipping or before, and the perfect match for the Capri Wooden Seat Bench I purchased to pair with it.", 
    "Serves its purpose and doesn't look cheap. It's not the best quality, but it's not being used for formal dining. It looks nice where it is.", 
    "perfect size table for my 1 bedroom apartment. arrived in excellent condition and super easy to put together.", 
    "Seems like a solid table. Arrived well packaged and on time. It was easy to assemble (only the legs needed to be attached).Very pleased with the purchase.", 
    "Very pretty and easy to put together. The box is very heavy!", 
    "Beautiful table. Love it!!", 
    "very good for the price, worth the purchase", 
    "Perfect size for my kitchen. Very nice quality.", 
    "Packaging was sturdy for me and there were no dings. For its price I would say it's high value and quite decent, too. This is an arts/toys table for my boys and so far as first impressions go I am very pleased with this purchase all in all.", 
    "Easy to assemble and very sturdy....Stylish and cute", 
    "Although the table top came in damaged, customer service was so helpful and sent me a new table top right away. Could not be more please with OS customer service team!", 
    "This is perfect for my kitchen. Nice and heavy for its size. Sturdy, easy to assemble.", 
    "For the price you cannot beat this. It arrived early, was well packed and went together easy.", 
    "Great table for an even better price.", 
    "Excellent for the price, beautiful finish, easy to put together and very sturdy.", 
    "This table was very easy to put togeather. I love it. Price was wonderful", 
    "thought it was a good table but it came damaged they exchanged the damaged top with no problem", 
    "This is a very good table for the price. My only issue is that like many other reviewers, when it came in the box it had a piece broken. Luckily it was on the bottom of the table so you can't see it, but it was broken nonetheless. Either way, it has been great, cleans off easily, is sturdy, and visually appealing.", 
    "I was surprised by the sturdiness of this table once put together. I previously had a similar table from **** *** that was not nearly as sturdy. After being put together for a year I never once had to re-tighten the screws. And there are only 8 of them, so it doesn't take half a day to put together.", 
    "Great quality for the price and so easy to assemble!", 
    "Love the deep color and assembly was easy.", 
    "Looks great. I'm using it for a large desk in an office and it is exactly what I needed. Easy to assemble", 
    "really really happy with it!!! solid..perfect..steady..strong..love the color..simple and so practical..easy to fix and looks great!", 
    "A perfect fit, looks great", 
    "Good value but a bit smaller than expected", 
    "Great quality, affordable price, stylish and very easy to put together (took about 10 minutes). Super!", 
    "Does the job sturdy easy to clean. looks good", 
    "This is a lovely, reasonably priced dining room table. It comes in pieces that are relatively easy to assemble. I realize this responsibility falls on me to read the fine print, but in looking at the photos pictured with this item, I mistakenly believed that this table included the chairs featured with it in the pictures. So, when I ordered what I thought was a set for a new home, only the table arrived. So, it wasn't as good of a deal as I had hoped but it is still an attractive product. I just didn't have chairs for a couple weeks, but got the matching chairs and everything is good now.", 
    "This was much easier to assemble than the chairs. Nice looking for a small space.", 
    "This table was extremely easy to put together, it only took about 10 minutes. It's very nice, good lines, level, and seems sturdy. My only complaint is that on Overstock I've seen the price range from $*** up to $*** I think it's a good deal at $*** but I wouldn't have wanted to pay any more than that, I've seen similar tables on other sites for about $*** (but they were out of stock at the time of my purchase). So if you're interested in this table, make sure it's either on sale or you have a decent coupon.", 
    "I bought this table for the price because the one I wanted in a store was not in sale anymore and too expensive for me then. This table was supposed to be a sustitute so I didnt expect much. But the table is nice and strong. I really thought it was going to be light and cheap for the price but I was really plesantly surprised. The top of the table was damaged at the corner but Overstock replaced it easily.", 
    "I have had this table for about two months. I am super pleased with the quality. Easy to put together. It came very well packaged and arrived on time and unscratched. Great price for a nice rather smaller scaled table which is exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for what I needed. Love this table!", 
    "I was a little hesitant to purchase this table because of the price, I thought it would look cheap- But I was so pleasantly surprised! It is a beautiful dark brown and looks so great in our space! I purchased vinyl parsons chairs also from Overstock and I'm totally happy with how nice it all looks!", 
    "This table is a classic, simple style. Sturdy, solid wood. Nice finish, though the stain is almost too opaque and paint like. This is an excellent table for some who wants a nice-looking, dark wood table, but is on a budget. Delivery was quick, and it was pretty easy to assemble.", 
    "very satisfied with the dining table - rich looking warm wood color - its stylish simplicity is very pleasing - I highly recommend this product - a lovely match to any furniture in your room!", 
    "First item bought at Overstock. The wood is beautiful, dark coffee color, with a very stylish design. Definitely worth the purchase, especially when adding the 4 corresponding chair set.Great spacious table. Very modern.", 
    "nice wood table. easy to assemble. good value. would recommend.", 
    "Table arrived in perfect condition. No dents or scratches. Very easy to put together. Assembly consisted of attaching 4 legs & done!Very nice quality & perfect for a smallish dining room", 
    "The other reviewers are right; it's a little bit of a grab bag on the packaging it seems. Mine came mostly unscuffed on the top but with a fairly significant crack on one of the sides. The packaging consisted of two box-sized pieces of foam and very little on the sides, which is not sufficient for such a heavy item. Also, they do staple the box with the legs to the underside with heavy duty staples that are difficult to remove.That said, it's a gorgeous table and a great value for the money. It feels sturdy once assembled and looks nice. We bought it for a craft room and it's a pleasure to work on so far. The espresso color is pretty much exactly like the picture.", 
    "im very happy with my table. I did think it would have been a little bigger and I wish it had a table leaf that came with it to make it bigger for holiday meals", 
    "Great quality and very easy to set up. Would recommend to anyone looking for a kitchen dining table", 
    "The size, the color fits perfectly in our dining area - not too big and not too small. It was exactly what I was looking for!", 
    "This table looks great and was very easy to put together. I love it and it is just the right height.", 
    "Got this table yesterday and it took us about 15 minutes to put it together with 2 big screws for each leg. It was packaged very securely and not a scratch on any of it. It goes perfectly with the espresso chairs I ordered from here. I was very hesitant to order furniture from here but I ordered 6 chairs and then this table and they all came in excellent shape. I couldn't be happier and the price was great. I shopped around to many places and kept coming back to this table.", 
    "I love this table! I was worried about having to by \"fake\" wood, but it has a very nice look to it. I can tell that we will have to be careful to protect the surface from any water (i.e. condensation from a glass) but this table is a great deal. It is a very sturdy table, which adds to the quality of it. There were no dents in it, and it was packaged very well - reinforced all the way around!", 
    "Table arrived in a flimsy, torn box. It was easy to put together, but has a long crack along one side.", 
    "i would recomend this table to anyone who wants a nice looking table for not a lot of money.... it was simple to put togeahter...a few bolts to secure the leggs. we use it in our office for printer and computer table...it is deep enough to have printers and computer tower behind the screen and ample roof for the keyboard and any other device you wish to use with your computer... we would purchase this item again if the need arises... graehound", 
    "PUTTING TOGETHER WAS DONE BY A DIY HANDIMAN.", 
    "My daughter loves the table. Great size and very sturdy", 
    "The table was just the size we need for a small dining area. Has a nice protection finish on the top. I think is a good deal.", 
    "so apparently when you put a picture up of a kitchen table, chairs and a bench you do not have to sell it all together. I received the table only. After, looking through the post and trying to see somewhere where it would mention \"table only\" or \"chairs sold separately\" I found nothing. So I guess it is ok for Overstock.com to have pictures on here with things they could sell you if they want. Make sure you call them to make sure you are getting what you think you are getting before you place the order. Good news however, they have the chairs and bench for sale as well....YAY! (sarcasm)", 
    "I love this table.It is attractive and sturdy and large enough to entertain with.",
