    "We were missing several parts when the desk originally arrived, and called the number listed on the instruction sheet for assistance. Unfortunately, those folks were not very helpful and said they weren't sure when the parts would be available. Overstock's customer service was great, however, and they immediately shipped out a new desk at no cost. I was able to pull out the parts that I needed and return the extra pieces at no charge. Randomly, I later received the replacement parts from the manufacturer, but the parts weren't even the right color, so I was very glad that Overstock helped! It's a very sturdy workstation, great size, and looks nice.", 
    "I put it together in no time. Works great. My office can be move to any room in the house now.", 
    "Desk is EASY to put together - everything fitting and available. Moves easily. Sleek, nice design.", 
    "I have a small office space in my bedroom, and this desk is perfect for that space. Easy assembly too.", 
    "i was looking for just a cart for the computer so i could move it around because my space is very limited. The instructions for assembly were easy to understand, and is very steady, is a good quality product at a good price. the only thing when i was putting the screws for the keyboard sliding piece they wouldn't go in so easy and had to struggle a bit, but besides that im satisfied with the product.", 
    "The table is exactly what we wanted but the instructions for assemble suck. Not a word - mostly just pictures that you had to study to make sure you were doing it correctly. The biggest thing you must do is get the frame square. It takes two people. The hardware strips very easily - cheap allen wrench hardware - you get one chance to get it right because the heads of the bolts strip easily. You will only know if your table is square is when you try to put the glass on. By that time it is too late. Only positive is that the mfg. will send you more hardware. Personally better instructions would have avoided all of my problems. It did the job ok - if I get the energy I may take it apart and redo it to get it square.", 
    "Love the sleek look of the desk cart! Was a little daunted initially at all the parts and pieces to assemble, however the instructions were complete and easy to follow.", 
    "Good quality and just the right size to wheel around the house and for tight areas.", 
    "While it has a stylish look, the parts don't fit well and it really is easier to put together if you have two people.The tray at the bottom, while metal, creases easily. Whole thing shakes.It is useful for me since it is the perfect size for the my purpose but, would not buy again. It is about as cheaply made as one can possibly make it.", 
    "This is a great mobile computer desk. It is very sturdy but has a flare to it. Great value for the money.", 
    "This desk was great deal for the price. Needed a small desk for a tiny area, and this works.", 
    "I loved this as I was building it until I realized there were a bunch of parts missing.. Sucks I had to take it all apart and send it back for a refund.", 
    "Exactly as described, easy to assembly - I did it alone. Mobile to move my work at home desk out of the room at the end of the day, now I just need to find a good comfortable chair!", 
    "Just what I was looking for !!!!!!", 
    "THE COMPUTER DESK IS BEAUTIFUL. BUT WAS A PAIN AND VERY DIFFICULT TO SET UP. THE CHAIR WILL BE SET UP LATER. THE NEXT ITEMS I WILL PAY A LITTLE EXTRA TO ASSEMBLE. IT TOOK ABOUT TWO HOURS WITH A FRIEND. VERY TIME CONSUMING AND EXAUSTING. THANK YOU.", 
    "LOVE this piece, I have my iMac work station that I can roll away in to my office or move to any room in my house to work. It is durable, easy to put together and a great looking piece.", 
    "Nice desk for a college student and reasonably priced for the quality. Easy to put together, the only thing is that the wrenches they sent with it were total junk and not easy to tighten screws with.",
