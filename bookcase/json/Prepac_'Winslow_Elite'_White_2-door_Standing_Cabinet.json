    "Easy to put together about 45 mins. It made of particle board, but sturdy. Very easy instructions. For the cost, it's good. Looks great!", 
    "I can not complain about this piece. Just as described. Took about 30min to get together. Overall i am impressed at the way it's holding up. One down side is the doors. They do not close quietly. One door does not close smoothly therefore tends to bang the sides. Alittle annoying and also it's a little pricey. That is why i give it a 4. Otherwise it provides extra storage and alot of it at that which I am happy with.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for my new salon. It was delivered faster than expected, which was perfect for our opening. I (a female) assembled this all by myself so it's pretty easy to put together! It holds all the skin care products, cleaning supplies & extra equipment for the spa room. It is very sturdy; I am not worried it will collapse during a treatment. It\u0092s not as tall as some of the other cabinets I looked at but I like it that way. I am short and so are many of the females that work for me so we can reach everything with easy. I can even use the top of the cabinet for more storage (the xm radio & ipod dock). I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this cabinet to anyone interested.", 
    "ITS STURDY. SUITABLE FOR WHAT I NEEDED IT FOR.", 
    "Though the directions left a bit to be desired, it was pretty easy for me to put together. Materials are heavy duty, except for the back of the cabinet, which is like thin paneling. But I have no complaints about that. All hardware was intact. Filled it up right away, it's still standing, so that's good!", 
    "I have a tiny apartment and a tiny bedroom and this good looking cabinet works well in my small room. It was fairly easy to put together and it stores all of my folded clothing, sweaters, purses, etc... A very good value!!!", 
    "I went by other reviews when I ordered - SO GLAD I DID - This isn't your regular put together furniture. I've been looking for an armoire for my 19 yr old daughter and couldn't find anything we liked or reasonable in the furniture stores. This piece is sleek and modern and really good quality - we were very impressed! So impressed I'm going to order the caps (more storage without taking up floor space) for the top of the armoire and the floating desk and hutch. Don't hesitate to buy - easy to put together. Like I said I will be buying more from Prepac!", 
    "Need extra storage in kitchen this was exactly what I needed", 
    "the instructions were not efficiently written. first, they want you to put the boards together with the back on the floor then turn the entire (very heavy) unit over to install the backing. it's smarter to place the unit face down so you don't have to turn it over to nail the back then turn it face up again to finish installation. second, the doors are so heavy that the unit tilts forward when both doors are opened. third, the hinges are so rigid that you can't adjust the vertical gap between the two doors. my ikea wardrobe cabinet is of better quality and price. overall, i don't recommend this product. i'm very disappointed in wasting my money on a poor product.", 
    "I love the simplicity of the design and construction as well as how roomy the interior is. It fits right in with my uber modern bathroom for extra storage.", 
    "love the quality, love the color, very spacious cabinet", 
    "My wife liked this product.. its useful and met our expectations", 
    "I cannot say enough about this cabinet. It inspired me to buy the smaller one. What a treat - good wood, easy to put together - holds everything.", 
    "I love this pantry...easy to assemble...very good quality but the inside has an odor that i dont like...i assume it is just a new cabinet smell & will eventually go away...i am trying to help it along with Febreeze, but no luck so far...", 
    "Love the quality, roominess and the fact that it is locally/ USA manufactured", 
    "Sturdy with good hinges. Nice looking. Not too industrial.", 
    "Very sturdy and useful. Love it", 
    "Work perfect for extra storage in my garage. Sturdy. I did not put together but watched. Looked pretty easy.", 
    "Solid (and heavy) piece that is simple build if you have some experience with assembling furniture.", 
    "Bought these to set up in the garage for food storage. Bought two of them and they were easy to build, just needed help to stand them up as I am a Five foot tall woman! But the building was extremely easy!", 
    "Great price and easy to assemble.", 
    "Even my husband the engineer was impressed with the quality. I even trust the cabinet to hold my good dishes!", 
    "It took a couple of hours to put together - I can say that the directions weren't great, but my after it was put together, I was thrilled at how well it fit in my sewing/craft/art room. I am thinking about purchasing another one. Prepac cabinets are beautiful as well as large enough to store fabrics, sewing machines, etc. Love the price!", 
    "Just what we needed for our church Stephen Ministry supplies. Sturdy and nice looking", 
    "This arrived quickly after it was placed on order. Item was well packaged and there was no damage, a good thing given that it is rather heavy. All pieces were well packaged and nothing was missing. Directions were easy to follow and cabinet was assembled without problems. A very good cabinet for the price. Would buy this one again if there was a need", 
    "Cabinets look good and were fairly easy to put together. Two of us put the first two together and I put the third one together and I am a 74 year old woman.", 
    "I am unhappy with the quality, everytime I had to move a piece, if I didn't lift it off the carpet, the partical board mashed in or caused slight damage to the white covering. Once my husband and I got it together and put the doors on, the doors do not touch, there is about a 1/4\" gap between them and one door swings partially open. I purchased this product with doors vs. a bookshelf to keep the dust out. I am not satisfied and will not purchase another product of this kind. It seemed easy to put together, but when the pre-drilled holes are not in the correct place so the doors don't work right, then it becomes difficult because you either accept it as is, return it or try to fix it.", 
    "The delivery was prompt and on time, and they did not block my garage door, but placed the boxes alongside it, so I could keep them there till I got help assembling, and lifting them. But, they turned out beautiful, with well functioning doors and hinges, which don't pop open but stay aligned. Overall, great cabinets at a reasonable price.", 
    "Beautiful cabinet. Well made and easy assembly. The brushed nickel handels are the beautiful finishing touch. I use the cabinet in my garage but It is defiantly nice enough for inside house or office", 
    "very happy...helped us so much when we bought our home that did not have enough kitchen cabs...sturdy & is holding up really well for many years now. about 3 yrs now...", 
    "I'm not yet done putting this together, but so far, no complain here.", 
    "This cabinet was easy to assemble and has a great look! It's exactly what I needed and expected!", 
    "This is really, really heavy but once you get it together it is great storage for a great price", 
    "Fairly easy to install and appears to be pretty sturdy. Lots of storage room.", 
    "I'm very impressed, it went together fine. It holds all my fabric in my sewing room without sagging shelves. The look fits in nicely with the rest of the room. Yes I do recommend this cabinet!", 
    "Just what I needed. A little difficult to put together but good quality and fits the bill.", 
    "excellent service.Love to purchase more from Overstock.", 
    "This product was well made, very quick and easy to assemble. I'm a woman and did it alone in thirty minutes. The instructions were great.", 
    "We purchased these for our basement for additional storage. They look great, keep the basement looking clean and bright and are roomier than you think. My husband put them together in about 30-45 minutes. We have purchased several of these.", 
    "Looks good and great storage, easily put together, no damaged or missing pieces.", 
    "Easy to assemble, delivered quickly.", 
    "flimsy construction, better to spend a little more and get a steel cabinet", 
    "This cabinet is sturdy, easy to assemble, and nice looking. It hides my laundry room clutter perfectly. No complaints from me!", 
    "Shoddy assembly, didn't send all the correct sized hardware", 
    "Much nicer than I expected, the instructions were very clear, what a pleasant surprise. I would buy more of these if I needed them.", 
    "The cabinet is well made and good looking and has adequate storage spaced as advertised. It fits well into our kitchen", 
    "Hired someone to put this together. Was done in about 1/2 hour. Needed a place for towels. Stuffed to the gills. Does have an odor so air out before placing items in and closing door.", 
    "This cabinet is exactly what I have been looking for and was a great product and value. Most cabinets I found were only 12\"-14\" deep, but this one is 16\" and can fit so much more inside. The design is clean and looks great. Not too hard to put together. I ordered another one because I was so happy with the first one.", 
    "bought this cabinet to relieve my pantry problems my house was build with a small pantry could not shut door this took care of problem", 
    "Excellent quality for the cost. Easy assembly. Perfect for basement storage. Still white laminate particle board, so would not personally use it as a decor item. Highly recommend.", 
    "I saw someone turn a cabinet just like this into a dog supply cabinet on ********* and decided to make my own. I do a fair amount of DYI projects (I'm female and widowed) and had no trouble assembling it. It's in my combination wash-mud room and holds everything for my four rescued dogs--from food, to meds, to towels, brushes, and leashes. Use stick-on hooks for calendar and shopping list. Not only is it great to have everything in one place, it frees two drawers and part of the pantry. AND when the dogs hear the cabinet door open, my dogs know something about THEM is going on!", 
    "Even more beautiful in person! Installed this in my office and I'm receive compliments every day! The door handles are especially modern and sleek and, in my opinion, make it appear even more classy. I also purchased the broom cabinet and together they look like one unit. Very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "Over the years I have had many (you put it together) storage cabinets. This one was the best. Higher quality materials / fit / finished appearance.", 
    "Nice-looking cabinet. Fairly easy to put together, even for those who are challenged in this area! ;-) Being used for clothes, so definitely sturdy enough. Don't know that I would use it as a pantry for canned goods, might not be sturdy enough for that.", 
    "Perfect, son put it together easily, doors close great, looks like good quality piece of furniture. It has so much space for our kitchen food items. Nice white finish!", 
    "Nice item. Good price.. Good Quality. Installing was easy too", 
    "lots of storage easy to assemble fits perfectly in my kitchen would recommend to my friends and family", 
    "The cabinet arrived with the side panel split in half. It's clear that it was probably mishandled, but nowhere on the box did it say \"handle with care\" or \"this side up\" as it should have. Fortunately I was able to get a friend to nail a piece of wood to it to hold it together. The box was very heavy and it would have been impossible for me to carry it to a post office to return it.", 
    "Very pleased with this product. Quality and workmanship was great. Am so pleased ordered another."
