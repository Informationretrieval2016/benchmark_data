    "This is a great price on a very solid heavy wood chair that is white-washed reclaimed wood. This is not a veneer or whatever other fake wood products they use. GREAT price for this awesome chair! I bought it for my office, but its a very cool dining table chair too. Love it and would recommend it.",

    "These chairs worth the price and is lifelong beauty and quality. It is the best buy together with table I ever made on overstock.", 
    "good looking well built sturdy chair.They come in pairs, and one had a natural split in the leg from the wood grain. Overstock quickly replaced and I am a happy customer.", 
    "This chair is very sturdy and for a solid wood chair a great price. The rustic look is very pleasing. The photo does not show the back of the chair which is much more whitewashed than the seat. The only thing that bothered me is when I was handling the chair it felt kind of chalky as if there was a residue left behind. I noticed that not only did my fingers appear to have a white residue after touching some areas but also brown as if from the finish. I cleaned the chair with water and a cloth and indeed some brown residue was coming off. It was only slight but noticeable. After I cleaned the whole chair it felt \"clean\" and there was no longer any residue. A minor inconvenience but concerning when you're going to be sitting on the chair.", 
    "I absolutely love this chair! The line wash is awesome and it is such a heavy duty chair!! It absoulutely wonderful!!!", 
    "These chairs arrived in perfect condition, they are exactly as pictured and are very heavy and sturdy!"
