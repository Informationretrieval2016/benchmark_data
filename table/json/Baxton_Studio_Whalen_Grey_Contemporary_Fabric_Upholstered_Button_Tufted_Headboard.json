    "I was surprised at the quality of this headboard for the price. Color in listing is accurate....Slate gray with textured upolstery. Easy to install. Highly recommended!!", 
    "Great value. Looks great. Sturdy and good quality!", 
    "Nice quality and color, I was small that the measurements on the website, so I had to send back.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this Headboard. The legs are not the best, however the Headboard itself is great. I was expecting the Fabric would be a soft feminin fabric (what I wanted). But it turned out to be a sturdy thick upholstery fabric with an almost tweed looking pattern. A little darker than the pictures on overstock. It is of Much better Quality than I expected. So even though the fabric isn't what I expected -I still Love It! It looks Great!!!I didn't want to spend a lot of money since it was just for my Guest Room. This definately looks alot more expensive.", 
    "This headboard looks great in my bedroom- better than it does in the picture. The only issue I have with it is that it was difficult to attach to the bed frame. After several failed attempts, I have up and set it up against the wall and pushed the bed against it.If you've got someone handy around, this will be great. Otherwise, may be best to pick something else. I still give it 3 stars because of how great it looks though.", 
    "Love this headboard--for our small bedroom, it does the trick! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not the sturdiest thing. It's a little wobbly, but I'm not worried about it crashing or anything. Looks good though!", 
    "I purchased this for my parents who are redoing their bedroom. The material is just lovely and and it looks to be of great quality! I'm so glad I decided on this and the shipment was so quick! I love Overstock!", 
    "VERY easy to assemble and looks good. It's a little lighter than the picture.", 
    "The headboard is beautiful and fits perfectly!", 
    "looks good, but is not very sturdy when attached to the bed frame", 
    "This is a great piece. Make sure to have hardware to attach to the bed frame. Doesn't come with.",
