    "If I could give this zero stars I would. First of all it came in a busted up package that was taped back up (very poorly), to the point that when it was delivered there were pieces of the styrofoam packaging all over the floor. The styrofoam is THE most annoying packaging type I have come across, it is extremely cheap and gets everywhere, sticking to my hands and even my apt walls when the package is opened. And to TOP it all off, the back panel was missing and didn't come with the packaging!! After a long wait I was told that it would not be available for me. They offered to send me a new set as long as I send them the old one back, but I couldnt do that as the original packaging was in shreds. I had to demand a discount, which I got, but it was measly considering the missing piece was crucial to the integrity of the bookcase. Will never shope here again."
