    "I was concerned the delivery men being able to get the sofa and love-seat through my small round-top front door, but the backs of the sofa and love-seat come as separate pieces that snap onto metal connectors, which made delivery super easy. Delivery time was excellent. The white glove delivery (which I was surprised to find was included at no extra cost) was excellent. The sofa and love-seat seem to be well built. The covering is soft and comfortable The only issue for me is that the band along the back lumbar region is a little firm for my taste, but after having the two pieces for about a month now, I'm getting use to it. The other issue is that I have wood floors, so the love-seat moves around some, but no big deal. I shopped around at local furniture stores, and found nothing as nice as these at this price.", 
    "Love the concept, the \"pleather\" is a bit \"soft\" but other than that for the price to have an apartment sized dual reclining couch is awesome", 
    "We were looking for a clean, reclining leather sofa, and this is it! It looks just like in the picture. The leather is taught with no bunching. It's not the super soft kind of leather, but smooth leather. The sofa provides great back support, but not overly sticking out (like some lumbars can do). I will say the product isn't consistent (ie - the height of the armrest on the loveseat is a little lower than on the sofa, one side of the sofa reclines 1-2 inches more than the other side). But you'd only notice these inconsistencies if you were staring at the couch, there is nothing glaring. Also, at 5'3\", my toes barely touch the floor. Generally, thought, the quality of the sofa is good. Overall, we are happy with the sofa. Great Overstock customer service and white glove delivery included!", 
    "The sofa is so comfortable I could sleep reclining on the sofa all night."
