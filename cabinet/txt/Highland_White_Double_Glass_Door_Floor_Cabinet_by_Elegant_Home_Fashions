The Highland floor cabinet highlights a white finish and two
textured glass panel doors. This functional piece also offers
chrome finished knobs and an MDF construction that offers
durability and style. With door magnets and hinges already in
place, it is easy to assemble. With over a foot of depth, you will
get more storage than you had hoped for. The textured glass lets in
enough light to be convenient, but distorts enough to give a
comfortable level of privacy. It is a must-have for anyone needing
classy storage space.Door magnet and hinges are pre-hungAmple storageTwo (2) interior shelvesTwo (2) glass panel doorsTextured glass panel doorsChrome finished knobsSet includes: One (1) floor cabinet and assembly
