    "Received this fabulous table in great time. About a week and a half from purchase to delivery. It is an oversized product too so I was very impressed. You will need a couple strong people to help hold the table top while the legs are attached, but it is assembled in less than 10 min. Getting it out of the package is another story, it's packed in at least two layers of cardboard. It did have a ding on the corner of the table but to me it just adds character to an already distressed looking piece. Wasn't worth the hassle of shipping back. Still very very happy!", 
    "This matches the buffet we also ordered a few months ago. We love BOTH. This table is HEAVY and beautiful. It's everything we were looking for in our contemporary mixed with rustic decor. It's like a rustic white wash with brown/beige undertones that pick up our wood floors.", 
    "Very nice quality. Very heavy. Will last forever!", 
    "First it's boxed, wrapped in Styrofoam, boxed again, taped. Took along time to unwrap, it's very heavy as well. The finish is interesting, but the top of the table is wavy. Each plank has a high, low swell. Will not be good for dishes and glasses. Priced a bit high with the issues it has.", 
    "This is a very unique table. The color is a very light biege, creamy and white distress look. Although it is manufactured distressed the designs are beautiful. This is a very solid piece of wood, sturdy and will last me a very long time. My friends LOVE it! Can't wait to pair up some chairs with this!", 
    "Just ordered this table and it arrived this week. Love it! It is very solid and heavy duty. Arrived perfectly and was very secure in packaging and packaged very well. The color is true to the site and looks just like the site. It is just what we wanted and a perfect size. The legs give it a nice look and soften it as well. The free shipping is a great offer. It is very heavy and has to be delivered by freight, so that is a great offer as to ship it has to be costly. Very happy w/ this product. Thank you.", 
    "I paired the Cosmo dining table with the Cosmo buffet and was told that it sold my first house! It is a show stopper with its white washed wood and unique details on the legs. We are foster parents and had little ones play and eat on this table leaving no evidence of it on the wood. It wears extremely well. The dining table is a FOREVER piece.", 
    "Love how the pattern hides dirt! I have two small children and don't have to worry about cleaning up all the time. Very solid durable table.", 
    "The unique character and solid table make this table a great statement piece. I get more compliments on this table than any other piece of furniture in my house. I have toddler twins and I'm not worried if they ruin this table because of it's rustic finish. It's perfect for an eat-in kitchen area!", 
    "love the rustic look...beautiful table", 
    "Received this table in less time than expected and was packed extremely securely. It is a VERY heavy and beautiful table. The Rustic Chic is just what we were looking for and looks AMAZING!! Love Love this Table", 
    "Wish the picture and description was more descriptive. The top of the table is wavy so plates wobble and wine glasses are not sturdy. Also can't find chairs. I like the look and it's very sturdy but I will most likely get rid of it.", 
    "Upon opening, you'll know it's the real deal due to the weight of the table top alone. Elegant legs sets this table apart from most. It's a little bit more white then I expected but I may add a few more grey shades to it. The surface can hold wine glasses without falling over. Thumbs up overall.", 
    "Simply stunning table... Everyone is in love with this feature in our dining room.", 
    "so perfect, exactly as pictured", 
    "I purchased this table for a dear friend of mine who has wanted it for a long time. She's a hard-working lady and deserves the best!!! It was a surprise! LOL She was thrilled, shocked and speechless, which is a first for her! She LOVES the table so much, she gave it 6 stars!", 
    "Read many reviews prior to buying this table. The table is awesome. to clarify the look, it is rough sawn, and white washed. a reviewer said it looked like fake distress...No, those are blade marks. The table gets compliments constantly, but it fits our coastal (not beach) d\u00e9cor. we used white wooden chairs with the table. stunning! well made, heirloom piece.", 
    "I like this table and am growing to love it. In the picture it looked amazing but in reality other than being sturdy it's not rustic matte in a sense of it's been worn but more machine made. The paint/coloring is not as pictured. I love the distressed look of it but the way it's been painted is not what I imagined. I have gotten many compliments on it by friends. I think with the right chairs and decor it will look great regardless. It's a timeless classy table that later on you could sand and stain to something different.", 
    "I am so happy with this purchase. Extremely heavy table and is a solid piece of furniture. It is definitely a lot more whitewashed that I thought it was going to be, so if you are looking for a more natural wood table I wouldn't get this one. I myself was pleasantly surprised as to how white the table it and am absolutely keeping it.", 
    "This table is awesome. It is a conversation piece. The top is like a zebra strip with white and beige and a small hint of brown. I am in amazement. So glad I waited until I found something unique!!", 
    "Absolutely beautiful! We were amazed at the quality and the weight. The picture doesn't do it justice. Probably one of the best purchases we every made! Thank you Overstock for the quality you offer your customers.", 
    "Gorgeous table !!! Super heavy !!! Everyone that sees my table loves it !!! very easy to assemble", 
    "The table is beautiful, but the table top is textured, with distressing, and not flat across as it appears online. In addition, the white distressing is a lot more pronounced than it is in the pictures online, and the table also has a high sheen to it. All in all, heavy, nicely constructed table but NOT the same finish or texture as pictured. Will look to return.", 
    "This is a life time keeper. Hope to always have this table. Modern, elegant and great quality. I love it..", 
    "Our white table arrived in a large beaten-up box...unpack it outdoors if you have the space--unless your trash people take almost anything, be prepared to get rid of lots of styrofoam and cardboard. The inner box was in OK shape. The table has 2 wooden support bars underneath the top; one was knocked sideways (obviously before packing) and the metal brackets were ripped out of the top and the screws sheared. We bent the brackets back and installed new screws. These supports are probably not needed anyway, as the top is so sturdy. Washed the table before bringing it in--it was dusty with black powdery dirt (probably from the black metalwork that holds it all together) imported directly from India. If did your homework, you'd know that this table weighs approx 140 lbs, not 300. Once you bolt the legs on, it is easy for 2 strong men and a small boy to lift. lol. No, there were just 2 of us, and one of is neither strong nor a man. The finish was exactly as shown in the picture, with lots of striations and a geometrically distressed top--that is, in our case 7 x 1\" groups of planing running the length of the table and 3\" perpendicular groups running across between them. The legs are quite stripey. It looks beachy, beautiful, casual, and the shape is very graceful. The contrast between the shape and the finish is exotic. The surface of our is not too uneven, but quilted placemats will fix any inconsistencies. Get over it, people, it's supposed to be rustic. We put 2 large upholstered chairs on each side and none at the ends. The results are inviting and stylish.", 
    "beautiful table. legs easily attached. Sturdy and heavy. Looking forward to years of wonderful family meals and games played around this tale.", 
    "This table has received so many compliments! I was searching for a ZG/RH type look and feel without the massive prices, and this table was absolutely perfect. I purchased the white. One thing I was not expecting was the top of the table has ridges. It is not completely smooth on the top. But, it's not bad! I just didn't expect this. Like other people... it is SO SO HEAVY! I could barely move the box around myself. You will need minimum two strong people. But it is so worth it. It is so great! I used 4 chairs and a bench and its perfect!", 
    "This is such a great table in many ways. The color is very pretty & rich along the the classy look adding so much style to my kitchen. I found the perfect nail head tufted chairs that couldn't be a better match. Adds a custom look to the room. Great quality & price too.", 
    "The table is made well, heavy and stylish. It goes great in my new dinning room. I paired it with orange dinning chairs....a great look!"
