    "after only three years with another click clack purchased at overstock that was poor quality, we finally purchased this one and are so thrilled. the quality of the fabric, the comfort of the foam cushion, and the structure of this sofa is perfect. well done.", 
    "We researched this purchase for a long time. Assembling furniture is not my forte, and for the most part I didn't like the looks of the futons we could afford. But this one looked really nice. I read all the reviews and they were good, but I was still nervous. It arrived today and I put it together in no time at all. The packaging was really impressive. Everything was tucked into a zippered compartment underneath, and all the little bolts and washers and Allen wrenches were blister packed. The instructions were clear, all the holes lined up, and it looks great! Very pleased with how it looks in our little home office, and quite satisfied with the comfort.", 
    "Needed something quick for a guest and thought this looked very nice and hoped it was comfortable. Easy to assemble, looks great in our office, and the guest slept wonderfully on it!", 
    "Just as I expected,the futon is really comfortable,very sturdy and very nice.I would definitely recommend to anyone", 
    "Nice comfortable for one person", 
    "It's a nice looking little \"settee\" but will obviously not stand up to constant use. I was looking for something for the TV room but will move it upstairs to an office/library/exercise/escape room that doesn't get used all that much...except for exercise. It's also only 70 inches long and would require a pillow topper to be comfortable for a guest. So will go looking for another for the TV room.", 
    "Easy to assemble quality look and feel", 
    "Perfect for our grandson's bedroom. Parts all sealed so none missing which is great ! Easy to assemble.", 
    "I ordered this Futon shortly before Christmas to put in our new family room. It arrived earlier than expected which was a surprise being so close to the holidays. This Futon has really nice the fabric its durable and looks great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it sits lower than I would like.", 
    "I was disappointed that this is really a very short twin bed. I am 5'2\" and if I stretch all the way out I cover the length of the thing. There is an uncomfortable spot right in the middle when sleeping. The fabric is good. The color is true chocolate. The cushion is actually good. It's little & cute. I would only use it for a small child. Such a disappointment but not worth keeping for my purposes - a sleeper for grown up guests.", 
    "Bought it for my spare room/office and it looks amazing. Comfortable, and very classy looking. Bought it for when our granddaughter comes to stay overnight! We love and!", 
    "We like it a lot. Super easy to assemble. It is light and quite firm but for the kids in the basement it is nice.", 
    "This Futon came on time and was exactly as advertised. The leg assembly came with clear instructions and I put it together in less than 15 minutes by myself. That's unboxing and everything.The back of the futon adjusts from the upright position to the horizontal position with ease.Highly recommended!", 
    "Super easy to put together, very nice. I highly recommend it!", 
    "This is a nice looking futon. It is not the most comfortable, but will definitely do the trick for guests staying a few nights (and really, do you want them to stay longer?). I have a mid-century inspired office (I live in Palm Springs after all) and this fits in nicely.", 
    "Firm, but not uncomfortable. In fact, can be made quite comfy with the addition of small pillows [for your lower back] a quality throw blanket, and an ottoman. Color is true to picture. Fits right in with the retro decor in my lounge/den area. Great size for small studio or office space, and a perfect sleeping solution for guests! Besides opening up [flat] to a bed, it can also recline another notch.", 
    "Loved it, exactly what I wanted, great price easy to assemble"
