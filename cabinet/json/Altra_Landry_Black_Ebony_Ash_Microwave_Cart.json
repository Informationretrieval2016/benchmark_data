    "Very sturdy and nice accent to my kitchen. Also helps with putting away items so that there aren't any unwanted items on counter.", 
    "This was a disappointment. Way to low to the floor. If you ate over 4 feet you may get back promblems bending to warm up your meals.", 
    "Very basic item that fulfills the need of wheelchair user.", 
    "This definitely serves it's purpose. I complain I have is the doors are uneven and there's no stops on the rollers so the cart rolls all around. Other than that it's been great.", 
    "Easy to install and perfect size.", 
    "I was very disappointed with the product ,a very poor made.", 
    "nice size for my kitchen and keeps microwave off counter.", 
    "Saw this item & knew it would be good for my kitchen, especially the cost since I was not trying to spend too much. When I received it and my husband put it all together I was not happy at all. It was so small I could hardly fit the things I had in mind for it. But I guess I get what I paid for.", 
    "Very good quality I'm happy with my purchase", 
    "I like this. It looks good and gets the job done. It could however be a bit more sturdy.", 
    "I would have given this a higher rating if it had been easier to put together. Especially given the fact that it would have been easier if the instructions had been clearer and a little more comprehensive! It's just ridiculous to provide \"instructions\" that still leave people having to guess about some parts of the assembly!", 
    "average product looks just like the picture. the cabinets are nice to hide tupperware", 
    "Looks great and easy to put together. It says Microwave cart but I use it as a tv stand and works great.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Perfect size.", 
    "Nice cart easy to assemble."
