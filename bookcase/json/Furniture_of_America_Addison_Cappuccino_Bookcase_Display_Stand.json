    "Very nice piece. I am glad I bought it. It is very sturdy and looks nice. The instructions are decent but it is fairly easy to get a piece turned the wrong way. There is lots of hardware but it is well organized. Nothing was missing. It is easy for one person to put it together but does take a while.", 
    "I was a bit scared that this item didn\u0092t have a review, and that other, more expensive bookcases/display cabinets had some bad reviews. But it is much sturdier than I had imagined. I didn't need to secure it to the wall. Came in excellent condition and in only 5 days. The color is slightly darker than the picture. Easy to assemble, you might need more hands when installing the racks. Only thing you should pay attention to is the back bars and which side to use; it is not clearly stated in the manual. Having quite a bit of experience in this area (I assembled almost all the furniture in my house) I wasted a few minutes on the back panel. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap contemporary display stand.", 
    "I really like this unique looking stand. I am glad I purchased it.", 
    "Very sturdy. I didn't put it together, but the person that did said he had a little difficulty. I like that it's open and not closed in. It's very stylish .", 
    "this is rather standard \"flat pack\" furniture, same basic construction and materials. It is pretty simple to assemble just take a moment to know what is going where and it will all go together in 20min. It will not take a full set of books since the shelves float, but for a display it works well and the design removes it from the standard basic seen over and over... Nice accent item", 
    "Other reviews stated how difficult this was to assemble. I almost passed on this item because of those reviews. But I liked the look to much to pass. I assembled this alone, just me. No Problem. It took me awhile but slow and steady and I completed this without a mishap. Directions were very easy to follow.", 
    "We purchased two of these for our new home, When my husband opened one of the boxes there was a large gash in one of the shelves from shipping. I was not happy, but after contacting overstock.com customer service they were very friendly and offered to ship out a replacement part. It took about a week which wasn't ideal, but overall the friendly service made up for the extra time. Love the look of these shelves. Very different and add something special to the look of our home!", 
    "What an awesome display shelf. The style of the item is so unique and makes all my decorative pieces stand out. The item looks very rural and western. It brings a more home-like atmosphere to the room. The item arrived in good condition. No scratches or damages to the panels and contained all the hardware. Assembly was fairly simple and easy to do. A drill gun made it very convenient and quick. The final outcome was exactly as shown in the picture and did not come across any issues. Each of the shelves has been holding up to moderate weight placed on it. The whole unit feels very sturdy and stable.", 
    "Great addition to my office. Great color and style.", 
    "Good product. Had a problem getting the screw into one shelf so had a replacement shelf sent. Service was very good. Lots of e-mails keeping me informed as to the progress in getting it sent out. The shelf looks great. Very happy with the product.", 
    "This bookcase looks just like it does in the picture and a great value. I looked endlessly for a bookcase that was unique but not unreasonable in price. This fit the bill. The only issue is that I put it together alone and it does take some time (granted, I didn't have a few of the pieces put together correctly-- pay close attention to the directions). I would definitely recommend this!", 
    "Fairly easy to put together 0 only took 4 hoursPeople love it - have gotten several rave reviews so far", 
    "Looks great. Fairly easy to assemble and maintain. Very happy with design.", 
    "I was very nervous after reading the reviews about assembly. It is definitely a two person project and someone needs to know something about craftsmanship and putting things together. Luckily, I had someone and we finished in about 2 hours. The base was the toughest part to assemble. I am very pleased with the finished product in my living room!", 
    "Fantastic wall unit. Love the shape. Perfect height. Was very easy to put together, around 40 minutes. You need two people though. Delivery was fast and came in excellent condition.", 
    "Overall happy with the shelf. Sturdy, contemporary look, fairly nice size but could be a bit taller. Assembly took some time, but was easy and it's good to have a second pair of hands to help. If you like the style of this shelf you shouldn't be disappointed!", 
    "I was looking for something a little different and this filled the bill wonderfully. Every one that has seen it has asked where I bought it. I am very happy with how fast it got to me and the ease of putting it together. It looks like it has always been in my livingroom.", 
    "This is a beautiful piece of furniture, easy to assemble (if you pay attention to the instructions), very sturdy, in a nice dark cappuccino color. It looks elegant, and much more expensive than the price we paid for it, you won't be disappointed with this bookcase.", 
    "This is actually a beautiful piece. It doesn't look cheap and it's sturdy. My son put it together and some of the tips earlier buyers shared helped quite a bit. Beware of some of the holes not being drilled through far enough though. The only thing I don't like about it is the vertical piece that comes right down the middle of the front of the shelf. Be aware that the shelves only can be arranged one way (I thought I could turn the unit around, but the back side is unfinished).", 
    "Putting it together was easy. Took two of us hour and half.", 
    "Great price for a great product. We love it and guest love it too.", 
    "I really do like this product. It really brings out our living room! We love it! People who come in always compliment it! The quality is great. It was easy to assemble. We are really pleased with our purchase.", 
    "A very good looking product. Really appreciated by my children and friends. It has filled up a place in my house.", 
    "i like this stand a lot. it is a little darker, almost black, picture made it look lighter. i use this stand to display my doxie figurines and it is working out perfectly! very sturdy!", 
    "Great looking shelf. It was a little tough putting it together alone but I managed just fine. You will need two people to move shelves once put together. I assembled my shelves in the general vicinity they were going to set so I could move into place.", 
    "well im no handyman at all, so I'm always prepared for battle when it comes to assembling furniture. I must say itll take at least 2 hours if a second person is not there and one mistake (which i made) might cost you to disassemble almost the whole thing. so in my experience is worth the money and the effort cause the end result is amazing!!. I'll add my experience and mistakes so hopefully you new buyers dont make. First make sure you have all your parts, I did, and are nice and labeled in letters so you can count and see if you have them, i liked that. Second Pay attention to the pictures VERY carefully because there no written description just pictures. my pieces 2 and 3 where labeled backwards but they are the same pieces holes and everythign so youll be fine just had to switch them up which kinda throws you off during the later phases but no big deal. Clean your shelves off small wood debri inside holes, itll save you an hour and patience, and last make sure your big holes on parts 2 and 3 are facing the back of the piece not front, i made that mistake since the picture had no drawing of which holes faced where( i guessed wrong lol). but i must say it wasnt that hard took me 2 hours by myself with help im sure its way easier!!. enjoy delivery was fast pieces well protected also and love my shelve!", 
    "This thing is a bear to put together and I am handy with this. Let's just say, they made it as complicated as they could think to. This thing had assembly pieces I have never encountered on all the assembly required things I have ever gotten. Granted, some of the sturdiness might be because I think I missed ONE DOWEL on the top, and once I figured it out, I was NOT going back and undoing everything I had done. Maybe one day. In any case, the bookcase is just too unique and pretty to give it less than 4 stars. In fact, I'm getting another one right now since it's available again. I will probably just figure out a way to modify the first one I got to make it sturdier. Based on all the reviews of how sturdy it is, part of it was me missing that one dowel, but I know for a fact part of it is the damm unit they sent because some of the implanted pieces came out from each other...hard to explain, but I assure you it wasn't user error. Anywho, give it a shot, its an awesome piece. Just read the instructions carefully and have more patience than I did when you put it together so you don't miss a single dowel. Then you'll do great and love your bookcase.", 
    "Very happy. Only took about one hour to put together. If you are looking for something unique that you can't find in your usual chain super stores this is it. No problems with delivery, no damage...another great buy from Overstock...", 
    "I looked all over for display stands and I wanted something different and unusual. This stand fit the bill perfectly. I love it!", 
    "I purchased 2 of the bookcases. I really like them. They look great in my livingroom. Kinda sheek. Easy to assemble. Heavy duty, Looks great.", 
    "It looks great. It took a while to put it together, but I did it on my own in about an hour. Different and complimentary in my living room. I love it.", 
    "This unit is nice for a book case use but instead I'm using it to showcase picture, air plants and nick nacks. Just beautiful!", 
    "Love my new bookcase - it was simple to build and offers an interesting stand to display everything; books, photos, art pieces, candles, tv.......amazing! It has been the perfect addition to my home office.", 
    "This was a little complicated to put together, but nothing two guys couldn't figure out pretty quickly. It adds a modern touch to my living room.", 
    "We love this shelf unit!!! We do agree that it does take two people, some good music and drinks to put it together. I would say make sure you pay attention to what goes where because it is easy to get confused. Other than that it looks great and is perfect for our kitchen!", 
    "assembly took a bit of time. not terrible. I used this for the cats. nice alternative to the big carpeted things.", 
    "but looks pretty good. Maybe a little cheaper look than I wanted but not bad at all. reasonable sturdy.", 
    "This Display stand looks great. It's very unique and I love it but, It is very hard to assemble because even though the pieces are numbered, they don't explain which side goes left, right, or up. Basically the directions could be much better.", 
    "We ordered a set of two and we like them. these stands are nice n compact not too bulky", 
    "This is a sturdy piece of furniture that looks great. There is plenty of room for some plants, knick knacks, books or whatever. Real cool looking piece.", 
    "I personally could not handle putting something like this together, so I had 2 of my brothers do it for me. It took them about 30 minutes with no hiccups. Excellent piece for the price. Looks great in my living room. Now to fill up the shelves. Def recommend.", 
    "I purchased this bookcase for my 25 yr old son...he loved it!! Awesome piece..as nice as it looks..very unique..durable construction..everyone has complimented and asked where he got it. Well worth the money.", 
    "I was able to out the piece together by myself fairly easily and am pleased with the way it looks.", 
    "although it was super tricky to get together for one person - I did it - but it was challenging. I love the look and that it's different from the regular old shelves. Well worth the price!", 
    "I love this bookcase. It provides display space, without creating a heavy, bulky look on the wall.", 
    "This was a bit of a challenge to put together on my own but we'll worth the effort. Exceeded expectations.", 
    "Purchased for guest bedroom. Also using for plants. No cons. Great value.", 
    "A little over priced in my opinion, but its nice. It's a beast to put together, so leave yourself some space and time. You'll also need a buddy to help hold things as you screw bolts in. For some odd frustrating reason, they didn't \"finish\" the back piece of the bookshelf, its partical board looking. They should have done this. Regardless, I'm happy with it.", 
    "The product was as described. Just like other reviews I read before purchasing, it was difficult to put together. :) The drill hole covers disappointed me a lot. Stickers just doesn't cover it. Looking on my own at a few local hardware stores for some sort of substitute. Thanks Overstock! Half of my home is furnished by you. Until we meet again.......... ;)", 
    "Nice looking display stand -- but be prepared to spend the whole afternoon putting it together. Instructions terrible. They didn't show front of stand from the back of stand. We would up taking it apart three times! Also there were no holes predrilled in the stand for the back hinges on the bottom. Must be affixed to the wall if you have toddlers. That being said, it really is a beautiful piece and we are happy with it.", 
    "I liked everything about the display stand once it was assembled but the assembly was a little difficult. Over the years I've assembled many products and this was definitely the most difficult. The reason is that the screws supplied for the major portion were not long enough so I had to go to two hardware stores before I could find ones that fit. Other than that it wasn't too bad.", 
    "This piece helped to break up the long wall in our living room. It is made of nice, rich looking wood. I was able to put this together by myself. It took about 4-5 hours total because the directions only had pictures. I had to take my time to make sure the per drilled holes were in correct alignment. Overall I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend to others.", 
    "I bought this for my son's new house. He was able to put it together with ease. It was shipped fast !! He is very happy with it!!", 
    "Looks very nice. Easy to assemble. The color a bit darker, which is actually much more what I had in mind so I am very happy. Would highly recommend!", 
    "Impressive packaging, couldn't be damaged during shipping. It was difficult to assemble, as other reviews indicated. I had to drill two holes which were not pre-drilled. Very sturdy and attractive.", 
    "I badly needed a display shelf to put things on in my livingroom. I wanted somthing contemporary, attractive & with lots of space. This definitely fits the bill. Putting it together takes two. It isn't complicated but does take some time . If you pay close attention to the ample instructions, you will be pleased with the finished product & feel it was worth the time. I couldn't wait to put all my \"stuff\" on it as soon as we finished & moved it to the space we bpught it for. My Husband came into the livingroom later that evening to look at it & said, wow, that really looks nice.. That says a lot coming from a guy. We both like it's style & feel it is an attractive, comtemporary addition to our livingroom.", 
    "This item is great. I love it. The putting together part, I didn't love. There are 8 steps to the directions and it took me (by myself) 2.5 hours to get that part done. I needed to get a friend to help with the last 2 steps since its such a big item. Very happy!", 
    "I have been looking for an item similar to this for months - finally found it at Overstock. It is perfect for my needs and looks great in my living room with plants, pictures etc. displayed.", 
    "I took a chance on this shelf given that the \"cappuccino\" color seemed lighter than I wanted. But I saw another picture of this shelf on another site and it appeared darker than the picture on Overstock. And WHEW! The color is actually darker...it's closer to an expresso color than a cappuccino color. But that's what I wanted!!! It was a pain to put together - but then again, it was just me putting it together. I'm sure it would go easier with another person. All that work and it was worth it. I looks like a little piece of art in and of itself. It's unique and I get tons of compliments on it. The shelf is stable/solid and doesn't wobble. And of course the price was right!", 
    "I was looking for a non- traditional bookshelf. I wanted to put it on the leaving room area. Finally, I found exactly what i wanted at Overstock.com.", 
    "I absolutely LOVE my new book shelf with its more modern look! I had to hire someone to put it together and it took him about 3 hours and $30. Was worth it. Am enjoying my latest overstock.com purchases.", 
    "I love this bookcase. It's such a unique piece and really makes a room! Putting it together took a little work (definitely takes two people) but no more then most furniture you purchase online. Great purchase!", 
    "OVERALL VERY NICE STURDY DISPLAY STAND! SHIPPED & PACKAGED NICE,NO DAMAGE HARDWARE NICELY PACKAGED & EASY TO LOCATE PICTURE DIRECTIONS,NEED TO STUDY THEN ASSEMBLE HAPPY WITH PURCHASE!", 
    "This bookcase was purchased for an odd-sized room in a hospital that we use for meditation and quiet time. We looked at many different pieces, and this one suited all of our needs. The measurements given were spot on. Because the room was oddly shaped, we had to be very mindful of space planning, so we marked the dimensions with tape. When the bookcase was put together, it fit exactly within the tape. The design is unique, and that is what was our deciding factor. The piece is solid and looks far more expensive than the price. I'm not sure how easy or complicated it was to assemble, because one of the guys who works in our Maintenance Department helped us out with that. It took him about 45 minutes to an hour. This piece is the focal point in the room now. We use it as a display/ storage unit and not for books. Because it's a relaxation area, it holds items like a CD player, salt lamp, lotions, a reed diffuser, etc. Baskets are used to store the CDs and other items. We are very pleased with it and have gotten so many compliments on the piece.", 
    "Love this piece, looks amazing in my living room. Down side: it took my very handy husband hours of frustration to put this together.", 
    "I really like this shelf. It is not solid wood, as indicated in the description. I was looking for something less expensive yet unique and this fit perfectly. I get a lot of compliments on it, its unique enough without being totally eclectic which is what i wanted. Its sturdy enough to hold display pieces. Sturdy enough for my purpose, but certainly not as sturdy as a real solid wood shelf. Great price. Took about an hour with a friend to assemble. Because of the size I needed help assembling it, but its not difficult. If you are looking for something in this price range, I would recommend this shelf.", 
    "The shelf looks very nice though some of the joints could have fitted better. One of my joints was a little off 90 degrees, but it's minor enough that other would probably overlook it, but obvious enough that I would notice. I didn't like that stickers are provided to cover the screw holes-- perhaps plugs would have been appropriate given how large some of these screw holes are. Again, I don't think they are terribly noticeable. The unique design is distracting enough to draw attention away from these little details. Overall, it's still a nice display stand that looks very nice in our living room.", 
    "As other reviews said, it was a bit tricky getting this put together (and I'm one of those weird people that loves putting furniture together!). The fronts and backs of the pieces are labeled which led me to guess (and guess wrong) a few times and have to back track. But I don't think it took me more than 30-40 minutes to finish all by myself (35 year old woman). And the finished product looks great. I wouldn't fill every shelf with books but add a few decorative items here and there and it'll be the perfect balance. I'm quite pleased with this purchase!", 
    "I really like the look of this product. The dimensions are exactly as described on-line. It was a bit of a challenge to put together only because it is a little heavy. I would recommend two people for best results. The quality is equal to the price. In one area, the applied finish was loose and threatened to peel back but it came with glue for the dowels and I just used a little bit of that. It is very sturdy! it comes with enough hardware and brackets to make it so it doesn't sway. The rails and shelves are very firm. It can hold quite heavy items. I have it in my dining room and it is perfect for glasses and plates. Over all, I really like the piece.", 
    "I am in love with this shelving unit. I was considering a ladder bookshelf for something more airy than a traditional bookshelf, but loved how unique the Addison is. It looks very expensive and is a great compliment to the rest of my furniture decor.", 
    "it fit our room very well both for the color and design. we like it.", 
    "I purchased 2 of these to put side-by-side since they were being placed on a long wall. The look is amazing and decorating ideas are limitless. Very pleased with these shelves and assembly wasn't so bad.. I recommend this product highly.", 
    "It's a lovely book case, and quite a conversation peice. I get lots of compliments. The shelving unit is not as sturdy as I had hoped that it would be. I mainly bought it to hold my collection of pottery. If there were holding books, I would be a bit worried about the stability of the shelving due to the weight. Otherwise, I am happy with the purchase.", 
    "I originally had been looking at the Ladder bookcases and the one I wanted was out of stock. This ended up being a great stroke of luck as I stumbled upon this piece and absolutely LOVE it. It is the perfect size for my room and looks gorgeous in it. My boyfriend put it together and it took him about 15 minutes. I use it for books, a lamp, picture frames and a plant. I like this piece because it is unique and a nice change from the ladder bookshelves.", 
    "The bookcase came packed very well. It took my husband maybe 30 min to put it together. I was a little concerned about the color in the picture, I thought maybe it might be to light. But was very pleased to see that it is more of an expresso color and goes with our living room furniture beautifully.", 
    "Gorgeous bookcase! Definitely something different and looks much more expensive than it actually was. Beautiful and goes perfectly in our living room without taking up too much space. Our living room is a mix of traditional and contemporary, and this is the perfect blend. We've received many compliments. Now I just need to get some decorative items to put on it!", 
    "It really is a lovely bookcase, looks great! The instructions are clear, howhever, I would not recommend it if you are not a handy person, or if you don't have experience assembling furniture. It took us about 4 hours to put it together. Otherwise, it looks good, it was my first order from overstock and the delivery was without problems and fast.", 
    "Bookcase took a little while to build but looks great. It looks nice in our living room with some other furniture from Overstock. A quality product that looks like it should have cost a lot more than I paid.", 
    "I bought this bookshelf because of the sleek design. It took my husband quite a bit to put it together but the end result was fabulous. The bookshelf looks nice with my new furniture.", 
    "Overall, this is a very solid piece of furniture. I put it together, alone, in approximately 2 hours (with one mistake on my behalf which caused me to back-track). As with most furniture that requires assembly, the directions are pretty useless, but good enough to get the job done. I would recommend this piece to anyone looking for a unique display piece/bookcase.", 
    "My husband and I assembled the unit without too many glitches. It looks lovely in our small living room, adding a lovely accent without crowding the room.", 
    "If I didn't have to go through the trouble of re-packing I would have returned this product. I love the 'look' of it but it is very unsteady, and I never had such a difficult time putting something like this together. VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT TOGETHER, TERRIBLE INSTRUCTIONS!!! I've purchased other items from Overstock and was satisfied, unfortunately, this was not the same experience", 
    "This was a SURPRISE birthday present for my daughter. Purchased and delivered in March. May4th at 2pm we opened to the box to assemble while my daughter was at work to SURPRISE her for her birthday. The description says 13 inches deep. BASED ON THAT I purchased this shelving unit so it would accommodate the tank sizes. 13 inches would have given the tank and extra inch so it would have fit perfectly. The shelves ARE NOT 13 inches deep but rather 11 inches deep! SURPRISE RUINED! She will be home in two hours I have NO time to go to store, purchase and assemble new shelves. Thanks a lot Overstock!", 
    "All came together well, but took quite a while to assemble. Seemed a little flimsy once put together, maybe that is why it had a bracket to attach to wall.", 
    "Although I do like the shelves look in my home office, the pieces did not fit together snugly. One might argue that I did not do an expert job in putting it together. But at 47 years old, I have put together numerous pieces of furniture from numerous manufacturers. Some of the bolts and screws in this one \"jiggle\" around in their corresponding slots, so I am not putting nearly as much weight on each shelf as I had hoped to do. In addition, the assembly manual was much harder to interpret than other manufacturer's manuals (most notably Ikea's). The manual diagrams aren't explicitly clear, and the letters and numerals marking the various pieces were either faded or not present at all. The result was significant guesswork, and the installation of a few pieces backwards, which I did not realize it until I was so far down the road that drilling new holes was preferable to dis-assembling what I had just done. In the end, the shelves look exactly like they did in the picture, and I am happy to have them in my office...and if the manufacturer corrected the issues above, it would be a stellar product.", 
    "Among the poorer instructions to come from a Chinese factory. Minimal-to-none language, too many schematics crammed into small diagrams, and you have to read thru the entire instruction set to avoid a 50% chance of attaching one of the main base pieces 180 degrees wrong (even if you do, it's not a fatal error). Milling precision is okay, but they make no effort to clean the debris from their dowel holes, etc. If you don't clean them out manually ahead of time, you may have trouble with some of the fasteners. Can be used as a room divider (I am), but the side with the fastener holes uses cheapo decals to cover them up. You may decide it looks better with the holes exposed. Be aware that the color is a very, very dark brown, but not black. The finish is semi-glossy, simulated (and phony-looking) wood grain, which the decals don't really match. Ultimately it's a question of whether you like the design and are okay with a middling-quality finish. I do, and I am, so I'm satisfied. It's sturdy enough for most bookshelf/room divider purposes.", 
    "Quality is poor, on assembly holes weren't drilled deep enough on numerous holes which slows assembly greatly because you have to drill but be careful not o go to deep, instruction ok not to good", 
    "The bookshelf itself is alright. Doesn't look quite as classy as it does on the site, looks a little cheap. But assembly is required, and I followed all the directions to a T, and on the last step none of the screws fit. Literally tried to figure out everything, but just had to send it back. It was a big headache. I would try something else instead.", 
    "it is a nice looking shelf. the original color is darker than the picture. it took me and my husband about 6-7 hours to assemble it. one of the pieces where the screw was supposed to be fitted had a wider hole and the screw just went in and could not be retrieved through the hole. peg is now supporting this site without the screw. with the result that the long arm of the third shelf edges is slightly movable because of the defect in construction. also the top bars do not approximate completely on two points (despite application of significant pressure) so the angles are not smooth and this is noticeable from a distance as slight space between the longitudinal and horizontal bar which I find a bit disappointing and have thought about covering with black tape. the end result is a good looking shelf with some flaws. it is good to keep for a couple of years I think, though with the price I had hoped that it would last longer.", 
    "Very difficult to assemble. Instructions poor and I found that I had to redo several section. Of course, when I thought I was done - I saw that I had one side on backward. So.... next time someone visits - this goes to the basement. Had it not been so heavy and taken so much work to take apart - I would have sent it back. So... it is basement bound."
