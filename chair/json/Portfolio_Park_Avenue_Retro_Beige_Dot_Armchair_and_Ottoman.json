    "This chair set is a great deal for the price. It is not super-high quality; the fabric is thin and seems likely to wear quickly and the padding on the arms is fairly minimal, but it looks good and is actually quite comfortable. It's not a squishy sink-into-it chair, but the seat and back are comfy and provide good support. It's just wide enough that I can tuck a leg under myself. Not great for those who like to sit sideways in chairs due to the thin arm padding. The ottoman is a good height, just a hair shorter than the chair. The seat is too deep front-to-back for a short person (I'm 5'4\") to sit with back against the chair back and feet on the floor, so short folks may need to add a throw pillow against the back for optimal comfort. The fabric colors are muted and blend well with nearly any near-neutral or earthy palette. The fabric, as mentioned before, is not as thick as standard upholstery fabric and my cat managed to snag it with his claws by just jumping off of it within 24 hours. I don't think I'd recommend this chair set for a household with young children due to perceived lack of durability. Assembly (which consists of screwing in the legs on chair and ottoman) was super easy. The hardest part was getting the chair out of the box and into the house all by my lonesome. Still, I think this chair is a good value for the price, feels solid and definitely looks classier than many other chairs in this price range. It would be nice if the same style chair and ottoman set were avilable in a selection of solid colors.", 
    "OK guys.. I read *ALL* the reviews here regarding this prior to purchasing it. Some good, some bad. I made a decision, and went ahead and purchased it. The price couldn't be beat I figured. It was a great price, and the shipping can't be beat anywhere! I received the chair in 5 days in a **HUGE** box from UPS. Upon opening it I became very happy when I started to look at the chair & ottoman. IT IS LOVELY! I am soooooooooo pleased with this! It is simply the cutest and most adorable combo I bought! It fits right in with everything perfectly. The color is great! It has a beige background with multi colored dots. I will admit that the fabric is not extremely thick, but it feel durable enough to sit in it frequently. I love this so much! There was very little assembly required, all that was needed was the feet to be put on each piece which took 5 minutes! I am sitting in it right now as I write this and it feels great! The back comes to almost the top of my shoulders and I am 5'5\". It is a nice fit, and very comfy! I give it a great recommendation!", 
    "This is seriously the worst chair I have ever sat in! After only a few months, the entire chair and ottoman have balled up. The material is just falling apart. I called and Overstock said they only give a 30 warranty. My chair and ottoman is so uncomfortable, we have to place a blanket over the chair and ottoman. I have never seen anything like it. The chair has to be thrown out, after less than a year. So disappointing because it WAS so cute and it really is comfortable. I just wish Overstock would have been able to help me a few months back when I called.", 
    "Love it! Soft and matches my decor perfectly. The colors; however, are much lighter than the picture indicates... but is not at all a bad thing. Almost came completely assembled except for the feet which just had to be screwed on - so to me, anything that I don't have to put together deserves an automatic 5 stars!", 
    "I was a little skeptical about this product after reading some reviews, which stated the fabric was too thin. However, since its delivery, I have been really delighted with this product. It looks just like the picture, the chair is nicely firm, and it makes a cozy and comfortable corner to watch TV or read a book. Really comfortable and cute-looking - great purchase.", 
    "Chair is comfortable & stylish. I use it as reading chair. Screw on legs very sturdy and easy to assemble. Came in a single box, and the UPS man even carried it upstairs.", 
    "I bought this chair about six weeks ago to go with a brown leather recliner and a taupe colored microfiber sofa. It was the PERFECT addition to my living room. The colors are not too bright at all and it is really comfy. I highly suggest it as an additional living room chair if you already have some basic, plain colored furniture. It basically gave me the color scheme for the pillows and art work. I absolutely LOVE my new living room and I get rave reviews on the chair every time someone walks in the door!", 
    "I converted a small bedroom to a home office, and I wanted a small chair and ottoman for reading. I ordered the chair/ottoman on Monday, Jan. 18 and received it the morning of Jan. 21. That is pretty darn quick! While I was waiting for delivery, I had second thoughts about the furniture being too big for the space. But I am very pleased that it is the perfect size.Easy to put legs on and the pattern's colors are beautiful Be warned that the seat cushion is attached to body of the chair, so vacuuming may be a challenge. All in all, I love the furniture and would recommend it if you have a SMALL area to put it in. Steve in Peoria, IL", 
    "I love the pattern and style, but it does not wear well at all. I've had it for 6 months and it looks like 26 years!", 
    "The chair itself looks awesome. but over 3 - 6 months the fabric on the chair started to fray and seat cushion was getting lump. We now need to have it reupholster which probably cost more to do then the price of the chair itsself. Overall, it is a great looking chair if no one sits in it.", 
    "But it sure looks great! The fabric is great quality and the dots are really fabulous. It's not very cushion-ey, though, and the back is slightly reclined (with no head rest) so it's not the world's most comfortable. If you want a decorative piece this is the chair for you. If you want a chair to cuddle and nap in, this isn't quite comfy enough.", 
    "Overall, I am pleased with this chair. The colors and pattern are great and it is pretty comfortable. (Although the back of the chair is pretty low, so if you", 
    "I just received chair and ottoman very unhappy with material, very flimsy, colors were pretty just what I wanted but the right arm was broken during shipping or put together wrong at the factory. Do not think I will reorder", 
    "As described online. Love it!", 
    "Love the colors in this chair. It matches almost any sofa color", 
    "The most disappointing part of this purchase was how copletely dull the colors really are. It looks worn and dingy instead of nre and bright. The colors in reality just don't pop, it looks so different in the picture. In my living room it looks like an ols piece of furniture...I'm not pleased", 
    "Good for the money back to low for me.", 
    "Love this set!!!! Very comfortable, good looking and perfectly matches our interior!", 
    "This chair is really comfortable. The back is a little short for people over 5'6\". A great chair for a smaller room or apartment. The price is right and a hard find with an ottoman.", 
    "This began a whole remake of my living area for the better. It is comfortable and cute. Very unique and the color palette is muted but easy to accent.", 
    "I just now purchased a replacement chair for the park avenue chair & ottoman. Cannot believe it was almost 5 years ago that I originally purchased this chair. The chair is still in useable condition but now has a small wear mark/tear in the cushion. I now have it on a porch and my dog lays in it. I would buy this again but just went for a new look in the replacement.", 
    "Very cute chair. fits nicely into my small study. Love the print.", 
    "I wanted something fun and unique for my loft area. This was just the ticket! Colors are right on w the web pix. It's very firm yet very comfortable. I love the ottoman. It's a nice finishing touch. W five kids I think it was worth the money. Not too pricey if they wreck it and definitely not cheap looking for the price. Actually considering buying a second.", 
    "Chair is cute. Seat is uncomfortable - like sitting on a hard bubble. I don't expect it to last too long.", 
    "Yes, the fabric is a little thinner than some upholstery, but it even took an attack from the cat and held up. Love the muted colors and it picks up the colors in the room well. In our game room, the red stands out, in the living room it is the blue you notice. It is the perfect reading chair.", 
    "This chair and ottoman are beautiful but they do not wear well. They started pilling soon after I received them, and we barely use them they are in the formal living room that gets very little use. They would be best seen but not used :(", 
    "I needed starter pieces for my first apartment. I'd searched the site and feel in love. I showed the set to my mom and told her it would be a great set to go with my sofa sleeper. She got it and ive enjoyed it every since. It sets well and had no problem with assembly.", 
    "Great chair. Great comfort. Adds \"happy\" to the room.", 
    "Very nice looking, but the material was loose on the arms of the chair.", 
    "This item is just what we were looking for. It fits perfectly in our living room.", 
    "Ok... I am very satisfied with my purchase. I am a retired high-end furniture rep and I think I know a quality piece when I see one and this chair is quality and the price? What a value and they ship it free. How can anyone go wrong? I plut the chair in my study and was so impressed I ordered a matching side chair to go with it. I am looking forward to many more purchases from Overstock.", 
    "I have this small corner of my bedroom that I wanted to make into a private work/reading area. I looked all over for a smaller type chair that didn't cost a lot and had no luck...then I thought \"why not try Overstock.com?\" This chair is PERFECT and it was a bonus that it came with an ottoman! Some reviewers describe it as \"stiff\" and it is a bit but I like that in a reading chair, keeps my back from getting stiff like some overstuffed chairs can do. The color looks almost exactly like the picture, in fact I guess I was anticipating being disappointed with the true color but much to my suprise...it looks even a bit better! I LOVE my chair & ottoman. The only thing I would say is that I am 5' 4\" and it fits me just perfect. I don't think my 6'3\" husband would be very comfortable in it. It is made for shorter people, I would say. I LOVE It! PS: I LOVED the FREE shipping...wow!", 
    "Well,after reading tons of reviews and browsing the web in search for a perfect chairs,I decided to go with these (I ordered a set of two).So first of all they arrived very fast,like the next day.It was pretty easy to assemble,just screw the legs and here it comes the beautiful chair set.The pattern is not as bright as you may think.The polka dots have all kinds of colors - grey,blue,rusty,red,yellow.So it really will go well with any king of furniture finishes and shades.The only thing I wish is for fabric to be a little more thick than it is.Anyway it's a good buy which fits the bill just right.", 
    "Great chair for the price. Wish the fabric was a little bit thicker in quality. Quick delivery in quick assembly would recommend to others.", 
    "We bought this chair for a bedroom and it has been the perfect addition. We have received many compliments on it.", 
    "It took me many months to decide on this chair and ottman. I am so glad that I decided to get the chair. It is lovely and the colors are very true to the pictures. The cushion is firm and very comfy. I am extremely satisfied.", 
    "The couch looks great, the quality is OK, nothing special. The problem is it is not comfortable at all, I hope the cushion soften over time..", 
    "Good chair for reading,knitting and relaxing. It is defintely a chair for women, because of the short back. My wife loves the chair.", 
    "Love these chairs and very comfortable to sit on. i looked in the furniture stores of similar and just couldn't find anything close to this one. Very fun, I ordered 2 - they really make the room.", 
    "You get what you pay for. The color is very dull. Matches everything. Not a chair to set in everyday.", 
    "Bought this accent piece to go with a chocolate sofa and loveseat that had green and orange pillows. This went perfectly with the set.", 
    "This set is in our home office and it is beautiful. It was very easy to put together and is comfortable to sit on.", 
    "For a bedroom piece that will get occasional use, this is perfect. Comfortable, not oversized, good value. Other than screwing on the legs, no other assembly required. Packed well for shipping.", 
    "love it! My cat has already scratched up the fabric, but I knew that was going to happen when I ordered it. It is soooo cute!!!", 
    "Perfect accent chairs for my small living room. Do not seem like they would withstand a lot of wear and tear.... but a good product for the price.", 
    "I put these in front of my fireplace with a small table between them and they look great. My home needed a splash of color and these give it just that. I like that I can accent them with an array of colors. I'm very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "Great for an extra chair. Would not want it to be the chair I spent hours in everyday.", 
    "I saw this chair on another website for 125.00 more than overstocks price. that and 2.95 shipping were too good to pass up. Some other reviews said they thought the fabric was thin, I disagree. I think it's fine, but I don't have small children or cats so ..... The only thing I don't love is the back is really low and the seat cushion is super plump so you have to be a fan of sitting up straight! Even so,I do like it for reading and I'm short so I can curl my legs up, but it's definately not a chair you'd fall asleep in.", 
    "My husband told me not to order this (a poka dot chair!); but I told him to trust me, and he's glad he did! I came to our door in 2 days, and matches the colors in my bedroom perfectly-and is comfortable!", 
    "This is a very cute chair and ottoman. I bought this for my bedroom so didn't want anything too big and overpowering and this set fills the bill. The back of the chair is fairly low - the top comes to the middle of my shoulders and I'm 5' 9\". The fabric is a little like hessian although I don't think it is cheap looking as some reviewers said. I wouldn't buy this for a main sitting room as I wouldn't want to sit in it all evening but it fits my purpose very well. The background is a little darker than it appears on my monitor and the other colors a little more subdued.", 
    "We ordered two chairs and ottomans along with the 5-year accidental damage coverage. The chairs and ottomans were shipped very quickly, and we were surprised at how quickly they arrived (< 7 days after ordering). Some people have mentioned that the fabric seems thin, and I can see how it might look this way, but the fabric is just a looser weave and is, in fact, upholstery fabric. The cushions are a little stiff right now, but they haven't been sat in much and will be broken in over time. They're accents chairs in our family room and only get sat in when we have company. The chairs seem very sturdy and since the cushions are stiff now, this hopefully means that the cushions won't breakdown too quickly. The pattern is nice for an accent chair and the colors are muted; the chair isn't overly busy. Overall the chairs are a good quality.", 
    "Well built, like the legs, color is different than I thought background is beige. Very nice chair for the money", 
    "I was extremely disappointed when the chair and ottomen was unpackaged. Before it was assembled I knew that I had made a hugh mistake in this purchased . Both were of inferior quality and workmanship and it looks as though it may last 6-months wear time. I truley feel I was deceived and overcharged for the product I received. Buyer Beware!", 
    "We bought this chair and ottoman to stage our house to sell. For this purpose, it works very well. Nice looking, and colors are great in that room. If we had purchased the chair for long-term use, I would be disappointed in the thin fabric and cheap materials.", 
    "This was my first purchase from Overstock.com.My sister, the recipient was very pleased with her gift.", 
    "We purchased this chair because we wanted an accent chair with some color for our new loft in Philly. It's perfect for the price. We found others we liked for over *** and didn't want to spend that much on a chair we may only use for two years or so. The fabric is a bit thin, but the color and description is exact and we are very happy with this purchase and the fast delivery!", 
    "Nice chair, kinda knew what I was getting from other reviews. I just love the polka dots and had to have the chair. Should hold up well and work for many years to come!", 
    "Very cute chair, and comfy. Perfect accent chair...I wouldn't use it as a primary chair, the fabric is not designed to handle that, but it gives the perfect 'pop' to a room if you are looking for an accent chair. Arrived quickly with no damages. Happy I bought it!", 
    "Ok for the money, no tax and cheap shipping this is a great buy, we bought this for moms new apt digs, and it goes great in her senior studio apt!", 
    "The product has been in my house for 1 week and thus far I am very satisfied. Although the pattern is a bit busy, it fits perfectly with my current decor. The fabric seems a bit thin/delicate and I am worried about wear and tear. However, no children are in the house so I expect it to last some time. I originally order a chair & ottoman set from a local furniture store. But after several deliveries with damaged pieces, I cancelled the order. Ordering from Overstock was a much more pleasant experience. I placed my order on 10/17 and it was delivered on 10/24. Assembly was extremely easy (screwing legs on) and the chair is light and was easy to move to the upstairs office. In addition, the cost was $180 less than another online store.", 
    "This chair is great for small living space - it is a very nice accent piece too", 
    "The colors were not as deep as in the pictures, but pretty accurate. The chair is comfortable and great for the corner I put it in.", 
    "The chair you see is the chair you get. The colors are exactly as shown in the o.co photo. I've had this chair for almost a year and although it has a few little nicks in the fabric, it's held up nicely. This is the chair my roommate sits in when we watch TV, so it gets a lot of use. The seat cushion has lost a little bit of its firmness and one blue dot in the middle has a thread hanging from it, I'm guessing due to a grommet in someone's pants that snagged it. Overall, it's a cute piece and really made my drab living room much more cozy by adding a little pattern. When I bought it a year ago, the price was higher than it is now, so if you're leaning toward getting it, JUST GET IT! This is one of my favorite O.co purchases.", 
    "Love the polka dots in the fabric, colors very close to picture. We bought two for a study/library. At first I was afraid the fabric might be too thin, but they both seem okay. Got lots of good feedback on how cute these chairs are. I would reccomend these chairs.", 
    "I think this is a great chair and ottoman set. The colors are versatile and can go with many different things and I find it to be very comfortable. Others have described the fabric as wearing easily, but I've had the chair as an only piece of furniture for about 2 weeks now, I sit in it daily and it seems to be holding up to me. The cushion does not remove so to safe guard against spills or stains since the color is so light, I sprayed a couple of coats of scotch guard on the chair and ottoman just to be safe. I wish the price was a little lower but since it comes with a chair and ottoman, I suppose it's a good deal. Other than that, It is cute, comfortable, and very easy to mix and match with many different colors.", 
    "Makes a great extra chair. very comfortable, this will be my reading chair by fire this winter. Good value for money.", 
    "I really was hesitant on buying this chair but read all the reviews and decided to do it! I received the chair within 5 days and loved the chair even more in person. The dots are bigger than I expected but I like that and the color is really beautiful with my Taupe couch--they work really well together. The chair took me 10 minutes to put together--I only had to screw in the legs on the chair and ottoman--very easy! The only problem I had was that one of the ottoman legs was stripped so I had to have a replacement sent out but at no cost to me. All-in-all, I had a great experience and would buy from Overstock.com again. I hope this review helps you!!", 
    "I bought this for my brother in law he is a little man and the chair otaman fits him to a T . Nice design and comfort I think it is a steal for the price. He loves it as do I", 
    "I like the chair. Its firm. But alittle small. Overall the price was right and everything is good!", 
    "I love the style of this chair. The colors are exactly as they look in the picture. This chair is not the most comfortable I've ever sat in, but for the price, it's fine. It's a good reading chair. The back is quite low, so don't expect to lounge in the chair, unless you scoot yourself down. I've only had it for a few months, so I don't know how long it will last. The upholstery looks nice, but the material is thin and the stuffing seems lumpy in a few places. All in all, I'm satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "Great Product from Overstock.com I would reccomend the item to everyone.", 
    "This chair is wonderful for the need it serves. While not a heavy duty item, it is a wonderful complement to the decor of the room. The material is of medium grade but again perfect as an accent, not really for regular use. The price was great, and it was delivered in days right to my door in a big box. All I had to do was screw on the legs. I love the rounded shape of the hassock. I loved working with overstock.com. Very easy and great service.", 
    "Delivery extremely fast!!! Chair and ottoman match room perfecctly. Low back to chair but I anticpated that. Ottoman very comfortable for stretching out. Only concern: material seems a bit thin. There were loose strings, as others have experienced, that a clipping w/ scissors resolved. But, if chair is to be used often, I would reconsider. I am very pleased with the purchase. All in all, great value for the price.", 
    "Totally great!!! Easy to put together, and comfortable, love it.!!!", 
    "speedy delivery, quick set-up, good quality and great price! color is true to image on website comfortable chair that fits perfectly in nyc apt the only reason for 4 stars is that the seat cushion is not removable/reversible (but I knew that from other reviews)", 
    "We were looking for a chair for our nursery that wasn't going to break the bank. A little risky to purchase a chair online (as we tested plenty of less expensive chairs in local stores and they were terribly uncomfortable), but for the price, we decided to try it. This one is surprisingly very comfy, and although it doesn't rock, it's still perfect for the baby's room. And it looks beautiful!", 
    "We ordered this to streamline our living room. We had a much larger, bulky (yet comfy) chaise recliner that just overpowered the room. This chair and ottoman fit perfectly and add just the right touch of modern sophistication to the room. The back is low so it's not a chair for reclining or napping in. It is a great set for watching television, or reading. I can see this as being a lovely addition to rooms (other than the living room) such as a den or even a bedroom. The colors are soft and muted (not as deep, rich as the colors in the photo) and the cushion on the seat and back are pretty comfortable. Be cautious on the arms however; they do not seem to be sturdy enough to sit or lean entire body weight against.", 
    "This chair is one of the first pieces of furniture you see when you walk in the door. It has such a unique look and very playful design. I've had many compliments! The fabric is thin - almost canvas looking until you get closer and see that it's just thin fabric. But, still beautiful, and very comfortable. I love sitting in the chair and reading books with my feet up on the ottoman on lazy Sundays.", 
    "We purchased this chair and it is great. We have had it for.about a month now and we still get great comments about it. Not only does it look great, it is built strong. The fabric is a little more thin than I would like. We use this as an accent chair and don't sit in it on a regular basis. So I could imagine if you where to use this as your primary seating it would wear out quicker.", 
    "I had been waiting to purchase this chair until our home office renovation was complete. Did not intend to buy from O.co only b/c it didn't come up via search engine (other e-tailers sell it under a different name...but stock # the same). So imagine my excitment when I found the same exact chair for $200+ less than everyone else online PLUS is was only $2.95 to ship even though it's oversize!!! Other etailers charge more and offer 'free' shipping or charge less but $150 to ship. O.co is AWESOME!! The chair is AWESOME...super comfy and perfect for the space we bought it for! Just thrilled all the way around! Thank you O.co!! Off to search you for a small side table to go with it!!", 
    "The chair is very cute and fits my decor. However, the cushion does not come out and the seat began wearing immediately upon use. I am the only one who uses the chair and I sit it it about 10-12 hours a week and now I keep the seat covered by a towel to 1) cover the bad look of it and 2) to keep it from deteriorating more. There are huge strings and picks from nothing other than sitting on it and no...I don't weigh 200lbs. I would not recommend it to anyone. Sorry!", 
    "I love the way this chair looks in my office but it's not the \"cuddle up and read for hours\" perch I'd hoped for. Still, a good buy for the price.", 
    "So happy with this purchase. Great, muted colors. Helps pull in more color for my living room and would be a great chair for a children's room or nursery in the future! Lots of compliments already!", 
    "The fabric is thin and pills easily. The seat cushion could stand to be a higher density because it is starting to warp however, we sit in the seat almost every night and has held up well. Great deal for a chair and ottoman though! Easy to assemble.", 
    "While I was not excited that the chair did not arrive as guaranteed for Christmas, my mom still ended up loving it when it came. Its a great size for an added touch of jazz in the bedroom.", 
    "So I got this chair for my bedroom. I watch tv and do computer work in it. the fabric is thinner that you would expect but its not so thin to be of concern. This fabric will pick easy if you have dogs that like to dig or cats i would recommend a different chair or a room where they are not allowed. The only thing I found about the chair that was a bit disappointing was that it was uneven, the chair wobbled. but it was an easy fix, I just put to felt pads on the front right leg and the back left leg and bom problem solved. I love it the colors are true to the pic and easy to match to existing furniture. I am in the process of getting new furniture for the bedroom and cherry stain looks great with this chair. the price on this chair goes down sometimes so i would watch it for a few weeks before purchasing.", 
    "Great chair for the price, I couldn't find any accents chairs for less than $600 that was to my liking, except for these and I got two for less than I could even buy one of the other ones. I have purchased furniture from other reputable furniture stores and I've learned to not just look at name brand furniture. The color is pretty accurate on the picture and I was super excited to get a good deal and at the same time awesome chairs. My formal living room is complete now!", 
    "Fun, comfortable chair. Not superior construction, but good for an entertainment center-basement. Looks just like the picture - and sites an adult comfortably. Good purchase!", 
    "Absolutely Love It!!!! I was concerned about the color of the dots when I purchased the chair, but the pattern is very mutted and not bright at all. I love it so much that I am considering ordering another one.", 
    "It is a truth universally acknowledged that nice chairs must cost one a good fortune. Thus, I am all astonishment at the quality of this chair and ottoman for the price! Oh, a chair such as this! It is not merely tolerable. It is overall very pleasing to the eye and serves its function with aplomb.", 
    "The chair and ottoman are perfect for our guest room! The colors are just as seen on your screen; it is light, good looking, and a firm seat. The fabric may wear over time as it is not a heavy upholstery fabric, but for a guest room it is absolutely fine. I would not hesitate to suggest this chair for purchase.", 
    "After searching for a modern chair and ottoman for over 4 months, I was pleased to find this on overstock. The price was great and looks great anywhere in our living room. It's very comfortable and I spend alot of time working on my computer in this chair. It does have a tendency to snag if you let a pet or have anything sharp on the chair, but it's impossible to see it because the pattern is so varied. Great buy and would recommend it for anyone!", 
    "This chair was a great addition to our reading room. It's comfortable and an all out cute chair. There have been many comments that the material was to thin, but I didn't feel that to be the case at all. It was a great chair for a great price. I'm even thinking about buying another one for my living room! I love it!", 
    "Extremely fast shipping! I received this product about 3 days after ordering. The chair looks pratically identical in person as it does on the site. The background color is more of a tan, rather than a white...which I am happy about. All I had to do was screw on the legs. The only downfall is, I wish the headrest was a little bit higher. Regardless though, its a perfect addition to my living room.", 
    "This is a great set. Good quality and quite comfortable. Very good price for the quality and quick shipping.", 
    "This was super easy to assemble and looked even better that I had hoped. I do agree that the chair back is short and the material could be a little thicker, but I was honestly expecting to be disappointed and I love this chair. I am not sure how it will hold up over time, but I am very pleased with the quality.", 
    "I love this chair, and it is a great pop to our living room. We needed something on the smaller side, and this is small while still being big enough to have room in (and I am very pregnant and still find it comfy) The only drawback, and why I only gave it 4 stars is that like other ratings, the fabric is a little on the thin side. There were some loose strings that needed to be cut, but overall, I am very happy with this chair and ottoman. It adds a great pop of color and pattern to our room. For the price, it was a great purchase.", 
    "This is a very comfortable chair and I haven't had problems with the smell. It did smell when it first came out of the box, but that faded in a few days and a few weeks later with some fresh air it's completely gone. I use it all the time as a reading chair. The only real complaint so far is that up close the fabric looks like it's pretty thin and I'm worried that I will wear it out quickly from using it so much. Time will tell and I'll write back later to say.", 
    "As others have said, the chair is pretty, but not made for anything but occasional use. It's fits a spot in my family room perfectly, and is brings a lot of style to the space, but the fabric is thin, easily snagged, and is an uncomfortable chair. That said, it certainly makes up in style as an accent piece.", 
    "This chair was bought for our family room. The colors fit with our newly remodeled room. It's a nice extra chair, but would not recommend it be the main chair. The fabric does snag easy-I've caught it on my rings. It is comfortable but not one to get cozy in. I am pleased with it for my purpose and would recommend it under these conditions.", 
    "This chair and ottoman looks great in my new family room. I have no complaints. Delivery was smooth, assembly was a breeze and it looks great. The cushion is not removable but that's not a deal breaker. Based on some of the other reviews, I thought the fabric was going to look very thin and cheap, but in my opinion it looks just fine. I would recommend this chair.", 
    "I was very pleased with the ordering process, the delivery process and the friendliness of the website. The delivery personnel were kind and thoughtful enough to place the order at my back door behind closed gates.The packing of the chair and ottoman were very sturdy and the items were wrapped in plastic to prevent tears, cuts or other damages.Overall, I am very pleased with the processing of this order.Thanks, Wendy", 
    "I love the chair and the LOOK of the fabric, but the fabric itself seems to be a little thin (cheap) . I worry that it won't last very long. BUT, it was a great price.", 
    "This chair is super cute in fabric design... the legs were very easy to install... really not install, but twist right on... A couple of drawback to this chair is that the backside does not offer super great support for tall people. if you are looking for a lounger type chair, I wouldn't recommend this style. Second, the seat cushion is NOT removable... other than that, it's great as an accent chair or for extra seating for guests.", 
    "Color and fabric seem well represented by the photo, however the product does not appear as well constructed as I thought for the price and the cushion is NOT removable. Product comes with legs detached from the chair and the ottoman, but assembly was basic.", 
    "OMG loved, loved this online, was so excited to receive it to match other furniture. Was very disappointed the fabric was horrible. Very thin fabric, seat cushion can not be removed. Feet of the chair and ottman stained my carpet. Wish I would of sent it back. Will never buy furniture again from overstock.", 
    "I bought this for my daughter as an anniversary present. She loves it and was happy to see in person the backgound color was a little darker tan. The pictures when shopping for the chair made it appear to be white. We shopped around and found this to be an excellent value and glad we checked the web site as others had the same chair for quite a bit more money plus shipping.", 
    "The chair was delivered in a ripped carton to a unsheltered driveway in the midst of a rain storm. Thankfully the chair was wrapped in plastic in the carton and did not get soaked. There is a covered patio in the back that it could have been more safely left at. The under side of the chair arrived with a rip in it, and the colors are much more muted than the picture shows. The chair is fairly comfortable and seems to be sturdy enough . I am not as thrilled with the purchase as I had hoped, but find it adequate.", 
    "This Chair is my favorite piece of furniture in my whole house! I have gotten so many comments on it...Its so decorative & usable at the same time. Very relaxing and so cute! LOVE IT!!!", 
    "I love the look, colors are great and the size is perfect. I needed a set that was not oversized and this is it! My only complaint is the fabric quality. It is a bit thin and I don't think it would hold up well for everyday use in a family room. I am using them as accent chairs, just to fill a corner and they are perfect. They are comfy and I think the price was great for the set.", 
    "An excellent choice. Stylish and compact.The fabric gives it an updated feeling.", 
    "I am an Interior Designer and I bought 8 of these chairs thinking it would look great in a doctors waiting room and when I got them I initially thought great, but as took a closer look I noticed I can see through the fabric. The makers has used a cheap fabric and managed to pull it so tight you can see through it. When you sit on it for a couple of minutes you quickly realize that at any moment the fabric could (would) tear. Also, shoe or marks that you might get on it will show and would be hard to get off. As for the colors, it is a bit more muted than in the pictures, but it still looked good. I give the lifespan of this chair 3 months if you use it on average.", 
    "I love my new chair.It came on time and in great condition. It looks good.", 
    "This chair is perfect for a corner or lightly used area as the construction is definitely cheap. The profile is attractive, however, and quite comfortable for the price--the slightly curved back has good lumbar support. The seat cushion is attached, despite its look as a loose seat. I bought it planning on re-upholsering it and it's a good thing I didn't want it with the factory fabric. 1) The pattern is stretched and slanted in some areas; 2) the matching at seams is not very consistent; 3) only a couple of seams have welting so the look is somewhat cheap.", 
    "I ordered the chair after months and months of searching for a reasonably priced chair and ottoman less than 33\". The fabric was right on per the thumbnail picture and the colors were perfect. The only thing odd, is the seat cushion isn't removable although it has a zipper. Anyway, I am very pleased and the delivery took just a couple of days.", 
    "I think this chair is really great for the price. It's definitely more an accent chair and not for everyday sitting. The pattern is great, and I don't think the fabric is as cheap as some reviewers think. I don't think you're going to find many chairs w/ottomans in a trendy pattern for this price elsewhere. Probably the only negative is that the seat cushion is attached.", 
    "We bought two chairs and they look great in our living room!! They are very cute, but beware, they are not super comfy. They are only somewhat comfy, but for some, like me, the cuteness makes up for it.", 
    "I got this chair to go with my microfiber dark rose color couch. The chair really goes well with the couch and is very comfy. I also love the ottoman. I am thinking of getting a second chair. Some of the downsides are the fabric isn't as high a quality as I would have hoped for but still good and it also sits very high for the height of the arm rests (ie the arms are low). Overall the chair is a good buy.", 
    "When I opened the box and pulled out the chair, I was extremely pleased. The chair looked great and is comfortable but the quality of the fabric is questionable. We've had it for only a couple of months and it already looks worn.", 
    "overall I am very displeased with this chair. I received it in a timely fashion but it does not appear to be new condition. in fact it has fabric stains and loose threads and definitely appears to have been used and sat in repeatedly. the sides of the chair appear to be faded by the sun. I am very disappointed.", 
    "The chair is nice looking and the colors are similar to what they appear on screen. It is not high quality but is great as an accent chair that won", 
    "I purchased this chair after having searched and searched for months for the right fit. It was ordered on a Sunday and came to me in a HUGE box on Friday, all for super low shipping and handling. All I had to do was screw in the little legs on both the chair and ottoman (super easy for me, and I", 
    "I am very pleased with this chair and ottoman set. I ordered 2 sets and was pleased that the fabric dye lot matched. They add a spirited accent to any room. They could go with just about any soft color, including light greens, blue-gray, rust, tan, beige, and browns. I also bought the retro dark moss sofa with the matching pillows. Not really because the pillows have the same fabric, but because I knew the color, dark moss, had to match with the chairs."
