    "I bought this chair for the midcentury style. I ordered it in oatmeal which is a brown tweedy fabric and is soft and smooth. The chair is large so you need to plan on enough room for it. The seat is wide and you can curl up in it with plenty of room. The back is firm so I added some soft down pillows for just a little more comfort. I ordered them on Monday and they were here on Friday. You have to screw on the legs which can be tricky as they splay out and I had to move the legs around to get some of them to position correctly and I wasn't sure if they should point to the side or to the corner. Ended up pointing to the side and making sure they were as tight as possible to get them in that position and that worked best for these legs. They probably should point to the corner? The come with a rubber spacer to help tighten them and level them and that helped. Found them on several other sites but Overstock had the best pricing and color that worked for me. Overstock offers them in some colors at a two for price that saved a lot of money. When I ordered them on Monday Overstock didn't have the Oatmeal at the two for price, but on Friday that changed and the color was added at the two for price. I called customer service and they worked it out so I got them at the lower price. Note: Pricing has changed on the two for so if you want these chairs watch for the discounted price. The dimensions are off in the description. The correct dimensions are 40 wide 33 deep 32.5 high. The seat is 27.5 wide 24.5 deep. Love my chairs.", 
    "When the chair comes you have to screw on the legs. that is fine except they won't screw on tight, they are constantly spinning themselves the wrong direction and it looks really strange because there is a strong angle to the leg. Because of the movement of the leg the chair leg broke after using it for one month. It's very bulky so I haven't decided if I want to deal with the return or go out and buy new legs for the chair. I will probably do the latter, but for now this expensive chair is sitting in my garage and my car is in the street... I would stay away from this chair.", 
    "easy to assemble. comfortable. looks just like the pictures.", 
    "Beautiful design, made well and very comfortable. High quality.", 
    "Legs were easy to attach. Very comfortable, although it could use an ottoman to match.", 
    "Neat and comfortable chairs . Will not disappoint."
