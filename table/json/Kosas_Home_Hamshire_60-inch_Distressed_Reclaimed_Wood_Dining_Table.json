    "I loved the pictures of this table but not the actual table itself. I'm happy with the quality of the table its heavy and solid and weighs twice as much as my old wood table, but I'm very unhappy with the way it looks. The table top is paneled with a light wood and a dark wood which gives it a plank style look. On one of the darker planks in the center of my table there is a very noticeable circular taupe color spot that doesn't look right. It bothers me because it is large, about 2 inches in diameter. I thought maybe I got a bad table and contacted overstock and sent them some pictures. They said this is normal and part of the \"distressed\" look. Now i'm stuck with this table because it would cost too much to send it back. Overstock should use more accurate pictures especially for large furniture items like this.", 
    "love, love, love my table!", 
    "This table was impressive and just as nice as something I had my eye on at restoration hardware. You must like variations in the wood in order to like this. If you are truly looking for a reclaimed wood love you will love this table", 
    "The table is a little darker than I expected. The lime wash does add little hints of green so expect that. Because it is a rustic table.....the top is not completely level but I like that. Overall the table is beautiful and what I was hoping for. Assembly was easy as well. It is a very heavy and sturdy table.", 
    "The tabletop and legs are quality, solid wood. The way they're put together is less than quality. They put screws through the wood joints, the bolt for one of the legs wasn't even long enough to be useful, and one of the braces under the table was unattached. Way too much money to spend on something that requires you to use your own hardware. Too heavy to send back."
