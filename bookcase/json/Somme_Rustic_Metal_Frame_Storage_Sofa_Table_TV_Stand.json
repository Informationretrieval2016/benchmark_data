    "Took me about \u00bd hour to assemble and is extremely solid", 
    "Nice quality, easy to assemble. Looks sharp.", 
    "hi i bought the tv stand and media shelves, its very dark, like a dark brown, not this lighter brown as shown. check your size as they are pretty small as well, so this would fit a small apartment needing smaller furniture.", 
    "solid and easy to put together. looks as pictured. using this as a sofa table and it is a nice addition", 
    "This very stylish TV stand was exactly was I was looking for. It has a simple sleek rustic-modern design that looks fantastic. It's understated yet created an instant update in our family room. It was a bit heavy and the shelves were challenging to assemble into the frame, but once set up it's a sturdy and gorgeous piece. Also, you cannot beat the price!", 
    "I am very happy with this purchase - bought to use as bookshelf in living room. It is deeper than a standard bookshelf which is what I was looking for. Good quality materials and very easy to build.", 
    "I needed some storage for my office and decided this would work well to hold my printer, a lamp and some baskets to hide some of my supplies. I was originally going to get a very large bookcase that was tall and wide, but I decided to buy two of these because they are more versatile if I ever change my mind about where to put them in the house. I can see them behind a couch, in a bedroom or even as storage in my kids' playroom. I bought two since my space is large and they are beautiful! Very sturdy, gorgeous wood and a BREEZE to put together. I did it myself and only needed help with putting the middle and bottom shelves into place. I would highly recommend this.", 
    "I'm using it as a TV stand. It is a solid piece of furniture. It took about 20 minutes to assemble. Looks nice, but slightly overpriced. I'm happy with it, but it had a very strong chemical odor that took about a week to dissipate.", 
    "This TV stand is very sturdy and very heavy duty @ 80 pounds. I've searched for a year for something with the right width with shelves that wouldn't bow. Went together by myself in 15 minutes. Wood is very nice shelves are straight and sturdy but do read the directions and don't put all the legs on at once! the top is the heaviest wood piece and while I managed it myself this would be better with two people. Constructing it is a one person job putting the wood pieces on is a two person job but I did it all myself but put a scratch in one of the shelves because of it. Good value & lots of storage.", 
    "Love this very much. It looks better than the picture. Has the mid century modern style. I used it in my kitchen, and it fits in pretty well. However, this product like most overstock furniture, is shipped with defective. Good for me is that the defectiness in this one is not serious, small crack in one shelf's corner. Overstock needs to change the way it packages furniture, or it's gonna waste a lot of good furniture.", 
    "I spent a lot of time looking for a buffet for our dining room. I really didn't want to spend a lot of money. I looked at a lot of sites, comparison shopped and finally decided on this one. I just put it together and I love it. It was super easy and fast to put together, the wood is solid, sturdy and beautiful. Happy with my purchase!", 
    "Slightly more pricey than this product should be. But it does look good.", 
    "This is very sturdy and looks great", 
    "Quality furniture. We bought five pieces of the Somme Rustic Metal storage line as display shelves. Easy to assemble, sturdy hardwood and metal product. Highly recommend."
