    "I actually bought 2 of these mattresses for use in our toy hauler trailer. They fit perfect in the queen sized bunk beds that raise and lower!", 
    "I like this Queen-size mattress, plus very comfortble. My friends like this mattress too!", 
    "I needed a queen-sized sofa bed mattress to replace a worn, thin one. The thickness is good, but the length is entirely too long. It was longer than the mattress that came with the sofa bed, and I have to maneuver it in order for the sofa to fold up when the bed is not in use. Recommend that you re-check the length of your queen-sized sofa-bed mattresses.", 
    "This item is listed as \"Reversible Comfort 4-inch Queen-size Sofa Bed Sleeper Foam Mattress.\" Item was shipped and received in good condition; however, the listing failed to say that this mattress DOES NOT fit a sofa bed sleeper! We have two sofa bed sleepers and one queen-size bed in our house. The mattress fits NEITHER of the sofa bed sleepers; but, it DOES fit a regular queen-size bed. This mattress should NOT be advertised as fitting a sofa bed sleeper. And, once you open the box, cut the binding cords and try to maneuver the mattress onto the sofa bed sleeper, I dare you to roll it up again, tie it, and get it back in the box. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!", 
    "Replaced original sleeper sofa mattress with this one, added more use to sofa , very comfortable, no complaints form tenants!", 
    "Mattress is not of the quality it states, it is shorter than it states and the fabric around the form is loose and slips. Not really worth the price.", 
    "nice, comfortable replacement mattress. fit the sofa bed perfectly.", 
    "The mattress was too long. Hide-a-bed is standard bed size 72in, the replacement mattress is 80in. It is not as comfortable as I expected. Can feel the frame/bars a bit too much.", 
    "Shipping was very fast and free! Mattress smelled a bit and we left it for 48 hrs on top of our queen guest room bed. It fit perfectly on the sofabed and the sofa sits higher and more comfortable than before. HOWEVER, the review said it was reversable and had the same covering on both sides. NOT. One side is just plain plastic/vinyl covering. The other is lovely, but no problem as this will be used very seldom, it is for overflow company.", 
    "We were pleasantly surprised with both the product and the level of service that we received. The mattress is comfortable for a sofa bed mattress. It arrived well within the time frame that had been posted, conveniently wrapped and in good condition. I had never used overstock before but had my sister in law's recommendation to go by and I must say she was right. Based on this experience , I would definitely use Overstock again.", 
    "arrived as planned, well packaged, fit to sofa bed perfectly. very comfortable. well satisfied with purchase.", 
    "came as promised and fits the description perfectly. i an using it in my slide in camper perfect fit", 
    "The mattress is nicely made, but the size was not described accurately. It hardly fitted to my sofa, so I am glad there was no return."
