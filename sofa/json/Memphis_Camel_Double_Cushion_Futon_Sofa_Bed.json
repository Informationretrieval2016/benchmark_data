    "Love the look and color of this couch. It is easy to change to a lay down position. But it is hard as a rock.", 
    "Product surprisingly easy to install. Very good ROI, strongly recommended.", 
    "WHile this serves the pupose on our lanai for now, it certainly isn't something you want to curl up on and read for a few hours. It is very easy to assemble - just screw on the legs - but two screws were the wrong size, so we had to scavange replacements. Just not very comfy and not likely to hold up for long with the very thin, pseudo-leather fabric.", 
    "This piece meets my expectations. It arrived in a really bulky box but it turned out he installation was attaching four legs, easy enough that everyone can do it. the size fits my space well and set to bed or sitting positions needs no effort at all. don't expect it to be a soft sofa but the firmness is just right as a bed. So far, our guesses have been using it on a regular basis and works out well."
