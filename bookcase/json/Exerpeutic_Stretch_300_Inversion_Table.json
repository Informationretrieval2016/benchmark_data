    "I was amazed at how much relief I got after just a few days.The only problem I had was somehow during shipment the backrest had a tear in it.so I called the company where it was made and no problem they said they would send out a new backrest the next day.", 
    "I AM A WIDOW AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT PUTTING IT TOGETHER...IT WAS SO EASY WITH THE NUMBERED SYSTEM I DID IT WITH NO TROUBLE... NOW IF I COULD JUST GET OVER THE NAUSEA I WILL BE GREAT !", 
    "Arrived in a few days. Assembly was pretty easy, took maybe 1/2 hr. After I figured out the proper adjustment for my height. Took about 3 or 4 tries, easy to follow directions for use. After first use, next day had to my surprise some sore muscles through rib cage area from the stretch l'm assuming. Soreness Gone next day. Loving it.", 
    "When delivered the box was a mess. I was nervous. However, everything was fine and complete. Assembly was simply but requires 2 people. Use was easy. Feels total secure. I'm not a light weight but feel totally safe. I would reacommend this. Why spend more for a product simply because of the name? This does the same thing. Supports up to 300 lbs. And is substantially cheaper. Plus it works! My back is steady improving.", 
    "Overall, this is a very good product. It is comfortable, and I notice the significant reduction in back pain after I have used for the first week. Very simple design and I am looking forward to using it more often", 
    "we have two tables that we use and we purchased this for our brother who has back issues. the delivery was made within days, easy to assemble, and he has used it every day since. He loves the product and has already been feeling a difference in his back.....", 
    "I love Overstock! The last part of assembly I found a problem. The manufacture welded the adjustment pin incorrectly. I contacted both Overstock & the manufacture. Never heard from manufacture but Overstock could not be more helpful. After much back and forth to see if we could get the part ( I really did not want to disassemble the unit). I finally had to take it apart & return it. The new one came & no problem. The assembly is easy may need an extra set of hands for the back rest but other then that I like the product. It works just as I hoped and is really stable!. You cannot beat the price I looked at other units and for the price they appeared cheap, this one is solid & it can be folded to store. If you use it every day you may want to make sure you have space to leave open as it is a little heavy to more.", 
    "very steady, doesn't feel fragile and very easy to get on and off. I think it needs 2 people to put it together, it was very easy to put together between my husband and I.", 
    "I purchased this Inversion Table to help with my back/sciatic problems. Originally when I received the product, one of the foam handles was ripped so I immediately contacted customer service. They not only sent me a new replacement but made sure to keep me updated daily regarding the progress of them contacting the manufacturer for a replacement part. I use this table twice daily and have found it to be an excellent help with relieving my back issues. It was definitely well worth the price and made of quality material. I would definitely recommend this purchase to anyone that may be on the fence about buying one of these.", 
    "A couple of months ago I woke up with a crick in my neck which, over the next few days got progressively worse. My doctor husband did an X-ray and MRI, but nothing much showed up. Still I was in a good bit of pain so asked him what he thought of this product. He said it was worth a try, so I ordered it. It arrived in a few days and was easy to set up. I have used it now for three weeks and love it. It has some very good safety features, most notably a strap which does not let you go back further than you want to go, so if you are alone, it is not scary to use at all. My neck pain has almost complete disappeared. Of course I can't be sure that using this product was what helped ,but it certainly seems so. Plus it just feels good on the back and shoulders. It is very easy to get into and out of so if you just have five minutes you can use it for a little while. It is extremely sturdy and seems like a product which should cost way more than it did.", 
    "VERY sturdy, well built and exceptional value for the price. Very easy to assemble. My husband put it together in about half an hour. Its very comfortable and operates perfectly. The padding is thick and comfortable. I can't say anything negative about it. Its great! Don't waste your money on the expensive ones, this one is that good. It arrived in only a few days, sooner than the estimated arrival time. I would highly recommend this product!!!", 
    "Theres a huge variety of inversion tables this one is simple sturdy and comfortable. If you have back problems i suggest trying an inversion table. Inversion Tables can get expensive. Its a simple idea hang upside down so go with something that can hold your weight. Its the reason i chose this unit it was cheaper and heavy duty enough. Highly recomended.", 
    "I was very impressed with the quality of this product, especially for the price. I was encouraged to start using an inversion table as a mid-40's year old woman to assist to maintain a healthy posture. I have been very pleased with that advice and my subsequent purchase of this table. Definitely worth the money.", 
    "I looked at quite a few before making my decision with this. More expensive ones had plastic back which I didn't like,tubular metal not square like this and I love the look of this instead of plain black! I have upper pain in my back from all my days playing sports and just doing crazy things like jumping off houses and factory work for most my life has put a toll on my back. I bought a $$$$ dollar massage chair to try to relieve my back pain with very little relief. I always wanted a inversion table for about 20 yrs now just because the concept made sense. Well let me tell you this is the best decision I could have ever made!!! After a week I wake up with no pain whatsoever which has never happened! In fact I'm done with my review I have get on it now before I go to bed.", 
    "Excellent back muscle stretcher", 
    "So happy to find this here. Great value for the price!", 
    "I was able to put it together in 30 minutes, and my back feels amazing now :)", 
    "directions are confusing, product came ripped but they replaced the part quickly,", 
    "Bought this for my daughter and she said it really helped stretch her lower back muscles. Excellent for the price.", 
    "My husband is 6'4\" and weighs 200lbs. He uses every day and has for 6 weeks. He loves it and swears it's helped his back. Easy to assemble. No difference in movable parts and is used frequently.", 
    "Great inversion table. Foe the money this table was a steal.. Just twice on the comfortable machine and my back felt better than in years! Great buy from overstock...", 
    "It does what it is supposed to do. Shoes should be worn during inversion or the foot restraints may be uncomfortable. If you are seriously trying to recieve back relief you should look up and follow the correct instructions or injury is possible. A great addition to a personal gym or for entertainment... especially for the price. The frame is solid and can fold \"flat\" for storage. You get what you pay for, but this is worth the money.", 
    "I don't use this as much as id like to. But for the money it was well worth it. Ty Wendy", 
    "Great item. Heavy construction, easy assembly, comfortable.", 
    "I teach golf and have problems with lower back tightness. My Chiropractor recommended an inversion table and I looked into the Teeter Hangups brand because I'd seen it advertised. It might be great but it's also three times the price. I went with this model. It's well built. Was easy to assemble. Best of all it's GREAT for my back. Couldn't be happier. Not sure what you get for the extra money with a more expensive model. They all hang you upside down and that's the bottom line.", 
    "This product was extremely easy to assemble. It took me approx an hour to put it together. I'm a women and live alone and put it together on my own. The company makes it easy to put together by numbering everything and they even include the tools needed to piece it together. The only tricky piece putting together without assistance was when mounting the backrest frame, but I used my knee to balance it steady and it was on with no problem after inserting the first socket.. The product is absolutely amazing and works perfectly with an unbeatable price. It is a very good quality machine and feels extremely safe and sturdy when in use.. It is also easy to fold up and wasn't to heavy for me to fold and put in the corner of the living room when not in use. I think shipping said 64 pounds, but that might have been including the box, since it felt a little bit lighter.Overall, I had a really hard time deciding which table to buy, but I'm very happy that I went with this one. Highly recommended.", 
    "All it said to be for what its for.", 
    "Great Inversion Table, use it every other day, and feeling fantastic", 
    "Sturdy, easy to put together, we are happy with the purchase. Priced it out at nearby sporting goods store and best price was here.", 
    "Couldn't wait to get it !!!!!", 
    "Easy go put together. Easy to use. Great quality! Sturdy! I feel very safe on it! Our whole family uses it... Even the kids. I feel it working in my hips & lower back while I'm on it. Much cheaper than a series of Chiropractor visits! Great product!", 
    "My husband says this really helps his back.", 
    "Great inversion table. Easy to adjust and use.", 
    "great product as described", 
    "Wonderful. Sturdy and well worth the money!", 
    "we love this thing - why pay more", 
    "I never leave comments or reviews but I had to for this one. I've been lucky & never dealt with back & neck pain until this past March. Set my table up last night & couldn't even believe the relief after only one use! Wow! I also bought a Chiroflow pillow, water pillow, unbelievable how much of a difference they both made after using knee time! I totally recommend both products!", 
    "I keep this in my sewing room for when my lower back acts up. It doesn't take up too much room and is very easy to fold up and/or just move out of the way for me. It has been a life saver when my back acts up.", 
    "This inversion table is solid, safe, and reliable. The only part that wiggles a bit is the foot rest, but that wiggle doesn't affect how capably it holds the ankles and feet. I love this device. Leaving it set up works better than trying to stow it. While it does fold up a bit, I would not want to have to slide it under a bed or into a closet very often, as it is bulky and heavy. Still, ordering this model was a good choice and I'm happy with it.", 
    "Difficult to assemble.... the padded back is not as long as my old one... a 6' person's would extend beyond the padded part. eh", 
    "This was easy to assemble, though the tools they send are junk. Much better to use your own. Works great, nice look. I don't think you can beat it for the price!!", 
    "This is super sturdy and well made. Really big though! This does fold up and store also..", 
    "why pay more if you don't have to? can hurt ankles when you try to go bare skin but put on cushy sweat pants and no problem. I think I notice a difference in my back", 
    "Inversion Tables usually start at $$$ and go up from there. This model is definitely value priced. It is a no frills Inversion Table, but it get's the job done.", 
    "very strong & heavy(off course).", 
    "My husband uses it to relieve back pain. Once you get the right bar level,for your weight figured out. Easy as 123", 
    "Heavy duty, easy to assemble, works great, exceded my expectations. I'm loving it!", 
    "The product was delivered as promised and was very easy to assemble. The height settings on the foot rest was very helpful to find the right position to tilt yourself and return without assistance. My setting was 5\" longer than my height and my wife's was 3\". The adjustment is something you'll have to set according to your body type but very easy to do by trial and error. I was surprised how much better I felt after just a few minutes of being inverted. The only issue I have is there are plastic caps for the ends of legs resting on the floor. Two were broken upon receipt; they should be made of rubber instead of hard thin plastic. I am very please with this purchase.", 
    "love this table makes my back fee so good, very easy to put together.", 
    "Just what I was looking for. Not hard to put together. Sturdy product. Exceeded my expectations.", 
    "easy assembly. well made. still getting used to it.", 
    "Good price for a sturdy product. It's being used by my husband and my sister-in-law. They both like it a lot!", 
    "got disie the first time i use it didn,t read before trying hope it help my back pain don,t no yet think it might, if it does will save money in long run by not going too a charpractor, machine work like i think it should", 
    "Doctor said I had degenerative disc disease in my neck, so i bought this to decomress the discs. Within three uses my neck and back felt better and the pain from the compressed discs was almost gone. Now after a month i can say it really does work on back pain and even my posture seems better. I highly recommend this product to anyone with back or neck pain!!!!!", 
    "Excellent inversion table. Great value, sturdy construction, low price as well... Highly rated.", 
    "The inversion table is easy to assemble, although it would be easier if two people were involved. The results that I am getting are wonderful.", 
    "UPS delivered our package to our front door. Heavy box, well packaged. All parts, nuts, bolts, etc were included. Assembly went very well, about 30-45 mins. Using your own sockets and wrenches will speed that process along, however, a couple of make do tools are included. This is a very well built table. Mine was in perfect brand new condition. I adjusted it to where I could control my tilt by simply moving my arms above my head to tilt back and invert and bringing my arms back by my waist to tilt upright again. I must say, my back feels better after using it a couple of times. There are some instructions included that cover assembly and use in detail. Overstock saved me about $30 - $60 on price and shipped for ***. Much better through Overstock at my front door than at any local store where it would have been much harder to get home. Thank You Overstock!", 
    "I considered sending this back before I assembled it. I have osteoporosis and the instructions say it is not suitable for someone with this condition. I read the instructions and decided it could have a limited range of drop that should protect my back and legs. I use it for a few minutes every other day with the strap in place that limits the drop. It was easy to learn to control the speed of movement with the arms. I mentioned the purchase to my brother who wanted one. I still had not decided to put it together and keep it. I figured it would cost me more to send it across the US than buy another one. So I sent him one and kept mine. He likes his. The table was easy to put together (even for a 64 year old woman) and all necessary tools were provided. I don't feel I get full value yet but hope that improves after my next DEXA test.", 
    "Iam very happy with free shipping and it aririved in 48 hours. Thank you Overstock you guys the best.", 
    "Great product; just what the doctor ordered to remove my back pain. I use this for up to 15 minutes every other day and have not had pain in my back as I did without it.", 
    "This is a basic, comfortable table for a very reasonable price. The table itself is longer than most, which is a big advantage. If you are not interested in bells and whistles, consider this model. Assembly is a bit difficult, but the picture instructions are clear. If you pay attention to small things in the photo of the assembled table (e.g., the direction the brackets are facing), there shouldn't be a problem.", 
    "This Inversion Table is a very sturdy, well built, nicely designed product ! It was nicely packaged, partially assembled, and very easy to put together. Most impressive is it's strength, precision balance, and sturdy construction. I've had problems with my back for quite some time. My Doctor recommended X-Rays, MRI's, & nerve tests; basically the full gammet of tests imaginable, but no conclusive diagnosis. I've only used my Inversion Table for 5 to 10 minutes in the morning and again in the evening. I've only used it for 3 or 4 days and I feel some very pleasant relief to my back strain and discomfort. I'm going to keep using it, believe me. I'd highly recommend trying an Inversion Table to anyone who hasn't gotten any satisfaction from medical tests or other methods of relief (perhaps with your Doctors approval) and I'd certainly recommend this Inversion Table as a well built, well designed and affordable unit. And I was also extremely pleased with the FREE SHIPPING.", 
    "This product is Great. Delivery was fast. I'm a Very happy customer", 
    "Needs to include an Inclinometer to gauge the degree of inversion.", 
    "At 6'3\" I had some trepidation about this product when ordering it, along with some of the other more expensive ones, but figured it was cheaper than three visits to the chiropractor if my height wasn't an issue and it did help my back. I found assembly to be pretty easy as long as you ca handle the weight of the back piece. You might need help otherwise. There was a small tear in the side of the back which I choose to ignore. I found the height markers when adjusting the fee to be a bit off. If I set it to 6'3\" I can not even begin to invert without forcing myself back using the bars to push and then I can maybe get to 40 degrees (measuring the angle between where my back starts when horizontal and stops when inverted). If I set it to 5'10\" I can almost achieve a full inversion but come awfully close to my head resting against the floor. I wonder how it would handle anyone taller. Maybe where the fulcrum aligns with your body will keep your head hoovering just above the floor. Either way, I can't extend my arms very far and end up resting my elbows on the floor. I do wish it had some kind of neck rest that was adjustable. If I'm at a partial inversion my neck rests against the upper edge of the back piece and my head hangs back. I have had some significant improvement of my lower back after three weeks of use. My last doctor actually suggested that I go back in for another surgery so I'm actually pretty happy about this. However, I didn't get the upper back and neck relief I was hoping for, yet, but that my just be the limitations of inversion therapy and not a reflection of the table itself. I was impressed by the shipping.", 
    "Easy to assemble and gets the job done. Great value for the price", 
    "Just had the product. So far so good. The service is excellent, the price is great, it arrives very quickly. The shipping is free even though the product is huge and heavy. Another online company was going to charge us $60 for the same product to ship. We would be happy to recommend this product.", 
    "Why spend more when this has all the functions of a 300-400 table", 
    "I think that this is one the best inversion tables that I have seen for the price. It folds up and it feels sturdy. It is easy to use and is comfortable. It inverts easily. I waited until I found a table that was relatively low cost, folded up and was sturdy. This was it and I am glad that I bought it.", 
    "This easy to assemble inversion table feels very stable and is easy to use. It might all be placebo effect but my neck, which has hurt for more than a decade, seems to be getting relief. I find the inversion to be very relaxing, so much so I set an alarm to make sure I don't overdo it.", 
    "Within one week of using this inversion table, my lower back was almost back to normal. I love it!!", 
    "I received my inversion table and I was excited to assemble it after work and get some relief on my lower back from all day computer work. I was able to assemble it with little help from my son in about 30 mins using power tools to accelerate the assembly; although it includes all you need to assemble it. It took me another 30 mins to adjust the inversion table to have it correctly balanced to maneuver it with my arms. I used the inversion table and was loving the handles on the side which easily helps you get back up even at a crazy 90 degree angle. the foam cushion is super comfortable. Just after a day of using the inversion table my back feels much better. This is definitely a great sturdy product and would recommend to anyone.", 
    "I have had surgery on my back a few years ago. When the pain started again the doctor who did the surgery said I should try an inversion table because the next surgery would be a serious one with with plates and screws. I looked at many models trying to not spend a lot of money because I was not sure it would work. I found this model at Overstock and ordered it. It came in a week, was easy to set up with my wife's help and I have been using it for about a month. Although my back is not cured it has given me much relief.", 
    "This piece works exactly as advertised, is easy to assemble, and arrived promptly. There is one design flaw -- when you are standing upright on the bottom bar, locking your ankles into place prior to inversion, the swing of the table makes it hard to reach essentially behind yourself with one hand (because your other hand is holding on to the handlebar so you don't topple over headfirst) to lock the ankle pads. I solved that problem by putting a piece of wood on the floor as a \"stop\". My only other complaint, and it's a nit-picky one, is that the rubber tubes that lock your ankles into place have that weird burnt-rubber smell and I can't get rid of it. All that said, I am very happy with the product. The fulcrum works beautifully; I can swing easily from upside down to right side up just by moving my arms. Absolutely would recommend it.", 
    "Table arrived. Opened box and styrofoam crumbled all over, small, small pieces, very messy! Unpacked unit, foam on handlebars was torn. Bolt was defective on rotator unit. Called customer service, had to leave a number for call back. Never returned call. Called again, got a person. Explained problem. They will send replacement parts for unit. Love unit. Seems sturdy. Use everyday. Good value for the price, I would order again.", 
    "I'm 6'6\" and it's JUST, long enough. Very happy with it.", 
    "Works great I just wish it would collapse a little more.", 
    "Love this! Use it twice a day (once in the morning and once in the evening) Great price for the quality of the product", 
    "Bought this for my husband for his low back pain issues, it has helped him alot and the machine is very nicely made.", 
    "We love this inversion table. Would be nice if we could purchase boots to use along with it. Great help on our backs!", 
    "Happy with the product. Assembly instructions were a bit lacking, but was able to assemble it properly after a couple attempts.", 
    "Fairly quick assembly, under an hour. Not easy for one person, but possible. For moving to another building, must remove four bolts using allen wrench and socket wrench (or adjustable), and slide out the foot rest. And it's heavy to carry. Using it puts a lot of pressure on your upper foot, but it was OK for me. Swings fairly freely beyond 180 degrees, but your arms must be straight down. No problem getting in or off once you understand the feet must slip in (don't make it too loose). To dismount, first lift arms in, then slide down a bit and bend the knees. Takes a slight amount of coordination. Feels great to use once a day for 5 minutes or so. Haven't been doing it in the morning.", 
    "I have fibromyalgia and wish I had gotten this Inversion table years ago. It takes all the stress off my muscles and the pain is gone while I am on it and for time after I get off. It was a great purchase for me at a wonderful price. It wasn't difficult for two of us to put it together and arrived in a timely manner.", 
    "Got this for my boyfriend as he works as a plumber and always complains about his back! All the lifting, positions, etc. We was able to put it together in about 20 minutes and he loves it! He only used it for 5-10 minutes the first night but when he woke up in the morning he said he really felt a difference. I hope it keeps working for him! Product seems of good quality for the price. Some of the welds are not as elegant as they could be but I think it gets the job done, but probably not something you are going to show off in the living room. It can kind of fold up to set against a wall but does not fold completely flat for under the bed storage, etc.", 
    "I have back problems and rather than go to a chiropractor for adjustments I thought this would be just the thing. I think it will be but I haven't had a very long tiime to try it out. I'm still trying to get it just right for me to use. I think I will enjoy it once I have it down pat.", 
    "Great exercise product. My lower back has been helped by using this device.", 
    "This is my first inversion table I've owned. It doesn't work as easily as the more expensive brand I see on TV, but this works good. I wear my works boots when I use this to provide a bit more comfort for my feet. For my husband and I, we both can invert backwards and line up with the back frame. The only way we can get fully inverted is manually holding on to the frame and pulling / pushing backwards. It's very easy to make the height adjustments and foot rest adjustments. This seems to help more with our lower back pain and less with upper back pain. The first couple of times your back may feel more sore, but it's just the muscles adjusting and getting used to the table, much like the first few chiropractor visits. Overall it does help a lot with back pain. One easily removed pin and it folds up, but not flat enough to slide under a bed. I'm happy with the purchase. I'm amazed with Overstock and how fast they ship, even this rather large package, I ordered it Wednesday early morning, it shipped from CA and was at my door in TX in two days.", 
    "having used only a few times i am really satisfied .", 
    "Great product. Don't spend too much money as you can get this entry level one for cheap. I weigh 230 and it's fine by me.", 
    "Very sturdy, great materials, very happy. I bought if for my Husband cause I am sick of hearing him complain. He has been complaining alot less. I think its great, been using it, been sleeping better. Very glad I made the purchase.", 
    "I love my table. I use it daily. My back and hip pain is diminishing quickly.I won't live without one ever again!", 
    "IT was a very good product. I have a bad back wanted to try this to see if it helped.", 
    "we've been looking at these for a long time, but really thought the prices were to high. When we saw this and the rating- we figured it was time to buy 1, and we are THRILLED with it. LOVE IT!!", 
    "I had bought an ironman for myself and loved it so I purchased this one for my son, who needed this for his back. It was just the ticket. He uses it twice a day.", 
    "I have cronic back pain and have already used the table once it is just what I needed to help with my back. I plan on using this table a great deal and it is comfortable and easy to use. The price was in my budget and the quality is great.", 
    "Had to return. Doctor did not recommend using thisif you have high blood pressure."
