    "these chairs are very attractive and comfortable. they brighten up any room you use them in. we use them as our dining table chairs (we bought 4 of them) and they look wonderful. They were very easy to assemble. When we first sat on them, they made a few small cracking noises which made me nervous at first, but all appears well now. It may have been because they had just been assembled and were setting in place. overall, great chairs!", 
    "I had been searching for modern-looking white dining chairs to go with my all black, glass dining table. I had no idea how expensive most dining chairs were and was freaked out at the prices once I started shopping around. Finally, these chairs were the best I found, for the price. I'm 100% satisfied with the price/value. My dining room looks great now and it didn't cost me $400.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful, and appear to be very high quality. I really love them", 
    "The chairs are very comfortable and look great. I'm very happy with my purchase, also size is perfect not to small or big.", 
    "Super good product for super good price. Very durable, easy to clean. My kitchen looks perfect now!", 
    "I like the way these chairs look and since we don't use our dining room EVER that's the purpose they serve for now. My fiance (200lbs) and myself (140lbs) have both stood on these chairs (not together) to hang curtain rods and have had no issues thus far. They seem to be holding up great for the 3 times we've actually touched them.", 
    "The product I bought for a small dining table. They are for medium to small weight range people (under 140lbs). Good for the price but not for formal dining room.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful, I purchased 6 of them and they are a true white color. They are very lightweight, so they do not scratch my hardwood when the kids are moving them around, but great quality. They are very sturdy and I am very happy with this purchase!", 
    "Chairs arrived well packaged and it good condition. They were somewhat easy to install due to me having to play with the little holes but I build all 4 chairs I bought 2 sets, in one hour maybe 2 all by myself. Out of the 4 chairs only 2 were sturdy the other 2 chairs had a front leg shorter then the other so basically its uneven, HOWEVER when you sit on them even though the two aren't sturdy you don't wobble or anything which is the weird thing lol my friend said well maybe thats how they are but i don't think so cus the other two chairs are not like that. They are a very bright white which will brighten your room. I love the fact they are big but not heavy at all. Id recommend this. By the way the legs don't wobble or anything like they are tight which is good.", 
    "I was looking to buy some much needed chairs for a dining room table that was given me as a wedding gift. I went to Pier One and was shocked at the price of one chair. $139.95 plus tax for one chair! I couldn't believe it. It wasn't even real leather - bonded leather and the construction was horrible. I looked on Overstock saw these chairs, immediately bought 2 sets and viola! Same exact chairs for the fraction of the price. They aren't real leather but the legs are real wood and they are pretty comfortable. Not bad for $50 a chair. If you are looking for a temporary but nice fix until you get chairs that you really like, these will do the trick.", 
    "These are great looking chairs for the price....not as sturdy or substantial as I would have liked but then again it was a good deal for two chairs.", 
    "I bought these chairs for my office and I love them! They are super easy to clean and very comfortable! Putting them together is really easy too. I did it by myself in just about 30 minutes!", 
    "Very pleased with the chairs. Arrived in perfect shape.", 
    "great chairs, easy to put together", 
    "Great product for the price! Highly recommend!!", 
    "The chairs are beautiful and are great quality, it was just too white for us.", 
    "Surprisingly delighted. Easy to put together. Perfect with greyson table.", 
    "I bought these chairs for my dining room. I have two messy boys and the wonderful thing is that they wipe clean fairly easily. They do look cheap so if you're looking for chairs you want to keep for s long time I'd suggest finding something else.", 
    "I LOVE these chairs. Make sure the double check the height, they are a tiny bit low.", 
    "Legs would not stay tight", 
    "For the price of these chairs they are very nice they are solid ! They wipe clean and look great with my farmhouse table !", 
    "I really like these chairs. While these chairs are not the most expensive, the look like they are worth more. They work for us.", 
    "its a rather cheap vinyl - cat had a hey day with scratching it", 
    "leather is great but wood legs are so weak. 1 broke in 2months.", 
    "The seat height for these reads 18.5\" on Overtstock's website. They are NOT. The box they come in even says 17.3\" for seat height which is WAY low if you're seating guests around a dining table. I was so disappointed because they cost for them was great and I had already assembled 3 of the 6 I bought. Guess I'll be packaging them back up and returning for some different ones. :(", 
    "Not bad for the price...build quality is decent.", 
    "We are looking for simple and inexpensive dining chairs and these made the final cut! Good buy!", 
    "easy to put together and very comfortable - also easy to keep clean", 
    "For the price - what a bargain. The chairs are on the small side; however, they are very nice to look at and easy to assemble. Classy and again, you can't beat the price. They are true to what they look like on the site. Absolutely, would recommend if you need something inexpensive, but looks like it cost much more.", 
    "These chairs look more expensive than they are. I have a orange accent wall in my dining room and they look gorgeous against it. Speed delivery and all pieces were in place, and very easy to assemble.", 
    "For the price of these chairs they are exceptional. Very comfortable and lightweight, only negative is they are a shorter chair.", 
    "Good chairs for the money &very fast delivery & very easy to assemble.", 
    "The chairs are a great complement to my bedroom. The look expensive and very modern. For the money I paid it was well worth it. I would say one thing make sure you look under the fabric chair if any of the hardware is missing, I was extra worry it was missing but pulled the fabric off and it was there :)", 
    "For the value, these chairs are exceptional. After reading all the reviews, we decided to purchase eight chairs for our dining room. They arrived yesterday and were very easy to transport. All four boxes fit perfectly in the back on our SUV. If I would recommend anything to someone considering buying a set, it would be to purchase a small screwdriver with removable tips, then purchase some allen wrench tips to make it easier to assemble the chairs. Took me less than 30 minutes to assemble our eight chairs.", 
    "I got this chairs back in January, we assemble those recently and we notice the inside of the tufted chair is broken. Of course Im not happy with my purchase. I wish Overstock can do something about this. This site has great items at very good prices but I am hesitant to buy again because of this experience. Your attention will be highly appreciated thanks", 
    "These chairs are nice but not the most stable when you sit on them they feel kind of cheap. The seat area is a little smaller than I had hoped. Not bad for just a dinning chair but wouldn't get them if you plan on using them for more than just that. The appearance of them is nice.", 
    "Although a little short chairs look great and was very easy to assemble,", 
    "Love these chairs! Was confused at first when the chairs came in an I had to put them together, but it was easy. The measurements of the chairs from the website helped to find a table and the chairs fit perfect. I have a two year old who loves to color and had gotten some blue marker on one of the chairs, I used water to remove it and you cant even tell.", 
    "Look - these chairs aren't made here. We bought two sets for a rental apartment. And all four chairs - which shipped at once - were all completely different when it came to assembly. They all matched on the surface but not on the parts. And - let's be more frank - these are not quality chairs. The leather feels more plastic-y than leather-y. You need to keep up on tightening the chairs or else they get loose. And you need to keep leather wipes on hand to clean very often lest they stain. That said - they are modern, bright white leather parsons chairs. A classic shape. And for the dollar figure, they do in the right setting.", 
    "I love,love love these chairs! I bought 6 and paired them with a black antique table. The contrast in both color and style are perfecto and adds a whole new dimension to my fabulous gray,black and white color-themed dining room. Class all the way!", 
    "aside from one chair missing the front legs (which they are sending along) they were easy to assemble and nice chairs.", 
    "We received 6 of these chairs (3 orders) yesterday. We were so excited because we're having our family over for the first time tomorrow and wanted to complete the look of our dining room with these chairs. Unfortunately, we ran into issues once we opened the boxes and began putting the chairs together. First of all, my husband who was doing all of the manual labor of it said that it was really hard to screw in the nails when attaching the legs to the seat cushion. Second, each chair comes with a little red packet of \"tools\" (nails) attached to it to use for putting that chair together. Well one chair was missing the entire red packet of tools! Third issue, one chair didn't have a hole to fit the leg into (manufacturer's defect I suppose) so we had to basically shove the chair leg into the cushion to create a hole ourselves. So we now have 4 chairs put together, one semi put together with a weird leg issue and one that's missing nails! :( I contacted Overstock to tell them about the issue and she offered me $10 credit on overstock.com if I went and found similar nails by myself! REALLY?? $10 for all of these issues?? And not even $10 back, just $10 credit to use on their website!! So ridiculous! I told her no thanks, just have the manufacturer send another set of nails please. Hopefully we get them soon!", 
    "It would have been worth it to pay for a heavier duty chair of real leather. I bought 6 and 3 of them really should go back as they are wobbly and the faux leather puckers and looks cheap.", 
    "I really like these chairs and think they will look great in our new house. I think they could be a little sturdier though. For the price, I think they will be just fine.", 
    "These chairs look nice, but the quality is low. However, for the price, they are fine.", 
    "The description says that the seat height is 18.5 inches... IT IS NOT!!! The seat height is exactly 17 inches. That makes a BIG difference! These chairs would have been PERFECT if not for that. These chairs are very well priced because they are FAUX leather.. that doesn't give them a right to be completely misleading in the description. If your table works with a seat height of 17 inches then yes buy these chairs, they are great!... but if not, like most, then dont! They sit way too low! Disappointed :(", 
    "Overall happy with the look and style of the chairs. I paid a really good price and I had been looking for chairs for a long time. I had a hard time matching up a few screws so I just ended them up leaving them. Some squeaks when you sit in them and I feel as though when you sit on them the stuffing does make them feel a little cheap. I am very happy with the \"look\" though.", 
    "The chairs look excellent and set up was fairly low maintenance. Although the front two legs were a bit off alignment-wise, its nothing that you would notice had you not been the one who assembled them.", 
    "Screwing in all the bolts was not easy. It almost seemed like the pre-drilled holes didn't align with connecting pieces, but after playing around with the angles of the bolts, and with some forceful turns of the Allen wrench, all pieces fit ok (thankfully!). Assembly time was about 20 minutes for the first chair, then about 12 mins. for the next one. The chairs do sit a little low off the ground (I'm 5'9\", and while sitting on these chairs, I reach the table at mid chest). Overall, they look nice, and easy to clean. Our guests have given us many complements on the color and design of these chairs. Chairs seem sturdy. I bought two orders of these (so I have a total of 4 chairs) and paired it with a large round wooden table in a similar dark brown color as the legs of these white chairs.", 
    "First you have to put them together, ok thats fine but its not fine when one leg is shorter then the others! are you kidding me?! honestly is poor quality( does not feel sturdy) and i think there ugly. i cannot find a single place to put them now that ppl cant sit on them without rocking back and forth. i wish i returned them.", 
    "I expected white leather. If you put the chairs near anything white.... they look grey! sad times for me!"
