    "We bought these for our game room because we knew that at times they would need to be stored. They don't look like folding chairs, they appear like nice dining chairs. They are very comfortable sitting for long game playing and are easily moved to other rooms to add seating for parties. Very pleased with purchase. Only negative would be that even folded they take up quite a bit of storage space.", 
    "This is the perfect extra chair. Solid and handsome and folds away in the closet. You could use it as an everyday chair as well as they are well made.", 
    "Very comfortable. Great fillers for large table when having guests for dinner.", 
    "I have mid-back pain and this is the most comfortable folding chair I've found. I use them for the kitchen table in my apartment. It doesn't fold as flat as most folding chairs do. It's generous padding makes it thicker, but it fits perfectly in the storage closet of my apartment. It's practical: during the week, there's usually just 2 chairs out for us, but when guests are over, we can easily have 4 chairs out. It's also easy to fold and carry out to the patio if we need extra seating. It's stylish: it's modern look and craftsman-style colors blend well with every room in our apartment. The style blends in with our tan/black patio furniture too.I had a problem with one of the chairs, sent the warranty a photo email, and they delivered a replacement hassle-free. I'm happy with the quality of the experience.", 
    "Loved these because there was no assembly required. They do fold but are not very flat when folded. They are a little high, which is a problem for my 86 yo mother- slides out of it and needs a foot rest. Otherwise I am happy to have these due to plans to downsize from a large house to and apartment. Wood matched my Amish table exactly.", 
    "They are exactly what I needed. Good quality and comfortable. Solid construction and attractive.", 
    "I bought these for my daughters small apartment, since she doesn't have room for a lot of seating but wanted folding chairs for when she does have guests over. She says they are very nice and comfortable.", 
    "chairs are exactly what I was looking for: foldable for easy storage, modest size yet comfortable, good looking, quality seems good. Perfect for fitting into narrow areas. Good value.", 
    "Was looking for extra chairs for the dining table. A giant step up from most folding chairs. Comfortable and easy to setup."
