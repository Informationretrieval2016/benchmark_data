    "Looks cute, but not sturdy. My dog pushed it out of the way in 60 seconds or less, but she is a genius!", 
    "This is an absolute piece of crap: cheap wood, painted not stained, hideous hardware visible from either side and major scratches from... The animals that made it? Or the styrofoam packing materials? BUT, it would have been more of a pain to send it beach, honestly so I use it upstairs at night where no one will hopefully ever have to see it.. Also, don't let it touch anything else, like a wall or door because the red brown paint will scratch off on it like a doodie crayon. Two stars ONLY because my dogs haven't gotten through it yet, so technically it does its job, but could it be any uglier?", 
    "have a small dog with a training problem. Just got new carpeting installed. Purchased a gate each floor. The gate is a gift from above. Decorative and not overly heavy. Handles with ease and we use them to block her in when we leave the house just to prevent any accidents. So far so good. Carpet beautiful and everybody's happy. Gates are 4 feet long.", 
    "This is a very nice gate.....however, I was beyond upset that it was full of dust inside the box (I'm highly allergic to dust) AND one of the pegs on the middle section wasn't even connected and it's not long enough to be secured at the top and the bottom. I expected more from Overstock.com. I did a LOT of research and found that you had the best pricing on the items I was looking for but I never expected the poor service I received. If an item has been used, it should state so. I'd be more than happy to send you pics if needed. As for now, my Yorkie is small and this gate is being used at my office to keep her secluded to one area. It is a great gate. I just wish you took more time to ensure that your products are of quality value.", 
    "Attractive way to keep pets in or out of an area. Easy to maneuver around them."
