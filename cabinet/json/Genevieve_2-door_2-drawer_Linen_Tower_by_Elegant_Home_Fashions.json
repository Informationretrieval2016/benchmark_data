    "Love this item easy to put together a great quality at a good price", 
    "Easy assembly. We remodeled our small bath a need a small cabinet to put towels and other toiletries. It matches perfect with our decor and lots of room.", 
    "We had a few glitches but Overstock was right on top of the problem. Once problem was resolved, we ended up with a lovely Tower. It was exactly the size, color and quality we were looking for.", 
    "This is a very sturdy cabinet. It was easy to assemble. Overall I'm very pleased with this item. It is a darker color than it appears in the picture so take that into consideration when ordering. Room lighting will make a big difference in color.", 
    "I was very satisfied with my purchase. It fit perfectly in the space of my small bathroom. What I like the most was the large doors, large shelves and two extra drawers to keep to my bathroom more organize.", 
    "I found this easy to build in no more than 5 hours! The instructions were clear and the parts were labeled in a very organized manner. I needed a small amount of assistance to help hold up pieces of the furniture while I put in the screws. I am using it as a linen closet and so far the doors and drawers are working fine. The box was missing only 1 minor, nonessential piece which was a plastic trim for the rear. My advice is don't be intimidated by the assembly!", 
    "This is a decent cabinet, sturdy, but the doors didn't fit together well. By the time you figure that out, you have already assembled most of it!"
