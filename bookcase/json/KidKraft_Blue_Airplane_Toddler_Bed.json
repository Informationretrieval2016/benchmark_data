    "it is a very nice piece of furniture and my son loves it. It is well made and the instructions are great. Just keep looking at the screw colors while you are assembling it.", 
    "My granddaughter loves it but will not sleep in it until we got her mini mouse sheets. It's narrow and open on the sides so there is no feeling of security for kids at age of 2", 
    "just what I wanted for my grandsons room in my home, so cute, took a bit to get it assembled on my own, but well worth it", 
    "I ordered this for my grandson and he loves it. It was a great purchase.", 
    "My 3-year-old grandson loves the bed! The reviews I read said to expect it to take 2 to 2.5 hours to put together. The 3 men who were putting it together spent 5-1/2 hours putting it together! It's really quite cute. Note that you'll need a crib mattress - it's not included. There is a little storage space between the wings to hold pajamas or toys - my grandson loves that. He's quite tall for 3-1/2, and I don't think this will fit him for more than a year. I bought one for my 2-year old grandson as well.", 
    "my son loves his bed. requires a lot of assembly", 
    "Great quality, great directions that makes it easy to assemble.", 
    "Very cute bed and very sturdy! Plan on 2 or more hours to put it together. Make sure you Match the colors of the screw to where you are screwing. So far my 14 1/2 month old is loving it!", 
    "This is a sturdy, well-made bed. It was the perfect bed for a 2.5 year old moving out of the crib. It is low, safe, sturdy. Best of all, he loves it so much that he made the switch from crib to bed with no hassles. He has been sleeping in it every night without a problem for almost 6 months now.", 
    "I bought this for my 2-1/2 year old grandson and he loves it. This was his first bed out of a crib and he has done wonderful in it. It was a family event putting it together and took about a half day. This is a half day with someone who can read directions and is intelligent. So, be prepared for a somewhat time consuming construction project.", 
    "My son loves this bed! It's perfect for him. It wasn't the easiest thing to put together but once we got it together it's a winner!", 
    "Fast delivery, great buy grandson loves the propeller turns. Overall excellent experience shopping"
