    "I ordered two of these tables, both shipped separately. Unfortunately, BOTH tables arrived with accompanying issues. The first table had broken drawer brackets of which I had to glue back together to make it functional. The individual(s) involved in the drawer assembly and packaging process proceeded to place the obvious broken pieces into the drawer, sealed up the box, and shipped it out. Adding insult to injury, the second table was missing 5 out of 8 screw bolts necessary for assembly. I had the challenge of locating usable sized bolts to put this table together. The on site image and description is lacking some details that might be of importance to some individuals. They are as follows: Satin black wood grain finish (very nice.) Distressed edges in a bright reddish pinkish orange... I know, odd color and nothing that a sharpie or a can of black spray paint won't fix. During assembly, place lower shelf in position before tightening the legs. Overall, this is a nice solid table. It's great for smaller spaces if your limited on space.", 
    "I bought two of these to use as bedside tables and they work beautifully. They are narrow enough to fit in the small space available but long enough to allow for a lamp, a box of tissues and a book to lay on top. The drawer is small but big enough to be useful. The finish is mostly black with a few well-blended streaks of red, which I like a lot. Very easy to assemble but, as others have said, don't fully tighten the legs until you have the bottom shelf in place.", 
    "This table is perfect as small chair or sofa side table. It arrived in perfect condition and was simple to put together ... make sure the legs are not tightened all the way before sliding the bottom shelf in place as you'll need a little \"room\" to get the bottom shelf in. Once the shelf is on, then go back and fully tighten the legs. The table is very sturdy and appears to not scratch or dent easily.", 
    "I purchased this table for my son's room to be placed right next to his bed as an end table. The space was only 10\", so I had a very hard time even locating something that would actually fit there. It was also difficult to find a black one. I shopped EVERYWHERE....in furniture stores, every single online furniture sites (there are hundreds and hundreds!), every store I could think of that sells ANY type of furniture ....the list goes on and on. FINALLY, I went to Overstock. Of course, I found it here! (hand hitting my forehead!) Now it is my first choice for shopping for whatever I need whenever I need it. Oh, by the way, the table is perfect....perfect fit, perfect color, perfect price!......And my son likes it.....who could ask for more?", 
    "This thing is fragile and was not packed properly. The plastic pieces used to hold the draw in place were broken and had to be super glued back. It is a nice table and easy to assemble but for the price it is not worth it", 
    "This is a great little table that fits into the space next to a chair perfectly. The assembly was quite easy. We are thinking of getting another one for a separate room.", 
    "I was looking for two tables in our TV room on either side of the couch for a lamp and coasters. Before we had one larger table on one end and it seemed I never got access to the end with the table to put my glass of water. We chose these because space was limited. They look nice. Seem sturdy enough - my hubby assembled them before I got home, so I can't comment on that! They aren't Ethan Allen, but they don't look out of place next to our furniture that is!", 
    "adorable little table. suits my needs very well. Easy to put together. Do not expect to use the little drawer for more than a remote. It is more for looks than actual use. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Was looking high and low for a narrow table to fit between new leather sectional and wall in tight space! I found it, and for the price youcan't beat it.", 
    "Perfect table for a lamp and holding remotes....exactly what I wanted! It was a snap to put together and looks great next to the sectional. I'd buy it again.", 
    "Nice table. I bought 2 to use as bedside tables in a very small bedroom. Love the color and the cute little drawer, which is great for my needs, enough to hold a few small things. The reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is that the paint has chipped off a tiny bit on the top surface, perhaps as a result of placing a hot drink on it without a coaster. I covered it with a black sharpie and it's fine though.", 
    "This chairside table is nice quality wood and finish. My only gripe is that the drawer is tiny. It will only hold a remote if that remote is slim. I ordered this for a small space next to my bed but it was too thin for anything other than a glass of water. Not even a small lamp. Ended up putting two of them side by side until I find something else. Product nice but you really need to understand how small it is.", 
    "I bought this to go between my husband's recliner and the wall. It is a perfect fit. The drawer is just perfect for remotes. That being said...I LOVE the looks of this little guy. I bought the two tone. It arrived in perfect conditions. I, being past retirement age, put it together in no time. It is a great addition to our home.", 
    "These fit perfectly beside the couch and look very nice. The only downside is the width of the drawer. I was hoping to fit coasters in them, but it is not wide enough for a small set of coasters.", 
    "the table is very well made and very contemporary looking and fits great for the need that I had. It was easy to put together and was very sturdy after completed. I would recommend this table if you have the need for a little thin table beside a sofa or in a small space.", 
    "After much shopping on Overstock and elsewhere, I purchased this little table to go between our new Basset mission-style recliners. I needed a very narrow table for the space and could not find one locally. The final decision was about purchasing this table with an oblong top or a slanted top. We went for the oblong, because I thought if I didn't use it between the recliners, I could use it alongside the double bed in our guestroom, which is also a very narrow space. We live in a 1920's style farm bungalow and I like furniture styled appropriately, but still functional and not too quaint. The oak top of this table matches the light oak arms of the recliners and seems like real wood, with a nice matte finish. I chose the black bottom because that color makes it recede into the shadow between the recliners and not stick out. The table arrived promptly and was easy for my spouse to put together; however, I should note he is a retired professional carpenter. Still, I looked at the directions and I could have put it together myself, although it would have taken longer for me. It is very sturdy and the shelf and drawer are secure; no wobbles. The legs do not scratch my 100 year old heart pine floor. I keep eyeglass cleaners in the drawer. It is very small, but still handy. I highly recommend this table and would buy another if I had space in my small house!", 
    "This narrow table is the perfect choice for a small area next to a chair. It is remarkably well made, attractive and large enough to hold items such as phones and beverage cups. The slim drawer is excellent for pens and other small items. The comfortable height reaches the arm of the chair. I recommend it to anyone who needs this size.", 
    "I put all four of the tables together using only the tool included in the package in about an hour. the finishes were very nice and the construction of each table was an example of quality beyond what I expected for the price. the drawers are very small but for the size of the table it was fine.", 
    "This table is exactly what we were looking for. We needed a small table beside our sofa and this is perfect!! It wasn't horribly difficult to put together, which was nice. The little drawer is cute (and small). It won't hold much but it's mostly for looks. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!!", 
    "The description was accurate as was the picture. Prompt shipping. I couldn't ask for more.", 
    "Nice, inexpensive table for a bedroom or a living room. Didn't have trouble putting it together. Drawer is very small, it might hold a remote or something else small. Didn't want to spend a fortune for a bedside table for my young son's room and this works nicely.", 
    "Looks great..thanks Overstock!", 
    "Very well made. Easy to put together. And we love the color. We also love the fact that it is very slender and we can put it anywhere.", 
    "The table is perfect for the small area at the end of my sofa. It is very sturdy, and looks good.", 
    "great table, great service", 
    "Love these tables. They fit in narrow spaces next to my piano and are perfect for what I intended. I was able to assemble them by myself, and have made a good deal, as I've seen them elsewhere costing more.", 
    "Well made, sturdy, nice two toned finish. Not 5 stars because it wobbles. Think I put legs on correctly or the screws would not have lined up with their holes. Kept because I still like it.", 
    "I have two of these. I have a small living room and just needed a small table next to a chair and loveseat. Very, very easy to put together.", 
    "It's just what I was looking for. I'm very pleased..", 
    "This table fits perfectly between my bed and the wall - a very narrow place. It gives room for a lamp and my husband loves it.", 
    "Attractive and handy side tables.", 
    "These tables worked perfectly in our guest bedroom. I was looking all over for just the right size. It goes nicely with the other furniture in the room", 
    "Very sturdy, solid wood, and good looking. Make sure you protect the wood when you assemble it upside-down. It will need leveling - so make sure you loosen all the leg screws a little bit, level the top, and retighten. It fits in a very narrow space by a sofa-bed we have in a spare bedroom. (We bought the smallest table.)", 
    "I was looking for a small bedside table to hold a small lamp and phone and this table is perfect. The drawer is a little small, but the table looks nice and serves the purpose beautifully. Very pleased with this purchase and not very difficult to assemble.", 
    "Perfect end tables when space is limited. Small drawer holds remotes. I bought three for my den and am quite pleased!", 
    "Perfect between two easy chairs. I bought the black/wood combo. Looks very nice without taking up too much space.", 
    "Very well made for the price. Extremely happy", 
    "Perfect when you only have about 14 inches of space and need to have a nice table. Well built, real wood. Very pleased.", 
    "putting it together was a bit tricky.. however, worth the time... table is attractive and serves its purpose.. and the price was not too expensive.. overall .. a good buy", 
    "I needed something that was compact to fit into a small bedroom. I also wanted an oak finish to match the rest of the furniture. This was perfect. While I have to have it long side against the wall, it makes it harder to actually use the drawer. But the drawer is obviously small and doesn't fit much more than a remote or maybe charging cords. I am very please with this table. Good quality and great finish.", 
    "These tables were easy to assemble and look great in my new office. The quality is good and they are very sturdy.", 
    "I got two of these tables for my small office. They're the perfect size for holding a book, drink, and pic of my grandkids. Love them!", 
    "Bought two and they were simple to put together. The drawer of the table was actually too small for both my remotes, but these products still serve their purpose well as side tables next to the couch.", 
    "Sturdy table if you need a narrow end table . I like the look of the black table with oak top.", 
    "Easy to put together, sturdy enough, although very light weight. True to color. Using as bedside table.", 
    "Very well constructed design; very functional; very practical...", 
    "After buying new furniture for my living room, the old pole lamps I had used in my previous layout just didn't work, they were the wrong color, too tall, interfered with my new artwork on the walls. I did not have a lot of space at the end of my love seat or sofa (love seat and sofa are grouped in a corner setting with a full size end table in the corner), still wanted to have lighting at the ends of the love seat and sofa, came across these narrow tables (I bought oak finish), they fit my space perfectly, can hold not only a table lamp, but provides space to hold beverages, etc. The included drawer is very narrow, but it can hold remote controls or other small items. These tables are constructed of real wood, no particle board or MDF, most is furniture grade plywood with real wood veneers, finish is excellent, simple assembly with 8 included bolts, alignment of holes for bolts were perfect, no issues whatsoever assembling the tables. I highly recommend them if they fit your needs.", 
    "Perfect for the small area I needed it for", 
    "We needed a tiny table to set drinks on in between two recliners, and this fits perfectly. The quality of the build, and the beauty of the natural wood is amazing. Yes, it's made in China, and this bothers me, especially since the company is in Sheboygan, WI. But if you can get past that detail, for the money, this is an amazing value.", 
    "I just put this together, and it was very simple. This is a sturdy little table with one drawer and a shelf. I bought it in all black. I had a tiny space near the door where I wanted to put a table with a basket on top so my husband wouldn't empty his pockets on the next closest flat area .... the kitchen counter! I'm using this as a catch-all spot, but it would be great next to a chair or beside a bed in a narrow spot. It would also be cute in a bathroom. Well made, sturdy, attractive. It looks like the picture only nicer than you would guess.", 
    "FITS PERFECTLY AND MATCHES THE OTHER FURNITURE AND HOLDS WHAT I NEEDED NEXT TO ME SECURELY", 
    "Tables fit perfect in the room. Great price and fast delivery.", 
    "Easy to assemble and perfect to put beside my sofa with a lamp. Exactly what I was looking for", 
    "I love this chairside table! It is the perfect size for a small area in need of a chairside table. It is well-made and sturdy and was very easy to assemble. I ordered the oak and it matches perfectly with other mission style pieces of furniture that I own. Fits the bill for me! I may order another one!", 
    "Great little table for the price. The black has a \"distressed\" finish to the edge that shows a bit of red. It works good beside the recliner, enough room for coffee, book, etc.", 
    "These are solid wood and adorable! They match my decor and are the perfect size!!", 
    "Size is perfect in limited space. Priced fairly. I keep several objects on top: holds lamp, coffee cup, knickknack, and still has room for a small tissue box. Pull out the drawer and it gives a place to temporarily set down the magazine I am reading. My tv remote fits in the drawer. Edges not uniformly finished, so not 5 stars.", 
    "For the price paid I was expecting a poor quality table, but after assembly really was surprised as to the quality and sturdiness of this little table.", 
    "This table is a little flimsy, but it is an acceptable value for the money spent.", 
    "Bought two. Perfect size, easy to put together, love them.", 
    "This table is petite and narrow and is perfect beside the sofa in a cottage setting. The drawer is very useful and there was minimal assembly.", 
    "This is well made and easy to assemble. I bought it to put in a narrow space next to the bed.It works perfectly.", 
    "Nice qty and easy to assemble. The drawer was smaller than it looks in pic. but Qty is better than i expected. You wont be dissapointed", 
    "I bought two of these tables, one for each end of a loveseat in a tight space. They were easy to put together and look great!", 
    "We needed a table to hold TV remotes and small items while watching TV.These tables fit the bill perfectly. They are well made, and do not take up much room. The drawer holds remotes, the table top is adequate for beverage glasses or snack dishes and the bottom shelf offers even more storage options.", 
    "Great quality and easy to assemble. Perfect for small spaces!", 
    "Very stylish and well built. I bought the two-toned tables to use as nightstands in a space challenged bedroom. They're the perfect size. The two-toned finish ties in my new black wrought iron bed with the rest of my furniture.", 
    "It fit just right in the space I had next to the sofa. The finish is really nice. I'm very pleased!", 
    "Lovely little table. Not big, but so well built and attractive. It just made me so happy that what I ordered exceeded my expectations. Seems like that happens less and less these days. I'm buying another!", 
    "Easy to assemble and beautiful!", 
    "I was looking for a small side table for each of our recliners. These were easy to put together and are very sturdy. Drawer holds remotes, pens, and the lower shelf is just right for books and magazines. The price was great. I saw the exact same table in a catalogue for more than twice as much.", 
    "It works for our application, may even buy another one.", 
    "Easy assembly, nice quality wood. Tiny drawer but still a plus.", 
    "Well made, easy to assemble. They are just the right size for a table lamp and a hot beverage. We have one on either side of our couch. They look great.", 
    "I purchased this end table, upon opening the box I couldn't find the washers and bolts to assemble the table. I contacted the manufacture Leick Furniture via telephone and email. Still waiting for response.", 
    "I wanted a narrow table to squeeze between my couch and the wall and this was it. It looks great. The drawer is so small it's basically worthless but had I paid attention to the dimensions I would have known that so that's on me. Pretty easy to put together.", 
    "This was exactly the size of side tables I was looking for. Easy to put together, very nice quality, especially for the price.", 
    "It is a nice piece of furniture for the price and fits perfectly between my wall an couch but it was broken when it arrived. There is a little piece that kept the drawer in line and with it broken the drawer won't stay straight. Other that that, +1 for quick shipping, +1 for price, +1 being the only viable piece of furniture for my living room", 
    "Very pleased... Timely arrival, easy assembly, great side hair height, width, color and construction.", 
    "Love these. Actually thinking of ordering a few more for other rooms. Small enough but great for what I need!", 
    "Very beautiful little table that fit perfect in the pulpit area of the church it has been liked so much so we ordered another for the pulpit", 
    "These tables are the perfect size. Very well made & easy to assemble. Love them!", 
    "This is the perfect side table next to my dropfront desk in my bedroom that houses my laptop. It is nice and long, and the best thing is it came to me halfway assembled. All I had to do was put on the legs and the lower shelf. It looks great next to my antique dropfront desk and holds my big external drives, and I tossed my thumb drives and a few USB cords into the handy drawer. Love it.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for. Easy assembly and rich wood finish. Arrived very quickly as well.", 
    "Even though the table I received was re-packaged from someone else returning it, maybe, and came damaged, overstock made it right and sent me another one. That had another issue, but between the two, I had a single correct unit. The quality control on the piece may be questionable, but overstock made it right. No complaints and it fits in my home and decor perfectly beside my sofa.", 
    "I ordered 2 of the two tone tables and just love them! Great quality! Beautiful finish! So easy to put together! They sit taller than traditional end tables which made them even more perfect for new furniture I just got for the room. Can't go wrong with these and price was perfect with free shipping.", 
    "We purchased this for an awkwardly small space between the end of our sectional and fireplace. No one would sit on that end because there was no place to set down a beverage. This is a simple, yet functional piece, I didn't attach the base shelf because one of the knobs was missing, but you can't see it anyway. The best part about the table is it has a smiley face all the time.", 
    "Very very nice table ~ especially considering the price.", 
    "Perfect size in a small spot beside a chair or sofa! Heavy and solid...not a flimsy table. I bought the two-tone. My husband put two tables together in about 30 min. He had no problem! I definitely would recommend these tables!", 
    "Very happy with this sturdy little table. Well made and finished nicely", 
    "Smaller than I expected, yet nice.", 
    "Easy to build and beautifully made. Exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "Nice table...little smaller than I expected but that's my prob for not considering measurements. Still it looks nice by our couch. Too small for a lamp though. Easy to put together", 
    "As described. Perfect for price paid. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Love these tables! They don't take up a lot of space but have great storage...a top table, lower shelf and drawers. Great buy!", 
    "fit perfect in our home office", 
    "I needed a small table to fit next to a couch with just a narrow space available. This charming table is handsome, sturdy and fits my decor. The drawer is a bit tiny, but I didn't buy this table for the drawer.", 
    "I loved my table. It fit perfect and looks good.", 
    "Very sturdy easy to put together. Looks great", 
    "Perfect size and just what I was looking for!", 
    "Nice little table which is just what I wanted well made", 
    "Purchased for very narrow space at bedside. Well made. Very pleased.", 
    "Perfect for a thin space. The drawer is deep, but only wide enough for a pair of glasses. Finish and overall construction is good!", 
    "this table seems to be of good quality, great looks, and reasonable price. My wife bought another brand, it was a little wider and a little better quality, but it cost 3x as much. I'm happy with this table, I just wish it was a couple of inches wider. the drawer is wide enough and long enough to hold only one remote unless stacked, then two.", 
    "This side table is as attractive in person as it appears in pictures. Very easy to assemble, too.", 
    "Needed end table to fit in a small space and this fit prefect. Like always shipped quickly. Went together easily and looks very nice. Would definitely buy it again.",

    "Nice sturdy little tables, surprised by the quality for the price.", 
    "Quality piece; simple assembly; perfect for intended space.", 
    "Would have been a 5 if leg was not cracked. Did not want to return or deal with hassle. Glued and clamped looks fine.", 
    "Very solid construction, love the oak finish. Only small issue, it was missing a floor protector for one leg which I corrected with a felt button.", 
    "perfect size price and great product.", 
    "Heavy bench that fits perfectly under the counter. Now I have a great bench to sit on to read the paper",

    "NICE HEAVY PIECE OF FURNITURE.", 
    "Easy enough for a grandma to put together. Heavy and solid.", 
    "We are using this small table in the bathroom and it is the perfect size to place tissues and hand cream on top and towels on the bottom.", 
    "So quality furniture DOES exist on Overstock! This nice end table is well made and suits the need for someone looking to fit an end table in a limited amount of space. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the screw for the drawer handle was too short, which resulted in two hardware store trips to find the right size screw. Otherwise, very happy with the purchase.", 
    "The table was smaller than it appeared in the picture. The drawer is too small to hold much of anything, including a coaster. It's not worth the price.", 
    "Table looks great stylish", 
    "I received my box in a very timely manner and everything was in perfect condition. Easy instructions and it looks wonderful. Would buy again!",

    "love the table .put it together in a few min.", 
    "I already did rate this beautiful table.", 
    "We needed two side table to go along side a reclining chair that was replacing a couch and coffee table. These were easy enough to put together, look fine and serve the purpose we intended. They're not the most robust tables, so could tip over if knocked into, but unlikely given where they are.", 
    "this side table in black fit perfectly against the arm of our couch. It provides a needed space and storage", 
    "Needed a small end table, and this one fit the bill perfectly. Price was very reasonable and quality better than expected. Glad I looked at Overstock.com. Unit was packed very well and shipped quickly.Thank you", 
    "Great quality product. Beautiful finish. Fits perfect in the right fit between the couch and wall. Great purchase!", 
    "Fit our space perfectly and was well made", 
    "I needed very narrow bedside tables and these worked perfectly. Small drawer for personal items and enough room for a lamp, glass, and book on top. Lower shelf to hold more books of course.", 
    "This tiny table is just amazing Btw very easy to assemble, it took me just 5 min", 
    "It was relatively easy to assemble, and its size makes it useful for small spaces, which is why we bought it. The quality is surprisingly good!",

    "Sooooo easy to put together!!! Took me about 20 minuets max...going to order another one..LOVE IT", 
    "Shipped well-protected. Heavier than I expected - a good thing after what I looked at in stores. 8 bolts and 4 shelf pegs are all it took to assemble and they are sturdy when they are assembled. Beautiful finish. I also have an entertainment center from the same company which is also heavy, sturdy, high-quality and was easy to assemble.", 
    "Great solution to a tough problem", 
    "It's well packaged and easy to put together. Once assembled, it just needed a light dusting and it was good to go. Very solid and very stable. If you are looking for a narrow table, I doubt you'll find a better one at this price. The drawer is a nice touch, it's tiny - but drawers are always welcome. And the bottom shelf is a real shelf! I'm not afraid to put stuff on it.", 
    "I looked high and low for 2 small tables to use on either side of my bed. This was the perfect size for my needs! The Oak finished also matched my antique dresser which I thought was going to be impossible to do. Assembly was a snap and it's a sturdy bedside table for for my CPAP machine and lamp. Sure the drawers are small, but they hold all that I may need at night! Very happy with my purchase!", 
    "table legs are uneven and it rocks when it is touched......", 
    "It arrived on schedule in great shape. It was packed well! Perfect size for space available. Went together without any dramas. Thank you!", 
    "With limited space this table is Adorable!! Fit right in and looks amazing!!", 
    "This is small - but it was perfect for the spot I wanted to fill. It is not much wider than a 24\" flat screen TV - which is what I am using it for. I love it. I got the black with walnut top and it looks real nice in my living room. I live in a small condo, so it is just perfect", 
    "This table looks rich for the price! It is the right size as it is hard to find a narrow - good looking table. We have it next to our leather recliner. It is long with lots of space & a shelf below. It has a bonus drawer! Perfect for what we need!",

    "It fit where I need it to", 
    "Looks good, easy to assemble, and sturdy. Good,accent piece.", 
    "Perfect end table for those narrow spaces! Easy to assemble and a good quality for the price. I don't think it's big enough for a lamp. I used a floor lamp behind it instead.", 
    "I purchased the two-toned side table. Well made, relatively easy to assemble, cute/attractive, fits perfectly in tiny spaces.", 
    "Love it! Bought for our RV. perfect size, good quality", 
    "I like the style, and the size is ideal, since we did not need to put a lamp on it. The black table has a bit of purple peeking through from place to place (style choice by manufacturer). I wish the drawer was bigger, but it at least holds a remote/", 
    "Nice small table. I live in a small NYC apt. with very little room next to my bed for a night table. This is perfect.", 
    "This table is exactly what I wanted. Good, solid oak construction. I am very please with it. It matches my other oak perfectly so the picture is accurate. Well made. Happy, happy, happy.", 
    "I purchased this table to go alongside a chair and a half. It is the perfect size and the top surface area is big enough for what I wanted it for; phones, remotes, laptop, drinks. It's a nice design and the oak color is rich looking. It was super easy to assemble. The only downside is that the drawer is pretty tiny. Don't plan on putting too much in there besides a remote and other small items like playing cards,", 
    "Nice table in perfect, narrow size. Good quality for the money. I would highly recommend it.", 
    "Love this table. It fits perfectly at the end of our sofa. Doesn't take up too much space either. It's a great buy.",

    "Great chairside table, easy to put together. The drawer is perfect for a remote.", 
    "Sweet little table that is perfect for a small space.", 
    "Fits perfect. Looks great and fits together perfectly. You can do it I did and I suck at putting things together.", 
    "I have a small room with my favorite chair in one corner. I needed something to put my coffee on while I read the paper. This table fit perfectly.",

    "tables wont stay put together", 
    "When you only have a few inches for a chairside table, these are perfect. They are very attractive. Only problem is, the drawer is VERY narrow.", 
    "This is an awesome little table and is just what I needed. I was looking for a small side table for next to my front door to put two small bamboo plants on and to use the drawer for doggie bags. The two toned perfectly matches the rest of my living room furniture, and the drawer is the perfect size to stock doggie bags. The table is small and light, so not the sturdiest or heaviest piece of furniture but just right for the price and my needs.", 
    "Very good quality table for the money. I would definitely recommend it.", 
    "I just had a few inches, but wanted a somewhere to place a book and hide my nail file and polish. If that's all you need too, it's perfect! Goes together easily. Sturdier than I expected. Looks nice.", 
    "Perfect size. Looking for side tables that were slim. Of course I found them here.", 
    "This was a great purchase. Easy to assemble. Perfect for a small space. But large enough for a lamp candle and picture", 
    "Does the job. Required a little assembly but it went together fairly well. The drawer and hardware have a cheap feel to them, the drawer slide drags, and the stop is plastic. It all works and I really didn't buy it for storage, but you can tell this is not top quality. The wood is real but is fairly lightweight, so don't expect the feel of a really dense hardwood. The way the bottom shelf attaches is a bit odd, and I had to loosen one of the legs during assembly to get it in. Once in, it fits fine. Overall this piece has the look I want for the price I wanted to pay, so I am happy to give up a little quality for that.", 
    "I had enough of reaching four feet to get snacks and and a drink. I finally found this one. It took time to put it together, but in 7 hours I did it! (I'm not mechanical).", 
    "works well in small spaces good height", 
    "Not oak, of course, but it is solid wood and has a nice heft to it. Will not tip over easily and looks good.", 
    "Very small with drawer for pens, glasses, etc Handy", 
    "I needed a small table to fit between our 2 chairs in our family room and this worked great! A little pricey for the size of it but it is what I needed for the space. Easy to assemble.", 
    "In a bedroom with 2 twin beds this is a perfect sized table, and the drawer is oriented properly, but it's a 'made in China' piece of junk. My husband and I had to do some modifications on the drawer slide (move the screw, adjust the fit.... good thing he is a handyman!) The color is close to the photo but the quality is less than great. I would not purchase this again, and would not have purchased it in the first place if I had seen it in person. Buyer beware!", 
    "I purchased a pair of these chairside tables in the two-tone(slate) for my bedroom, as I have too little space for traditional size nightstands. In the slate, the bottom portion of the table is blackened over the oak so that it shows through just a tiny bit here and there on the edges, giving it a slightly rustic look. They look great, and the fact that they are actually solid wood and not laminate makes them a great value for the price.", 
    "A perfect table for beside my husbands recliner. Has a shelf for magazines and remotes. I bought the smallest size as we have a small living room. Quality is good and easy to assemble.MNT", 
    "Sturdy and easy to put together, but darn it, it wobbles. Even though it was easy to put together and all pieces fit nicely, the darn thing wobbles just enough to make it dangerous if not up against the wall. Too expensive for this item to have this annoying problem. Another thing is the drawer is much smaller than the top and only half the length, so design is also not as good as anticipated. Now I will not return since I put it together, but I won't order a second one as I planned either.", 
    "This is a very nice narrow side table, small drawer is useful for pens, pencils, remote controls or small items. It was delivered quickly and was easy to assemble. It was a good value for the price, not fine furniture, but decent quality.", 
    "this piece is quality made and easy to assemble, and looks great next to the chair...love it !", 
    "This table is very well made. A solid piece of furniture. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.", 
    "easy to put together and looks great was delivered on time", 
    "I needed a narrow table to go beside a chair I got, when remodeling my bedroom. The size turned out just perfect. I love how it looks next to the chair. I am very happy with it. As the title of my review says, \"Just perfect\".", 
    "Pretty sturdy little table and super quick to put together.", 
    "It's table fity space perect and was easy to asemble.", 
    "This little table is just right for small spaces. Nice quality for the price.", 
    "Solid real wood construction, easy assembly. They look really nice in person.", 
    "Excellent quality...easy assembly...very sturdy...just what we needed to go beside Mom's recliner! Love it..thanks :)", 
    "The item arrived packaged nicely but the paint job on the table was less than perfect. 2 small visible spots were missed in the painting process one of which was on the top of the table and it looks as if when discovered they tried to cover the spots which made this table a poorer quality than I hoped to have purchased. Once assembled only one of the 2 spots was noticeable to anyone but me. I was too lazy to send it back. This table is pretty, well made and a nice replacement to my old chair-side table. Just be aware of potential flaws and decide if you can accept.", 
    "Arrived in good shape and packed very well. Color was exactly as in the photo. It did take me about 1 hour to put together but had the legs reversed at first. Very satisified.", 
    "Very nice table! It works perfectly next to a recliner I have in my sunroom. Good quality and a very nice finish. I got it in black, and am very happy with it. Was very easy to put legs on.", 
    "Nice side table. I needed something very thin because we have a small house and this is perfect. I put it together myself and I hate doing that, but it only took about 15 minutes and you didn't need any other tools aside from the hex key that comes with it. The little drawer is nice for tiny items, like our Bose controller that is always getting lost.", 
    "Great construction at a reasonable price. Delivery time cannot be beaten.", 
    "We were looking for a narrow side table to give us a surface next to the couch without pushing it too far out into the room. This fit the bill perfectly and was the narrowest table we found. Seems to be a fairly good value - I wouldn't say it's heirloom quality, but it is real wood, which is a nice change at this price point. We ended up leaving the bottom shelf off for now. A few things to note:(1) Our table arrived missing the bottom shelf. Overstock was great and shipped us a replacement immediately, so we have it in storage in case we want to use the shelf at some point.(2) The table is narrow, which is exactly what we wanted. That means the drawer is kind of silly though. Very few things really fit in there. We have one remote and a few cardboard coasters in there, but even the coasters have to go in at an angle. Don't plan on using the drawer for real storage.(3) The listing described and pictured the table as distressed on the edges, with the black color worn/sanded down to a reddish-brown. Ours was not distressed at all - just solid black. This is actually what we preferred, so no complaints at all there. Just something to be aware of if you affirmatively want the distressed look.", 
    "Had been searching for a narrow nightstand for a tight corner. Needed something 12\" wide or less and bedside height for a small guest room. This fit the bill perfectly. Holds a lamp with additional room from the length for a book or glasses etc. I think the drawer is more for show as it wouldn't hold much more than eyeglasses or maybe a small remote control. Table was also slightly wobbly but fixed with a felt pad on bottom of one leg. Agree with others on assembly. Overall perfect for my needs but could be discounted a bit more.", 
    "I love my side table and will order one more also I will look for other products to order later on this year.", 
    "This table perfectly fit the place and use I envisioned for it. Looks great.", 
    "Extremely pleased with this little table. It's a perfect height, and for narrow spaces, it's a rare find. The table I received looks to be a mixture of thick plywood and solid wood, not particle/chipboard. It comes flat-ish, but I was very pleased to open the box and find that the top of the table was already constructed (and finished with glue and interior screws).All I had to do was attach the legs, slot in the bottom shelf, and put it next to my couch. I purchased the Medium Oak option, which is accurate.", 
    "I ordered these tables online from England UK. They arrived within 5 days well packaged with absolutely no damage. That is superb service - from the USA to England in under 5 days. The tables were well made and very easy to assemble using just four bolts. They are well finished in Medium oak and match our other furniture extremely well. I would certainly recommend these tables to my friends.", 
    "ordered two...one has a drawer about 4 inches deep; the other is only about 2 inches deep. (Drawers are preassembed.) Assembly easy enough, arrived in excellent condition and quickly. Perfect for what we needed, and, more stable than we thought it would be.", 
    "I just wanted a small table to put next to our recliners to place drinks on. You could put a small lamp on them, but I have not. I would not want them in my main living room, but they are just fine in our basement family room where we watch football games, etc.", 
    "It is the perfect side--narrow enough and just the right height. Price is good and color matches my other oak furniture!Love it!!!", 
    "Was exactly what I was looking for. Beautiful wood, very sturdy. Easy to assemble and I would highly recommend it to anyone.", 
    "Very easy to assemble. Hubby loves this side table by his recliner that doesn't have a lot of space for a full size end table. Exceptional quality.", 
    "We needed narrow tables for our living room, due to lack of space. I ordered these from O as I have ordered so many things in the past. The quality is great and I am happy as always with my purchase from O.", 
    "The table is very sturdy and has a beautiful finish. The slim width makes it more versatile for me. Easy to assemble", 
    "Small but perfect for the area it is needed. Drawer holds two remotes and the bottom is perfect for papers and newspapers which we needed a place for.", 
    "Perfect size for use next to our loveseat. Colors also match our existing pieces.! Received quick and in great shape.", 
    "This little table was just perfect for a skinny space in our TV room. Is surprisingly weighty for such a small piece of furniture--sturdy and substantial. Assembly was simple and took maybe 20 minutes. Overall, a pretty darn good buy.", 
    "I needed a small chairside table for our family room. The unit came in easy to assemble and make of quality products. I sure saved a lot of time letting my fingers do the walking, comparing sizes and prices online. Of course I ended up with Overstock.com as they had exactly what I wanted. The unit was not misrepresented at all and I was delighted with my product.", 
    "This is a great table, and it fits perfectly in the narrow space next to my couch. I thought I was waaaay too smart for the directions it came with, but I was wrong! Follow the 1-page directions, or your table will wobble. It's actually VERY easy to assemble!", 
    "I love this table! It is just what I was looking for. It is just the right size for a small place. It was easy to put together, is sturdy and the quality is good too! You can't go wrong with this one!", 
    "Very easy to put together. packaged well. very sturdy table.", 
    "Love these tables! The size is exactly what I was looking for to go beside our couches. Have received numerous compliments on them. I thought the black portion of he tables would be wood, but they were composite. But they look fantastic and I love them. The assembly was easy, though there were a few hardware parts missing. I emailed the company and they arrived quickly. I would recommend these tables to anyone and I am so pleased to have gotten them.", 
    "Perfect size for my space. Sturdy little table and the finish is a medium oak which matches the picture.", 
    "Great table for the price. Assembly was a breeze. If you are looking for a narrow little chair side table, this one is great.", 
    "I got the 2-tone table and it's just perfect for the room. Everyone comments on this table when they see it, it fits just perfectly at the end of the couch. Wood is beautiful color and wood tone.", 
    "This table was just the right size for the walkway area between our sectional and recliner. The drawer is rather useless (only a remote could fit), but it's length makes up for the drawer size. I'm able to keep several books and tissues on the shelf, and the top can hold a drink plus my current book. All and all I love it!", 
    "I ordered this table Monday, and I got it by Thursday! It was easy to assemble. It has a nice drawer sized for remote, paper, and pen. My husband builds furniture as a hobby. He was impressed with the quality.", 
    "Good solid piece. Drawer is tiny but perfect for remote controls. Drawer slide quality could be better.", 
    "A nice little end table for lamp and does not take up too much room. Looks great in my living room", 
    "Perfect chair side table. It was easy to assemble. The black fits in well with my furniture.", 
    "I orderd this table as a backup order to some \"chairside recliner tables\". basically the two items are identical except for the available colors. I preferred the color of the other tables and returned this one.", 
    "Delivered in time. Assembly okay. Assembled table fine; no wobbly. Drawer movement not very smooth; average. Could have been better designed to provide smooth sliding!", 
    "Had been looking at this table for quite some time. Was exactly what I was looking for. I have a smaller home and wanted side tables to fit the look. Bought this one for end of couch. Bought the matching oval table for side of recliner. I just love them. Have the distressed look (redish) which is perfect, not too much, but just enough. Overstock did a great job in getting table to me quicker than I had anticipated and in perfect condition. Not much to assemble and very easy. Sturdy table for the size which was a concern as I have two dogs in the house most the time. No worries! If your thinking about making this purchase, put your thoughts into action, You won't be sorry:-)", 
    "This table looks exactly like it does in the picture. It was easy to put together. It goes very well between my 2 recliners, and the drawer makes it easy to keep the tv remote, pencil, pen, eraser, etc. easy to keep close but out of sight when not needed. The black color would fit in with any room colors and other furniture.", 
    "Was excited to find this size table....was exactly the size I needed.", 
    "Love this little table! The table's description and measurements (which were critical as this table was going into a very small room) were exactly as posted on the website. It took me exactly 10 minutes to attach the legs and they are very steady. All-in-all, a great purchase: great looks in a hard to find size and excellent quality for the price.", 
    "It's very handsome. The size is wonderful for beside a couch, since it's so narrow. Shelf and drawer will be handy. It's good wood, solid. The pieces are chunky (in a good way). The bolts & hardware are good quality. I love it.", 
    "Nice, narrow occasional side table for small spaces.", 
    "Perfect table for small space. Drawer holds 2 small remotes.", 
    "This was simple to put together, and was just what the room needed. Nice place to set your coffee and hide your remotes.", 
    "I needed a very slim table that would just fit in between my sofa, and the tile floor. This narrow table is just what I was looking for. It fits perfectly and looks great. I am very happy with this product!", 
    "currently used as a printer stand but can be anywhere...very solid, well made", 
    "This table is the perfect size for small spaces. I put it in our little bathroom. It was easy to assemble and is pretty sturdy. I'm very happy with it.", 
    "This is a great table. Delivered in great shape and very easy to assemble. Only issue is that the pull was missing from the drawer. Otherwise very pleased.", 
    "The table looks great between 2 recliners just large enough to hold a lamp and 2 glasses. The drawer is small and holds the remote.", 
    "Great looking table and it was easy to assemble. If you are looking for a long narrow table to fit in your motor home this is a great piece.", 
    "This table is the perfect size to fit between my husband's recliner and the wall. I wish the drawer were a little deeper, to fit more than 1 remote, but otherwise very happy with it.", 
    "Thiis is a lovely little table that is just a perfectly unique size to go between two slim chairs. The long narrow size with a drawer is hard to find. It was easy to put the legs on with no tools other than the allen wrench that was included. The finish was beaurtiful. It looks more expensive than the small price. Great pick Overstock!", 
    "Bought one of these to put next to a recliner...liked it so much we bought a second one. Very easy to assemble and has a small footprint. You won't be disappointed!", 
    "Took along time to find a narrow black end table modern enough looking with a draw and bottom shelf. This fit the bill. I was uneasy as a first time buyer but it arrived easy was easy sold materials and looks fabulous and fits perfectly in the spot", 
    "easy to put together perfect size for a small area", 
    "I ordered these tables to go beside my bed when I discovered after moving that my bedside tables would not fit into my new bedroom! I have a king bed, so I worried that the scale would be off, but these are such solid little tables that they go beautifully beside my big bed. Came immediately, assembled easily, look great. Wonderful deal for the money!", 
    "The description says it's 24\"H and 24\"W. This is not true and I didn't think it was by looking at the picture. I didn't want something 24\"W but I ordered it anyway. When it came in, I was glad it was not 24\"W. It's more like 12\"W! The table fit my space perfectly. The drawer was a little crooked but I made some adjustments and it's fine. Overall, I'm very happy with the table", 
    "It's easy to assemble. The quality is great for the price. It's a delightful little table", 
    "I am very pleased with this table. I needed 2 end tables for a small space and they are perfect. They are a little off balance but that could be an unever floor and that's an easy fix. They are perfect for what I needed!! They do have a VERY minimal amount of orangish color on some of the edges but I read on a review it could easily be covered up with a marker if you didn't like that part. It was so minimal that I just left mine.", 
    "Easy to put together, just used a provided allen wrench. Plenty of left over hardware, should there have been a problem with one of them. Drawer is small and not very functional, but looks good- it is obviously not going to fit a whole lot. Slim profile fits wonderfully in our tight space. I would definitely recommend it.", 
    "This is a perfect occasional side table for a large arm chair. The directions for assembly are not great but when you look over the pieces you will see how it is to be assembled.", 
    "Ideal for a small space apartment. The one-drawer is a great place for putting that pen/pencil, writing pad and/or keys you normally misplace. Bottom shelve ideal for \"one\" decoration or none at all. Thank you, thank you", 
    "I saw this table in a furniture store for $209 and was going to buy it on the spot. As I was pressed for time that day I decided to come back for it. When I got home I decided to have a look at Overstock and there it was for HALF the price. Great value!", 
    "Needed something at the ends of sofa to put drinks and items. No space for a larger tables. Not as stable as a larger table, but perfect for my needs.", 
    "This table is great! Saw reviews say hard to work with assembly. It took 10 mins and the drawer(some complaints there) was already installed. Nice little table priced even better!", 
    "Very happy with my purchase. Right size and color.", 
    "Table very easy to assemble, it is a small table and works well in my livingroom. Would reccomend to a friend.", 
    "Searched a while looking for a small table to fit into a narrow place. This fit the bill perfectly. The little drawer is very small. But otherwise it was just what I was looking for.", 
    "We bought 2 tables and we love them. We have limited space in our office/TV room and these tables solved our problem. We have one on each side of our recliner sofa. For extra storage, I purchased baskets to place on the shelf below the table. The price was right!", 
    "Fast assembly, looks nice, sturdy piece. And perfect size for a very small living room. Now we have a place to put down a drink when sitting in the comfy chair.", 
    "I love this table. It was perfect for my room. It was easy to assemble and it arrived in perfect condition. I would highly recommend it to everyone.", 
    "I bought this table for our finished basement to go in a tight spot next to a sofa. It is the perfect dimentions for what I needed, I bought it for function but it is really cute too! Not too over designed, and not too simple. It is solid and sturdy and the price was outstanding! I received it quickly and it was very easy to put together. Highly recommend this product.", 
    "The table was just the right size to fit into a small space in our spare room.", 
    "I loved the color and sturdiness but it looked very small next to my huge accent chair. Perhaps the black color makes it look even more compact. You really can't put anything on it because it is very narrow (lamp base is almost the same width as table). I will use it in bedroom or den in tight space but had I known how small it is, I probably would have bought something more bigger.", 
    "These tables are the perfect height, length and width and are exactly what I wanted. They look excellent with our decor. I love them. I bought two. Very happy with the quality and 2 days from order to my door.", 
    "We purchased two of these side tables for our family room and they are great. They are just the right size for our room, the height is good and the drawer allows for storage of clickers and pens. We use the shelf on the bottom for magazines. Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "Table arrived promptly and in good condition. My husband was able to put it together without difficulty. It is the perfect size for the area that I needed. I had looked for months for this shaped table. The design is an added bonus. Very, very happy with this purchase.", 
    "for the price not as good as thay should be. but all and all ok", 
    "I needed a very narrow table next to a recliner. This is perfect!", 
    "This is a nice little table for the money. It is hard to find tables this small and this one fit the bill for us perfectly. We used it in my son's room between his bed and a desk. (very little room) The quality and finish are pretty good, actually a little better than I expected. It was simple to put together. No need to read instructions. Please keep in mind that the drawer is ridiculously small. However, I didn't buy it for the drawer, so no big deal. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a very small table for not a lot of money.", 
    "This table is being used as an end-table near a sofa where space is limited. It holds a lamp comfortably. This table could easily be used next to a bed or armchair also. The extra details are a surprise - a small drawer which is useful, and a bottom shelf which is being used to store some books. At first, I thought the price was high, but given the extra details [drawer and bottom shelf], I'm very happy with this purchase.", 
    "This is a great side table if you have a small space. The dimensions are hard to find anywhere else. The item arrived early and works for the space but there was a small piece for the inside of the drawer that was broken when it arrived. It doesn't make it any less functional, but it's not 100% great.", 
    "My husband put this table together. It wasn't difficult at all. We are pleased with the look of the table.", 
    "great little table; perfect for tight spaces. I needed something that small to hold a lamp and a drink, and this is fine. Tiny little drawer holds my reading glasses. Nice !", 
    "This was mostly already put together, it's solid wood and very good for the price. I would recommend any of this mfg products if they are all made like this.", 
    "We are very satisfied with these tables. We had only a narrow space to use for bedside tables, and 10\" was our maximum. The tables accommodate a small lamp, and have enough room in the drawer for the remote control, glasses, and other small items. The finish is very nice, a smooth semi-matte black; and it assembled quite easily. They seem sturdy and well made and look very well. The shelf on the bottom is a nice touch, too.", 
    "Easy to assemble, good-looking contemporary flair, practical for a small space, sturdy, balanced.", 
    "Bought two of these tables for either side of a couch in a room with limited space. Easy to assemble. Great product for the price.", 
    "SUPER easy to assemble & perfect as a narrow side table next to the couch. I was hoping the drawer would be slightly wider (barely fits 3x3 post-it pad) but it's almost the length of the table so it's good for storing small items.", 
    "The table has a wood grain texture. I don't mind it because the table is cute overall, but I prefer painted furniture to have a smooth look. Easy to assemble, and perfect size and price for what I needed.", 
    "This is a great table. I needed two of them on either end of my couch and didn't have a lot of space. They were super easy to put together. The bottom shelf wouldn't even have to be used if you just wanted the look of a tall table. The drawer is narrow but a perfect size for a remote or two. Awesome table for the price and who can beat the shipping!", 
    "We are quite happy with our new chairside table. The height is perfect for beside the couch, the size allows it to fit easily in a small space, but it provides ample table top space for drinks and a lamp. It was easy to put together and is very stable.", 
    "For smaller spaces the black chairside table makes a welcome addition, a perfect place to set a drink, a bowl of snacks, or a book. The finish was good, and the assembly was not too difficult (take the drawer out first and bring the bottom shelf up from the bottom to install, then put in the supports underneath - took me a while to figure that out.) Instructions could be better. Nice looking small table.", 
    "I priced these at a local furniture store. They were double the price I paid for from Overstock.com They are of the same quality & style as the furniture store. I got 2 for the price of 1 locally. The $2.95 shipping price is terrific.",
