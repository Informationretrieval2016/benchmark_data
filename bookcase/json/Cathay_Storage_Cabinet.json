    "I got the Black - it s has two drawers and two shelves behind the doors and little lock - Oriental inspired and a nice finish. Perfect height for a night table for my extra high king size bed. Just what I was looking for! Thanks to customer service for helping me get the right color.", 
    "Quality is high, and it looks great too. I chose the red cabinet, and wow it is very red. The photo is accurate. Now I wanted to say a few things about the INside of the cabinet. The two drawers are aligned across the center of the internal space, leaving two free-form storage sections, one above and one below. It frustrated me that I could not find photos of the inside of this before my purchase, but I describe it here so you can make a more educated buy with your money. Overall I'm pleased with this and may buy another one in black.", 
    "I received the cabinet yesterday, and on the plus side it is very nicely made, all of real wood. However, the dimensions given in the item description are much in error. Here are the true measurements:Height: 31 5/8\" - Width at bottom: 20.5\"; at top: 19 3/4\"Depth at bottom: 13\"; at top: 11 3/4\"I can accept the width/depth being off a bit, but the height being a full 4\" less is not acceptable. I am not disappointed enough to send it back, given the nice quality, but I will make sure Overstock knows of this, and perhaps seek a percentage rebate.", 
    "I ordered the black cabinet. It is just the perfect size! There are 2 small drawers inside the cabinet, as well as, a shelf. It is sturdy, not easy to \"tip\" like some cabinets. It was shipped and packed very well. The \"latch\" actually slides in/out of the hardware on the doors. It looks like an antique cabinet. Definitely would recommend.", 
    "Love this cabinet! Just the right size for me and very attractive. We liked it so much we ordered another one!", 
    "Purchased tge black. Love the size. Perfect as a nightstand. Beware that if you put a hot cup of coffee on it, it will leave a mark. That might not happen with the other color.", 
    "The cabinet is nice as everyone described however when I opened it I noticed that one of the doors had been placed incorrectly therefore it made an indentation in the spot it had been placed, after moving it back to it's intended location. I also noticed a scratch on the top surface.", 
    "Love, love , love this cabinet and fits nicely in my rustic home. Highly recommend this cabinet.", 
    "Great looking cabinet. We really like the way this cabinet look in our foyer.", 
    "I love the little cabinet although it had a strong odor of wood finish so I had to air it out.", 
    "Sweet little cabinet for a small space. Really like the inside storage area."
