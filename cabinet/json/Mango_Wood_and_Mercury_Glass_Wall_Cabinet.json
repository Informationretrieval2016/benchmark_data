  "description": "Bewitchingly stylish and timelessly practical. The Carol Wall Cabinet features a straightforward mango wood structure with stylish antiqued mirror and brass hardware, and four interior shelves for ample storage. The mango wood used to hand-build the Carol Wall Cabinet is the byproduct of commercial mango plantations. The most commercially sought-after mangoes grow in the early years of a mango tree's life, meaning trees are harvested and replanted shortly after peak fruit production while the wood is still young and strong. On the soft end of the scale for hardwoods, mango trees are susceptible to fungi in the sapwood, which yields a unique black color in the wood's naturally swirled grain pattern, lending itself perfectly to creating unique, hand-crafted furniture. Due to the construction process and materials, slight variations that enhance the piece's character should be expected.Worldstock Country: IndiaMaterial: WoodStyle: Contemporary, Mid-Century, Modern, VintageColor: BrownThree (3) shelvesQuantity: One (1)Dimensions: 37 inches high x 11.75 inches wide x 5.5 inches deepStyleContemporary, Mid-Century, Modern, VintageMaterialWoodWorldstock CountryIndiaColorBrown"
