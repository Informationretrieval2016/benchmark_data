    "Great for the home. Holds six full bottles of wine securely!", 
    "love it. looks great even with empty bottles in it.", 
    "Awesome....looks great in the kitchen area and has a nice unique look i feel like will fit anywhere I go.", 
    "Great colors, bright and vibrant. Some of the metal is a little bent in places. It just adds more character to the room.", 
    "Absolutely gorgeous, great buy for the price, will last forever with quality", 
    "I absolutely LOVE this piece, it is in my dining room and is gorgeous", 
    "Great Look, sturdy, easy to hang.", 
    "Nice rack, but as long as it's secured to the wall, it won't shift when you take off or put something on the rack. Color is as pictured.", 
    "This piece fit right in with my existing artwork in my living room. It looks like an art piece itself. And it hold big bottles of wine and spirits. I love it!", 
    "they are light so it goes easy on the wall. They look very pretty and decorative. My mom Love it", 
    "We bought 2 , 1 for each side of the car. They look very attractive in our small bar area. Would recommend for a mall space.", 
    "Not only is this item beautiful and functional, it's also a great low cost item that you can give as a gift. We have on multiple occasions. Everyone we gave it to, just loves it. Couldn't be more pleased!", 
    "The rack itself is very stylish. I wish I would have looked at the back mounting holes for vertical positioning before I drilled mounting locations in the wall. It turns out that the welded mounting points of the rack were not level with one another. When I drilled level holes at the needed horizontal distance, the rack, when mounted was not level.", 
    "Everybody always compliments the wine rack. We love it.", 
    "i thought it was unique looking...overall nice, too bad its smaller then expected.", 
    "I have received so many compliments on this wine rack. It really decorates the dinning area where we hung it. I love it.....", 
    "I got this as a gift for my dad to put some of his wine bottles on display in the bar. My dad is pretty hard to please when buying him gifts but I'm very happy at the fact that he asked me if I could get another one. :) Overall, I'm a very pleased customer!", 
    "Beautiful decoration for the bathroom just added towels", 
    "Just the right amount of color for my neutral palate. Perfect dimensions for what I need. The bottles sit close to the wall and display the labels very nicely. The ONLY negative is that this will only fit the small 750 ml bottles and even then it is a tight squeeze. Since it is welded there is no wiggle room so you really have to consider the size of the bottle you want to display."
