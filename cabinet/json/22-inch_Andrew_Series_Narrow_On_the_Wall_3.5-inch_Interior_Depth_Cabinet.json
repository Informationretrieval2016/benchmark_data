The cabinet mounts on the wall with built-in cleats inside for an easy installation. A recessed white back panel hides the wall inside the cabinet. A beautiful mitered raised panel door sits on concealed hinges. The door is left undrilled for a knob or handle so you can mount it to open either direction. This item is perfect as a medicine cabinet, spice cabinet or storage cabinet anywhere. Nearly 3.5 inches of depth exists inside the cabinet area.\n\nMaterials: Solid pine, glassFinish: Unfinished pineOne (1) doorTwo (2) shelvesDimensions: 22 inches high x 11 inches wide x 4.25 inches deepMaterialWoodTypeMedicine Cabinet, Wall CabinetFinishNatural Finish"
