    "I ordered this item to use as a book shelf. The shelves are hollow, so I will not be able to fill the unit with books. The top molding was damaged, but it is not noticeable since the shelf is tall. The unit was very easy to put together. I would not call it high-end, as I don't think it is meant to be. It looks good once assembled and from a distance.", 
    "Easy to install and looks great!!", 
    "Was the perfect size for the space I had in mind.", 
    "Great price, great product, rustic and airy for small spaces. Was able to put together myself. Excellent, excellent, Excellent.", 
    "These bookcases are very expensive looking without breaking the bank. I love them. I have seen this style in several places for a whole lot of money. They are not hard to assemble either. They are a wonderful investment, and we are very pleased.", 
    "Overall - \"LOOKS\" great, but QUALITY in a nightmare and a huge disappointment! It is NOT wood, and the veneer is AWFUL. It appears heavy and sturdy and strong, but I could slide it around on my wood floor with one finger -- extremely lightweight. This was a fairly expensive shelf, for laminate to be used. The laminate covering that was intended to look like wood was damaged, nicked, peeling from edges in places, splintering in shards in others -- and it looks like some sort of \"spacklle\" or other sealant or \"smoothing\" material was used in attempt to \"cover\" some of the imperfections, but it was done poorly, and is very noticeable, leaving sizable whitish-grey specks and splotches all over. There are even metal tips of nailheads or staples or tacks of some sort, coming from underneath the shelves (MDF) through the top surface of the shelves (laminate/veneer). Seeing as I had planned to use this with fabric storage bins that would slide in and out from the shelves, two major problems would likely occur: 1) The poor quality of the laminate at the edges of the shelf (already peeling or splintering in several spots) would become even worse with the bins coming in and out of the shelves on a regular basis, and 2) the metal protrusions would likely catch on the fabric bins, and could pick or pull and damage the fabric; and, I have two small children that I'm concerned could also be injured from all the shards, splintering/peeling laminate, AND the metal ends poking through tops of shelves that could easily cause a scratch. I am very, very disappointed - as I've always had a good experience with overstock items....and I thought Christopher Knight was a good quality brand. It's unfortunate because I absolutely LOVE the look of the shelf, but it's features and functionality are null and void, based on the poor quality. :/ I should also mention, the shelves just slide in and slide out way too easily - aren't \"fixed\" in any way after assembled, are way too lightweight, and do not sit \"square or level\" in their tracks. The tracks are asymmetrical and crooked and cause the shelves to \"line up\" crooked-looking in them, and the shelves teeter and wobble when pressed (like a dining table with one leg too short). This shelf is just what I wanted otherwise, I'm so bummed it's....well, it's junk! I would picture seeing something like this maybe in Big Lots, for a much, much lower price - and quality is expected to be less as well. I simply did not expect this from overstock. (NOTE: We placed quite a large order, and there were other items in my order with problems as well :( that I will not mention here since this is product specific....but issues of quality -- damage or defects.) I WILL be returning, and hope to find something REAL wood next time. :/ No more laminate anything for me. Learned my lesson. I HAVE PHOTOS, WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO ATTACH THEM HERE!", 
    "Decent for the price. Brown version looks better than the black. Quick delivery and easy to assemble.", 
    "I ordered one a few months ago and decided I needed another one on the other side of my window. On the first the instructions were messed up. This one was a piece of cake because I put it together from bottom to top and threw out the directions. It was a fair price for a fair bookcase.", 
    "This bookcase is very easy to assemble. However, the quality is less than what I had expected from reading other reviews. Nail holes were filled with a lighter color (light grey) than the actual \"wood\" (dark grey-brown) and is very visible on every piece of \"wood\". A couple of the shelves were nicked and damaged. I guess for the price, it's ok.", 
    "The unit was easy to assemble for this 72 yr old woman by myself. Used the trick someone else suggested to put some 3 in1 oil on the two sections to slide them together more easily. It's heavy and sturdy and looks good in my living room. I'm very happy with it.", 
    "These work perfectly if you're going for that slight industrial look. They're sturdy and expensive looking and also very easy to put together. I just did the whole thing myself and it took about 5 minutes. I ordered two of these and some of the wood shelves did come in chipped so I might see if I can get replacements but overall I love these.", 
    "Very high end looking bookcase that was easy to assemble, and finishes the living room area off very well.", 
    "Easy to assemble except for one step. I didn't have another person available to help me align the top and bottom sections, so I ended up applying a small amount of oil to the end parts and they went together much easier. I use for storing vinyl albums and it is perfect for that."
