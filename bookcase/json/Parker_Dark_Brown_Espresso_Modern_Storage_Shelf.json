    "Great looking shelves; simple assembly though time-consuming because you are attaching every single piece. It is lighter weight particle board and doesn't tighten up to a very solid fit so if you slide it or move it, the parts will sway. Other than that, it looks fine and holds alot of books.", 
    "We bought two side by side - they looks great but they aren't stable enough - we had to brace them to our wall but looks great now!", 
    "This case was fairly easy to put together and looks great on one of our staging projects. It doesn't look quite as heavy as I thought it would look and we're not using it for real books so I can't comment on its durability but it has a great look.", 
    "Beautiful piece. I purchased this as a room divider. It's a nice sturdy piece of furniture. The color is a pleasant dark brown espresso color as described.", 
    "exactly what I wanted- all stats correct: height,width. Really pleased", 
    "very fragile ! move it very gentle !", 
    "Takes time to put together but it's worth it. Really good quality ! looks amazing !", 
    "Fits PERFECT and has more room that I was expecting. AWESOME Design", 
    "Perfect divider for my daughter-in-law's office"
