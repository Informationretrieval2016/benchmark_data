    "I spent months looking at sofas & love seats before purchasing these. I really love the creamy white color of this set. As far as the quality, I think it's good (not great). I actually would give this item a higher rating if not for one detail. When the sofa arrived it was covered with cardboard to protect it. However, someone (probably at the manufacturers warehouse) had stapled the cardboard to the sofa and right through the leather on the upper right-hand corner. I did get the staple out but it left two very small holes and a line. I'm not sure if anyone else would notice but just knowing that it's there irritates me. The sofa & love seat were delivered by White glove delivery drivers but they can't fix what's already damaged.", 
    "Works ok but not as comfy and soft as I like. I bought a black set elsewhere and the leather is so soft. This one is a bit hard."
