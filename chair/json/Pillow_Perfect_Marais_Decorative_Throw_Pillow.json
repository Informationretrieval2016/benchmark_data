    "Pillow did not have the large medallion that is featured in the photo. It had a much smaller off-centered medallion. The 'background' material was all wrinkled and there were threads hanging out of all the side seams. Was so disappointed, thought I was going to get a quality pillow. Have already sent it back.", 
    "The embroidered pattern of this pillow is very nice and feels like high quality. Unfortunately--the pillow you receive may not look like the one in the photo. The fabric seems to have the same star pattern at different sizes and when they cut out the pillows the pattern falls wherever it falls. So--the star may not be on center--or you may get bits and pieces of smaller stars from the pattern. I ordered the pillow in multiple sizes. I kept the larger version and returned the smaller one because it did not look like the photo online.", 
    "These pillows are perfect for my room. Solid Charcoal Grey Sofa, Ivory Velvet curtains...These pillows add the texture and colors needed to finish the room. Pillow fabric is synthetic, so not soft to the touch, also pillow covers have no zippers, so cannot take covers off to clean. Also feel like hese pillows are overpriced for the low quality.", 
    "the colors are as pictured, but the design is not centered as I thought it would be, the design is off centered. still nice, just not what I was expecting", 
    "I ordered the largest size pillow and knew from the photographs, the design would be scattered. The pillow was expensive and I was a bit concerned about over paying. When it arrived, I was thrilled with the quality, design and colors. I thought they were well made. Based on this item, I decided to change out other pillows in my condo and searched your inventory for the same manufacturer, in a coordinating design.", 
    "Really nice pillows; what I thought was a dark grey is really more of a navy color. Otherwise, I'm happy with them.", 
    "I purchased these with the Kosala Mist Throw Pillow. They complement each other perfectly. I did not get the pillow with the flower in the center like I wanted. Still a good buy!", 
    "Very beautiful pillow, wish it was cheaper", 
    "They are nice but not what i expected", 
    "The excessive pilling makes them look worn and dull very quickly. They're nice in design but not durable, so don't put them in a frequented area like on your sofa.", 
    "Although a little more expensive then I would typically pay for pillows, I loved the colors and pattern for my purposes. As another reviewer commented, don't expect the pattern to be perfectly centered as shown in the picture.", 
    "Love the material and colors.", 
    "Excellent quality and colors are as depicted.", 
    "These are lovely overall. I love that they are all a little different, but I read some reviews that expected all pillows to have the large medallion at the center. If you expect that, you will be disappointed. My only disappointment was the fabric's puckering. I plan to steam them to try to remove - it looks kind of like when you over heat the iron when spray starching something or when using witch stitch. The other issue which is easier to address are the multitude of loose threads. Most just pull out and appear to have simply been sewn in the seams in the factory. These are easy to fix, but just an FYI. I would (and did!) order again if I needed more, so more pluses than minuses!", 
    "Love these pillows- colors are true to pictures and very good quality", 
    "Pattern matched exactly what is pictured.", 
    "Looks exactly like the picture. Adds nice fair to my living room.", 
    "I purchased these for my new blue sofa, and they look great. I also like the quality...not \"squishy\" on the inside, but nice, firm quality batting and fill.", 
    "I purchase the Zig Zag Capri Pillow along with this pillow. Both of these pillows have the same feel to them. They are kind of \"hard\". I think they would be better suited for outdoor use, as opposed to indoor use. They feel like they are made with fabric that is generally used on outdoor furniture. If that is what you are looking for, you'll love it. If you are looking for a soft, cushy pillow... this is not the pillow you will want.", 
    "Looks beautiful on our new sofa.", 
    "These pillows are a nice size for a normal sized couch (not over-sized). The fabric looks more expensive than what you are paying for and it's holding up nicely with the boys in the family always throwing them on the floor. I've only had them for 4 months now, but so far, so good. I think they are worth the price.", 
    "This pillow accents perfectly with the Copacabana pillow", 
    "This pillow happens to match my rug and the new INSPIRE Q Sauganash Blue Damask Lift Top Storage Bench perfectly. You would have sworn they were sold as a set. Good quality.", 
    "These are really beautiful and plush. I'm very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Beautiful pillows with perfect added combination to other plain pillows on sofa", 
    "Love the colors and overall design. Unfortunately, the blue doesn't work with other blues in the area, so it has to go back. I'm disappointed.", 
    "The quality of this cushion is excellent. But the price is high and for the price I paid I was expecting the cushion patterns to be perfectly aligned. This is not the case. I am keeping the cushion and ordering another one to coordinate on our sofa. The colors match extremely well with my color arrangement.Great quality but expensive."
