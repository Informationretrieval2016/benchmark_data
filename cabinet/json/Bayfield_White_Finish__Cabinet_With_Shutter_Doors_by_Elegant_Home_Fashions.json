    "Bought 2 of these cabinets for my bathroom-mainly to store 'Gal Stuff'! You ladies know what I mean! The cabs are just right in depth to reach in and get the product you need-and two cabinets can store pleanty! Hairspray cans can be stored upright.Outside finish is nice and smooth too. I would recommend these to anyone who needs a small classy-looking cabinet.", 
    "We had no other storage in a very small bathroom and the louvers matched our tropical theme.", 
    "Unit is put together so won't be sending it back...however, this unit is NOT worth the money. On the front it had been dented and it was fixed by spreading some putty to fix it. Missing some screws. Second shelf Was in the box, but it was over an inch to long and no hardware to put it in anyway. I DO NOT recommend buying this unit. It is CHEAP!", 
    "THIS WAS AN ADDED ADDITION FOR STORAGE IN MY SMALL BATHROOM. DURABLE ABLE TO HOLD LIQUID SOAP AND SHAMPOOLOVE IT", 
    "The doors hang a little crooked and the screw holes for the knobs were screwed in unevenly. I really wanted to like this a lot more. Feels and looks cheap. :-/", 
    "Product arrived in excellent condition, and we are very pleased!", 
    "Great cabinet! I have it in the bathroom to keep toilet paper etc in - out of site. I love it!!!", 
    "I found the product to be of good quality for the price. Easy to assemble if you take time to read and follow directions. Coordinated well With floor cabinet.", 
    "We ordered two of these to match on each side of our bathroom vanity. One of them has distinctly uneven doors. My engineer husband put this together with the predrilled holes in the door. The holes were clearly not put in the right places. On the other set, the doors are even but the door hardware will not tighten all the way, so the knob spins and is never even with the other. I had such high hopes, but very disappointed in the quality.", 
    "Got for new bathroom..easy to put together and looks nice", 
    "sturdy little cabinet, fits between two vanity mirrors on my bathroom wall, Knew it would be about \u00bd\" too wide, so we notched the frame (which is very sturdy) on the mirrors and it fit perfectly.", 
    "perfect for the extra storage", 
    "This was exactly what I was looking for, size and shape. Durable and easy to assemble, I added four chair or table gliders to the bottom and use it as a cabinet under the bathroom window rather than mount it the wall.", 
    "I couldn't find a medicine cabinet that I liked or if I liked it, I couldn't afford it. This turned out to be a beautiful cabinet.", 
    "The extra storage is great in my 1/2 bath!", 
    "easy to put together, good quality, looks beautiful on the wall.", 
    "The cabinet arrived on time and shipped without damage. My husband put it together in no time and fits our needs perfectly. Would definitely recommend this product.", 
    "Very cheap construction. The back is cardboard.", 
    "So cheap and no need to put together!! You can get a great cabinet for around same price all put-together! And better quality!", 
    "This cabinet is very cheaply made - the doors wouldn't line up or close properly regardless of how many times I tried to adjust the hinges. I ended up giving it to a second hand store.", 
    "I was so excited to put these in my bathroom, I thought they would work out perfectly. Unfortunately the doors are uneven, there is a large gap between them, and the knobs don't line up. I purchased two of these cabinets, and although one is only slightly off, the second is WAY off and looks terrible.", 
    "We are redoing our master bath and thought this cabinet looked really nice for extra storage. However, as we were assembling it it was falling apart. They provided you with screws instead of nails to attach the back board and non of the holes were lined up properly. So all of the screws went threw the board and were exposed on the inside of the cabinet. It's cheaply made and NOT worth the money they are charging you. Probably a *** would've been equal or of better quality. Makes us not ever want to order from overstock again as it was a complete waste of money and time", 
    "I love the look of this cabinet, which is perfect over the toilet. This was our 2nd purchase, and this one had a noticeable chip on the front door, which my husband had to cosmetically fix, because we didn't want to take the time and trouble to send back.", 
    "Cabinet came with very detailed and easy instructions with some extra hardware. Installed in 20 minutes.", 
    "I love the look of this cabinet with shuttered doors! We bought 2--one for me and one for my husband. I assembled both in just an hour, and the templates made it very easy to hang them. Love them!", 
    "I bought two of these cabinets for different bathrooms in the house. They both arrived in good condition and are as they appeared in the ad. Easy instructions and all the parts were included. A little heavy on the price but good units. they look real nice when assembled.", 
    "The cabinet required a good bit of assembly, but if you're handy with tools and can follow instructions it turns out well. It has a great look and the price was reasonable. The doors were slightly out of alignment but I was able to fix that without much trouble.", 
    "Easy to install. Works as described. Instructions good."
