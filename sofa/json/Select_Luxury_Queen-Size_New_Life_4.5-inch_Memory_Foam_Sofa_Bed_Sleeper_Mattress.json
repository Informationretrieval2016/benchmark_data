    "For the upcoming holidays we have a lot of out of town guests coming into town so we just got finished renovating our basement and thought it would be really nice to have a more comfortable place for people to sleep. We have one of the standard thin little sleeper sofa mattresses and it's just not that comfy, so we did a ton of research and decided to buy this. I am so glad we didn't throw away the one we had b/c this one is honestly just about the same. But we decided to stack them together with the new one on top and it's really comfy! So now we are going to have to just keep the packaging (plastic and huge cardboard box) and store this new mattress in the garage whenever it's not in use, as they both of course won't fold up in the sofa.....kind of a pain. So basically it just serves as a feather topper or a cushy mattress pad. I wonder if we could have found something a lot cheaper, that would serve the same purpose but would fold up and fit in the linen closet........", 
    "I purchased this mattress for an older sofa bed that has an uncomfortable mattress. Our visitors loved sleeping on it. They thought it was very comfortable. They compared it to a bed in a fine hotel. I would encourage anytone to buy this memory foam mattress.", 
    "We needed a mattress for our queen size pull-out sofa. This mattress is so much more comfortable than the one that came with the sofa. It sleeps well.", 
    "We have a 30 year old sofabed at the lake that needed a new mattress very badly. We did not want to replace the sofa because it is slipcovered in the same fabric as the loveseat and club chair. Replacing the mattress was our quickest, least expensive option. The memory foam mattress was the answer. Very comfortable and the fit was perfect!", 
    "I have been researching replacement mattresses for my sofa bed for a few weeks and was going to order from a manufacturer's website. Then I checked out Overstock.com and found this mattress with memory foam that would fit my sofa. I was expecting company in 5 days, so I didn't expect to get it in time, but happy that I found what I was looking for at a great price. To my surprise, the mattress was delivered in 3 days! The quality is superior and fits perfectly on the sofa bed. My overnight guests tell me that they would never believe that they were sleeping on a sofa bed. It is very comfortable and folds up neatly when the mattress is folded up back to the sofa position.", 
    "Definitely worth the money. Purchase this if you don't want your guests to feel like they are sleeping on a sofa bed.", 
    "I bought this for a pull-out bed/couch which had originally held a blow-up mattress. When the mattress developed so many little holes it could not be patched, I decided to go for a regular style mattress for my guests. I read reviews carefully and decided on this mattress. It arrived in 5 days, in a tall rectangular box. It took both my husband and I to get it out of the box and up the stairs to the guest bedroom. It fit perfectly on the pull-out frame. I put all the sheeting on and my husband and I layed on it. We felt it was a bit stiff/hard, but since company was coming that night, we decided to keep it. NO SMELL, NO CURLING EDGES TO LET FLATTEN! My son and his wife slept on it that night and for 3 more nights. The mattress got the \"thumbs up\" from them and they are very hard to please. i could not fold the mattress into this particular couch afterwards, but stored elsewhere. I am extremely pleased!", 
    "I bought this as the ones that came with the couch were not that good. Boy, what a difference! I wouldn't mind taking a couch.", 
    "Ok if you weren't a heavy person using the sleeper sofa.", 
    "Family over night guests comment it is better than their mattress at homr. Very good purchase.", 
    "Before I got this mattress, I didn't understand how my guests slept on the dinky innerspring that my sleeper sofa came with. Once I set this up, I lay down on it for a test drive, and ended up lounging on it for nearly an hour. The only annoying part was trying to get it out of the package since I don't have high ceilings. Other than that, its an A+ and my guests love it.", 
    "Very comfortable. I have spent several nights on it myself when we had guests. Even after several years in place and folded up, it maintains its shape and comfort.", 
    "We built a shop with a living space on our property where I stay while the house is being built. So I am sleeping on this mattress a lot. I discarded the torturous mattress that came with the new sleeper and immediately started using this one. Buying this mattress was an excellent move. It actually feels good to this 64 yo guy!", 
    "great sofa mattress, so much better them the old one.", 
    "It fit my sofa beautifully; it folded fairly easy, again fitting perfectly. I find the couch comfortable to lie on. I am pleased with the purchase and rate it highly.", 
    "Now I can actually have people sleep in the sofa bed. Although I have to explain about it not being as the typical mattresses are (i.e. the support is even and you really don't feel the bar).", 
    "very nice, comfortable mattress, arrived earlier than expected.", 
    "bought a new sleeper soft with a spring mattress. it was not easy to sleep on. replaced it with this. much better.", 
    "this was great. I love it very much. I have had it for years and it still looks new.", 
    "On top of my sofa mattress, this makes it comfortable. Alone still doesn't work.", 
    "This mattress was purchased for a condo rental, my daughter used it for the first time and it was great! Comfortable, could not feel any metal bracing. We highly recommend this memory mattress. Also it fit perfectly on the frame of the queen sleeper sofa.", 
    "This mattress is very comfortable and exactly as advertised. I would recommend it.", 
    "I got this to replace a conventional sofa bed mattress that had received some criticism. It fits the sofa pretty well although it is a little smaller than the original. The support it give is a vast improvement and no more feeling the bars underneath!", 
    "Made our sofa bed actually comfortable! Guests have no complaints!", 
    "Using to replace a horrible mattress in a loft of an RV. A little short for this application but it is so comfortable that I really don't care. Highly recommend. I fell right asleep on it just after I rolled it out!", 
    "Our couch bed was not the most comfortable before we bought this. Now, it is! It gave us an extra bed for guests that we are not ashamed to offer. Great purchase as usual!", 
    "this mattress is comfortable and I would recommend it to others needing a replacement sofabed mattress.", 
    "Mattress a little softer than I thought but much better than the original thin spring mattress. Shipping was even faster than thought.", 
    "My daughter has to sleep on a sofa bed downstairs because our heating and air conditioner for our upstairs is broken. We inherited the sofa sleeper and the mattress was almost completely worn out. After sleeping on the old mattress for a year she was complaining about how uncomfortable it was so I started searching for a replacement. After reading all the reviews for several options, I decided on this one. My daughter is thrilled with the comfort level of this mattress. We had no smell and it puffed up in a matter of seconds with no lines or creases after removing it from the box. Since I had no way to dispose of the old mattress, I placed this one on top of the old one which made it higher off the floor and more like a \"real bed\". The price was right and the shipping was quick. Thank you Overstock.com for making this purchase easy.", 
    "I have a memory foam mattress on my bed so I know how wonderful they are but I wasn't sure how good it would be on a Sofabed because of the springs. To my surprise it is awesome. It doesn't feel like a sofabed at all. I have a 1br and when my nieces come over they LOVE the sofa bed. Sometimes they fall asleep in my bed while we're watching tv so I let them sleep there and I pull out the sofabed with no worries of lost or uncomforable sleep. VERY HIGHLY recommend this.", 
    "My son is back for an extended stay and the sofabed mattress I had was giving him problems so I purchased this item. It is TERRIFIC! It really transforms the sofabed into a comfortable, restful experience. He is using the bed everyday and I've only now gotten around to writing this review because he commented again on how much nicer it is to sleep. He is a big guy, so that says a lot!! It folds nicely into the standard sofa and makes sitting on the sofa more comfortable as well. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "The queen size didn't quite fit our sofa bed - came up a little short on the sides. If I were to do it again, I'd order a king size & cut it down. Lesson learned. Other than that, the mattress seems to be of good quality. We store it in the hide a bed & it folds out fine (a little crease, but not a taco shape).", 
    "My wife and I used an air mattress for 4-years and every year an air leak would develop. We then had to replace it under warranty. After the warranty ran out (3-year period), we switched to this memory foam mattress. It is simply the most comfortable and just love it!", 
    "We ordered this mattress for a sofa bed in a condo. We'd be using the original mattress for years, since the kids were young. They are now teens and the size of adults. We had them both sleep on this mattress and they said they slept just as well as on their own beds at home. I then turned around and bought a second one for my father who had a sofabed. Everyone is thrilled with the purchase....Overstock was great in delivering. I'm very happy on all counts.", 
    "I ordered based on the reviews here, for our vacation rental at Lake Tahoe. We tried to use the bed once, but it was so horrible we never used it again (let alone what our guests thought :o) I had been shopping to replace the entire couch...and wanted one of those new, very expensive hide-a-beds with the memory foam mattress. And then common sense struck and I decided to Google alternatives and that led me to Overstock. I've always had a good experience with Overstock. Based on the reviews, I went with this. Received it very quickly and no damage. Hauled it up to Tahoe and unpacked it (easy enough). There was a very faint (sweet) odor that dissipated quickly. Let me tell you, what a DIFFERENCE! I couldn't feel the bars whatsoever. It folded up nicely without straining any hinges. It even improved the actual seating when used in 'couch' mode. The cover was very nice also. For the price and free shipping...you really can't go wrong. I am very pleased.", 
    "Very pleased with this purchase. My Thanksgiving company tells me the mattress is very comfortable. I bought it to replace the original mattress which had been comfortable, but after many years of service needed to be retired. The mattress arrived quickly, no odor, and I'm sure will serve me well for years to come.", 
    "i would definitely recommend this mattress. My husband and I shopped around a LOT for a replacement mattress for our pull-out couch and this was the best product and the best price by far. Overstock's shipping rates are fantastic as well. We ordered it on a Sunday night and it arrived Friday afternoon. It has a slight chemical smell, but we think it will dissipate once it is aired out a bit more. We would recommend this mattress to others.", 
    "The New Life 4.5\" Memory Foam Sofa Sleeper mattress is excellent. There's just no comparison to the 'upgrade' selection of inner-spring mattress that came with our brand-name sofa sleeper. The mattress is very comfortable and provides a great night's sleep. Buy it!", 
    "I purchased this foam mattress for the pullout coach at our camper. My son and grandson love it and it was not a budget buster. I would definately recommed this product.", 
    "Mattress is comfy. Goes great on a sofa-bed. Delievery and service from Overstock was great too.", 
    "I ordered this mattress and it exceeded my expectations. I promptly ordered a second mattress for another queen size sofa bed. There was no smell even though we didn't unwrap it for 4 days after receiving it. We layed it on the frame, it layed flat and folded in perfectly.", 
    "The purchase of this product couldn't be easier and it's not like these mattresses are sold anywhere. The memory foam was a new product for me but it seamed that it would greatly increase the conform and enjoyment of sleeping on a sofabed. The comfort level is 100X better than what we had in the spring mattress, I would highly recommend this product.", 
    "I purchased this mattress for our travel trailer sofa bed. However, I thought I'd try it out at home since my mattress on my bed is getting old. What a difference! Even though this mattress is only 4.5\" thick, it gives great support! Like the description explains, you can get a mattress that is really ,really firm or one that is medium-firm. Mine is firm and I will probably add a 2\" topper to it for our travel trailer, but it is just fine on box springs. This mattress is very well-made and the foam is dense. The cover it comes with is thick and will protect the mattress (the bottom of the cover is thick enough that it won't tear when folding up the sofa). I expect this mattress will last a very long time and be very comfortable on our sofa-bed.", 
    "this mattress is perfect!!! i absolutely LOVE overstock.com :O)", 
    "I've finally found a mattress so comfy that even my Mom,who happened to be Princess on the pea,loved!It was essential to find a great mattress for her since she has serious back problems.I definitely recommend this mattress to those with back problems and to those who have trouble falling asleep.Works great for everyone!", 
    "I was hesitant to order a sofa mattress online, but I am now happy I did. This mattress was ten times better than the one that originally came with my sofa and it was a pricey sofa. It fit perfectly. When we tested it for comfort, we were more than happy. My own bed has a temperpedic type mattress, so I thought I would be disappointed in comparison. It exceeded my expectations and I am sure my guests will feel the same way. And it was great to see that this was made in the USA! Two thumbs up to Overstock!", 
    "I hesitated to spend this much for a sofabed mattress and just toss the one that came with it but after sending my brother home with an aching back every time he visited I gave in and purchased this after reading the reviews.My brother has not used this yet but I testied it out and I think he is going to be very happy next ime he visits. Extremely comfortable and folds into the sofa with no problems.Thanks Overstock, another great item.", 
    "The memory foam mattress has turned out to be one of the best upgrades we've made to our small vacation home. It's made it possible for us to offer the use of our sofa bed to visitors, knowing they'll have a comfortable night. After being folded up all day (and making our sofa feel more plush in the process), it resumes it's full depth at night and -- honest -- it's as close to sleeping on a cloud as you can get. We've read other reviews about needing extra protection for the sofa bed bars, but we haven't needed anything beyond this mattress. Can't say enough good things about it.", 
    "While I love the way my sofa looks, I was so sick of my sofabed mattress that I actually came to Overstock to look for a daybed/trundle to replace it in my guest room/office. Then I stumbled across this item. On my sofabed, I had been using an innerspring mattress that was only about a year old, but it was saggy and uncomfortable. I was very skeptical that ANY 4-5\" mattress would be enough of an improvement to justify the cost. But after reading all of the reviews, I bought it. It is WONDERFUL. Like NIGHT and DAY. SO worth the money. And I am thrilled to be able to keep my new sofa in my office instead of a daybed. I also went to another site and bought a corrugated plastic sofa bed bar protector. Even without this, I couldn't feel the bars through this mattress. But since the protector can be found for <$20, it still provides a little more firmness and support.", 
    "This is the best sofabed sleeper mattress I've ever owned. It fits well into my sleeper sofa. At first, I was worried that the foam may not hold its shape after being folded up. The sofabed is used at least once a week and it has always been comfortable. I highly recommend this for your sofabed sleeper.", 
    "The mattress is just as advertised, and arrived in great condition, right on time.", 
    "Great mattress for sofa bed--much better than the traditional sofa bed mattress which went out for trash pick up. For maximum comfort, I did put purchase a fold-up sofa bed bar protector for under the mattress--guests said it slept great.", 
    "I purchased this mattress because I was tired of guests complaining of sleeping on \"rocks\" and springs that seemed to be attacking them in the middle of the night while they slept on the old mattress. What a huge difference a new mattress makes! The new mattress seems to be well made, very cushiony, and is extremely comfortable. You almost feel like you are floating on a bed of air. I would highly recommend it. Looks and feels almost identical to the same mattresses sold at Brookstone and Relax the Back. Check it out...you'll be glad you did :-D", 
    "Quite pricey, but very possibly the most comfortable mattress available for a sofa bed. The original innerspring style mattress was very uncomfortable and lacked support. This new foam mattress was a big step up and is really not too bad when used by itself but when it used with the original mattress as a base it is almost as comfortable as a top line conventional mattress. It was 2\" shorter than the original mattress and this could be a problem for anyone over 5\" 10 \" tall.", 
    "I was skeptical about purchasing a mattress on-line, but it worked out perfect. I will say the size was a little smaller than advertised. Company slept on it and said it was just fine. On the next use I was anxious to see what the mattress would look like after being closed up for several weeks. Unfolded the bed and it took about a minute for the mattress to lie down flat. I was very pleased with the purchase.", 
    "Just received my New Life 4.5-inch Memory Foam Sofabed Queen Mattress and it is lighter in weight than I imagined it would be--which is a good thing. I had anticipated it was going to be an unwieldy beast. Very nice quality and sooo much better on the back than the mattress that came with my sofa bed. My only issue is with my sofa bed and not the mattress itself. If your sofa bed has a very pronounced bar across it like mine does, you may still need one of those sofa bed support mats that rests between your sofa bed frame and the mattress to make your sleeping surface completely flat.", 
    "This mattress is very comfortable. It fit our pull out queen sofa bed perfectly. It took a little extra force to close the bed, but it was not a problem. The only negative I heard from a guest is that it felt warm.", 
    "I was hesitant at the beginning, but I am glad I got it.The original mattress was so uncomfortable I was embarrased to have my guests sleep on it again. Well I was expecting the smell to be soo bad I actually ordered weeks before i really needed it, to my surprise it had NO smell at all. Its so comfortable,firm yet soft,my guests loved it also.And it fits perfect. So glad I got brave and ordered. Thanks for this wonderful product.", 
    "The sofabed mattress arrived quickly and in excellent condition. The cover is nicely made. The mattress did not have any odors. I think it is very comfortable. Only our houseguests spent the whole night on it but they slept in really late, much later than they do at home...so I take this as a good sign that the bed was very comfortable! (they confirmed this).In the past we had only innerspring mattresses for the sofa beds but I read an article that said memory foam is the way to go now. I am curious to see how it will do after being closed up in the bed for a period of time; i.e. will the mattress develop a flat spot or crease? No experience with that yet.Good value for the money, I would buy it again!", 
    "I looked for quite awhile but this memory foam mattress from Overstock is the best deal around. Still not really cheap but boy does it transform a sofabed. It fits our queen sofabed perfectly. So much more comfotable than the spring type mattresses, though I still found it necessary to use the cardboard thing you slide between the mattress and the bed bars for real comfot, and for even extra cushioning I used a memory-foam topper too. FYI, don't put on a topper and expext to fold the bed up -- you'll bend the bars if you even get the thing folded up at all. But this mattress by itself folds up just fine. My octogenarian mom slept on our sofabed recently and said it was pure heaven! I'm so glad to have an extra bed in the house that I can offer without apologies to my guests.", 
    "Excellent product love it will recommend to anybody", 
    "Let me tell you a short story. I have a significant other who fans of Seinfeld know as having the Jimmy legs, so I often need to run to the sofa bed often just to get a good night sleep. Let's face it, sleeping on the sofa bed regularly is not what these beds are designed for. The factory mattress was garbage, the air cushions (no matter what brand) only last a few months, and then I tried one of those foam mattresses from the dial a bed company. After a few months it fell apart and I developed severe back pain, and never was as comfortable as this product anyway.This mattress by far is the best designed sofa mattress I've ever owned. It offers memory foam with the memory foam topper built right in. Excellent craftsmanship you don't see in many products today and best of all no more back pain. And the price was cheaper than that name brand air mattress and the dial-a-bed companies offering.Only downfall is the sofa bed is a little hard to close now, but otherwise Very highly recommended", 
    "We got this for the sofa bed in our motorhome.. looks great, has a removable cover. Comfortable as much as one could expect on a sofa bed. Sofa bed called for a 4 inch matteress but this 4.5 worked just fine.", 
    "We have a second home in Miami that had a dated mattress in our sofa. Since it is a one bedroom our guests sleep on the pullout. I have been looking for a mattress that would be comfortable as well as economical. This fits the bill in both scenarios. It arrived just in time for my guests to use this past month. They said it was extremely comfortable and they did not feel like they were sleeping on a sofa bed. It folds into place easily and always bounces back into shape upon opening. Great buy and value. I would highly recommend it. Love the look and feel of it too.", 
    "Overstock.com was recommended by my kids. I have wanted to find a mattress for my sofa bed that someone could actually sleep on comfortably. The reviews on the sofa bed mattress conviced me to give it a try and order one. The online website was easy to navigate, and the shipping was easy to track. I received the package within days. I opened the box and aired the mattress outside on the deck for a couple of hours. No bad odors, extremely comfortable for a 41/2 inch mattress. I will now consider using Overstock.com for future needs. Thank you, Overstock.com staff.", 
    "with many guests in the winter to our west palm beach fl. home. we decided to put in a better mattress in the office/guest bedroom sleeper sofa. we didn't realize how expenisive a upgrade this would be. until we found this great deal on overstock.my son and his wife slept on it one night, cause their air conditioning went out on them. they said it was very comfortable, but they could feel the crossbar, slightly in their back.i pull it out myself sometimes to watch the phillies game. and sometimes fall asleep on it.overall it is a great memory foam mattress for the money. and is almost as cheap as some spring crummy mattresses.", 
    "I was looking for a mattress for so long. Finally, I could find what I needed. It made our sofa bed a comfortable sleeping place.", 
    "My 45 year old sofa bed was still in great shape. Not so however, in the case of the original mattress! I was quoted a price for the identical memory-foam mattress in a mattress store that ended up being more than double what I paid at Overstock.com. The mattress has been a hit with my married children who sleep on it when visiting. They say that it is the most comfortable sofa bed they have ever used. The only problem is that, with bedding on it, it can be a challenge to close it up after using it. That is because the mattress is so luxuriously thick. But, it does close and, when opened again, pops right back to work!", 
    "Guest have stated that bed is more comfortable then bed at home when using our sleeper sofa now.", 
    "The memory foam mattress came well packaged and shipment was received promptly. Although I still feel the bar from the sofa bed a little, overall the mattress is much more comfortable than the one that came with the sofabed. It folds up nicely and stores into the bed and springs right back into place when the bed is reopened.", 
    "Was less expensive that other, similar-looking \"memory foam\" topped mattresses, so I had some trepidation, but it fits perfectly and is very comfortable. A significant improvement from the original, painful \"mattress\" that came with the sofabed. No awkwardness or embarrassment in directing guests to \"sleep on the couch.\"", 
    "This was a great mattress. Shipped perfectly and on - time and unpacked easily. Also, no smell at all as others indicated. My only comment is that it seemed to be not wide enough for our sofa bed frame - about 4 inches short from left to right . But the frame is almost 30 years old - so maybe they were larger then? Anyway, otherwise great.", 
    "This is a great deal! Fits perfect, feels great, prefect amount of cushion and soo relaxing. A HUGE step-up from the conventional spring mattresses!! Thank you Overstock!!", 
    "This memory foam sofa bed mattress is great!. I purchased one previously for a different sofa bed and was so satisfied I bought a second one. It is light, easy to install and make the sofa bed much more comfortable.", 
    "This mattress turned an extremely uncomfortable sleeper sofa into a comfortable guestbed! It is very supportive and you don't feel the sofabed crossbar underneath you. It arrived very quickly (the same day as our guest), and was very easy to unpack and set up on the bed.", 
    "The best sleeping sofa mattress - ever! Great quality workmanship, fast delivery, best bang for your buck!", 
    "Ordered this to replace the mattress in our hide-a-bed which gets a lot of use. The difference is amazing. Instead of sagging, its almost too firm. There was no residual \"new foam\" smell. We received it, unrolled it, put in on and used it that night.", 
    "It arrived promptly, packaging was compact and intact, it unrolled smoothly, and is extremely comfortable. My guests (two already) have raved about their great night's sleep. The only negative, which applies to all foam beds or pillows, is the chemical smell you have to get rid of. This one aired out pretty well in one afternoon. I placed it in a room with the windows open and a ceiling fan blowing on it, and that made it tolerable the first night on the bed. Oh yes, I also sprayed it a few times with Febreze. I was so happy with it (and so was my second guest) that I ordered her the same mattress for her house! She can't wait!", 
    "This memory foam mattress is just as advertised, very comfortable, well packaged and much better than the air mattress I was using. The price and value were unmatched by any other internet store. I bought this mattress to use in an RV which turned out to be the perfect size ... thanks overstock.com", 
    "I looked all over Houston and this was much better priced and higher quality. Was delivered quite promptly and is very comfortable!", 
    "It fits perfectly and came just in time! Absolutely perfect.My guests were very comfortable and they took Overstock info so that they could replace their sofa bed mattress with one like ours.", 
    "This mattress is surely an improvement on what came with my sofabed. Although no one has slept on it yet, we tested it and it seems a lot more comfortable. It easily folded into the sofabed when returning it to the frame.The mattress comes rolled up in a box. In order to see how it fits, one has to cut the tie and unroll it. That may make it challenging to return to Overstock if unwanted.", 
    "This mattress is much better than those spring mattress that come in sofa beds. I have bought a foam mattress years ago that in my opinion was better than this one, but this mattress is good for the money. I bought this based on the price and the free shipping offered by overstock. I sleep on this nightly and have a great nights sleep. It fit well in my sofa, and when opened, expands to full size. It also made my sofa sit a little higher, which was actually better for the sofa I have. There is a slight smell to the mattress, which does not bother me, but some may not like. I would recommend this to a friend looking for a good mattress for a good value. However, there are better mattress out there. As for the longevity of this mattress, I cannot say at this time.", 
    "Made our previously uncomfortable sofa-bed comfortable. Thanks overstock!", 
    "I am very happy with this mattress so far. I have had it for about a month, and my children sleep on it every chance that they get!(Two 13 year old boys and 12 yr old girl.) I bought this mattress based mostly on the other reviews I had read, which were all positive and definitely true. The mattress arrived in a timely manner, and fluffed up nicely after being left open on the sofa bed for a most of a day. The quality appears very good. The mattress itself has just enough firmness while being soft and very comfortable to sleep on. When closed, the sofa looks great and is also very comfortable to sit on. I would highly recommend this mattress to family and friends.", 
    "I am so pleased with this mattress. Before purchasing, I could barely stand to spend more than few hours on my pullout. I have had it listed on Craigslist forever because I figured, no need to keep a sofa bed I can't sleep on. I looked all around Florida for a place to buy a new mattress, but couldn't find one. None of the \"mattress marts\" had sofa sleeper mattresses, so as a last resort, I purchased this one, thinking ANYthing would be better than what I had.Now - all I can say is WOW. My sofabed has been saved!!!!! The mattress took longer than I expected (after reading the reviews), however, when it arrived, I unwrapped it, let it lay on the floor for about 5hours, then plopped it on the sofa. I fell asleep watching TV, and woke up at 3am, laughing! I have never enjoyed my pullout so much.People have complained about the smell, which was problematic for me because I really have a sensitive nose. Every once in a while, I get a faint whiff of the latex smell, but I have slept on it for about two weeks now off and on, and can honestly say its what you would expect from a new ANYTHING. I left the bed open for two whole days, and now I dont smell anything.I like it so much I just ordered the regular mattress for my (new) bedroom set. Oh, and I'm keeping my sofa bed (for now)!", 
    "We purchased a used leather sofa bed that had been repossessed and was without a mattress. We ordered this, received it quickly ( as always) and popped it on the sofabed. It was a perfect fit, looked great and our guests said it was amazingly comfortable....Once again, another homerun for Overstock.com!", 
    "I spend a couple of nights at my widowed aunt's home every few months. Her 30+ year old sofa bed mattress has gotten unbearable so I decided to purchase a replacement mattress for it. Of course, I always check Overstock first for most of my online shopping.I based my purchase on the reviews and am quite surprised that I didn't have the same experience with this product.I will start off by saying that it was delivered sooner than I expected. I had no trouble unpacking it and laying it on the sofa frame. It appears to be well made. There was no odor and it expanded quickly.But the one I received is VERY firm and just not comfortable. Because I have fibromyalgia, I need a fairly soft sleeping surface. I've purchased many memory foam toppers of varying sizes from Overstock and they've never disappointed. I will say that it's better than the old mattress but not by much. I'm considering purchasing a 1 in. memory foam topper to put on it and hope it will still close properly.I would still recommend it. Just keep in mind it may be too firm.", 
    "We recieved an older sofabed from my sister, the existing mattress was springy and so uncomfortable. This mattress made the sofabed even more comfortable than my bed!!! I am always opening it up to lie down on it. Wonderful mattress!!!", 
    "I had a rarely used sofa sleeper... it was sooo uncomfortable to sleep on that it was pretty much just used as a sofa. I looked at the mattress on Overstock many times before buying. Well, I should have known how great it would be because of the other reviews. It is like a real bed now with a super comfy mattress. My grandsons slept on it last weekend and when my son came to get them, he flopped on the sofa that was still open and he fell asleep in the midst of lots of noise. He is a big guy and he said he couldn't feel any of the support system from the frame. Yeah! I now have another place to put guests as my home is a cottage which seems to attract overnight guests. How wonderful. The mattress came in a tall box that I managed to get in the house alone and set up alone (I'm almost 60). It was probably funny to watch, but it would be no issue at all with two people. There was no particular odor with my mattress either. It was delivered in 5 days, too... all in all, this was a great experience. Thank you Overstock. This is where I shop first.", 
    "All I can say is....WOW! Overstock did it again! Awesome product. Turned a horrible uncomfortable travel trailer pull-out sofa bed into a GREAT night's sleep! Couldn't even feel the dreaded bar across your back that you usually feel on a pull-out. YOU WON'T BE SORRY WITH THIS PRODUCT! Overstock must really screen their products because I am fairly picky and started ordering from them on a regular basis and have been amazed at the quality and prices of their products. Go for it...you'll love it!", 
    "I purchased this mattress for my Dad when he came to visit us since the only place we had for him to sleep was on our couch. He LOVED it (and is a large man at 280lbs). My husband has since slept on it several times for a few good nights of sleep since our infant son was born in the Spring and he finds it extemely comfortable as well.", 
    "I am not crazy about sleeper sofas because the mattresses are always so horrible, but unfortunately due to space, had to have one in one of the bedrooms. Have been searching for several years for something to help make it more comfortable for guests and was delighted to find this mattress. Perfect fit and perfect sleep.", 
    "For the money, this is definatley better quality than what originally came with the sofa bed in our motor coach. We had to trim it a little but it fit just fine. The quality of it is thick enough that our guests don't feel the bar under the sofa bed at all, and find it very comfortable. The cover is a nice feature and will make it easy to keep clean. I would recommend this for any sofa bed.", 
    "We had a very good nights sleep. This matress is very comfortable!", 
    "This is the most incredible mattress we've ever slept on ever! Shop no further; this is the mattress for anyone looking for the best! I cannot say enough about this mattress. We (our family) did not know that mattresses could be this comfortable."
