    "This is a great cabinet that can hold a lot of movies and CDs. It was timely putting it together but the instructions were very clear and easy to undrstand. It is pretty alarming when you are putting it together and it seems so flimsy and unstable but once you put the back piece on it is as solid as a rock.", 
    "I ordered two of these. They look very nice from 5 feet away but the materials are shoddy. Numerous nicks and dings in the finish appear to be from the factory, not from shipping. These come with fittings to attach to the wall which is recommended, particularly if putting anything heavy inside or on top. Othewise easily tips over. I am not impressed, but the pieces do exactly what I needed them to do (LOTS of storage for media), look nice from the couch, and were all I could afford. If you can't afford better - and if your household is gentle/respectful of items as a general rule - these might do just fine for ya. Easy to put together. First one took me (a reasonably 'handy' average female) 4 hours including set up time and figuring out directions and extra tools. Second one took 2 hours or less. Recommend soft mallet, electric screwdriver or drill, and Elmer's glue (or wood glue) in addition to the Phillips screwdriver indicated in the directions. The dowels do not fit tightly; a couple drops of glue in the dowel holes adds strength once it's dry. Be gentle with the drill so as not to overdrive the screws - the pressboard is not very dense and the finish mars/tears EASILY. Instructions indicate putting on cardboard backing last. Works better if backing is attached as soon as each part of the frame is secured. Item is heavy; 'flexes' when you try to move it so recommend moving entirely empty with two people. If working alone, recommend moving without shelves and doors, adding those after it's in place.", 
    "I was so excited to buy this piece. I wanted something large enough to store about 300 DVDs. I ordered, delivery was fast, but it was darker than I expected and one of the handles on the door was buckling around the wood - too obvious for me too overlook. So I called Overstock and they were great. They shipped out a replacement ASAP. To no avail, the second one was of poor quailty too. The laminate on the side boards was peeling, the paint was done poorly and the quality of the 'wood' itself was awful. I had to return and ended up ordering a media cabinet from another competitor.", 
    "This cabinet is awesome. It is exactly what I wanted; it holds all of our movies, it looks nice, and it doesn't feel cheap like it's going to fall apart. My only complaint is that after I was done putting it together (I'm no handy-woman so it took about 2 hours by myself) the top doors do not stay shut completely. This may be my fault but can be fixed with a magnet strip or something like that. Overall though, this cabinet is great and definitely a good buy!", 
    "When it arrived the bottom of the box was smushed & the styrofoam packing had disintegrated into millions of tiny foam pellets. It took an hour of cleaning before I could even start assembling the cabinet. very frustrating.", 
    "The unit fell by itself when I was in the middle of building it. The cabinet looks great but the structural design is not good at all. The CAM screws that came with it came out by even after locking them in place. The unit swayed when I was building and fell when I stepped out of the room. Luckily it did not fall on anyone. The unit is heavy but the design is poor and cannot withstand its own weight.", 
    "Holds a lot, looks beautiful.", 
    "This media cabinet looks great and the assembly was fairly simple. I expected a little better quality based on the price and the whole thing is pretty flimsy and it does not hold as many DVDs and Blue-Ray disks as advertised.. Several parts were damaged but the replacement process was excellent.", 
    "I love my new Windowpane Espresso Media Cabinet. I have been ableto arrange all my Cd's now in order. The cabinet is practical and fits myneeds with ease. I love it.", 
    "Very nice looking product. Quality could be a little better, but it is what's expected for the price. Be careful when lifting or moving as the top half is only connected with pegs inserted into the bottom half.", 
    "I bought it for him for his movies and video games. They all fit perfectly!", 
    "this was a little challenging putting it all together, but once completed, it is a beautiful piece of furniture and looks sharp standing against the wall in our family room.", 
    "Very unstable design. Had to reinforce the back to keep the cabinet from wobbling side to side in the middle. There is no way this cabinet can be moved safely with the materials provided.", 
    "Was nervous about ordering these after some of the reviews but I LOVE THEM!! I really couldn't be happier with them. Took a little longer than anticipated to put them together and the Styrofoam in the box went everywhere but I have no regrets. Very happy with my purchase", 
    "The veneer that covers this cabinet was loose at half of the edges. The doors don't fit properly in the tracks on the top even after adjusting to full amount.", 
    "I purchased this for holding movies and games, for which it is more than adequate. The cabinet looks great and the glass doors really add class.Despite a mangled shipping box, the only damage to my unit was on the backboard, which is hidden when the cabinet is in full use.The biggest problem with this unit is the wooden dowels. They are WAY too small for the pre-drilled holes they are supposed to go in. Usually wooden dowels require some effort to insert because they are supposed to supply rigidity to the unit. In this case, the dowels literally roll around in their sockets. No amount of wood glue can compensate for the mismatch. Thus the cabinet has NO lateral stability whatsoever until the backboard is attached. Do NOT expect this cabinet to survive multiple moves. If you want to add value to this piece, you might go to the hardware store and find dowels that fit better.The glass doors don't quite want to stay closed on their own. A magnetic catch would be perfect for them.Once everything is in place you will be pleased with the look of this cabinet.", 
    "Nice piece of furniture for my sons roomGreat organizer for video games and movies", 
    "I can't rate this item low enough. After much research looking for DVD display for our large library, this seemed the perfect solution. However the particle board was of such poor quality that the plastic pre-installed fittings broke out during assembly leaving me with garbage and four glass doors. Now I'm just trying to get my money back. Tam in Redmond, WA", 
    "Love it, will be buying another one soon", 
    "looks o k , but fasteners pull out---had to glue them in. And buy other back board to hold it together,", 
    "Beautiful piece of furniture. Not as hard to assemble as indicated in a previous review.", 
    "A lot of pieces to put together and time consuming otherwise a great stand. Great packaging.", 
    "We ordered 2 of the media cabinets. There was a piece missing out of each box. BUT overstock.com customer service was FANTASTIC!!! Found the missing pieces and were sent to me within a week. We also bought a TV stand at the same time. It's quality was much better than the media cabinets, but different manufacturer. Nice looking cabinets, but only a 3-star on quality.", 
    "I use this cabinet as a bar, I only used every other shelf and put wine bottles and glasses in it...everyone loves the look. I also put lights inside so it has a nice look when they are lit", 
    "My new house does not have a linen closet so I bought this cabinet to put all my extra toothpaste, soap, etc in. It goes together pretty easily, but is not the best quality. That's why I gave it four stars. It serves the purpose I bought it for and I am satisfied. Not very deep and that is what I needed to not take up too much space.", 
    "I bought this cabinet to house my CD collection. Yes I still own CD's, let's move on : ). The cabinet was pretty easy to put together with two people working on it. It came out beautiful. I later had a gathering at my house and so many people loved it and wanted to know where I got it. It looks just as it is pictured. Doors slide easily and wall attachment feature is a good idea.", 
    "Beautiful addition to my livingroom. Product looks expensive and was fairly easy to assemble.", 
    "Nice place to store your movies and CDs.Or repurpose for something else.", 
    "Wish I could give this ZERO stars. Either this product was defective as shipped or is the WORST construction design ever. First, upon opening the box, a thousand small pieces of styrofoam spilled onto my floor and took great effort to clean. Then, after spending hours to correctly assemble the product it leaned at least 12 inches in either direction from it's base. It could not be safely used in this state so I had to purchase and install 20 extra braces AND then bracket it to the wall. It looks fine but I would most strongly discourage anyone from buying this. If there had been an easy way to repackage it and send it back for a refund I definitely would have. Do not make the same mistake I did. Do not buy this product.", 
    "exactly as described! Just a little difficult to put together, need two people. You can also fit VHS, just arrange shelves further apart or stack them on their sides. Great cabinet all around.", 
    "A little wobbly when assembled, need to attached to the wall.", 
    "I would not even get this one star but they don't have a zero rating. The hardware brakes when you try to tighten it, the dowel pin are so loose,why have them. The side of the rail were puttied were they made a mistake, and with out the back panel the whole thing would collapses. Please don't buy this trash, not worth the money.", 
    "Cabinet was easy to put together & looks like the picture.", 
    "I purchased one of these, and It worked out so well I bought 2 more. I own an E Cigarette business and actually am using these as displays to hold my products! Love it. I do recommend when assembling the top half .1. Stand the bottom upright and put shelves on and Backing on the bottom half. 2.Assemble the top section and place on top of bottom. This makes the unit more stable and you don't need the back off to put doors on.Overall the unit was Very easy to assemble, I do suggest and extra pair of hands just to hold things and make it easier.", 
    "This is by no means a \"nice\" piece of furniture, however, it suited our needs for stylish storage for DVDs and games. It is a tedious job putting it together and as the piece is made out of particle board, it damages easily. Do not wait to put on the back piece! It helps stabilize the entire unit... The Styrofoam packaging got everywhere while we were unpacking the pieces. With the piece was finally put together, in place and loaded, it looks really good in the space. I would recommend it with full disclosure that this is not a stellar piece of furniture that is going to become a family heirloom!", 
    "Cabinet arrived in two days after placing order. Good quality for this type of furniture. Contemporary styling and the sliding glass doors are a nice touch. It took about 60-90 minutes to build.", 
    "First of all, it came packed in a way that damaged the styrofoam packing, so there were bits of styrofoam all over the item when removed from the box. It took half an hour to vacuum all of the pieces up. They should have shipped it in two boxes since it comes in one very heavy box. Second, it might have been fine at half the height, but there are no crossbars for support, and it's a pain to put together. The doors provide the cross bar support. Even when assembled, it looks like it's made out of cardboard. It's easily warped and twisted. I would return it if I could.I doubt if I will keep it for a year. It would have been a better produce if designed better, and if it was two separate, possibly stackable, cabinets.I can't say anything good about this product.", 
    "I love it! modern look, very sturdy. It was easy to put together. color matched perfect. Looks very nice!!!!!", 
    "Have sent the item back as the wood split while trying to assemble the item.", 
    "It is a nice media cabinet, but takes a long time to put together. Also, the instructions are not helpful. They had the least amount of information possible. Had to guess for a lot of the assembly. Other than that the cabinet itself seems pretty good, but a bit tipsy.", 
    "We were looking for a cabinet to get our media storage out of our RecRoom. This is tall, taking advantage of our vertical space, and since it isn't very deep, we could put it in our hallway. There are a lot of parts. So it takes some time to put it together. Of course mounting it to the wall is absolutely necessary. The cabinet holds a lot. We have more. However, most of our items fit. Walking down the stairs, it makes an organized impression sitting at the bottom of the stairs. I'll have to keep my fingers crossed that the dog keeps his soccor ball outside. I hate to think what would happen to the glass if he rolled it down the stairs. We just put it together, so I can't speak to how well it will serve us over time. Arrived undamaged with all its parts", 
    "Turned out really good... The instruction sucked! NO English \"\" REALLY\"\" would have saved a lot of time. but went together.", 
    "I was very disappointed with this product. It is very attractive, but once put together it is not sturdy. We have put other shelves together by other companies and those are fine. This one is put together in pretty much the same way, but this one hardly can hold itself up. Since I am stuck with the shelf, we will probably rebuild it with our own supplies and a carpenter's advice on a solution for the stability issue.", 
    "The only complaint I had with this cabinet is the assembly. It is partially my fault because I do not have a powerful drill to get the screws in so it was a pain to screw in all the screws required to make this a sturdy piece. I had a 6volt drill and the difficulty getting the screws in kept killing its battery so I had to use a screwdriver a lot. That sucked and took forever. All in all it is a beautiful piece and just what I wanted. I may need another one because I didn't realize how many videogames and movies I have!", 
    "The product seemed like it would be sturdy, hoever the whole thing almost fell over while putting it together. There isnt any support for the sides once they go on. It was extremely wobbly until the back was put on. It seemed that the back is the only thing keeping it square and not leaning, which is probably not good since the back is just 3 thin sheets of what looks like mdf taped together. It does work for what its intended use is but don't try and move the shelf once it is together much less loaded with cds or blu rays. If it wasn't for the cost and fact once you get it out of the box there really isnt a good way to repackage it, I think I would have sent it back. I actually have to check and see if the capacity limit indicated is accurate.", 
    "Looks great in my living room...so much that I bought a second.", 
    "I was hesitant about purchasing this piece, for a couple hundred bucks you figure it's a decent quality but you are never sure without seeing it in person. We it was delivered and unpacked I was very impressed. The quality was beyond my expecatation, assembly was easy and it all went together with no problems. i will probably buy another...", 
    "I bought the media cabinet for my son's first apartment. Although it was time consuming to put together, and the styrofoam messy, the cabinet itself is beautiful and functional. Its height and depth were exactly what he needed to help balance the other furniture in the room. Also, the glass doors added just the right touch of sophistication to the unit.", 
    "This was probably one of the easiest pieces of furniture I've assembled. The doors slide really smoothly too.", 
    "These are very sharp looking once they are put together, although they do feel a little bit flimsy. Assembly was fairly easy. But be forewarned that it takes almost as long to clean up the mess from the Styrofoam packaging as it does to assemble the product! We found that using a brush attachment to vacuum each piece as it comes out of the box worked fairly well. Seriously, though - Overstock, listen up: Don't overshadow your awesomeness with this packaging mess! Aside from the frustrating mess, Styrofoam is so not planet-friendly anyway. There are better options! (This is the second furniture item I've purchased by different manufacturers, so I assume it's an Overstock packaging decision.)"
