    "Poor quality and not worth the price. Visit a local home improvement store as the quality will be better. Unit is however simple to put together", 
    "Nice cabinet with adequate storage space when needed in tight spaces. This cabinet added a good dimension to our small bathroom. We are very happy with the results. Assembly was easy with clear to follow instructions. All parts included. The cabinet was assembled and installed in less than an hour. Looks great!", 
    "Love the style, color and wasn't hard to put together it is just too small!!!.", 
    "This is a very nice cabinet. It is of a better quality than what you would get at Walmart or Target. It came very well packaged so there would be no damage in the shipping. Unfortunately, there was a little nick in the door that must of happened during the packing, but it really wasn't a big enough deal to return. I just touched it up with some matching paint. Also, the template for hanging it on the wall doesn't match up with the wholes, so it was of no use. I would also get toggle bolts to hang instead of what is provided. The cabinet is pretty heavy. Overall, I am very pleased with the cabinet.", 
    "This cabinet is very sturdy and assembles quickly. It has 2 glass panels and an adjustable shelf inside with an open storage area on the bottom. It will compliment any bathroom you put it in and also has ample storage for most health/beauty items.", 
    "We ordered the top and bottom pieces to put in our newly renovated bathroom. The unit is simply stunning", 
    "This is a beautiful cabinet; easy to assemble and install.", 
    "Love, love, love this cabinet! Well made and sturdy and so nice looking! The gold speckled glass is classy looking. This looks great in my remodeled bathroom! Highly recommend it! Easy to assemble! Love the service of Overstock.", 
    "I was able to put this together in about an hour . . . and it looks really good!", 
    "Dark brown cabinet with gold/mosaic glass is very nice. Heavy and sturdy, with good amount of storage. Like the open shelf on bottom for quick items like washcloths and box of tissues.", 
    "Great piece well made easy assembly!!!", 
    "Very pleased - easy to put together and quality materials.", 
    "I had been looking for something to hold my medicines in since my new bathroom had no medicine cabinet storage. This cabinet looks really nice with my dark brown mirror (which is very close to the expresso color). The copper flakes in the glass doors really tied in with the bronze accents on my mirror. Very easy to put together. I priced some at Home Depot and Lowes and this cabinet was an excellent value!", 
    "The color is a bit darker than the picture, but a great piece to add to your bathroom! Easy to put together, just need 2 people to hang it and double check the paper they give you to line up the holes it was a little off on ours. Would recommend this item though if you like the style!", 
    "Love this cabinet..true to color and good quality", 
    "Beatiful and matches my bathroom perfectly with its sparkle of gold with silver and rich cappacino coloring. Easy to install. I recommend this item.", 
    "I bought this for my daughter, she wanted a cabinet in her bathroom. This is a perfect match for the color and style of her base cabinets. It is well made, sturdy, very attractive and fairly easy to assemble.", 
    "Good quality. Super easy to assemble. Nice in the bathroom adds a lot of light with the glittery doors. Pleased with purchase", 
    "Bought the floor cabinet first and loved it. Saw the wall cabinet and had to add to collection.", 
    "So glad I ordered both pieces! They are just what I need.", 
    "i love this product ,because it add beauty to my bathroom and made it look rich!", 
    "It was difficult to find a cherry wood cabinet with gold design. This one fits nice in my bathroom and was quite reasonable.", 
    "Purchased matching linen cabinet. Very pleased.", 
    "This is wonderful in my small foyer. Very rich color . I also got the floor cabinet and they match perfectly.", 
    "It is a small cabinet, but it looks good in my small bathroom. I purchased it about 8 months ago and am still happy with my purchase.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for with color and styling. Assembly wasn't too complicated. However, wood was scratched in places and one door was missing the hole to screw on the knob. This was a huge problem since I did not want to drill my own hole in the door. Wound up using with one knob for a while, and then later - gluing the second knob onto the door.", 
    "Easy to put together, but it is not a great quality product.", 
    "It was exactly what I was looking for and it came just how the picture looked and how it was described.", 
    "I recently remodeled our spare bath, and purchased this wall cabinet as a functional accent piece. I was completely happy to find this cabinet at Overstock because I found the same wall cabinet at two different companies (sold under a different name) at a much higher price. The price was more than double at one of the companies. The quality of the product is good. However, it does need to be put together, but this is a quick build. It should not take more than 15 - 20 minutes, if you take your time.Overstock shipped this to me quick, faster than anticipated.Note: This was my first Overstock order, and I will definitely purchase from Overstock again.", 
    "The wall cabinet arrived in a large box and was easy to assemble. The cabinet was exactly as pictured and has a rich dark color with the beautiful gold shiny specs. I loved the color and was a bit surprised at the quality for the price. I use in on the wall in one of my bathrooms with the matching Jezzebel floor cabinet. It has adequate space to store small bathroom accessories. I wholeheartedly recommend this product.", 
    "Bought this cabinet to hang in a new nursery. Was very impressed with the quality. The glass panels are much nicer in person than they show in the picture.", 
    "This cabinet is well made and easy to assemble. It arrived well packed with no damage despite having two glass doors. It is dark brown not black so we decided to paint it a glossy black & we love it even more. I am considering the purchase of the free standing cabinet to match it.", 
    "This cabinet was perfect for my powder bath. It will go nicely with any rubbed/antique bronze fixtures. The mosaic is a nice touch. It was easy to assemble, but doesn't seem like it would hold up in a high traffic room. As another reviewer mentioned, you can see through the glass doors so this is not a good fit for someone wanting to store multiple items.", 
    "I really like this cabinet, Looks very nice. Well made.", 
    "I'm disappointed how small the cabinet is. More like 22*18.", 
    "This is a really nice quality piece for the money. The doors with the mosaic glass panels are really attractive and the fit and finish are exceptional at this price point. One Big Caution, the first step of assembly is inserting pegs in the each side of the cabinet, be very careful not to thread them in too far, they will bust through the side of the cabinet. I stopped just short. Once past that near disaster assembly was a snap.", 
    "Needed a new cabinet for my bathrrom remodeling project. I found this in so many stores but it was out of stock. When I finally found it here, I was ecstatic.Purchased and received promptly. All parts were included and the instructions to put together easy to understand. It's weighty and absolutely beautiful. I love it and the broken glass look in the middle of the doors really completes the look.", 
    "Love how this looks in our powder room. It does not look like a \"bathroom cabinet\" which is what I did not want. Easy to assemble. Love it!!", 
    "The only reason I could not rate the quality of the product higher is that it has a gap between the two doors that is somewhat noticeable and just a little too large of a gap and there is no adjustments in the doors/hinges to compensate and fix it. I do love it with the Jezzebel floor cabinet and everyone gives me compliments on them. The color is pretty true to the images. This is a perfect combo for a small space b/c you do not have to sacrifice style or quality b/c you need something smaller than average cabinet combos and you cannot beat the price! Happy shopping.", 
    "A very nice cabinet. Well-made. Just one little problem one of the side panels had a damage so I called the company and they replaced the damaged part at no additional cost to me.", 
    "The cabinet is very pretty and looks great on the wall. Although it isn't solid wood, it still looks very elegant and clean. I would recommend it.", 
    "This is a pretty cabinet. It was as described. My husband put it together and it took about 30 minutes. The only thing that would of made it better would of been real wood . However for the price it is nice. I LOVE THE mosaic type glass in the doors and the dark wood.", 
    "Just redid my bathroom & was looking for the perfect wall cabinet & this is it!!! Absolutely Beautiful!! I got the black & it looks great next to my black Granite vanity top & got it on sale w/ free ship!!!! Kudos to Overstock.com!!!!", 
    "The item was priced very well and it shipped quickly. The item was easy to assemble and came with all necessary pieces to do so. This has been a great shopping experience and the piece looks terrific hanging up on the wall. I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I was really pleased with the simple assembley and the amber glass is great! I mounted this unit above my toilet in my bathroom and I love it.", 
    "Assembly is a bit of challenge but finally it worked out good -- Check the size carefully!", 
    "Excellent product for a \"build yourself\" piece. I have built many of the home assembly type products and this was by far the most durable. Add to that the over-all look... and it's a winner. Took me about 20 minutes to put this together and up on the wall. Only \"con\" was I wish it was a few inches bigger in each direction, but it is exactly sized as advertised, so, can't complain about that. If this thing catches your eye, and you dig the price, you wont regret buying it. I don't.", 
    "I was able to put this together in about 30 min. I couldn't tell from the pic but the amber glass, is actual pieces of glass glued on. It is a little small, but overall looks very nice. I don't know how well it will hold up in the long run, as I've only had it haning up for about a week.", 
    "The cabinet looks lovely in my bathroom with my bamboo cabinets, glass tiles and copper fixtures. Just keep in mind that you do have to assemble it. The area around the glass accent panes is glass, so also keep in mind that the items in the cabinet will be visible.", 
    "I've already received compliments on how the cabinet looks. But I don't think that the manufacturer actually got in-the-field feedback of problems people have run into installing the cabinet based on the instructions and parts.. In spite of the paper included meant to line up w/ the cabinet wcrew holes, it didn't. The plastic into which the screws were supposed to go had such a small rim that the screw pushed it right through the wall when I thought I was just tightening it. After the experience of trying to install it, I could do the next one from all that I learned from the problems & an additional trip to the hardware store to get some toggle bolts and making my own measurements from scratch. I spent hours on this & had to touch up the my wall paint when I was done.", 
    "This is not your ordinary-looking wall cabinet. I hung it in my bathroom and it is beautiful! The decorative panels within the glass are gorgeous and add that uniquiness and warmth that I was looking for. It's a beautiful centerpiece on the wall. My experience with Overstock was wonderful! When I first received the cabinet the glass was broken on one of the doors, but even though it was packed very well I suspect this probably happened during shipping. When I contacted Overstock about this they were very apologetic and sent me out another door immediately. They also told me I could discard of the broken door as I saw fit--so I didn't even have to bother re-packing it and sending it back! They really care about their customers' satisfaction and I will continue to order products from them! Besides that I have always been extremely pleased with anything that I have ever ordered from them and this beautiful Jezzebel wall cabinet is no exception!!"
