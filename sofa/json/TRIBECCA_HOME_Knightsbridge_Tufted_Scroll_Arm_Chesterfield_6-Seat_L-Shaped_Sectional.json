  "reviews": [
    "The quality of the couch is fine but just note that it's very small scale -- to me looks like a couch for kids. This is our own fault for not doing enough measuring but now we are stuck with a $**+ couch we don't like.", 
    "Love the finished look but it is delivered in pieces and isn't very easy to \"slide/snap\" together. Also the cushions slide down when you get up- we put thick Velcro along them and they're fine now but it was annoying at first. Overall I like this couch just wish it was real leather.", 
    "This sectional is delivered in pieces and requires assembly which was not easy but was not too time consuming. The color is true to the picture and the seat cushions and back are very firm but not uncomfortable. This is a beautiful sectional and I get many compliments on it.", 
    "Love my sofa and fast delivery!!!", 
    "Thought it was going to be too hard but it was super comfy. Beautiful sectional for the price.", 
    "This is the nicest piece of furniture I have ever purchased. Very fast shipping. Great quality.", 
    "Back is little lower than I'd like. Great fabric true to color. Easy assembly. Very firm cushions & back. This couch more for austetics not comfort but I am pleased with purchase and overall value!", 
    "Very sophisticated look, being so light in color may be deceiving, but getting the right throw pillows makes the perfect relaxing sofa", 
    "The shipping time on this was very fast. Not only was this couch easy to put together but we took it apart and reassembled it afterward so it could face the other direction. It's firm yet very comfortable.", 
    "The backs are firm (only the backs) and I'm sure they could be worn in but their in my \"pretty room\". I sit and read on these coaches. I love them! Everyone who comes over compliments me. Well Made and easy to put together."
