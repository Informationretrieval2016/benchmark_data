    "These chairs are great, I got a total of 4 for our eating area, plus 2 different red chairs. They look great, and are super comfortable. Several people commented on the assembly of the chairs- it isn't that bad, I put them together while my husband was out. It took about 2 hours, since I was by myself. The chairs do not come with instructions but pretty easy to figure out. If you are having problems with the holes lining up exactly, try only tightening the screws slightly until you have them all in place, making lining up easier, and then fully tighten once all are in place.", 
    "I have been a fan of Eames design for many years, but unfortunately the pieces are out of my budget. So when I saw these repros on Overstock for such a low price, I had to jump on the chance. I am quite impressed by the look and feel of these repros -- they really seem like the real deal. Well made with exacting constuction and attention to details, I think they would fool most Eames aficionados. For the price, this is a great way to get the vibe of a modern classic.", 
    "These are a reasonable facsimile of the Eames Eiffel Chair. I was almost scared away by how inexpensive they are, but it's a faithful knockoff. The chairs are slightly flexible plastic and have a matte finish. You'll find stiffer, fiberglass versions out there as well and I guess it's a matter of personal preference. Assembly was very easy. It's true that it takes a little work to line up the base/legs with the pre-drilled holes in the seat, but because the legs are angled you can flex them from the very end and create plenty of leverage without using a lot of force. The only really cheap part are the plastic disks that sit on the very ends of the legs, against the floor. It ships with extras, presumably because they will break off, pop off etc over time. Overall highly recommended.", 
    "There were a few confusing parts about assembling these chairs and I was unable to find any instructions online so I thought I'd post some tips. - There were felt stickers covering the screw holes under the seat of the chairs. I'm not sure if these were actually intended for anything specific but I peeled them off and stuck them to the bottom of each black plastic chair leg cap to protect my floor. - One of the chairs had a few drops of hardened plastic obscuring two of the screwholes. This made it impossible to get the screw in correctly so I used a razor blade to scrape away the excess plastic. - In order to easily line up the holes of the legs and seat, I placed the chair seat upside on the edge of my couch. This allowed me to easily see how to line up the holes. - For each chair leg, there is a bolt, a washer and a lock washer. I first put the lock washer on the bolt followed by the washer and then put the bolt through the hole in the legs and finally into the screw hole in the base of the chair. You'll most likely have to pry on the legs a little to get all the holes lined up. I recommend hand tightening them all before using the allen to finish them.", 
    "These dining chairs suit our purpose just fine. We purchased six (three sets of two), and will purchase one more set once we move into our new space and have a larger dining table. The poly seats do have flex (as opposed to similarly styled rigid fiberglass classics) which is both a good and a bad thing. It is good in that it makes them more comfortable when you are sitting in them. It is bad in that our toddler grabs the back to try to pull herself into the chair and the flex throws her off balance--but she is getting better at it already. By three, she should master it. Also, because the base is set into a narrower mount than the wood style ones we've looked at, they can tip, say, when a toddler is climbing into one. So, for now, we'll just lift her in and out. Other than those cautions, they are great little chairs with good looks at an inexpensive price. They are easy to clean, and the white plastic hasn't stained at all in spite of having tomato sauce and red wine sit on them for varying periods of time (even after a couple of days), which kind of surprised me a bit. They are super comfortable and definitely lend themselves to long, lingering meals with friends and family, which was important to us. So a win, win so far. Time will tell how they hold up, but if they break at least they are inexpensively replaced--important details with a little one using them as props for her imaginitive play. On an assembly note: one of our sets came with parts missing. But another came with double sets of the parts missing from the other, so it worked out for us. There were two hiccups in the assembly: one was trying to separate the two wire bases that were somewhat wedged together (hubby strongarmed that one) and the other was getting everything to line up in order to screw in the bolts. Because they are designed to have some tension in the frames, you have to screw a little bit of each one at a time (think tire changing--best done in an X pattern) to ease the process as much as possible. The black floor pad things were a bit uneven, but we just put the felt pads from the packaging on them with a little dab of glue and now they are more even and slide nicely on the floor.", 
    "I was a little suspicious that these chairs would be of poor quality as there were only 4 available, and it made me think that someone returned them. The main problem is that the rim is uneven on one side of all the chairs, perhaps from a poor mold or heating conditions when shipped from China. I have a few other knockoff Eames chairs and the rims are fine. The finish is not great either. They are scratched in places and have the feel of an orange peel. I wonder if the high reviews came from customers who received a different batch of chairs?", 
    "I ordered two sets of two, having already gotten similar chairs with arms via Overstock from the same manufacturer. The boxes showed up all dented and broken, given that there was no filler packing inside. One wire base we could not get to fit any of the chair seats, since it was manufactured so that one of the holes to line up the screws was 1/2 inch off. We couldn't bend the wire base enough to fit. No directions come with the chairs.", 
    "these look just like the other white wire chairs sold here on overstock, however the hardware is different and its missing the spacers. if i could have ordered 2 more of the other white wire chairs that would have been my preference. these chairs are good looking but they do tip over very easy, especially if you have children getting up and down from them.", 
    "these chairs are seriously one of the best things we have ever purchased for the home furnishings. we purchased six for a banging deal. they're durable like a tank, they look stunning (as they should, considering they're a major designer rip-off), the price is awesome, they're easy to keep clean, and they're crazy comfortable...they're pretty much everything you'd want to get from a chair. buy these now. your bottom (and heart) will thank you. :)", 
    "After much hesitation I went ahead and bought 4 of these chairs. One of the customers who wrote a reviews was correct in that once you opened the boxes there was a smell of moth balls; however, the smell went away in a few hours. Also, assembly took some time, but it wasn't all that difficult. Overall I am very please at the way these chairs turned out once assembled. They fit perfecty around my round table and the seat height was fine. They look really close to the much more expensive Eames chairs and I am very happy that we bought these reproductions instead b/c we saved a lot of money.", 
    "The plastic of the chair is very cheap. I ended up getting four for my dining table based on the positive reviews. I'm surprised that it got such uniformly high reviews. When I received it, there were some minor dents on one of the chairs and a big scratch on another of the chairs. I thought about returning them, but not sure whether I'd do any better with another brand. The plastic material will dirty easily. Just from assembling, lots of areas got dirty and did not come off until I scrubbed. They were NOT easy to assemble. Two were okay and I assembled by myself, but the other two had holes that did not match up and required two people to pull and tug with all of our strength to match up the final hole for screwing in. The only positive is that they look good from far away and they are comfortable to sit in.", 
    "I have been looking around for this modern chair since I saw it on ***. It will fit my kitchen dining area so well! It is hard to find it around my area, where there is almost zero affordable modern furniture stores. I am very glad I found it online and the cost is very much within what I was expecting to spend. I ordered one set just to make sure it will work for me first, and I love them! Ordering more for sure!", 
    "These chairs are great Eames imitations that cost a lot less. When assembling, if you don't tighten any of the bolts completely until they're all in, the leg mounting part ends up being just fine. Also, the manufacturer seems to have fixed the missing-foot problem - all three of my pairs of chairs came with four extra feet each! Very comfortable and beautiful once they're assembled. I'm so happy with these chairs!", 
    "The chairs look great. Although, they are a bit tippy - I need to remind the kids to keep all four legs on the floor for fear that the metal will bend or the solder will snap. Also, on one of the chairs a foot was missing so we've had to construct one until a replacement arrives.", 
    "Instantly adds style to our dining room, and great price!", 
    "Love them easy to put together comfortable and cool looking", 
    "...for a great price. A few of them were not easy to put together, but they've held up well.", 
    "Would buy again if necessary", 
    "we paired these with a rustic wood table and i love the look - the look for less! they are comfortable with just the right amount of give and are a good size. very happy with my purchase!", 
    "They look great. Who cares if they are not comfortable for my kid. It's a homework chair so it's supposed to feel like torture. I'm 5' tall and the chairs fit me perfectly too. They are not going to be comfy for anyone of normal size.", 
    "Awesome designer look for a fraction of the price. The felt tips do come off the feet, however that is an easy fix. Not the most comfortable for long periods, but when I needed to sit for in them for hours on the computer, I put a throw pillow under my bum and I survived. :-)", 
    "I love the style of these chairs but I received two chairs dirty and it looked liked some parts of the chair is textured and some parts are not.", 
    "We bought 4 chairs 3 years ago, and initially were very happy with the purchase. However, now they are breaking, one by one. The legs are literally punching through the seats leaving holes which can't be fixed. It's really disappointing, chairs should last a lot longer than 3 years, especially if they aren't used this much. We would have been better off buying cheap chairs at ****.", 
    "Ordered four of these chairs about 5 years ago and I've been happy with how they have held up in a heavily used dining area. They look great, too! Just ordered two more due to an expanding family so I'm glad that Overstock still carries them.", 
    "While I don't really approve of knock offs in theory, the whole point of mid century modern design was to bring good clean design to the masses by using industrial materials and mass production techniques. What a shame then, how expensive the originals have become, totally at odds with this concept. These do not get daily use in my home, but they seem sturdy enough and look great. They are probably not quite as solid as the ones you would pay $3-400 each for, but I can live with that for the difference in price. The plastic feet were broken on several of the legs (2 chairs) on arrival, but overstock shipped me a second set promptly. I am happy with this purchase and if I needed more kitchen chairs, I would order more.", 
    "We love love love our new dining chairs. We could not afford the original Eames chairs & these look so good for a fraction of the price!! We are very happy. Great first experience with Overstock!!!!", 
    "Amazing design, very modern, had a bit of issue screwing the legs on to the top part because the wholes were a bit different then the legs but needed a bit stretch and now when fixed looks amazing,spare parts are very handy too", 
    "I love these chairs, the quality is great and they were simple to put together. I am thrilled with the purchase.", 
    "looks great. so far so good", 
    "For the price they're actually pretty good, and not that cheap looking. They're comfortable. The only thing is one of the black plastic caps was missing on one of the chairs. Other than that, they're worth the money and they came relatively quickly.", 
    "Pretty easy to assemble, gives a little style to my teenager's desk space", 
    "These have been good chairs. They were the look we wanted with our distressed wood table and acid stained concrete floors. The pop of white looks great. - These chairs do tip easily though, I would not recommend for children because even I have leaned over a little too far and the chair almost got away from me. Also, the little black leg caps fall off easily. I have already lost one of the leg caps. :( But overall I really like these chairs.", 
    "The chairs were nice but the seats were too low for my table.", 
    "Look nice, but the plastic feet that snap into the wite leg portion are constantly falling off", 
    "We love these chairs. They are modern and fun and super comfortable! Great price and fast shipping!", 
    "This is my second set. I love these chairs-they are so comfortable. A lot of people mistake them for Herman Miller!", 
    "I have had the chairs for a few months now. For the price, these are unbeatable. They are incredibly easy to clean - wine, jello, blueberry jam can't stain them. They look terrific and were reasonably easy to assemble.Downsides: 1) they tip. My 2 year old often tips them over when she gets off too quickly. However, the chair pushes out and falls behind her, not on top of her, and this problem should subside as she gets taller b/c my 4 year old doesn't have this happen. 2) one of the legs on one of the chairs isn't totally flat/even on the floor. even with these functional issues, i would still buy them again. They are very inexpensive knockoffs of VERY expensive chairs, and they look fantastic and for the most part have been functionally excellent. 4.5 / 5 stars for me. very very pleased.", 
    "For the price I thought they would be good to use in our office but when we got them in they were actually better quality than anticipated. They aren't a smooth finish but had tiny texture on it which made them better to prevent sliding. The plastic is quite thick and they were super easy to put together. Overall I'm very happy with them.", 
    "We bought these as extra seating for visitors. My son had no problems assembling these chairs. The end result is a sturdy and stylish product. They are light enough to tuck away when not in use and I just wipe them down with a damp cloth to clean. Happy with these chairs.", 
    "These chairs look great with my reclaimed lumber table. Assembly is a bit challenging. Best way is to tighten each screw a bit until you have all attached. Then screw all tight. You do have to pull on the legs a bit to get the holes lined up, but once you get the hang of it, assembly is quite quick.", 
    "These chairs are really functional and great for the price. Yes, you can tell they're a little... \"thin\" like not the sturdiest of builds. BUT for the price, what do you expect. We've had them for a few years and overall very pleased.", 
    "Once the plastic feet come off, which they will without you noticing, the exposed wire will carve deep grooves in your wood floors. There doesn't seem to be any obvious source for replacement feet.", 
    "These look really nice once put together and looks really modern. They can look good in just about any room.", 
    "Much better than I expected.", 
    "Comfortable, sturdy & beautiful. My office has the real deal, and I don't notice anything obviously different about them.", 
    "These chairs are uncomfortable! Even though they look do like posh/high style chairs, it isn't worth it. Also the black leg tips come off and these chairs are destroying our hard wood floors! They're also hard to clean so they look dirty.", 
    "These chairs are a great Eiffel repro, but they arrived with several deep gauges.", 
    "These went into two of our kids' rooms, and who knows what they've been through (!). I know they've been stood on (adult and children both), used for forts, become impromptu desks, and of course, sat upon. They look terrific still, even after a couple of years of use. They look remarkably new.", 
    "absolutely amazing deal. looks expensive, great quality", 
    "Got a set of 6 for a large dinning table. Works well. Comfortable. May need a cushion if you plan on sitting for more than 3-4 hours. Or not. Otherwise, fantastic purchase for a modern look.", 
    "Very happy with the chairs, however I thought they were going to be same ones I bought elsewhere. They will do, price was better.", 
    "Love these! One was a little difficult to assemble, but they were both put together in less than 20 minutes. They look great and I'm considering ordering two more. Also surprisingly comfortable.", 
    "Good quality considering the price", 
    "One of the chairs in the set of two assembled fine, however the second chair was impossible to put together. The base did not line up at all with the holes on the bottom of the seat, regardless of how much we tried to bend/push them into place.", 
    "These chairs are great. Comfortable, easy to clean and way cheaper than eames.", 
    "These chairs are great and easy to clean.", 
    "I bought six of these chairs last fall. They came well protected and assembly was a snap for four out of the six. The other two required an additional set of hands to help me get the screws in place but, with the price tag being so reasonable, it was a small inconvenience. They look great and have held up well.", 
    "I've had these chairs for years now and never reviewed them. They are incredible. I use them as my children's homeschool chairs and we wipe them constantly and EVETYTHING comes off. I have no complaints of the quality of these chairs! Great purchase! Great delivery! Everything about them is wonderful!", 
    "Lovely chairs for an office or kitchen. Great design, and very closely resemble the more expensive modern representation of this chair.", 
    "These chairs are very nice looking as a replica of a classic mid-century design. They were easy to put together. The white plastic has a little texture which looks nice. They are not the most comfortable chairs for sitting a long period of time. We are using them as desk chairs for our children. Perfect!", 
    "For the price I thought they would be good to use in our office but when we got them in, they were actually better quality than anticipated. Ours weren't a smooth finish but had tiny texture on it which made them better so you don't slip. The plastic is quite thick and they were super easy to put together. Overall, I'm very happy with them.", 
    "Looks great with a chrome and glass table", 
    "Added that funk to the ends of my semi conservative table. Came exactly as described. They are a small chair. Easy to put together.", 
    "I love the look and practicality of these chairs. Yes, they are white and get dirty easily, however a little bleach spray and they clean right off. What I don't like is the feet. A couple of our chairs have feet that keep falling off and that has caused inadvertent damage to our wood floors. Very unhappy about that!!!", 
    "I ordered these for my kitchen, knowing they weren't top quality. I like the look, but don't try to use the Mr. Clean magic eraser, the plastic is not good quality and it messed one of my chairs up. The little black covers for the feet do not stay on either and we have already lost 2 of them completely.", 
    "The chairs are fantastic. I am so pleased with them. Super easy to put together. The chairs are sturdy and look almost exactly like the real thing.", 
    "Arrived missing parts that broke through the box, but customer service was quick to resolve everything. Have had two for a couple months now and they're comfortable and seem pretty durable.", 
    "These are great chairs, good quality. They have a slight texture to them, not a smooth plastic just to note. They also creak a little, but not too noteworthy. We've had them for 3 years and they still look great! easy to clean.", 
    "Delivered quickly and a great price!", 
    "I love, love, love these chairs. I have a rather large family member and no fear of the chairs supporting their weight and they were comfortable sitting in the chair for a long thanksgiving dinner. Also, my grandchildren hated my prior dining chairs saying they were cool but very uncomfortable. Now they say my chairs are \"cool\" and comfortable!! Can't get a better review than that!", 
    "Very sturdy and comfortable. These are a steal at this price! Easy to assemble. Easy to keep clean with a toddler. I put them with my farm table and love them!!!", 
    "These chairs look fabulously modern, and for that reason I would recommend for looks only. BUT I would strongly caution buyers that these chairs tip over very easily. If you sit squarely in the center of the chair, they're fine. But if you sit on the edge, the chair will very easily flip over. My elderly mother fell twice by sitting on the edge while trying to feed my son. Dangerous!", 
    "It looks great, I would have given it 5 stars except I had a hard time in the assembly for the last remaining screw, otherwise it looks fantastic", 
    "The chairs more than lived up to my expectations! I love that they are lightweight and yet extremely sturdy. Great purchase", 
    "i've always wanted chairs like these, but i can't afford the real thing! i was torn between this or a pair from *****. glad i ordered from overstock. fast shipping, packaging was secure. these were easy to set up. love love love them. impressed, overstock!", 
    "Ordered a pair of these chairs. They assembled easily in minutes. The little floor protecting bases are flimsy plastic and keep falling off. The chairs are comfortable for dining and seem sturdy.", 
    "The chairs arrived exactly as described. They were easy to assemble and are super comfortable. Great style for a low price - highly recommend!", 
    "These chairs are great - sleek, stylish and comfortable. I read many reviews that the seats were small. I am 5'5 and 145 and these are plenty big, unless you are larger than average. I have heard the ones with the wooden legs aren't as good, but the all metal legs are great! perfect for our kids as well. These are excellent Eames replicas, and I could recommend them, and purchase again.", 
    "Really great chairs patterned after an iconic design. Very comfortable. A little difficult to attach the eiffel base but easily accomplished with a second pair of hands. I purchased 4 chairs and paired them with 2 upholstered chairs to use around my angled leg table from West Elm. A great mix of mid-century and modern design. Thanks, Overstock!", 
    "I was hesitant when purchasing these chairs initially, but since I could not afford the originals, I went on the reviews of others. The chairs turned out to be a very close replica to the originals. They are very comfortable and look amazing!! Overall very pleased!", 
    "The chairs arrived without the \"leg casters\", and missing screws......annoying but easy fix, (just order more); but the disappointment didn't stop there. The holes in which the legs/base need to attached to and screwed in were all covered with hard plastic substance which made screwing the legs in impossible. There was no tool in my garage that could scrape and or drill it off, and even if I could why should I have to?", 
    "Received these chairs with no feet caps. Customer care was nice enough to give me a partial discount.I searched and wasn't able to find any to fit.So sadly had to return. That's ok though.I was able to find others. Overstock has so many others to choose from.", 
    "I love these chairs! The design is very modern and the white color goes well with any decor and looks very chic!", 
    "These are an incredible buy. Very attractive and comfortable chairs. We'd read reviews that chairs often arrived scratched/damaged, and that happened with 4 of our 10 ordered because packing is very inadequate. Annoying, yes, but expected based on the reviews. And overstock had such great customer service that they were quickly replaced (without requesting return of damaged ones, which suggests these are incredibly cheap to produce). They are not as sturdy as a real Eames chair, but great knock-off version for a great price.", 
    "Lots of rave reviews on this one, which are all completely correct. While I'd gladly purchase them again, I thought I'd point out my issues with this purchase. I ordered three sets of chairs. Two pairs came in perfect condition. The third set had a lot of some sort of gooey substance splattered on it. I'm not sure what it was, but it wouldn't clean off. I contacted Overstock for a replacement set and had no issue with getting it. So the issue was resolved but something to consider as a possibility of you're on a time crunch when ordering. My only unresolved complaint is with the feet. The little black bits pop off not infrequently, causing minor scratching on my hardwood floors. I know to look for it but do admit I find it frustrating that I have to. That said, I like the style off chairs enough that it's worth it.", 
    "My chairs showed up today and was missing a plastic foot on one of the legs I went to Ace Hardware to get a replacement and they didn't have any that fit. One of the screws wouldn't fit into the bottom of the chair due to a poor fitting (the plastic oozed into the female end of the fitting at the factory). The chairs are made in China, and the quality control must not be very good. Just a heads up that there may be some issues with your chairs fitting together, or missing parts. It's too much of a hassle to return them so I'm just going to deal with it.", 
    "We were worried when we took delivery of the chairs because the legs were sticking out of the box they were packaged in. They must be pretty hardy though because when we took them out, they were in great shape. It took two of us about 5 minutes to put them together. The holes on the chairs matched up perfectly to the legs. They don't come with instructions but my husband knew where everything went as soon as he saw the hardware. They look great with a wooden table our son made and they seem very well made. Our kids even lean back on the back legs and they seem to take the abuse.", 
    "I love these chairs. So simple to assemble and a great way to update your home for a small amount of money! The quality is great and they are surprisingly comfortable.", 
    "Well priced Eames copy that look great without breaking the bank. I ordered 4 of these for my dining room and they are fairly comfortable. Just be sure to check the chairs for any damage and make sure you have all the parts. There was a black line on one of my chairs that I was able to get off with cleaning solution. One of the other chairs had a scratch on it but wasn't enough of a deal to send it back. I was missing 2 of the black plastic disks that go on the bottom that stabilize the chair and prevent it from scratching the floor. I called customer support and they said they should be able to send new ones within 5 business days.", 
    "The chairs were very easy to put together, are very sturdy and have a great look.", 
    "Nice copy of designer chair of the 50s. Looks really cute in my new kitchen with wooden modern table.", 
    "Considering that these chairs are a cheap knock-off of the Eames originals, and that these sell for about 20% of the cost of the designer version, I'm really happy with them. I use one as an office chair and the other is at my daughter's desk. We've had them for about a year and they're holding up really, really well. I'm happily surprised that they're better than I expected them to be and I'm actually thinking about buying more for our dining room.", 
    "The quality of seat and wire base are excellent but the black plastic footing that connects to wire base are of very poor quality. I can see those things breaking within just a few months. I couldn't even try the chairs bc one of them came with only 2 of the plastic footing and w/o them there is no way to stand the chair up. The other chair was a nightmare to put together! They don't come with any directions and once I finally put it together, the chair was completely crocked. It is too bad! I wish they had worked for me because the price is just incredible. I need a total of 8 chairs so I definitely will not take my chances getting this replaced. I feel like I would run into the same problems I had a least with a few chairs so I must return them. If you only need a couple of chairs, I say go ahead and try it, you might be lucky and get a good pair. Good luck!", 
    "I love, love, love these chairs!!! They totally updated the kitchen from country to modern.", 
    "Very good chairs, a bit expensive tought, but I like the design. and shape. they are also very comfy", 
    "I bought 8 of these for my kitchen (4 sets of 2) and they look fantastic. The quality is really high, we've used them constantly for 2 years and they still look perfect. Food wipes off easily, they're comfortable, and I love the modern look. They're with a $50 kitchen table from a clearance outlet and they make the table look expensive. Easy to put together too (for a girl - a boy tried to help and made a mess of it, something about not wanting to follow the instructions.....).", 
    "I bought four of these chairs (2 sets) a couple of months ago, and am totally happy with my decision to purchase them. They look exactly as I expected based on the photo and other reviews. The white molded plastic is slightly flexible, and the base is a weighty metal that feels exceptionally durable. The chairs were easy to put together as well, in spite of the fact that the manufacturer doesn't include any instructions (would have been nice, but we figured it out). The ONLY reason I am giving them four stars instead of five is the issue that some others have mentioned with the feet. Both boxes we received were short one foot, so we had to call Overstock and request that they send replacements. They were happy to send us extras, and they arrived by mail within about 7-10 days. The willingness of the company to correct any errors meant a lot, and I would buy from them again. The feet are the cheapest looking part of the chair, and I hope they'll last, because I expect to have these at my kitchen table for a long time. They are the closest thing I'll be able to get to the real Eames for the foreseeable future, and are very comfortable to sit in. I smile every time I walk into my kitchen and see them.", 
    "The chairs were easy to put together which worried me after the other reviews that I had read. Evidently someone does not know how to use an allen wrench. One of the black feet for the base was missing. I contacted Overstock and they had it out to my house right a way. Great set of chairs that compliment our retro table.", 
    "These chairs seem to be a bit shorter than most chairs. Not sure if it is the chairs or if my table is a bit taller. Regardless, they look great and are comfortable.", 
    "I recently ordered 4 chairs for my new apt. I liked the design of these chairs, and they are not expensive. I received well the chairs, except that 1 foot cap was missing for 1 chair. After contacting the customer service, they were not willing to send me the missing piece, for the reason that it was not explicitly listed in the item description on the website. In fact, the item description do not list anything except that there is 2 chairs in the box! Moreover the picture associated with the item description show clearly that the black foot caps are part of the chairs. Without the foot cap, the chair is not usable as it is because the foot of the chair is an iron point (not good for the floor). The foot cap is a cheap piece, so I will look into stores to buy it myself, but what a bad experience with customer service! Otherwise, the chairs looks great, they are comfy, and good looking. The material is not the best but it is ok. I think the assembly design could have been ameliorated, because the hole on the seats do not match with the holes of the metallic legs, so you have to put a lot of force to screw everything together.", 
    "Got a pair of these along with a pair of the \"armed\" style for our dining room chairs. Really recommend this pairing if getting these for that purpose. That being said, I use one of them now to replace a vintage, highly-comfortable desk chair we had - so much more comfortable! If you're looking for a great knock-off for a great price, look now further. These are a lot cheaper than knock-offs people are trying to sell on Craigslist!", 
    "Good quality value - great design...missing screws in box but as I said it they were easily replaceable at the Home Depot", 
    "Nice chairs. Takes a little longer than expected to align and attach the metal legs (first three holes line up, the fourth is a bit off). It does not come with instructions, so you need to know or figure out the sequence for the washers, lock washer and bolts. The plastic feet that attach to the bottoms of the legs are not very secure and of poor quality.", 
    "OK Quality, you get what you pay for. Don't think that an Eames replica is even going to be close the to quality of the actual product. At least I did not return these. The matching table came with bent legs twice.", 
    "If you know what the real ones look like you will see the difference immediately. The moulding quality is poor, however they look robust and do the job.", 
    "We received our chairs only to find one was defective. We spoke with customer service and they sent us a replacement seat, which arrived with gashes and scratches all over it. We spoke with customer service again, and she said she could either refund us only part of our order or send out an entire new order which we would then have to take out the different pieces that we needed and ship it back. They arrived in good condition, just more hassle than what it was worth.", 
    "Hi, the only problem that I have with these chairs is that the little black/gray-black foot pads do not stay on. I've even tried to crazy glue them on, but it doesn't hold for long. Maybe the foot pads should snap on--like make the top part of the plastic pads a little more rounded so that the leg could snap in and since the pads are curved to the bottom of the chair it will move/repossession itself as the chairs are moved around.", 
    "I've had these chairs for almost one year now. I love them! They are comfortable and look awesome. Easy to clean.. I have wood floors and put a pad on the legs and they slide around perfect without scratching the floor.. I would order again.. I mixed a pair of these chairs with other chairs I already had and it goes great..", 
    "Used large quantity in food service establishment. Endured much abuse. Held up extremely well. Good likeness to designer original.", 
    "Cute little chairs, you can throw them anywhere in the house & they will look just great with any home decor style you have.", 
    "So happy to find these on Overstock. I've always loved these but haven't had the home to put them in. We've recently purchased a very small mountain cabin and these are perfect for the design, comfort, and visual impact. They are comfortable but take little visual room. They will look great with a black-stained oak table, and a modern suspended Italian light fixture....Thank you for offering these!!!", 
    "I love my new chairs. Such fun, modern chairs for more then half the price of the Eames designer chair. However, they didn't come with assembly instructions. Really easy to put together but still annoying that they didn't have any sort of instructions. They are really comfy too. I wouldn't expect that but you fit right into them. Happy with my purchase.", 
    "I got these chairs because after they're sturdier than the chairs, similar to these with a wooden base, and they're just as eye-catching.", 
    "The chairs are perfect; however, one of the black protectors on the bottom of the chair was broken upon delivery. Aside from that the chair was easy enough to assemble (with the right tools).", 
    "These chairs are lovely to look at, a nice modern look without being flashy. The material is constructed solidly and they did not take long to assemble. However - I would mention they are not lounging chairs (meaning, they're not overly comfortable for sitting a long period of time). We use them for our kitchen table, which works fine but if you like to sit for more than 20-30 minutes, a small cushion might be in order.", 
    "A little difficult to put together, but overall really nice chairs for the price.", 
    "These chairs look great with a casual cherry dining table. The room has a mid century style and these chairs are a great addition. I highly recommend them.", 
    "These chairs are comfortable, practical, and a nice imitation. They also look great. I bought 4 a 18 months ago, and needed an extra chair @ the office. the price is so good you really cant beat it. Highly recommended", 
    "I just received my chairs. Delivery was quick and easy. I don't think these chairs come with instructions but it's so easy to put together you won't need them. I purchased the tripod table from west elm and paired it with these chairs. It looks amazing. Perfect for a small space. Very modern looking and comfortable. I am very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "These chairs are a great purchase being that my kids and husband tend to spill things everywhere and I am able to wipe them off very easily. That's why I chose this kind of material instead of the chairs with fabric. Although, they are a little lower than my previous chairs so I had to place a cushion on them for my younger kids. I like the modern look. The only thing that bothers me is the little black plastic things at the end of the legs tend to fall off once in awhile, but they do come with extra ones in case you lose them, but other than that I really love the functionality, practicality and look of the chairs.", 
    "I ordered these chairs thinking that I may be dissappointed as I had a pair of the \"originals\" some years back. They are VERY close to the same chairs and actually a bit more comfortable! They arrived well packed, however there was a hole in the bottom of box and 3 of the plastic feet caps missing. I called Overstock and the customer service could NOT have been better! Repacment feet (plus some) were shipped to me within 7 days and Customer Service kept me informed. VERY pleased with chairs! COOL modern look and comfortable. I am going to order a 2nd set.", 
    "We purchased these chairs for our kitchen eating area and love them. One of the 4 chairs had a few scratches on it but they were minor so we kept it. Otherwise, we are very pleased with our purchase.", 
    "- The chairs give a modern feeling in the living room - One of the chairs had black marks on it but they disappeared after I cleaned them with a wet cloth. There was a scratch as well, but I didn't go into the trouble of returning it. - The black plastic parts for the four legs were a bit loose. -Very easy to assembly", 
    "My box arrived in perfect shape and everything was safely and well packaged. The only assembly is screwing in 4 bolts per chair to attach the base to the seat. The base has a little bit of give to match up with the holes. Just screw each bolt in lightly just to hold and tighten once they are all in and it should be a breeze. Comes with felt pads for adding under the legs, a nice addition. This is of course a knock off but all things considered it does pretty darn well for the price. The seat is not plexiglass or completely smooth and is a very lightly fine textured plastic. I got a tiny mark on mine when putting together but a quick swipe with a magic eraser and it was gone. I can see this holding up well with kids etc as it is easy to keep clean. Besides looking good it is also very comfortable. Perfect dining table height. I am currently using one at my desk which it is a little low for but since it is so comfortable on the bum it works well for short times. :) One downside to note: the box and the chairs came with an EXTREME chemical smell. Had to open the windows and let the room air out for a while. Took a couple days to wear off but it does wear off completely eventually.", 
    "We were looking for modern style chairs that were affordable. We love these chairs. They are very comfortable, sturdy, and were relatively easy to put together.", 
    "Comfortable but slightly low for my table. Its fine with a cushion though.", 
    "I was very please when they arrive. In the beginning I only order 2, just wanted to see how the looked, after seeing the product I order 2 more. I was very please with the quality, I place them in my dinning room they are so confortable. I would recommend to anyone. The delivery was also exactly as stateed.", 
    "I love these chairs! They are the exact look I was going for in my dining room for an 8th of the price I'd normally have had to pay for designer looking chairs or any chair for that matter. They aren't super wide but I think even a wider person could sit in them for a bit comfortably. They are very comfortable to my family an friends. I would highly recommend for anyone looking for this eames style for a great price. They are awesome looking, which is my favorite part:)", 
    "I bought these as dining chairs at my table and they are great. They are surprisingly comfortable and are a great knockoff of the Eames style chair. Assembling these chairs is much easier if you have two people; before buying it I read how some people thought assembly was difficult, but just grab someone to help you. Overall these are great and I highly recommend them!", 
    "these are a great replica and are comfortable and look great. however was a bear to put together. i would buy them again for the price doesn't get any better", 
    "These are fantastic chairs. I bought six. Some were easier to put together than others because the holes did not match up with the metal legs, but they eventually all went together. I am thoroughly enjoying their style and their practicality. They are very stylish and extremely cleanable, which makes them perfect for our family!!! I love them and like them more each day. Glad I purchased them and will definitely purchase more items from overstock.", 
    "Good chairs, though they're a bit smaller than I anticipated. Surprisingly comfortable, even for someone my size (6'1'', 225). They look great in our dining room.", 
    "I LOVE these chairs! My style in my house is a bit mid-century modern with industrial touches so these were the perfect fit! Very comfortable and sturdy - can't wait to have dinner parties with my new dining set! The shipping was amazingly fast! I orded 6 chairs on a Wednesday (during holiday season) with free shipping and expected arrival date of that following Tuesday or Wednesday but they arrived that Friday afternoon!!!!! Such a great holiday surprise for me!", 
    "I have a real Herman Miller custom color chair for my desk area, but did not want to spend the money on 8 high end chairs that are made of plastic (yep the real Herman Miller chairs are made of plastic). These chairs from overstock were a great chair that are identical to the high end chair I have and for way less. Definitely a good buy.", 
    "I was looking to order these chars quite a few times, but my luck, they were always out of stock. I do not wonder and am not surprised as they are just as great as described. Simple, really useful for indoor and outdoor use and stylish. Finally I have them on an amazing price.", 
    "These chairs ROCK! They are the same look as the designer Eames Chairs at the fraction of the cost. They are very comfortable and modern looking, which I LOVE. You won't be disappointed. I love the way they look in my dining room and couldn\u0092t be happier with my purchase.", 
    "I love these chairs! They are exactly what I wanted to go with my new \"retro\" white tulip table first designed in 1956. One chair was very difficult to attach the base, but the others were a snap. They look great in my kitchen.", 
    "These chairs are really great for everyday use and they are really solid and sturdy. Made of durable materials, we can sue the chairs both indoors and outdoors, whenever we have a friend or family gathering. They are really easy to clean and store, and we finally do not lack seating. Thank you.", 
    "These chairs are really simple and unique. I have never had plastic chairs so it was my first order but I was really happy and surprised of the great quality. The wire legs and base is really unique and constructed in a solid and stable way. Easy to clean and perfect to use both indoors and outdoors.", 
    "I have an original fiberglass Eames chair that is better quality and I wanted to buy more for my dining room but I could not afford to purchase 6 original chairs- which run about $300 a chair. I expected these chairs to be lower quality and they are to an extent because they are plastic, but I believe new Eames chairs are also plastic---but probably a heavier grade of plastic. That said, I LOVE the chairs, they look great with my natural wood table. I loved them so much that after buying 4 as a trial, I completed the set with 2 more. Honestly, for the price you can't get anything better. I think chairs at xxx or xxxxxxx aren't even better quality. That said, I would highly recommend these to anyone with a decorating sense who wants the look but can't afford the originals.", 
    "The chairs look amazing but putting the legs is just pure pain! The screws do not line up. I guess that's what happens one doesn't buy the original chairs.", 
    "I should have spent more money to get a better quality chair & will do that later down the road. These look good, but are smaller than I imagined & look tiny next to my dining room table. My mistake as the chairs are exactly as described on overstock. I like the other chairs I bought from here much better.", 
    "This chair is a good replica piece and quality is good as well. We have 4 original ones from design within reach in red color. This chair is not comparable to the real ones in terms of quality. But it does look very similar and the price is unbeatable.", 
    "Purchased 4 of these for our vacation home. Very pleased.", 
    "If you want the look without paying the price these are a good choice. What I always want to know when buying Chinese knock offs is if they pass the eye test and if they are built well enough that they won't be trash in 3 weeks. These pass. I don't think they'll be confused for originals, but who really cares? Most people would probably guess the current **** versions are fakes until they flipped it over (they are also made of plastic). I was between this and a set of the **** ones, which are still made in the original fiberglass. I got a set of 4 for the price of 1, so the choice was easy. If you don't care about labels or 100% authenticity go with these.", 
    "Me and my husband run a private after school program and we thought that if you have different color chairs you can eliminate some barriers between children and teacher. So we took action and bought a set of these chairs along with other colored chairs. As it turned out we were right. We got the chairs, the service was ok, the price was ok, it was totally worth it.", 
    "These are great chairs for the price! You are not getting vintage Eames chairs - these are reproduction ones, so there will be a quality difference. But if you're looking for the same look at a decent price, then these are fantastic & comfortable. As other buyers had mentioned, there is a bit of an alignment issue with the legs. So you need to be a bit 'persuasive' in getting the screws in.", 
    "I have never had plastic chairs before but these ones are so eye catching and unique that I had to order two sets. They are really solid and durable, easy to clean and really great to use outdoors and indoors. Whenever we decide to have breakfast or dinner outside we just take these chairs and enjoy our meal. I am really glad I ordered. Thank you.", 
    "I love my living with these chairs. They are unique and really durable, bringing a fresh look into the room. I have never imagined I will get plastic chairs but I am glad I ordered. Best price and really unique wire base legs. Just simple beauty and modern minimalism. Warmly recommend it.", 
    "Very pleased!! The products shipped very quickly, they were packed nicely. And their condition was excellent. They were easy to assemble. We had no issues with the holes not matching up. The chairs are sturdy and comfortable. I was nervous to buy a white chair with a 2 year old toddler running around. But they wipe clean easily. Great mid-century modern edition to our home. Great price for a very close to the original reproduction. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "We love the chairs! We have a 20 and 17 year old, and surprised our 17 year who was away when we ordered them. SHE loves them! She came home with a bunch of friends and they all said how cool the chairs are. It's not easy to impress teenagers. Usually they don't say anything, or they just mumble. The chairs wipe clean easily, as well; that was our bggest concern. They were easy to put together. My husband put them together in a matter of minutes, and he cannot do anything around the house:)", 
    "I purchased these chairs June 30th. They arrived 5 days later. I had no issues putting them together. Unlike other reviews, everything lined up. 10 minutes total for both chairs. The chairs are comfortable. They have good", 
    "I am satisfied with these chairs. They are a great affordable option for a look that is usually much more expensive. We already have gotten a few compliments on them! Assembly was a bit tricky, while there are just 4 screws for each, aligning the wire base with the holes so the screws threaded straight required a bit of pulling and pushing. Once assembled, there were a few smudges from manufacturing or shipping than needed cleaning. A paper towel and windex took care of it. They have been comfortable and I think they will be durable for quite some time. I worry about getting them dirty or scratched by those metal rivets in jeans but that wear and tear will happen. The welds seem strong.", 
    "Love these chairs and especially love the chairs for the price! Purchased four chairs for my kitchen table, and we couldn't be more pleased.", 
    "I ordered 4 of these chairs. I received one damaged. I contacted overstock and they replaced it right away. The plastic is a little like a school chair, not smooth like a real eames chair, but easy to clean. Chairs were easy at assemble.", 
    "Very nice design in a chair, however, it is smaller than I had hoped. I returned mine as a hole was not drilled in one chair. The return was easy. It is a nice contemporary piece.", 
    "it's really good for a price of $xxx.xx for the pair, and we got extra 10% off. I would buy another pair. Does it look like a 500$ chair? no. Up close you can see the workmanship but for me $xx a chair to make my dining room looks modern, why not?", 
    "I ordered four of these chairs to go with the white 36\" Saarinen Tulip Table also on Overstock. They look amazing together and the white on the table and chairs matches perfectly. These chairs completed my retro-modern look in a beautiful way. In assembling the chairs I suggest not to tighten the screws completely until you have them all attached. The first chair was difficult to put together because I didn't have instructions but once I figured it out, each chair took about five minutes to assemble thereafter. I would recommend these chairs to anyone who wants a clean retro-modern look!", 
    "I own a beauty salon and I recently upgraded the furniture. Since the new furniture is white I thought I will buy some white chairs to the lounge so that my customers feel relaxed why they enjoy a good coffee or tea. These chairs were the best pick I could make to accomplish what I had in mind. Now everything looks just the way I wanted.", 
    "These chairs are perfect for indoor and outdoor use also. I ordered three sets of wire base chairs into our weekend house as we love to go there with our friends and to have fun. he chairs are lightweight and comfortable and whenever we need them just take them out near the pool or use them inside in the living. Top price and quality. I adore these chairs. They are easy to clean also.", 
    "These chairs were the best hall additions I could find. They are modern, simple fresh and comfortable. The wire base looks amazing below the shell seating. The chairs are easy to clean and move around and look amazing near my new glass table. The price was a bit higher that I could afford but the design and quality worth the money.", 
    "I ordered four of these chairs to pair with my rustic farm table. They look amazing! They are so unique and cannot be found anywhere else for this price! They are exactly like their knock off original but not for 5 times the amount. They really we're fairly easy to put together and my husband and I had all four done in maybe 15 minutes. Thank you overstock again for helping me look richer than I really am! ;)", 
    "I love these! No better price anywhere on the internet. Fairly true to the original Eames design and they come with felt pads on the underside of each leg to keep from scratching your floors. Very timeless. A++", 
    "I am very pleased with the quality and construction of these chairs. I wanted Classic Eames chairs for our work desks in my photo studio but were able to find a pair of originals that fit both our color scheme and budget. I was a bit hesitant of these but absolutely love them. We've only been using them for a couple weeks so I can't speak of long term quality but they are comfortable, sturdy and were a breeze to put together. (Took me 15 minutes total to install the bases on both chairs). Definitely recommend these to anyone on the fence and we will absolutely be purchasing more soon.", 
    "These chairs look nice in our space, but when I put them up to our dining room table, they were quite short, making the table top come up kind of high. We'll keep them, but I wish they had been a little taller/bigger. Also, they smell SUPER strong of plastic and mothballs when you take them out of the box so give them a good airing when you receive them.", 
    "The chairs looked just like on the site and the only thing is they are a little hard for sitting any long period of time, good for extra chairs.", 
    "These chairs are very affordable, however, they are not the highest quality plastic chairs out there. They are good for our purposes, and pass for something more high-end if they aren't carefully inspected.", 
    "Good: finish, price, sturdy, attractive. Bad: metal legs packed tightly, difficult to separate from each other. Wish more colors available.", 
    "These are exactly what we were expecting. They arrived very quickly and were easy to assemble. They make a nice addition to our mid century modern dining table. I would buy two more if I had a place to put them!", 
    "I am a designer, and needed to have a fun modern dining corner. These chairs complemented our dining table real well!", 
    "I found it a bit then in the plastic part - it needed more heft to it. The original chairs were made of fiberglass. I have the impression they may not last too long. But the delivery was good, putting them together was easy enough. I would prefer more thickness in the white plastic. A bit lacking in urban chic.", 
    "Pleasantly surprised how sturdy and solid they were. Assembly was a snap, even without directions. (though I'm glad I read the reviews first to know that you shouldn't tighten any of the screws until all four are in place.)", 
    "so happy i bought these chairs(6 total) for my dining room-changed the whole look of the room. no assembly instructions included but easy to put together-my husband did all 6 within 1.5 hours. like previously mentioned-don't tighten all connections until all 4 are attached. the quality is great-no problems- sturdy-solid chairs yet lightweight when it comes to moving them , also very comfortable not stiff-conforms to your body-easy to clean. enjoy!", 
    "I love these chairs in my mi d-century house. They look great and are amazingly comfortable. The only problem is that they can be very difficult to assemble. My husband had to push with all his might in order to get the screw holes to line up properly. I don't think it would be possible for one person to put these together.", 
    "We purchased these chairs for our front breakfast nook on the deck - we needed something that was narrow, but stylish and still comfortable. They were fairly easy to put together and seem to be sturdy, I don't have any concerns about them breaking anytime soon. They look great and seem to be weathering OK so far, though they aren't in direct weather.", 
    "These chairs are fantastic! The holes don't match up exactly but I put them together myself within 15 minutes per chair. The chairs are a great knock-off of the original design and look great with my chocolate-brown dining table. I ordered 4 more!", 
    "I am delighted to have my new set of Ronnie Wire Base Chairs. Overall I am pleased with the color and the quality. My only problem was that the bases did not exactly match the chair bottom and I had some difficulty screwing them together. My husband had to force the base in place while I screwed them in. I don't think I could have done it alone. If this problem was resolved I would up my rating to 5 stars.", 
    "I purchased four of these chairs to go with my reclaimed wood & industrial table and they work great. I read all of the good reviews before I bought them and I remember reading one review about how dirty they were. I thought that was silly but they were seriously dirty!! They looked like they were bathed in muddy water. We had to scrub them before we could use them. Now that they are clean they are fine.Also they are pretty difficult to assemble since the holes do not line up. Overall we are happy with the purchase, they look great and the price was excellent!", 
    "I purchased these chairs for an office that my husband & I are sharing. Great style & great price for a nice designer knock off.", 
    "We ordered 2 sets of chairs to use at our dining table. We are very pleased! One of the chairs was a little bit of a challenge to put together, but not impossible by far! The chairs look great in our space and I couldn't care less that they are a \"knock off\". No one who visits my house would even know that there was an original to knock-off in the first place! The only issue (not really an issue...just a note) is that they are fairly easy to tip over. That only matters if you have a toddler trying to climb around in one, like I do. They are safe and everything, just easy to tip. Overall, we are very pleased and would order more in a heartbeat!", 
    "I would love to be able to purchase the original Eames Eiffel chairs, but that's a ways off. These are excellent facsimiles and and look amazing with the Havana dining table.", 
    "The Quality of these chairs was good. The hardware was a bit fragile, (I nearly stripped one of the screws using my cordless driver) so be careful when assembling them. No surprises, overall. Product was as advertised and so far seems to be a good value for the price.", 
    "We love the look of these Ronnie Wire Base chairs. They are very similar to much pricier Eames style chairs. The price can't be beat, however, we had difficulty with the base not lining up with the holes and it was very difficult to build these chairs as the screws would not thread in since the holes would not line up. We contacted customer service and they were excellent about handling the problem and replacing the base and continued to work with us until it was right. Again, I can not emphasize enough how good Overstock's customer service is and how quickly they resolved the issue with the chairs and shipped replacement product.", 
    "I just received four of these chairs this afternoon, and my husband and son-in-law put them together in about 15 minutes. No problems, no drama. I think they look and feel great -- in my opinion, they're a faithful-enough knockoff of the Eames original. Only a total Eames snob would perhaps readily know the diff, and how many of those types come around on a regular basis. So happy I didn't spend a thousand bucks on the so-called authentic ones at Design Within Reach.", 
    "I ordered these chairs with low expectations, knowing that it is a replica and a lot cheaper, so I was ready the cheaper feel... Boy was I right, and then some! The plastic chair itself is a way cheaper plastic, I've seen the original so I know the difference. This is fine with me, since the these are way cheaper in price. What sets me off is the legs are completely off. Other people are experiencing hard assembly, my was smooth... but the legs are way wrong. The correct length of the front legs are 17\" tall, while the other set is only 15 1/2\". I ordered a set of 2 to see how these are, before I ordered the rest ( I was going to order a total of 12 chairs to be used in my coffee shop ). I'm not so sure now base on the inconsistency of the product...", 
    "good chairs for the price. Hard to line up legs to attach seat. one was easy, the second much harder...metal was bent a bit.", 
    "This is one of my favorite purchases from Overstock. This are adorable, light-weight, easy to assemble, comfortable & sturdy. I get so many complements from friends. Buy them.", 
    "Had a little trouble with the assembly, not very handy and I'm 83 years young. O.K. now.", 
    "looks awesome in my room. high quality just like the brand name version", 
    "i really like these chairs. they are just the perfect height for my table. my kids say they look like the cafeteria chairs at their school. makes them feel hungry!", 
    "These remind me of the chairs I had to use in school, minus their bright colors. I bought a pair and put one in each of my kids' rooms. These seem to like them a lot more than their old ones.", 
    "i love these chairs. make great informal dining chairs. and i cant believe you get two for such a low price!", 
    "These chairs really speak to me. They are so stylish, but wow! How comfortable!", 
    "I can believe I got TWO of these chairs at such a good price! Fantastic deal!", 
    "We were not able to put the chairs together because the holes don't fit with the legs. They seem very nice, but it has been disappointing. When returning the product any of Overstock questions are correct because the product is defective or maybe this only pair. I hope so.", 
    "super fast shipping. love the unique look of the legs", 
    "Ladies love them. Got them in my game around around the pool table. Perfect chairs for my lovely audience", 
    "OMG, I just adore these chairs. They remind me of when I used to be in detention. LOL. Only missing the old gum under the seat. ROFL! They are super comfy, especially for plastic. The white just pops against the yucky wood paneling in my room.", 
    "loved them for the price. there was a little trouble screwing on the base to one of them. but great overall", 
    "I put these in the waiting room of my home office. Told they are comfortable and look nice.", 
    "replaced my dining chairs that my boys tore up with these. great chairs. holds up well when they act foolish", 
    "I was looking for a couple of chairs for a small home office. These were perfect. The size was just what I needed to not to big and not too small.", 
    "These chairs look nice in our dining room (dark hardwood floors, coffee-colored dining table). Assembling the chairs took a little bit of time but was doable by one person (me). We ordered six of these (three sets of two). One set of two was damaged by poor packaging, with the chairs suffering from some scratches. Overstock Customer Care graciously sent two replacement chairs, which arrived without scratches. The chairs feel sturdy when sitting on them. The backs have a little bit of give when leaning back, which is nice. I can't speak to how well the chairs will hold up to years of use since we've only had them for a couple of weeks, but the build and quality seem fine to me (I'm no expert though). My wife thinks they are mid-century modern and thinks they feel well within the feel of our dining room. I myself don't know the difference between various furniture styles... as long as she's happy and the furniture is decent quality and isn't too much of a pain to put together :)", 
    "Except for a couple of chairs that were defective, the chairs are fine. We ordered eight of them and O.co was quick to ship two new ones to replace the defective seats. Took hubby a while to install a few of them because some of the legs are tight. Satisfied with the purchase.", 
    "very nice chairs. I went to *** (to sit on the expensive version) a few days before I received my chairs from Overstock. honestly, I can't tell the difference. these are comfortable chairs.", 
    "I love these chairs so much -- they look fantastic with my Saarinen tulip table (well, the CB2 knock-off) and they're so easy to keep clean. They're pretty comfortable too. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend them -- they're pretty much my favorite thing in my kitchen.", 
    "Nice chairs, we didn't end up keeping them b/c we found something we liked a bit better, but these are really cool!", 
    "I was very disappointed when I received the chairs. I have a wholesale showroom in Manhattan, and was going to order 12 of them, but decided to \"check out\" one set before ordering a dozen. First of all, I thought the seats were glossy, but they were matte. I started to assemble them, and discovered I couldn't attach the rubber \"feet\" that goes on the bottom of the legs to one of the bases. I pulled out the second base, to see if that one would be easier, and discovered to my dismay that they were already attached to that base. The metal base that I could not attach the \"feet\" to, was also out of line, and rocked back and forth when I put it on the floor. This led me to believe that this set was returned by another customer, and sent to me. I promptly returned them.", 
    "Perfect look with my dining table, but a little shorter than I thought. However I needed a lower profile chair with the dining room being a bit small and the existing matching chairs too big for the space. These look great - but are about an inch shorter than my other dining chairs....owell. Still great look/value!!!", 
    "We need four chairs for a table in our office. Essentially we had to return two because they could not be put together. The drilled holes didn't match up with the legs. Overstock return/exchange policy was easy and swift. However, when we received our replacement, one of the chairs again could not be put together because of a defect. Ultimately, because I had been out of the country for a month and wasn't aware of the problem until I came back to the office, I chose to just order two more chairs and not return the one that didn't work again. The final order, both chairs were easy to assemble. They look great.", 
    "i was looking for chairs that would work well with a fairly traditional decor, but not detract from the beauty of our new custom table. these were a great choice. they are clean and modern looking, but also blend nicely with existing furnature. i am impressed with how easily they clean up after meals with my 2 young children. a simple spray and wipedown and they come perfectly clean. easy to assemble. a great deal for the price.", 
    "The Chairs are beautiful! They are sturdy and have a lovely sheen. They are a little tricky to put together on your own, but with two people it's a breeze. Totally recommend!", 
    "we've got the real deal fiberglass chairs in our dining room and absolutely love them! i wanted the same comfort and style for our outdoor dining space as well so i ordered two of the ronnie chairs as a trial. at a fraction of the price of the originals you get a nice replica that can hold it's own. assembly was a bit of a pain as the holes and the bases don't line up perfectly but with a bit of pushing and pulling i amnaged in the end. ultimately we ended up ordering six more to complete our set.", 
    "The order was shipped quickly and after assembly the chairs look exactly as pictured. The chairs are comfortable and look great in our downstairs family room. Great price.", 
    "similar to others reviews, these chairs are a bit of a pain to put together, which is why i left the job to my husband. we assembled the chairs in less than 30 minutes and were very happy with the results. one of the chairs had a dark scratch on the seat, which was pretty upsetting, but i didn't want to go through the hassle of sending back one chair, so we have 3 + 1 imperfect chairs sitting around our wooden dining room table.", 
    "I ordered these chairs last month. They shipped sooner than expected. They were a little tough to put together but not impossible. They are super comfortable and look great in our dining room. I think I'll order two armchairs as well.", 
    "This is without a doubt the most comfortable chair ----ever---- made. Glad to see so many available these days.Solid sturdy and classy. Love it!", 
    "The chairs arrived well packaged. Easy to assemble, no missing parts. One of the chairs wobbled, so I easily put a small piece of felt pad on the bottom. They are stark white, light weight, comfortable. i've only had them for a few weeks, so they are still clean and I just wipe off food/dirt. Haven't had major staining spills on them. I use them as kitchen table chairs. I like them alot. Enjoy!", 
    "Chairs arrived in great shape. It was nice having two people to put them together - because it took a little muscle to get the metal bottom to line up with the holes on the plastic seat. I purchased 4 chairs for my 'tiny' dining space. The scale of this chair is perfect. Quality of both the metal and plastic is great for the price. The chair itself is very comfy. I'm thinking it needs a lambswool throw for the winter months to keep the seat warm. Also thinking of getting (2) of the bigger arm chair seeing as I have so much space to move around now.", 
    "Lovely mid-century modern look, crisp, clean, comfortable. The chair body has a nice flex, very supportive with a matte finish. They look great juxtaposed with an older wooden table. These chairs were delivered without directions. I was unsure where to put the washer, under or over. It's really a two-person job, everything should be aligned correctly and lightly tightened before the final tighten-up. I needed a tack hammer to put on the chair feet. All in all, I'm delighted. I intend to order 3 more sets.", 
    "Although I do not like this kind of material, these Ronnie Wire Base White Chairs looked so amazing I had to order them. My living room looks great with these funny, modern, vivid and elegant chairs. I love their white color and the clean, simple form sculpted to fit the body giving the comfort of sitting in them. Everyone loves these chairs just as me. The design, high quality and low price is great, just as expectable from Overstock. Thank you.", 
    "I think these chairs are so cute and modern! Bought 2 sets. Our kids tend to sit on the edges of chairs and they have learned to totally sit on these because they tip over! Husband is happy with the flexibility, size and comfort, and he's big...6'5\", over 200 lbs....don't really like how they sound when we pull out the chairs on tile. Wood floors probably wouldn't be as bad. Overall, they are great, but since I've never sat on the real Eames chairs, I can't compare. Hope they last!", 
    "I purchased these for my two desks in my office, and I have really enjoyed them. I spend a lot of time in them and they are very comfortable. They were a little tricky to put together as the seat didn't line up with the holes, it took a little pushing and bending, but I was eventually able to put them together and have had no problems since. Great chairs, especially for the price!", 
    "I debated about buying knock offs for a long time, but after reading the positive reviews I decided to take a chance. I was not disappointed! These are very nice quality and work great with my Heywood Wakefield desk. I am very impressed with Overstock's retro reproductions and would highly recommend these chairs to anyone looking to bring a cool mid century feel to your home without spending a fortune.", 
    "these are great chairs at a great price. they are easy to assemble, super comfortable and look great. i have them matched up with some wire knoll chairs but these are way more comfortable!", 
    "I always wanted to have these chairs, but could never afford the real thing. The chairs are really pretty, and I was super happy I found them on here. However the assembly was a liiittle bit tricky. Nothing major, but it did take 2 people to bent the legs into the right position and a set of screws was missing. I'd definitely buy them again even if they're not the real thing and am sure won't last quite as long ...", 
    "We would have loved to get all herman miller on our dining room, but alas these were much closer to our price range and we love them. They are difficult to put together but in the end they feel sturdy and look great. I love the matt finish to them too. Check out what we did with them if you like in about a week (12/20/2010) there will be some pictures posted at http*****. Buy and enjoy! Also, we recieved them in like 2 days and the customer service was amazing when my husband scratched off the gift card code by mistake and the opperator helped us use the card regardless!", 
    "These are a good quality replica of the famed \"eiffel tower\" chairs by Herman Miller. They are quite sturdy, look good, and even come with some felt for the feet. Not to mention this is a BARGAIN.", 
    "Love, love, love these chairs! With three small boys, I wanted the look of the classic but I didn't want to pay the price. These look just like the Eames and are sturdy yet easy to clean. These were easy to put together and they look great at my table. Such a great find!", 
    "Yes, the chairs did take some muscle work to get together, but it was not as bad as I thought it would be. They look fabulous once assembled, and are pretty comfortable. I might get 2 more for my kitchen table.", 
    "Ordered two intially and liked them so we ordered two more. They are sturdy and have had them for about 45 days. Great chair for the price and very comfortable. Nice compliment to our 1959 mid century home. Only issue was with the holes in the chair base for attaching the legs. I had issues with two holes (4 per chair) on two separate chairs. Just needed to be careful and screw the bolts into the chair first without the leg attachments. We would consider buying a couple more if there more color choices.", 
    "You can find similar chairs at designer stores at double or more the overstock price. Unless you tell your guests, they will never know the difference. I purchased two for pairing with several \"Ronnie Chairs.\" They match perfectly -- same manufacturer, so same plastics and chrome finishes. As others have noted, the chairs can require two people to assemble depending on how well the legs line up with the holes for attachment (one person for bending, the other for screwing). The plastic is a matte finish, much like more expensive versions sold elsewhere. The chairs offer some flex when you sit; definitely, a stylish, comfortable chair. I wholeheartedly recommend them.", 
    "These are fine if one accepts they are not the original... I ordered a dozen chairs (6 pairs) and Overstock sent 4 correct pairs and 2 pairs (4 chairs) of a different model... so they had to be returned, I had to be refunded, then wait for them to come back in stock and then reorder.... took several phone calls and visits by UPS etc. but all well in the end. One chair arrived with the leg bent due to poor packaging... but I can't be bothered to return it... (I'm sure OS w/ld replace it etc.)", 
    "These chairs were amazingly cheap, came in the shortest time possible and the assembly was as easy as a child\u0092s game. I have ordered this set of Ronnie Wire Base White Chairs for my small living room and they are adorable. Featuring simple and clean lines and having an elegant design these chairs are what I have been long searching for. They look great in my living and give a pleasant atmosphere.", 
    "Searched a lot before I purchase these chairs from Overstock.com. Same look with other websites 1/3 of the price!!...Cant beet that...The chairs came in less than 5 days...The assembly is redicusly easy, they are very sturdy and they look awsome in our computer room!!!....Bravo Overstock!!!", 
    "For the price these chairs are great. No complaints yet.", 
    "These chairs are basically the same as the Herman Miller $250/chair!! Love them and sooooooooo glad I found them on Overstock!!!", 
    "I was really worried about assembly after reading other reviews. Funny thing is, I found them to be incredibly easy to assemble and I'm no mechanical engineer. The most trouble I had during assembly was getting the little black feet on the ends of the legs-but even that was doable. Looks-wise, they are exactly what I was expecting-a very close replica of the original (and WAY more expensive) Eiffel chairs. They really are lovely-they are a nice matte white color and yes, there is some texture to the finish that may be off-putting to some. They aren't the smooth fiberglass of the originals-even the herman miller replicas are now made of polypropylene instead of fiberglass-so I'm not sure this would be much different if you paid more for the herman miller ones. They look great, but even better-they are really comfy. Like the originals, they have the waterfall edges, so they don't cut into your legs at the seat and the seat is deep-so plenty of room. They are the perfect height for my dining table. They are easy to clean. Couldn't ask for more at the price I paid. Shipping was quick and everything arrived without a scratch. Very Satisfied!", 
    "I consider myself handy and these chairs were not easy to assemble. 2 of the 4 were almost impossible to put together. There was white plastic (from chair seats) where the screws go in. We had to shave the plastic down with a razor to get the screws in. The holes did not align with the metal bases so a second person was needed to push the metal base in place (which was not an easy job). We did get three of the four chairs together and I still like them. The fourth ... I could only get one of the screws to go in half way (its warped from try) and now can't take it apart so I can't return it.", 
    "These are a great addition to your home. Let's be honest, they are wannabe Eames chairs but much more affordable. The texture of the plastic is similar to school chairs and the color is a clean bright white. I read other reviews about how difficult attaching the legs to the base are but I didn't have that problem. If you're building on your own, I would suggest placing the chair base upside in the box (use a folded flap as leverage) and then attach the bolts & the wire legs. The rubber ends attach easily when you're sitting on the chair. Cheers!", 
    "Chairs were as described. Great look and feel! Were just a little challenging with assembling one or two of the legs but overall not much effort. Might actually buy additional chairs just to have as additional seating for larger parties. Thanks!", 
    "I have to admit at first I was afraid to order these chairs, because they look so nice on the picture, but I did not know how they will look at the arrival. But I was not disappointed. After assembling they looked great. Better than in picture. They were easy to assemble, and worth their price. Easy to move around, a good solution for decoration, they are simple, elegant and easy to clean. Love them.", 
    "it was a cinch to put together and very comfortable and stylish. I'm buying another set!", 
    "I was a little hesitant to order these without seeing them in person, but I took the chance and I am very happy! These are a fantastic, affordable, option for an iconic look without the price tag. They are good quality, fairly easy to assemble (about an hour w/two people) and quite comfortable. You really can't beat the price, including shipping, for any sort of modern chair (IKEA or similar) of the same quality and taste. I look forward to using them for years ahead!", 
    "We were so excited when these chairs finally came back after being sold out for months. We love the look and the assembling took no time at all. My only complaint is that the plastic is not shiny and slick, rather more similar to school chairs \"popcorn\" plastic finish.", 
    "Chairs are very nice for the price. Little difficult to put together because the alignment is sometimes off. All and all it was a good purchase.", 
    "I purchases 2 sets of these for my dining room. They were simple to put together (says the husband) and they haven't shown any wear, and we've had them for a few months now. Definately a great buy at the price! I'm planning on buying another set in the next few months to fill up our dining room table.", 
    "I love these chairs. They are nice replicas of the Eames Eiffel chairs. They were not super easy to put together but very manageable. I assembled them all by myself. I later purchased small round felt pads and put them at the foot of the chairs which fixed any wobbliness that I felt when I first assembled the chairs together. I love these chairs and would recommend them! Thanks Overstock!", 
    "Easy to assemble, nice and light, but good solid construction. Great look and great price!", 
    "When I put those screws on, it was okay, struggling just a little. Then I put some black feet on with the handle of a screwdriver as a hammer otherwise I COULDN'T put them on. I guess I was a little mad so I had to give up using my hands to do it. But after finished the set, I found one of them had some deep scratches on the sitting base, which is not okay. And I started to worry that since I already assembled both and I might need to return them at my own expense. Finally I contacted the customer service through live chat and they took care of it right away. They contacted the factory and asked them to send another one to me and kept me posted about what process they had been working on the issue. I got the tracking number after they shipped just that one chair to me. The quality of the chair is so so, but they look pretty good and modern. I am so impressed by the fast service provided by the overstock staff. Thank you all You made me a happy shopper!", 
    "Omigoodness! Finally they are sitting around my kitchen table! And they rock! But putting them together tested my patience. To be honest, putting the legs on was a bit annoying - but nothing over the top. What WAS annoying was the black plastic feet on the bottom of the legs. First of all, why does one chair have them already affixed, and then the other doesn't? I ordered 4 chairs. Putting the black feet on the two that didn't have them on already, took more time than anything else. I pushed, I twisted - I got two on. Finally I decided to put my high school physics education to work - and I poured boiling water in a bowl and added the black feet, and I let them sit for a few minutes They became much more flexible and I was able to get them all on. Overall - the aggravation was worth it. They do look very similar to the original Eames chairs. They really are quite lovely....", 
    "We ordered 6 of these for our staff lounge and we were quite pleased. Adequate quality for the price, big on style. Definitely takes 2, or one strong idividual to assemble, as the metal leg assembly doesn't actually line up with the holes in the seat bottom. It takes some elbow grease to hold the metal supports in place while inserting the screws. Overall an excellent buy. You can have that high-end, mid-century modern, look for a more affordable price with these chairs. Move over Charles and Ray E.", 
    "These chairs are nice, sturdy, with slightly flexible backs. Took 10 minutes to put together, nice addition to my tulip table.", 
    "East to put together, nice bright matte white, comfortable, look great !", 
    "Ordered the Ronnie Wire Base White Chairs to go with a vintage mid-century modern dining table and couldn't be happier, they look great. My boyfriend and I put four together in half an hour but alone it would have been more difficult, you need one person to line up the legs with the bottom of the chair while another attaches the screws. The quality is better than expected for the price, not high end but they feel quite solid and sit comfortably.", 
    "I ordered six of these chairs for my dining room table and I've been very pleased. I've seen similar chairs at high end furniture stores for over $200 each and, while these are reproductions, you really can't tell. They are very comfortable and have proven to be very durable. They are easy to assemble and I received them within a week after I purchased them. This was my first experience with Overstock.com and I'll be a regular shopper now.", 
    "they are a good deal for the price but very difficult to assemble the base to the shell of the chair. Its not a one person job. It took me 4 hours to do all four chairs and a lot of cursing!", 
    "Overall I am very satisfied with the product. They are beautiful! I just want to leave a word of warning: the chairs were hard to put together due to screw holes that didn't quite match with the seat so you have to do some tricks to get the legs and seat together but when you succeed doing so the chairs are great. Very sturdy and solid product. They are easy to clean which is nice because the chairs were dirty when they were delivered.", 
    "This is a great value considering the timeless design and low cost. A few things to note: chair is stark white in color (a little too white for my black/brown stained table) with a texture (not glossy) finish, the base is not welded smoothly (guess you get what you pay for) but is not noticeble since it is below the seat, it is much easier to assemble with 2 people, putting the black caps on the feet was the most challenging part - my boyfriend almost gave up!", 
    "great price for these chairs. we had been looking at similar ones at boutique type stores and just couldn't justify spending that much. these were a great price and great quality...not dramatically different from the \"real\" thing. assembling them was definitely better with 2 people than one...lots of squeezing the metal legs to get them lined up properly. but ultimately they all came together and they look MARVELOUS with our new dining room table. oh...and the chairs are quite comfy to boot!", 
    "I love these chairs that I purchased for my home. Would recommend them.", 
    "I too agree with the others, do not tighten all the screws when putting together. The holes do not line up, and this makes it easier to get the screws in. The only thing I could say is the seats are not completely smooth like other ones I have looked at. But, for the price, can't say it bothers me. 4 chairs for the price of one! I baught 3 sets. Now if Overstock could get a hold of a Tulip table, I'll be set.", 
    "I fell in love with these chairs online after seeing them in numerous mid century modern photos on design sites. I received the shipment promptly and began to assemble. One chair was perfect and looks great, but the second chair had a defect that prevented me from being able to put it together. One of the holes to fit the screw in was completely stripped. I wrote Overstock and after a few emails back and forth they quickly sent me a new box and replaced the chair. They look great with my mid century furniture and are very comfortable as well.", 
    "Like my title says, i feel like I scored with these. I love the look of the eames & mid century furniture, but as a newlywed and new homeowner, i just cannot afford to buy the real stuff. Some say it's a sin to buy the imitations, but i don't agree. You won't find me telling anyone they are real. I have 2 sets of these, and they exceeded my expectations. The plastic is solid, the legs are sturdy and they were clean & in new condition. They were not the easiest to put together as it took a while to get the holes lined up, but eventually it happened. The second set we got was missing a foot stopper, which was a bit of a pain to get a replacement but Overstock customer service was very helpful and actually sent us a replacement set and paid for the return shipping. Overall, I'm very happy and just trying my best to resist the urge to purchase the Retro-classic White Accent Chairs too.", 
    "Everything about this product was great except for one of the chairs was missing two of the four black \"foot caps\" that come on the chair. I have already talked with customer service to try to get this issue worked out, but other than that - all was good. Nice product.", 
    "I am so glad I bought them. These chairs are well worth the money and look fantastic. It was not easy to get the holes to align on the bottom of one of the 4 chairs but finally done for a while work. Sturdy plastic and wire base. Nevertheless, these will hold us at least several years. Still a very good buy.", 
    "I love these chairs. They look great and 4 chairs were the price of 1 and a half chairs here. You might need an extra hand to get the fourth screw in but this is intended to create an even pressure on the base.", 
    "Well made, and sturdy.....these chairs are a comfortable and affordable option to the real thing.The shell of the chair is made of a hard plastic that is quite comfortable to sit on. The base is a sturdy chromed metal. They are a very good alternative to the original, pricier design. Great for any mid-century or modern home decor.I bought 2 initially and bought another pair the day after I received the first.Would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone.The pair is shipped in one box and very nicely packed and wrapped for protection.", 
    "I had searched everywhere for an accent chair that was just the right size and color for the spot I needed. I was also impressed with the quality of the leather and with the fact that the chair arrived just a week after I ordered it. Great value.", 
    "So these chairs are obvious knock offs but they do a decent job of imitating the originals. The metal looks great. The plastic... so so. The litle plastic leg caps are cheap looking, and really hard to get on. Assembling the chairs isn't too hard but the wholes don't match up with the chair so there's a bit of frustration involved. Overall, happy with them.", 
    "I bought these chairs as dining chairs. I was a bit uneasy about the leg design of the chair and the comfort. I purchased 1 set at first to be on the safe side. After a fairly easy assemble I sat down and was surprised by the comfort of the seat. The seat contours to the body's shape and the plastic is flexible to a degree. The wire style legs are much nicer than the picture. These are similar to the Eames style Eiffle chairs and at a much nicer price. I went ahead and purchased a second set so now I have 4 chars around the table. Great Buy!", 
    "I was a bit skeptical about the sturdiness of these, but ordered 2 sets anyway and hoped for the best. I am so glad I did. These chairs are well worth the money and look fantastic. Only gave 4 stars for workmanship and ease of assembly because it was not easy to get the holes to align on the bottom of one of the 4 chairs and you can see where the base attaches from the top of another chair. Nevertheless, these will hold us over for years until I can buy the licensed version. They are quite comfortable and look great in our newly remodeled kitchen. Now if Overstock just sold a version of the Saarinen \"tulip\" table to go with these (in marble, please)...", 
    "the chairs are so unstable! my daughter fell off few times already. The little pad at the end would come off and scratch my floor. Wish I can return them because I bought 4 chairs!", 
    "Never been the cool guy in the group. Purchasing these chairs changed all that. My place is now the go-to spot. My new girlfriend says thats why she finally gave me a chance - who could say no to a guy with such awesome dining chairs?", 
    "This chair is very difficult to put together, considering it's just a wire base that has to connect to 4 holes in the bottom of the chair. The pre-drilled holes do not accept the screws easily; the connection points with the wire base are bent and not well-centered; and you're using a crappy hex wrench which does not hold the bolts well at all. Have to say, very very disappointed. Sending it back."
