    "The color was much darker and more of a slate blue/gray than the lighter gray color shown on the picture. Handles were more of a brushed brass than gold. All of this worked better for what I needed it for than the actual colors though. The piece was very easy to put together and seems solid with no wiggling in the legs. Everything lined up perfectly.", 
    "This piece fits perfectly in my entryway. Although, it is a little darker than what I was thinking it will look great with a couple cute accents and decorated. I read some other reviews and noticed that there were complanits about the assembly so I was a little skeptical if it would be just a cheap table but I was able to fit every piece together perfectly and it only took me about 15 -20 minutes.", 
    "I bought this table to use as a dressing table and it appears to be of an adequate size to fulfill that purpose. I only have a couple of issues with it. the screw holes on one leg didn't match up so I couldn't have all four screws in on one of the sides. This results in a slightly wobbly table. The other issue is, one of the handles popped off right when I picked it up. It was missing a screw so now I have to try and find another one to make-do. Other than those two things, it will still serve it's purpose and looks nice in my room.", 
    "I ordered this table and it was delivered within a week. I could not wait to receive it. When it arrived it was perfect for the area that I needed it for. Some reviewers did mention that it was more on the green side than grey and that is correct. It work for me. It was easy to assemble so much that for once I did not need my husband's help. The price was right and I would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "I bought this for a dressing table. the size was perfect and has enough drawer space for what I needed for my make up.", 
    "I needed a table for my dinning room but with my furniture being dark wood and my floors I wanted some color in that room on a wall that was bear and this was just what I wanted and I love the color and the style.", 
    "color toward greenish, justa \"bit\"toward lint- ur NOT olive. Lovely. deep drawers. perfect!", 
    "Definitely on the green side of grey. Perfect for our space. Easily assembled in minutes. No complaints from my husband. Love it.", 
    "This is a nice table perfect for the spot I bought it for.", 
    "This table took no time to put together! It is exactly what I was looking for. The grey is more of a bluish grey which was perfect for me! Will definitely buy this brand again!", 
    "Love this brand of furniture. Easy to put together and look sheek. Light but solid.", 
    "This obviously isn't the same quality you get from other Safavieh furniture pieces- it is clearly mass produced and on the cheap side. However, it put together easily and it looks nice for an entryway or an additional side piece in a dining room.", 
    "Looks cute in my foyer and only took 5 minutes to assemble", 
    "The console table was purchased for a small area in the hallway. It fits this purpose perfectly. Would not suggest using as a main console in a large living room. My only criticism is the color. It is more green than gray. That was okay for me because the color still works.", 
    "I bought this table to hold the cable box and blue ray player under a wall mounted flat screen. It is a stylish, sturdy table with three drawers (they are small but perfect for remotes and odds and ends). The color is a washed grey blue, very pretty and the handles are a nice match. I definitely recommend this product- nice quality for the money, great value.", 
    "Great entryway table! Very good quality for the price. It was also extremely easy to put together, no drill required. It is darker in color than I expected by it still works well in the room.", 
    "Well, it is sturdy and was a breeze to put together. It was sturdier than I thought it would be. Solid wood. Quite a few blemishes all over the piece. Drawers just sit in the opening and are not on runners. The color is less blue than the picture shows. It is a nice piece but not an heirloom piece.", 
    "I'm very pleased with this table. It fits perfectly in my home and I absolutely LOVE color. It's darker than the pictured image but it works. Assembly was simple and easy. What a great find!", 
    "Love this! Very easy to assemble & looks great in my beach house!", 
    "I highly recommend this piece!!! It's beautiful! The table is made of great quality, heavy, and sturdy. It's cute and decorative while still being functional. The color or colors (because each piece is unique and varies a bit) are beautiful - a soft vintage look. I can't wait to compliment it with decor!!", 
    "This piece looks more expensive than it really is! This is a great deal!", 
    "The dimensions and general asthetic serve its intended purpose very well. The construction and finish quality can be improved to earn my 5-star rating.", 
    "A lovely elegant piece of furniture", 
    "The drawers are not square, the finish is slightly marred, one screw is missing from a drawer pull, one screw hole for a leg attachment does not fit. I should return it and I may.", 
    "It looks more greenish than grey but I love it. Great piece to display pictures or store items in one of the nice deep drawers. I am so pleased that I bought this item. Real wood.", 
    "I ordered this console table to put behind my couch. It is the perfect height and narrow, which allows plenty of room to walk around. The drawers do not have slide guides, but they do not fall out. The color is very true to the description and it was very easy to put together. You remove the drawers and put in four bolts on each leg. I have only had it for a little over a week, but have had a lot of compliments on it.", 
    "looks great, weathered gray color, had it for 3 years without any problems.", 
    "Just what I was looking for. The only thing that I did was to change the knobs to make it \"MINE\".", 
    "LOVE this greyish/blue table. Using it as a TV stand in our bedroom.", 
    "well made, color is true to picture", 
    "Love, love, love! Great table for a great price! I get compliments on it all the time!", 
    "Very happy!!!! Highly reccomended.", 
    "Been using it for a year. Great piece in the entry way. Drawers are useful for storage and love the color.", 
    "Perfect fit for my guest bedroom. Ties in well with gray walls and navy blue accents. Color of this piece is suttle and muted so would blend with many color schemes.", 
    "for a gift they picked out, easy to put together, just what they wanted. good color, perfect size.", 
    "I made the mistake of using this as a vanity desk for my bedroom. It's a bit flimsy, and the drawers are not solid for daily use. Definitely get what you pay for, although it's very cute.", 
    "Not only can this little table be used anywhere in the house, I bought it for use as a make-up table . . . . it takes up very little room, has enough space underneath to put a chair or seat, and the 3 drawers have so much room for those who need lots of room for creams, brushes, eye, lip and skin products.", 
    "One of the handles came off early on and it is loose. We have yet to find a a way to to fix it permanently but it looks good.", 
    "Love this table - bought for my bedroom and it looks great. Easy to assemble!", 
    "Nice piece for the price. Frustrated that the fourth hole for the leg screws did not line up even though the complaint has been noted before. As I do not have a drill to correct the problem, I, too, am getting by with only 3 screws.", 
    "looks great, perfect size for us, drawers are quite shallow and come out easily", 
    "Drawers are a little loose once assembled", 
    "A darling little table, well made, but the \"grey\" was far too \"green\" for my room. Seriously thought about painting it or sanding and staining it. Sadly, it had to go back, but the return process was simple.", 
    "I order this one for hallway, it is very good with any pictures. I love color and size.", 
    "Table was to be used in a gray, blue and silver bedroom and was very green, not the blue gray of the image online.", 
    "Lightweight table was easy to put legs on. Color is more green than grey. Drawers have no hardware for sliding.", 
    "For the price I think this was a good buy. It looks great but the drawers really aren't that functional and almost fall out every time I open them. We still use them but you have to be very careful.", 
    "I LOVE THIS BEAUTIFUL TABLE! EVERYONE TELLS ME THAT IT LOOKS REALLY NICE WHERE I HAVE IT IN MY EXTRA BEDROOM. I WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING ANOTHER ONE FOR MY FOYER.", 
    "I just love this table. It is the perfect color and size for my hall. The three drawers will be very useful. I tried to get another one just like it but they seem to be out of this style. I was very impressed with how reasonable the price was.. It shipped quickly as usual with Overstock, It arrived in perfect condition.", 
    "The color and size was just what we were looking for. Some of the reviews scared us about the color, but it is a lovely greenish/grey. Very easy to put together.", 
    "Love this product. Shipped quickly to my house, it was easy to get the legs on, less then 5 minutes to put together and use.", 
    "Very nice sofa table, it's the perfect dimensions for my needs. The color is much darker than the picture, more of a greyish green but looks great!", 
    "Looks true to picture. Very easy to put together. Sturdy. Looks perfect in my entryway!", 
    "this little table ended up being the perfect fit for an empty space behind my couch. in the pic i thought it had a little more green tint to it, but it is very gray and ended up an almost exact match to the couch so it works. i wanted a colorful accent piece, but the muted tone is very homey and make a great little space in my living room", 
    "The actual color is a darker bluish-gray, which I prefer anyway. It was very easy to put together, and looks great in my entryway. I would definitely recommend this table.", 
    "The color is much darker in person but luckily it still went well with what I was going for. Assembly was easy and takes only a few minutes. One of the drawers did have round indentions in it, which was a little disappointing.", 
    "I've been looking at Home Goods for a table like this for a few months. I just needed a accent table for my bedroom. There wasn't anything like this there, especially for the price. Simple tables maybe for $180 but anything with drawers ran over $200. The color was much darker and more of a slate blue/gray than the lighter gray color shown on the picture. The color matched perfectly for what I was wanting. My screws didn't line up exactly either and the way to get around that is to not thread the screws tight until all the screws are in. If you tighten one then the other might not fit. The drawers don't have guides but that's fine for me as I'm not going to use the drawers for \"everyday\" stuff so I don't be getting into them that much. Super easy to put together and pretty sturdy. LOVE OverStock!", 
    "This should have been a breeze to assemble. Eight screws, eight washers and an allen key. Unforunately half of the drilled holes did not line up and I spent 2 frustrating hours trying to clamp the timber with my hands to line up the holes so the screws would take. One of the drilled holes was too large and the screw simply spun with no purchase. So now I have my semi assembled table one leg corner flapping in the breeze. Very disappointing.", 
    "We live in Palm Springs, CA, where the patios are an extension of the interior house, with wide, shaded overhangs. The house has four such wonderful \"outdoor rooms\". I bought this table to go in the patio that has a sofa and chaise, and a dining table and chairs. The table serves as a sideboard, with a mirror hanging above it. Since this patio is also on the pool side of the house, the drawers are a great place to store water goggles, spare sunglasses, and other small items that are not affected by the heat. The table is really meant for indoor use, but the Palm Springs climate, the patio's wide overhang, and the table's location that keeps it out of direct sunlight and away from the infrequent rains, make it work for my purpose. The table isn't the highest quality one could buy, but it works quite well as it's being used, and the price was very reasonable.", 
    "Once I opened the box, it was only disappointing. The finishing is poor the color is a lot darker than the picture. None of the drawers would close completely. Horrible!", 
    "I love this little accent table.It was just the piece I was looking for.I wanted something that would stand out against my dark wood dining table and grey marble floors.Also accents the art work I have hanging in the room and the bright patterned rug in the living area.Very easy to put together too.", 
    "Nice fit for my foyer. Stable legs and drawers fit nicely. Color is darker than photo on website. Overall I am pleased", 
    "All in all, I love this table, even though it wasn't the color I expected. But, it still works in the room we wanted it for.", 
    "I was extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend anyone buying it. We received a broken table and went through a long process to order a replacement. When we received the replacement, we were disappointed to see that there were significant marks on the top of the table, the paint was completely stripped off in areas, the legs had marks on them and the bottoms of the legs ended up scratching our hardwood floors. Overstock gave us a *** store credit and small percentage off of our purchase. I would have expected a more significant refund consider the hassle we had to go through with this product. Do not order this table, you will be disappointed!", 
    "Worked for what I wish to do with the table in my dinning room. Nice added furniture and color.", 
    "The only troubles I had with this table were that one of the screws didn't match up with the holes so I have an extra, and one leg is a little wobbly. Otherwise it looks great and is what I was looking for.", 
    "Good quality product- easy to put together. Although the coloring is darker than what is shown on the photo."
