    "Almost feels like velvet! Rich dark brown, very comfortable sitting. Nice shirt around the sofa, two throw pillows, comes with care instructions, love that! I would buy again, you will not be disappointed with this purchase. Looks so expensive!", 
    "beautiful, comfortable, great value, shipped really fast!", 
    "I purchased this to replace the ***** Slipcover sofa. Much better product and quality.", 
    "This sofa is wonderful! Good support, you don't sink into it! Fabric is very nice and it was easy to put together! Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Appears to be well made. Arrived in a crushed box, but was packed well so no damage. The color is almost black, a dark chocolate, not as the photo shows a \"milk chocolate\". Very firm. Looking forward to my naps on this sofa!"
