    "Beautiful bench, nicely upholstered in a beige polyester fabric; classic style and very appropriate for the end of a bed, which is how I used it.", 
    "Easy to assemble and super high stiff structure so the quality on this piece was very important because it gets high usage. And it's beautiful.", 
    "Looks like a bench that would cost so much more. Perfect in front of queen bed.", 
    "Easy to put together. I'm using it in place of two chairs in my traditional dining room in an effort to make the set less \"stuffy\". It was easy to put together, and it's sturdy. Perfect height, and it's comfortable. Love the nailhead trim.",

    "I love this bench, I just wish it was a little bit more comfortable!", 
    "Comfortable to sit on, just like pictured", 
    "This bench is elegant looking and the wood color is great - medium brown & distressed grey. The cushions are not super comfortable, but not uncomfortable. I weigh 120 lbs. and can feel that is sinks in the middle a decent amount. I wish there were recommendations for matching dining tables and chairs.", 
    "Great piece, complements our RH furniture seamlessly. Great price and great buy!", 
    "When i purchased this bench, the first photo in the listing was not there, so i was expecting the color of the legs to be more of a grey/brown as shown in the rest of the pictures. the first picture now accurately shows the coloring. Quality of the bench is good, sturdy cushion without being too hard. comfy to sit on.",

    "I am using this dining chair as an ottoman for the end of my king bed. My king bed has espresso feet and although the wood is a weathered espresso it looks very nice together. The color is the an oatmeal color. Matches my potterybarn bed exactly!",

    "Well constructed. Colors true to pictures. I nice complement to place the end of your bed.", 
    "easy to assemble and looks nice", 
    "Purchased this bench for the end of my King size bed so my lap dog had a tier in between the floor and my very tall bed. I sprayed it with Scotchguard. It may be a little stiff to sit on for some, but for my use, it was perfect.",
