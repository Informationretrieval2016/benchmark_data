    "I was hesitant to order a headboard without seeing it in person first so I'm very happy to write this review to say how pleased I am with what I received. I ordered the king size headboard in brown fabric. It looks MUCH better in person. It arrived 4 days after I ordered it! It took my husband about 30 minutes to attach the legs to the headboard, adjust the height and secure it to the bed. I like the fact that the legs are wrapped in fabric, not just bare wood or metal against the bed frame and the wall. This was the first time Ive ordered from Overstock.com. It won't be the last!", 
    "I couldn't be happier with this purchase. I've looked at many other's very similar for a lot more money. I smile whenever I walk into my bedroom. It makes me feel like I'm walking into a hotel", 
    "Very happy with this headboard! Arrived quickly and looks great. The color is exactly how it is described. The material is not cheaply made. Very high end!", 
    "Beautiful deep rich brown. High end look and feel. Very pleased.", 
    "Inexpensive and gorgeous headboard, so happy with my purchase. I liked that it was wrapped with a liner/fabric inside the box just in case the box ripped or was opened so the upholstery wouldn't get dirty. Easy to set up and put together, came with the hardware to attach to a standard bed frame (I used the insta-lock frame I got from Overstock)", 
    "For the $$ this is a great buy. Looks like it cost way more. Just enough, not overpowering or hiding under the pillows. Color is a tan toward a grey hue so just perfect with my weathered bedroom set. Easy enough to install. It came quickly too.", 
    "This headboard is gorgeous. Simple but elegant. Easy to attach legs. No need to attach to bed frame, sits nice and tight between end of mattress and wall. Would highly recommend.", 
    "Beautiful headboard at a great price. We couldn't be happier. Saw similar ones at stores for more money. This headboard makes our bedroom look luxurious. I would highly recommend it.", 
    "I have been very pleased with this beautiful headboard. It is very well made & looks great! Fast delivery.", 
    "The stitching on the top of the headboard just above the nailheads was done unevenly and the fabric does not lay flat. This is right in the center of the headboard and very noticeable. Very disappointed. Would exchange if I could, but sold out in the size/color I need.", 
    "It's really pretty! Just what I was looking for, color and style is perfect also a great price!", 
    "Very well made headboard, the grey fabric has a slight tinge of green to it, hence the color Basil Green, and it is beautifully trimmed by what looks to be brushed nichol nail head trim. Very comfortable to lean back against when reading in bed. A very good buy!", 
    "Love the headboard. Great color. Raises up high enough behind all my pillow shams to be seen. Yea!", 
    "I received my headboard in a timely manner. I put it together with no assistance. The color was a taupe/beige and the craftsmanship was good. I debate awhile before buying online without seeing product but very happy I did.", 
    "Headboard is excellent quality for the price. Highly recommendedCheers", 
    "Perfect, the color is great!", 
    "Wanted to update our bedroom and decided to purchase this headboard. The price was amazingly low and we just put it together and attached to the bed frame in under 30 minutes. Easy to do and the fabric is even richer grey in color and more textured than I thought which is perfect for our room. The nail heads are perfectly spaced and it is a sturdy fit on the bed.", 
    "We bought this for our rental home. We put it in the second bedroom with the Kenton bedside tables. They look very good together.", 
    "Goes great with my new bedroom....", 
    "I don't understand why they would not include mounting hardware.", 
    "LOVE this headboard!! The quality is great and the color is as pictured. It was delivered on time without any damage. It was just what we were looking for ..along with a great price!"
