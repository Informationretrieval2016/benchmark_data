    "We needed a small entertainment center piece of furniture to fit in a corner beside our fireplace to hide the boxes that come with using Uverse cabel TV and our blue ray player connected to our flat screen above the fireplace. This was perfect. It hid cables and boxes from view and really classed up the way my living area looked. We also now have storage for some other collectables. I had searched high and low for something like this and found products more expensive that didn't quite fit my conservative classical decor. It went together easily also. It also was shipped free and came very quickly.", 
    "Love the look of this cabinet. It was exactly what we were looking for and was stylish for an affordable price. The downsides are that the quality is average (though for the price you can't go wrong) and it's not insanely sturdy. It's decent quality, but pretty lightweight. It also took a couple tries to make sure it was level when we were putting it together, but it wasn't complicated. Overall I would recommend this cabinet to others because it looks great in our house!", 
    "Overall, the cabinet is nice but we had lots of issues with it. We had to request new parts 2 different times. The first time, one of the panels had holes that were too big. Received a new panel and in putting it together, discovered a second panel had holes that were too small with inserts in them (so we couldn't fix them ourselves.) It was a very frustrating process---ended up taking us over 3 weeks to build this cabinet! Hopefully we just got the defective box so nobody else has to deal with it. Very impressed with Overstock customer service though! They were wonderful! Very attentive and prompt with their responses!", 
    "Don't buy this as a piece that you want to use as a functional or practical floor cabinet. It's made in China and it shows. One of the holes drilled into one of the pieces was too large for the bolt meant for it to accommodate. I had to improvise to make the whole thing work so I could assemble it. The front doors did not mount evenly. If you are on a budget and want a floor cabinet, consider buying a used one at a thrift store.", 
    "Beautiful piece. It works perfectly in my bathroom and it was easy to put together!", 
    "This is perfect for what I needed it for. The quality was not the best. It came with a blemish on the top. I used a black marker to make less noticeable and placed an item over it. It was very simple to put together but came with no glue for dowels. I used my own to get a more sturdy product. The doors didn't line up perfectly so adjustment was necessary. But overall you get what u pay for.", 
    "We just moved in to a new house and didn't realize it didn't have a linen closet in the master bathroom when we were looking at the house. This just fills the bill, pretty good match to the cupboards under the sinks and is cute besides. Hubby loves to put things together like this, so I gave him the job. It was well packed, had all the pieces, good instructions and in less than an hour, it was together and standing proudly in the bathroom. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "Very nice bathroom cabinet, great storage space inside.", 
    "and brok during assembly. Looks nice but not very sturdy. I wouldn't recommend", 
    "Love this product!! Was easy to assembled, and was the first time I ordered furniture online, thanks Overstock!", 
    "I wanted a smaller-sized cabinet to use in my apartment kitchen to not only provide some additional storage, but to hold my toaster oven to keep it off of the already-limited counter space. This cabinet fit the bill perfectly! It was packed well and the instructions to put it together were detailed and very easy to follow...they even provided an extra little baggie of parts (screws, etc.) to use in case you loose something. The cabinet is sturdy. I had no problem putting the unit together, including the doors. The wood is dark and somewhat soft, so be careful when putting it together to avoid nicks and/or scrapes. Using it in a small, adult apartment is perfect and offers additional storage space without taking up too much precious room.", 
    "I bought 2 cabinets and 1 arrived with the top piece being marred as if it was packed before the finish was dry. Solving the problem by putting glass on top. Using it as a small bar under wine glass rack. It was the perfect size for my use. The furniture is not the sturdiest so I would only recommend it if its not having a lot of use. It looks nice with the glass front doors.", 
    "I was looking for a simple cabinet to house a cable box and dvd this was an excellent choice and it worked like a charm. It went together easily and quickly. I was surprised that i recevied the cabinet ahead of schedule.", 
    "I purchased the wall cabinet and the medicine cabinet together with this product. I especially liked the door dividers. All are of equal quality and will be nice in the bathroom where I will be placing them. I will probably put a sturdier back to each piece such as a separate board painted black. Otherwise, they were what I was looking for.", 
    "Material & finish is not up to past purchase's I have made on Overstock's site. Only reason it was not returned is I was on a schedule for a house showing and needed the product.", 
    "Just ok quality. Similar to what I would expect from ***"
