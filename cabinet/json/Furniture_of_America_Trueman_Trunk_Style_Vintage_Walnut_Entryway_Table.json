  "reviews": [
    "I like the look of this, but once put together you want to be gentle with it. The upper part is very sturdy and has nice hardware. The wood has a fake veneer over compressed wood, which we nicked as we assembled it. My concern is with the legs. The whole thing will wobble if you touch it. It needs a better support system for the bottom part.", 
    "This product came with awful instructions! There are hundreds of screws and the directions use pictures to depict the screw. Well good luck trying to identify what screws go where. Only buy this product if you have hours of time and are a rocket scientist when it comes to deciphering picture directions. Once you finally get it together it is cheap quality and the wood is more of a cherry red than dark brown. I wish I read these reviews before I purchased this product. If I could give this product a zero I would!", 
    "IF YOU LIKE DIFFICULT PUZZLES WITH A LOT OF PARTS AND HAVE A LOT OF TIME THIS IS FOR YOU. This is not worth the money and you have to put it together COMPLETELY using poor instructions and over a hundred parts. Don't say you weren't warned.", 
    "The trunk's handle came off within the first two days of using it. I had to buy a new screw that would better hold the handle in place.", 
    "This item takes a lot of time to assemble and some areas could have better instruction, but once it is all finished, it is a nice piece. The length is what makes it significant.", 
    "It took a bit to assemble but it was worth it!Love this piece.", 
    "Really nice piece of furniture. Well made. Looks great in our home!", 
    "nice look , pressed wood, hinges too strong for wood , split wood in back", 
    "Takes some time to put together, but not hard to follow the directions. Looks great!!!", 
    "Took us awhile to put together but it was worth it. This furniture is gorgeous! Hold my records inside and holds my cookbooks across the bottom. I absolutely love it!", 
    "I love this table it looks great in our family room, so glad my husband put it together it was a little too much for me.", 
    "This took a VERY long time to put together. And one of the sets of screws I received were actually two different kinds (mistake?). Same size, but round head vs flat head. Ended up determining to put all the round head ones where they would be seen, and the flat heads on the back, for consistency. Outside of that, I really love this piece of furniture.", 
    "The color is beautiful! The quality of the table is amazing!", 
    "A million pieces to assemble and didn't have the tie or patience to put it together. Gave it to my daughter and its still sitting in the box after a couple of months.", 
    "I have this in my entryway, and have gotten lots of compliments. For the price, it looks pretty darn good.", 
    "The quality of the mechanize was not as described, the directions were poor and misleading, some of the (20) screws provided were of 2 differing sizes yet implied that they were the same, directions suggested that there were pre-existed drill holes where there were not, overall I found this product a misrepresentation of it's advertisement and as such I offer the consumer a warning: BUYER BEWARE!", 
    "Easiest assembly if you can read and follow directions. Its a two person job as the instructions states. Took me and my boyfriend 2 hours to assemble and looks great when assembled. Its very sturdy and great looking piece in our home for the price.", 
    "We got 2 of these. They look perfect. Very high quality for the price. My husband is not the handiest & he had no trouble putting together", 
    "This is part wood, part wood veneers and the assembly was very complex. SO MANY PIECES.This will take a patience for sure, but for the price looks very nice. Storage is great as well.", 
    "Beautiful piece. Assembly takes a while but to me instructions were pretty clear and it's not that hard. Table looks great, is stable and heavy. Love it!", 
    "Great storage for our living room. It looks expensive, very happy with it!", 
    "I like the the style and solid pattern, its sort of complicated to build so it would be nice to give how to video with this kind of products.i love it", 
    "Great piece of furniture. Looks spectacular !!!", 
    "This is just what I was looking for a dining room side table. It is pressed board with nicely wood grained laminate that looks rich and like real wood. It has red mahogany undertones, which is just what I wanted to blend with my Brazilian cherry wood stairs. It took me 4 HOURS to assemble because I was afraid from the other reviews. It was NOT difficult to assemble. Look through the instructions first and think thru to the next step to assure you have the boards facing the correct way. I used wood glue to assure strength and it seems quite sturdy and heavy. It may help to separate all the different screws if you are new to assembling. Remember you are saving $$ by assembling yourself!", 
    "Looks great once it's put together. It took four hours to build. I use a ratchet to tighten the small bolts. I got it on sale do I won't complain. Not a quality piece of furniture. If I had to do it again I wouldn't buy it. I gave it a three only because once it's built it looks decent. I don't expect it to last.", 
    "HOWEVER!! OMG it came in pieces board by board! Like building a house! Took me 5 hours to put together. I love the finish product, but would have never purchased it if I knew I was going to have to build it!!!", 
    "Despite the other reviews, this piece wasn't too bad to put together and it wasn't necessary to have a professional either. However, you will need a small wrench of some sort for one of the steps and that is not in the installation details.", 
    "The Trunk table looks amazing! Other than a very lengthy build and needing longer bolts for the handle its perfect.", 
    "Takes awhile to assemble, but very sturdy. A couple screws for the handle were the wrong length, but I found some screws that worked. I really like it. Nice for the price.", 
    "Its beautiful looks great in my entryway.", 
    "Perfect size for the entry way", 
    "This is a very lovely piece. It was difficult to assemble and looks like an assembled piece somewhat. There is no way to tighten the chest enough so that it doesn't have a \"wobble\" to it. Two of the screws were the wrong size so that could have something to do with it.", 
    "I almost let the reviews scare me away but purchased any way. If you have ever put together a peice of furniture from any big box store this won't be a challenge. Obviously it's veneer coated mdf but it looks great once assembled and was plenty sturdy. You will need a wrench to make sure the final joints are tight which isn't included.", 
    "So many pieces to assemble!But if put together by a professional it was very sturdy.", 
    "I was looking for a specific style to replace a table behind our couch. This was the ideal table. It works great for the purpose and matches the room perfectly. The quality is awesome!", 
    "It doesn't only at a different decor to my hall a different good touch you can also put things in the drawers. Which just adds to the charm.", 
    "I use it in the living room and it adds so much character to the room! I love it! I had a professional assemble it.", 
    "Quality very poor. But design is nice", 
    "The finished product is very nice - it's just painful getting to the finished product.", 
    "It looks great in the den and is a perfect accent piece. The directions leave a bit to be desired but the piece itself is what we wanted."
