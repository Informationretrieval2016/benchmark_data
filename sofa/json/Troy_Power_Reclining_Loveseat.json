    "The leather is good quality. The power is a bonus if you have difficulty getting out of a chair. Very comfortable", 
    "Excellent for my apartment! Easy assembly- very comfortable and electric recline is smooth and lays far enough for a guest to sleep in.", 
    "The seat itself is good and the leather looks like good quality. However, the center piece went completely missing and wasn't part of the packaging. Contacted Overstock support for help. Disappointed that something as expensive as a love seat would come incomplete. It's not something we can simply ship back :(. 4 stars because we know Overstock has our back and hoping they will sort this out quickly."
