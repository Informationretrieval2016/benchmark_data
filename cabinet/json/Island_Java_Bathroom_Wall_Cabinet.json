    "this was supposed to be black. I called 3 times b4 I ordered it to make sure. Well it is not black it is brown. I am mad.", 
    "Pretty good looking piece except there is a crack in the door and there is no shelf inside the cabinet. Although a shelf is not included in the description. A user asked if it included a shelf and the response was \"yes'.", 
    "I was shopping for a small Java / mocha colored cabinet made from real wood and this one fit the bill. Here are some additional details not found in the description:- The color is a rich brown, not black- Box is 1/2\" plywood, doors are solid wood but not a hard species: this can be a concern if you plan to add handles as I did as the wood can splinter when you drill. If you are planning on putting in handles tape off and mark the holes, then start with a small bit and work your way up. I tried 9/16\" and it tore through and splintered. For the other holes I started with 1/8\" and it worked fine. - The cabinet is assembled with brackets and screws. I wish I could have assembled myself as I would have done a better job- There is one shelf on the inside that can be mounted in 3 positions - The door hinges are adjustable - The inside is finished in Java (Shelf as well)- There is a nailing strip on the inside top where you can screw it into the wall studsOverall I'm very happy as it was the only cabinet I found that fit all my constrains. What I did not like is there are a few nail tips poking through the nailing strip on the inside, the finish isn't perfect on the inside corners, and it is rather expensive for a made in China put together cabinet. That said, it is a nice piece and goes well in my small half bath.Ps: the box had a strong chemical smell - you may want to air it outside for a few hours", 
    "This cabinet is beautiful. I have been looking for quite awhile and have not seen any thing like this. Just what I needed for the must have bathroom items that did not fit in my vanity. It matches my vanity perfectly", 
    "My laundry room was a just a closet with folding doors. We took off the doors. Painted the inside walls a light color of gray brown then put 12 x 24 dark tiles 2/3 of the way up the wall and the floor. We then put one of these cabinets on each side of the wall with a shelf in-between. Washer and dryer are dark grey. Two clear glass jars are on the open shelf in the cabinet. They hold different laundry supplies. There are 2 shelf spaces inside that hold cleaning supplies, etc. Two turquoise vases (large, different sizes) sit on the open wall shelf with white flowers draping from the small-wide vase. Put in a pendant light. We couldn't bear to put on the doors and cover this amazing space.", 
    "Definitely brown, not black."
