    "I'm always hesitant to buy furniture online without first feeling the material but my family and I were very impressed with the quality of the cream colored linen material and the nailheads makes this piece look very rich and interesting. Very well priced and easy to assemble.", 
    "I ordered the grey, i struggled to find the difference between smoke and grey... grey is the lighter color for anyone else having problems. For the price this is a great headboard. I was going for a vintage shabby chic look in mmy bedroom and this fits in nicely, all otherones similar were in the 300+ price range.Im happy with this purchase, plus I assembled it in 3 minutes. really easy.", 
    "Ordered this for my mother. received it quickly and it had all nuts and bolts. Wanted Slate, but they were out, ordered the green and it is lovely...glad I went with the green. It's a very subtle green color. Order it!!", 
    "I had to move my bed in front of my window for room functionality, so I needed a headboard which I have never loved before. Now I am so happy that I got this, I can lean against it when needed with no problem and it adds a great touch of character to the room as well.", 
    "Perfect Exactly what I wanted!", 
    "This was delivered nicely packed. The assembly screws were too large for the holes in the legs but my hubby easily went and bought the proper ones and then we were done in a jiffy. Upon closer inspection, the nail heads on the headboard are in a long attached link lineup so no doubt there was factory- end ease of assembly and straight-in-row nailing which I guess is alright (not separate nail heads that are found on higher end furniture) especially as I paid less than $*** incl. delivery. I also was worried it wouldn't be high enough above the pillow line/very high plush mattress but it's plenty high with enough grey showing above the white and grey pillowsfor the contrasts of colors I was looking for. Looks great. I followed other's reviews and they were pretty accurate- I'd buy it again. Eve", 
    "Upon opening the box I definitely feel in love with it. It looks Great. The construction is wellmade and the wood brackets has several holes for height adjustments.", 
    "I love this headboard! It's just what I wanted at a great price.", 
    "It's mostly my fault for purchasing an ivory headboard, but it's SO PRETTY! The color looks great and the legs were easy enough to assemble. The headboard came with a lot of hardware, though, for the platform bed I assume it's supposed to be sold with (I didn't get it). There was no way for me to attach it to my metal bed frame with the hardware provided, so right now it's just propped up against the wall in the meantime. It would be easy to attach once I have the right pieces, but it's a little inconvenient. Another small gripe I have is that a part of the headboard on the bottom looks like it was smudged/dirty at one point and attempted to be cleaned. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't live with it and looks like it will come out with some soap and water, but still annoying to have my beautiful ivory headboard smudged. I know it's going to be a problem in the future to maintain such a crisp clean look, but it just looks so nice!", 
    "But over all it's a different touch to the bedroom.", 
    "I really like the look of the headboard. My only criticism is when attached to the frame it feels a little bit un-sturdy. I wouldn't recommend leaning against it to read unless you have several buffers between you and it to relieve the pressure on the fasteners.", 
    "I've been looking for the right headboard for months. I'm very happy with this. It's beautiful and coordinates well with my furniture.", 
    "The headboard was exactly as described and the color detailed on the website was precise and matched the bedding. Works perfectly.", 
    "I was looking for a simple headboard for my guest room. I love this and for the price I thought it was an excellent buy. It certainly adds a nice touch to the room and I have gotten many compliments on it. If you are looking for something with clean lines, sturdy and gives a bang for the buck, look no further.", 
    "Good looking product and good cost.", 
    "Great headboard for the price.", 
    "Very nice, as pictured in terms od color and construction. The sturdiness is good. Note the bolts to fasten to bedframe are short and large in diameter; had to replace them to fasten to sturdy frames.", 
    "Perfect for my teenage son's room. I thought the tacks were brass and they're actually a shiny black but not bad.", 
    "Perfect for my bedroom. Nice contrast with the wall color.", 
    "Nice quality, nice shade of gray. Pleasantly surprised by quality and ease of attaching to the bed frame. Good value!", 
    "This headboard is so beautiful! It looks very expensive and was easy to install.", 
    "Looks good, works good and is solid. Assembly instructions and hardware were missing so Overstock emailed instructions and parts list so we were able to buy bolts, washers, etc. at the hardware store. They also gave me a $35 credit for the inconvenience.", 
    "looks great in my guest room!", 
    "Awesome quality. Easy to install. Great price. No regrets!", 
    "Lighter gray than I had hoped for --- color is not same ason computer. But good looking.", 
    "This headboard exceeded my expectations. It looks very elegant and gives my bedroom a well designed touch.", 
    "the product is great, looks really nice. but when I lean on it to read at night my hair does get stuck in the tacks and I have to rip it out. ouch! other than that, I love it.", 
    "We paired this headboard with the ***** **** ********* Comforter Set and it makes a gorgeous pair. No complaints here - highly recommended and really easy to attach to the bed frame.", 
    "I bought this for my teenage son's room. It arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged. It is not a bulky headboard and the legs that attach to the bed frame were made of wood. I would have preferred metal because it would have made it sturdier (thus the 4 star rating). The directions were not truly clear for installation, but it wasn't difficult.Overall, it's a nice piece and adds a classic and fresh look to my son's room.", 
    "This headboard is really of high quality for the price. I would definitely recommend it for a queen-size bed.", 
    "Dusty charcoal gray with muted brassy nailheads. perfect for a queen bed. Easy to install. Not a headboard you can really lean against (maybe that's the way i installed it thought) but sturdy enough for pillow stacking. Great product for it's price. Actually would have paid more for it if I'd seen it in a showroom. Bought it here because it was low priced and from photo something I hoped to like.", 
    "It was a nice product for the price. Glad I purchased it.", 
    "The headboard is awesome. It was super easy to assemble and no one would know if costs so little!", 
    "Nice, sleek, good price. Dresses up the room", 
    "This was an affordable and easy to install update for a guest room. Love the large nailhead trim, and the smoke color coordinates well with many other colors.", 
    "Bought this to match d\u00e9cor in the room, and trying to hide a strangely placed electric panel in this Office/Bedroom. Easy to assemble and put on. The 4 bolts at the bottom, that mount from the bedframe to the headboard legs, are a little long and protrude about 1/2 inch out - so I'll most likely put something to cover them so when somebody pushed the bed against the wall, the bolts do not dent the wall (dry wall).", 
    "This headboard is a perfect size for a queen size bed and has nice nailhead details and great color. Not very thick for a headboard, just an accent piece.", 
    "We wanted the look of an upholstered head board without the high price tag. This fits the bill perfectly. The upholstery is not bad, and the color of the smoke is a blueish-gray. The box it comes in is not too large either very manageable. Just make sure you bolt it to the wall, otherwise every time you move you hear it.", 
    "The headboard (ivory) is really more of a soft beige color or creamy ivory. The tufted fabric and pewter buttons give it an expensive look. It sets off my my bedroom. And very easy to put together! Took about 5 minutes tops!!!", 
    "We got the LIGHT GRAY one. It is more of a very very light blue/gray. As long as you realize that...it will work out o.k. Because we had so much light grays and browns and also some violet-gray tones in a shade - it looks LIGHT GRAY thank heavens it does not look light blue in the room... Keep this in mind if A LIGHT BLUE GRAY will not work for you...perhaps go with the green or with the smokey gray :)", 
    "Exactly how it is pictured. Beautiful.", 
    "I ordered this in the green for my guest room. I had it assembled in under 10 minutes, and it really dressed up the room.", 
    "My young teenager's room is a mess; I ordered her this headboard in an effort to put her room together and be more organized. I did it without asking her, thinking it might end up in the guest room. She reclutantly agreed to help assemble protesting the whole time. Once it was up, she loved it! I have to admit I like it so much I want one too! One of the nail heads popped out out a bit but I just tapped it back down. Very nice, especially considering how inexpensive it is. I shopped around and lowest price for anything similar was over $375.", 
    "For the price I paid for this headboard, it is great. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.", 
    "This light weight head board does not take up a lot of space nor is it too heavy to handle. A simple finish to complete the small bedroom and bed set-up which include four items, bed frame, storage drawers, headboard brackets and headboard.", 
    "Great buy even better than another upholstered headboard I bought on overstock. Very classic. Amazing price too!", 
    "The color of the headboard was not grey or really was not what was pictured. It was more of a blue-grey. I wanted to send it back but by the time I paid for shipping it really wasn't worth it. Trying to figure out what I can do to make it work but don't have any good ideas.", 
    "Great look, easy to connect. But like most headboard still shakes when you move the bed.", 
    "Looks very nice, easy to install good value for the money.", 
    "Well made and lovely to look at, easy to assemble", 
    "This headboard looks great, however the actual posts to engage onto the bed frame are wood. This is a flaw in the design concept, metal would be much better. But for the money it will do the job and if it breaks we will look and replacing with metal parts.", 
    "Bought this for my Mom when we downsized from King Size bed. For the money, this was nice headboard and exactly what she was looking for. Attached easily to bedframe. I would definitely recommend this as a economical solution for a headboard.", 
    "I ordered the nailhead headboard and couln't be happier with my purchase. It arrived within 3 days and it was simple to set up.", 
    "I was skeptical......but this headboard is very nice. Good quality linen, the nailhead's are in line, very neat. Would recommend.", 
    "Love it..much better than pictures...green headboard is great color", 
    "This headboard is fairly basic. Decent fabric that seems like it will hold up over time. The nailhead edging is a nice touch. I have the cream version, nice color which matches most flat linens.", 
    "For the price paid (under $$) this headboard met and exceeded my expectations. It has a fancy look to it, nicely padded, soft material, well made and an ease to assemble. It's dark brown and I'm extremely happy with it. Would recommend it if you're looking for simple and pretty elegance.", 
    "Very nice headboard for the price. Easy to put together.", 
    "I was bummed when I saw that the gray was sold out and decided to go with the green...I'm so glad that I did. This is a great looking headboard, simply but it stands out. I would have given five stars but there was a small smudge on the board that I ordered. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase!", 
    "This headboard looks great, very polished and current. It was easy to incorporate with our queen size bed frame, and seems to be very good quality.", 
    "This headboard gets two thumbs up from me! Very easy to assemble. I put it together and attached it to my bed in about 15 minutes (by myself). It's not as tall as I had hoped for- but for what I paid for it, I am very happy!", 
    "I took a chance on the color of this headboard, wanting it to match a Tommy Bahama tropical print comforter that I also purchased at O. It is perfect! The nail head trim is also just what I was looking for, large heads so they show up nicely, but not so large that they are out of place. Getting it at the sale price is just an added bonus!", 
    "The queen nailhead upholstered head board is both elegant yet simple. Perfect for our small guest room.", 
    "Very easy to put together - literally took less than 5 min; I have screwed the support legs into highest position, and it really high, which i like, but it could be much lower - depends on your taste. Good buy."
