    "I had no particular difficulty putting this together, but the instructions did not include a list of tools needed, which would have been helpful. You need a flat screwdriver, a Phillips screwdriver, and some sort of mallet for gently pounding in the dowels. I used a hammer and a scrap of carpet pad. A strong magnet may be helpful for getting the screws back out of the holes on top if you drop them in before you remember to put in the last 4 dowels, as I did. You also need a drill with a thin, long bit for making pilot holes in the top edge where none were provided. I recommend using good wood glue on the dowels and along raw edges. The scanty amount of glue that came with it was solidified and useless when it arrived, which was yesterday. The cabinet parts are well made, but there were no provisions of any kind for hanging it. You're on your own figuring that out. I am a small woman in my late 60's with just a little experience assembling furniture and such. Other than hanging, it's reasonable to assume most people can do this if I can. It took me less than 2 hours, including quite a lot of time hunting down a screwdriver in this house! (You won't likely have that problem, will you?!) I will have to get someone stronger to hang it because it is heavy. Everything fit properly, no parts were missing or defective other than the glue, and it looks very nice when complete. The front frame and doors are wood, and are assembled in the factory, so you don't have to deal with trying to line up the doors. The rest is particle board with what looks like veneer, except for the thin back, which I think is mdf, but has the wood finish on the side that shows. The finished cabinet looks very nice and is a good value. I would recommend this to others.", 
    "Looks great, DH put it together and said it was not difficult. Matches existing Oak vanity. Vase, wicker basket and hand towels accessorize the bottom shelf nicely.", 
    "I purchased this to add some additional storage space to a bathroom. The oak looks great with the oak trim in the bathroom, and it seems to be of high quality. I don't care for the look of those metal units that stand over the toilet - this looks nice, while also providing useful additional storage. I did some searching, and think the value on this was very good. I recommend.", 
    "Mine came with a broken part, have contacted company but no response as of yet. It could be made better. Not all real wood. Not sure how it will hold up with moisture in bathroom.", 
    "Everything I wanted in a cabinet!", 
    "This cabinet requires assembly except for the front plate that includes the doors and hinges. The handles are cheap looking and were replaced with matching bathroom hardware. The tiny bottle of glue was for the dowels was spongy and worthless. Surprisingly, it went together with accuracy based on the easy-to-follow instructions. It looks just like the picture online.", 
    "The cabinet arrived in a timely manner, it was easy to put together and was just as advertised. I would buy again from this vendor.", 
    "This arrived quickly, but I soon discovered that it required extensive assembly. I call \"simple assembly\" less than 10 pieces. This has far more. It looks ok, but the dimensions are not accurate. It is NOT 27\" wide, it is 26. The shelves are NOT 10.39 inches in depth, but have only 8\" of useable space. This was my first & likely last purchase from Overstock, not so much for the assembly but for the mis-statement of useable space. It looks fine & seems sturdy, though"
