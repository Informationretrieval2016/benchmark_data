    "Pros: Good design and good structure. Cons: very strong chemical odor. It's been almost a month, but the fume is still there,even though I let it out in the sun for a whole day before I start using. i wish there's one more shelf. My husband added for me, but it would be more efficient if there's one more shelf.", 
    "Not a very nice looking cabinet. The doors are attractive but the box that surrounds it and the top look like the cheap white laminate shelving material. The doors are inset in the box so from the front you can see the cheap looking material. Also as other reviewers had noted, it off-gasses a lot! It has been up for 5 days and my bathroom stinks. We originally put our toothbrushes in the cabinet until they tasted like the smell. My kid who helped me put the cabinet together felt sick after we finished assembly. If you are sensitive to smells or off-gassing this product is not for you. Too expensive for the quality of product.", 
    "This was very quick to assemble with excellent, clear directions and everything well marked. The end result is a very nice sized wall cabinet that is the perfect compliment to the Virgo floor cabinet I purchased as well. I can fit so much more in this cabinet than I could in the one I replaced, yet the profille is not too obtrusive. Over the toilet it extends to slightly less than the tank width. The only concern is that it has the typical processed wood chemical smell that needs to dissipate, but it's not overwhelming. My husband is impressed with both pieces after being a bit skeptical about trusting the pictures and descriptions online, so this is a thumbs up.", 
    "I have always been very pleased with everything that I have purchased from Overstock until now. This thing is junk and I hung it in my garage. I stinks with a bad chemical smell that won't go away. This thing is not worth anywhere close to what they're getting for it. I would probably diappointed even if I paid $20 for it. As I said, this item is cheap, not the price.", 
    "Very pleased with this cabinet. The two shelves are roomy, and the cabinet is deep enough for stacked tissue rolls, and two rolls of narrow shampoo/conditioner bottles, and air freshener. This looks very attractive over the commode, and provides extra space for a small bathroom.", 
    "Cabinet is relatively easy to put together and nice looking. It is a good size over a toilet. It could use a third shelf.", 
    "Works perfectly in the space we have. Shelves are far enough apart to keep tall bottles in, a big plus for us. Well made. Nice finish.", 
    "I put this over the toilet for additional space. It holds alot. Kids wipes, toilet paper, etc. Keeps the bathroom tidy and it's a pretty solid piece. Pretty too. I love that the doors are not see through.", 
    "We are currently using this as a medicine cabinet. it was easy to put together, however, the doors are crooked.. no matter how much i tried to adjust it, they are not even or level..", 
    "This cabinet was decently easy to assemble and looks exactly like the picture online. However, it has a very strong factory/ chemical smell that has persisted for the first two weeks of the cabinet's time in our bathroom. The smell is particularly strong inside the cabinet and anything stored in there acquires the strong odor. I hope that this will go away with time, and wish I have aired out the pieces before installing it.", 
    "Perfectly adequate little cabinet for our daughter's bathroom. Easy to assemble, although the doors look a smidge uneven. Luxury custom cabinetry it isn't, but it looks nice and much better than the 1980s brass medicine cabinet it replaced. Would be better if it had 2 shelves, instead of just one. Glass knobs are a nice touch.", 
    "It was perfect for my bathroom. It looks lovely...Quailty is not great...But what do you expect for the price.I I found it ok to put together......No instructions were included though. Because of that I would say it would be difficult for the average joe to figure out.", 
    "Overall a great quality and good looking cabinet that takes about ten minutes to put together. The directions aren't much good, but that wasn't really a problem as it's easy to put together. The cabinet is sturdy and the glass windows are really nice. It looks really good put up. The minuses are the back of the cabinet is thin, like painted cardboard (similar to what you'd find on the back of a composite bookshelf.) I expected something better for the price. Also, it only comes with one shelf, so I will be making another for it. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Bought this for master bath between 2 mirrors .. Am very happy with this purchase !!", 
    "I returned a much more expensive one that I ordered from PB and was thrilled with this instead. It is hung crooked and too high, but that's another issue...", 
    "Nice looking cabinet. We didn't have any smell issues, as mentioned in other reviews. Prob came from whse or shipping container. Ours was easy to assemble. Perfect for few rolls of TP, box of tissues and some room for the unmentionables.", 
    "So easy to assemble and gave me just the extra bit of storage I needed.", 
    "just what i was looking for it fits perfect in the area and gets a lot of use.", 
    "Perfect fit for my half bath! Love it.", 
    "Perfect fit and very happy", 
    "Easy to put together, and they give you a paper chart to help hang it straight. Love it.", 
    "Even though I like it looks, the smell of chemicals used was quite overwhelming.", 
    "Love this cabinet. Great size and easy to assemble.", 
    "Easy to put together. Looks good", 
    "If you take the time to carefully assemble this you will be very pleased. All holes were perfectly pre-drillled sobjist had to make sire everything lined up. I didn't have any of the off-gassing that others had noted. Fantastic cabinet. I added a towel bar to underside to make it even better.", 
    "While I'm happy with the finished product, I could have purchased something pre-assembled for as much as I paid for this. I'm not sure if it was worth an hour of my time to get to the finished product. Doors are solid/ Interior shelf is thin/ Knobs are plastic. Well-styled, but overall just average", 
    "So handy to have over the toilet and great looking. It coordinated perfectly with our custom vanity and the crystal knobs tied into our new light fixture. We were looking for something compact to hold toilet paper, cleaning wipes, room spray and misc. \"stuff\" for the bathroom and this was just the ticket!", 
    "I had a hard time finding a cabinet narrow enough to fit over the toilet in my guest bathroom, but this did the trick! The shelves are spaced well enough to allow for large bottles, and it's roomy for being so small. I didn't notice any smell, and the only drawback I can find is that the knobs are pretty cheap looking. Small complaint though for how great the rest is!", 
    "Easy to put together and held together well.", 
    "Great looking. Took a long time for smell to dissipate. Pretty easy to put together.", 
    "Looks great in my bathroom above the toilet. Added extra space to a small bathroom.", 
    "Pretty cabinet for a great price", 
    "Not sure about the smell comments in other reviews. This cabinet looks great, smells fine, and was easy to install. Perfect for storing extra TP and cleaning supplies in a separate toilet room that is removed from the main bath area.", 
    "Delivered fast. Easy to put together. Exactly what I wanted for bathroom wall.", 
    "Easy to put together and install on wall.", 
    "The cabinet is very easy to assemble, sturdy, and looks great. I expected to get room for 2shelves, since it only fits tiny little items. It only has one shelf and you can only put little stuff in.", 
    "Looks just like the listing. Works well above our master bath toilet room.", 
    "Easy to put together and looks great. Exactly as described", 
    "It is a nice cabinet but when the doors are closed there is alarge gap in between them.", 
    "Great piece! Wonderful price! Solved storage problem for a small bathroom. Got the matching floor piece. Easy to assemble. Love the way it looks. I couldn't be happier!", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks nice!", 
    "thin material and not very deep. value for price is adequate. looks nice when assembled and serves the purpose for which it was ordered. recommend.", 
    "Only has one shelf, nice cabinet, but lack of shelving gets the lower review", 
    "easy to put together and looks great in our watercloset. Not huge but half the price of other cabinets", 
    "This is meeting our needs. Easy to put together but it has a terrible odor. I have left it open since we hung it but still smell badly", 
    "Bought 2 for my salon. They are just adorable and are nice for the money", 
    "This piece is easy to assemble but the doors aren't square in the frame. We have messed with the hinges and stuff and it got better but still not perfect. We decided we didn't care so much since it is in a small \"toilet room\" but it might've been a deal breaker if it was more visible. Did emit a chemical odor for the first few days, but it is going away now. Looks a little cheap up close (because it is) but it gets the job done :)", 
    "build is very good and it looks great. No problems at all whatever. Very pleased and it loooks good in the bathroom.", 
    "I turned this into a floor cabinet by adding legs. It is now the perfect floor cabinet for my tiny bath.", 
    "Nauseating smell during assembly and for two days afterwards. The crystal knobs in front are not even with each other. Description reads, \"Made from wood\". Well, if sawdust laden particle board with white laminate qualifies, then the statement is true. The edges of every laminate board are rough...not a tidy seam. For the price, my eyes failed to see the \"requires assembly\" notation. I presumed it would be assembled because of the asking price. We're not going to take it down at this point, but we are disappointed with the quality. If I saw that in someone's house, I would be thinking that it was a $30 piece. It's something I would put in a rental unit, hoping to get a few years out of it. This was for my home, with granite countertops. The piece is an embarrassment...looks out of place against the other higher quality lighting, cabinets and faucet fixtures. Only plus is the door design (not knob placement) and window feature, and overall size/depth. That was the selling point for us. We were duped. Sigh.", 
    "This cabinet fits perfectly in my power room. I covered the glass panes and spray painted it to match the d\u00e9cor. Absolutely thrilled with this purchase!", 
    "Bought 2 of these cabinets for extra bath storage! Look cute & very practical.", 
    "I purchased this for a bathroom. I am satisfied it has a clean crisp look. Most importantly I have extra storage. This was an easy install.", 
    "I bought this item as storage for the guest bathroom. After looking over the instructions, I thought that it would take me a long while to put together and hand. I was pleasantly surprised when the whole thing came together and was hanging in about two hours. For me this is quite an accomplishment. It's an asset to the bathroom and is functional.", 
    "We wanted a medicine cabinet with some pizazz, and not just a plain door. We ordered two, and they are really nice! The construction is great and they look awesome installed.", 
    "Took a little bit of time to put it together, well worth it :)", 
    "Just what we wanted for our powder room. It was easy to assemble too.", 
    "I am very pleased with the 2 door bathroom cabinet... some of the previous reviews make mention of a very strong chemical odor although that was not my experience with the unit that I received actually it had no smell at all. The cabinet shelf is made of a very thin plywood which is not super durable, but for my needs seems to be working for now. For a quick bathroom facelift it definitely helped.", 
    "I am very happy with the quaility and look of this product. Yes, I would purchase another one!", 
    "Very nice little bathroom cabinet. The assembly instructions were a little confusing but not terribly difficult. Looks exactly as pictured and the shallow depth made it perfect for the bathroom.", 
    "This item is a good size and looks nice, however it does have an odd smell and I wish it had 2 shelves instead of just one. I was questioning weather the hanging hardware it came with would be able to hold its weight, but it has been up for about a month and we haven't had any issues. Over all, I would say this was a good buy for the price.", 
    "I love the style of this cabinet! However, very poor construction! You CANNOT hang on a wall!! When we first hung it up, after taking an hour to assemble, it started to make small cracks in the MDF at different inside seams less than 24 hours later. And that was without anything in it!! So of course we knew immediately that there was no way that we could trust putting items in it and it would hold up. It comes with only a very thin piece of cardboard for the entire back which is not good support to hang it at all!!! I don't understand why they would do that?! Because I loved the design, my husband decided to brace the entire back with a solid piece of wood, adhere another solid piece of wood on the inside in order to support hanging it better & used different sturdy mounting screws. Unless you are handy or have someone that is, this cabinet is useless to hang on wall. But like I said, I do love the design & am happy that I have a handy husband!", 
    "Really ,these are very poor consruction. fastners. are a joke, they break when tightened they should be steel not allouy", 
    "GREAT PRICE AND THIS LITTLE CABINET IS SO CUTE AND NOT HARD TO PUT TOGETHER. I LOVE IT!!!!!", 
    "I made the mistake of using mounting hardware that came with cabinet. The dry wall anchors are not sufficient to hold even with cabinet empty. I had to spend and extra $XXX.XX. $XXX.XX to replace toilet when cabinet fell on and broke tank sending water gushing! Also, the $X.XX for metal \"French Cleat\" purchased a XXXX XXXXX. I have purchased a similar cabinet that this was included with. This manufacturer should include as well. I still have a slightly damaged cabinet & scratched toilet seat.", 
    "This cabinet was just what I needed. I have it sitting on a shelf, not hung on a wall, and it is only used to store small items that are not used frequently. It is a nice compact item. If it gets heavy daily use I'm not sure it will stand up.", 
    "Poorly made. Little wooden pegs too big for the holes. Had to use glue. Metal locking devices broke when turned to lock down. No extras included. Moldings have gaps (Ugly). Backing piece is super cheap white, paper thin! For the price, this cabinet is really cheap and looks cheap. Space in the center between doors is large at the top and small at the bottom. No adjustment. It is assembled and still sitting in the garage because I can't decide whether or hang it in the bathroom or relegate it to the garden shed.......... Very disappointing. I wouldn't buy this if I were you!", 
    "After reading some of the reviews, I was pleasantly surprise to see the cabinet fully assembled. I agree that the directions were not detailed well, but if you have some experience assembling small products and a little patience, it goes together well. My unit did not have an unusual smell, but it did sit in the box a couple of weeks before I had time to remove it from the package and assemble it. I am generally very picky, but the cabinet is perfect for what we wanted in a small space bathroom, and it looks great. For the price, I thought it was a terrific deal.", 
    "Cabinet looks great in my bathroom very happy adds nice finish to my bathroom", 
    "This cupboard is so darn cute. It is great in the bathroom or the kitchen. I love white furniture and this is beautiful and white.", 
    "This little cabinet is just perfect for a bathroom wall. It has ample storage, and is quite attractive. It was very easy to put together, and it was easy to hang. The template provided to show where you should drill the holes on the wall was extremely helpful.", 
    "This is very cute and was so easy to build, all the holes lined up and directions very easy to read, HAPPY customer!", 
    "A great buy--nice to look at, low price, easy to put together. It did have a chemical-ly smell to it--I built it and left it in the garage with doors open for a week before hanging it.", 
    "Excellent value. Looks good and holds more than you would think.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised after assembling this product. Yes, there is a strong chemical smell when you remove the pieces from the box. I placed the pieces under a ceiling fan for a few hours and came back to no odor, and then began assembling. Keep in mind I am not handy at all but I was able to do this by myself in 40 minutes and only needed 2 different sized phillips screwdrivers in addition to the hardware it came with. So nice that it actually came with a mini glue bottle too! There were a few minor scuffs on the piece that attaches as the back of the cabinet but really not a big deal. It was REALLY helpful that they pre-drilled holes for the screws to attach the back, because I have assembled furniture from IKEA that did not have the pre-drilled holes and a drill was completely necessary to do the job. The doors shut and close very nicely as well. Anyway, can't beat the price, easy assembly, and it looks fantastic!", 
    "I bought this cabinet and two matching floor cabinets for the master bathroom. It was easy to assemble and came well-packaged. We mounted it on the wall over the toilet, and it looks great!", 
    "Best thing about it is that it was very easy to put to gather and looked good when it was done.", 
    "perfect cabinet. It was the perfect size to fit over the toilet. Its great and lovely.", 
    "This is a good-looking little cabinet for a bathroom. At 19 inches wide it is narrower than many, so it fits nicely above the toilet. At 6 1/2 inches deep it gives space to store bathroom items without hitting the back of your head when you use the toilet. It probably could stand to be one inch deeper, but I am not complaining. The adjustable shelf allows taller items to fit. I have mine set in the middle position, which allows 11 1/4 inches in height on both shelves. If you put the shelf in the top position, you would have about 13 1/2 inches in height on the bottom shelf, with about 8 1/2 inches in height on the top shelf. The small glass panels in the doors are attractive without showing too much of the contents of the cabinet. My husband assembled it for me and said it is a well-made little cabinet and the pieces fit together as they are supposed to. You will need two people to mount the cabinet on the wall.", 
    "the only negative is a smell of paint / finish inside cabinet each time opened / may go away hopefully...", 
    "The cabinet matched my bathroom perfectly the color the size was what I was looking for. I was very pleased.", 
    "This wall cabinet is pretty once in place but the back side is difficult to get in place and Ithere is only one shelf inside. I purchased two glass shelves to put in the cabinet so iI could put more items inside.", 
    "The cabinet is exactly like the picture. It was very easy to put together and hang. The hinges are small and not noticeable. I would highly reccomend this product.", 
    "We purchased this cabinet to use as a floor cabinet. It fits perfectly in front of the toilet. We store extra paper and supplies. Works great.", 
    "I was looking for a small cabinet for the bathroom, and this one happened to have the perfect dimensions. It was also the cheapest I found, with free shipping as well! The only thing I did not realize was that the item did not come assembled...Assembly didn't end up being difficult, and the instructions were easy to follow. The item came with easy hanging guideline that I could place up to the wall for accurate placement of hardware. It is up on the wall, sturdy, and looks great!", 
    "This is a very attractive, sturdy cabinet. I love it. Only downside is that it has a paint smell that takes a very long time to go away. We leave the doors open all the time right now to help the smell dissipate.", 
    "I was unable to use it in my bathroom as planned but was able to use it in an alcove off the kitchen. It is just right for my teas and coffees. I could have used an additional shelf, however.", 
    "This is a fantastic, well-made cabinet. It was easy to put together and looks great!! 5 stars!", 
    "This cabinet looks great in my kids bathroom. Nice place to hide stuff. Good quality, great price.", 
    "This is a nice, attractive cabinet for the price. If you are on a budget, this is the cabinet for you! It assembles easily and the finished product looks good.", 
    "The cabinet was not the easiest to mount, but in the end it seems pretty stable. My one concern is that the cabinet pulls are kind of ugly, but that's easy enough to replace.", 
    "NEADS 2 shelves in side ,had to make one shelf . to much opening", 
    "very satified with price, quality, and delivered in a timely matter...always refers to friends...love overstock . com", 
    "Looks better in person than in the picture... nice size and quality for the money... looks similar to those at big name hardware stores for half the price", 
    "I love this cabinet. I had found this at 2 big box stores and it was priced at $$. Great product and the price was terrific", 
    "I am pleased with my purchase. If I had a complaint it would be that I think the cabinet should be a little bit bigger, but the dimensions are given in the descriptions...so that was totally on me. It took my husband about 45 mins to put the cabinet together, his only complaint was that the assembly instructions can be a little vague, but all in all not too difficult to assemble. The cabinet is pretty sturdy. The glass windows on the doors and the \"glass-like\" door nobs are nice characteristics of the cabinet.", 
    "I bought this along with the corresponding lower cabinet for my bathroom. I have so little storage space in my bathroom that I wanted to add \"something\" so that I could have a medicine cabinet and a \"towel and other stuff\" cabinet. I thought that the cabinets were easy and fun to put together. There is a slight off gassing, but that goes away with time. The Wall Cabinet is about the size of a medicine cabinet.", 
    "was too heavy to be held with two screws, took 4 screws into the wall. all in all very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Love the cabinet it fits in the site very well and am pleased.", 
    "Nice little cabinet for the bathroom. I can confirm that the odor of the paint or preservative is very strong, so if you plan on putting toothbrushes or something like that, this might not be the cabinet for you. I am using it for tissues and toilet paper, so I don't mind the chemical smell inside and I am hopeful it will dissapate with time. Easy to assemble, solid and cute too. I would reccommend this.", 
    "Love this cabinet, has a very high quality look to it, it really classed up my bathroom and there is tons of room inside!", 
    "The product was completely unassembled but it was very easy to put together. The instructions were very clear and all the parts were all there. It looks very nice hanging in my bathroom. If you are handy putting things together this is the right cabinet for you for the price. I did hang the cabinet with two 75 pound anchors on drywall since I had a shelf fall in the past and I just wanted the extra security. If I had more space in my bathroom I would also purchase the matching floor cabinet.", 
    "Great product - seems sturdy and well built - nice looking", 
    "I was looking for something smaller to fit behind the door in the bathroom. This was a perfect size and I didnt want to spend a fortune. For the price it is actually very good quality and had no marks or defects in it at all. I also purchased the matching floor cabinet as well and received the same quality and affordability.", 
    "I was looking for a smaller cabinet as this guest bathroom could not handle the bigger cabinets that you see in the \"big box\" stores. The glass windows was just the touch needed to update this bath.", 
    "The cabniet did not come with directions but was easy to \"figure out\" if you've assembled cabinets/furniture before. It does have a chemical smell when opened which concerned me because we were keeping our toothbrushes in it. We now have left them outside of it. For the price and convinience; not worth returning to hide 2 toothbrushes! Other than that we love it for keeping EVERYTHING off the counter tops that was too tall to fit into the drawers of our vanity. The fact that it only had 1 shelf is why I chose it. All of our tall products fit perfectly.", 
    "Item was pleasantly received. It was put together quickly and the item went together very well. Surprised to get such quality at that price. Woul buy again.", 
    "Very surprised and pleased with the quality of this item. We bought two and they are perfect for our needs. The quality for the price is really unbelievable. Thanks Overstock.com!", 
    "I had been looking for a wall cabinet for my bathroom and this was a perfect match. It was easy for my husband to assemble and it sure made a difference in my bathroom. No more stuff sitting on the counter - Yeah!", 
    "Not only is this cabinet attractive, but it was very easy to assemble and hang. I highly recommend it.", 
    "I ordered this cabinet because I had a narrow wall area. It is listed as 24\" H x 18\" x 7\" D, my wall is 19 1/4\" W. The cabinet is actually 20\", the top overhang is 1/2\" so I had to trim the left side of the top to make it fit my space. In spite of this I am happy with this product.", 
    "I love the look of this unit! It is sturdy, pretty, practical storage. I highly recommend it to anyone whose bathroom is lacking in storage space.", 
    "This product was easy to assemble and to put up on the wall. It is quite attractive, especially with the crystal-looking door pulls. However, this has been stated by other reviewers, and I have to agree, that the manufacturing odor on the inside of this product is very noticeable and distasteful. It is still there every time I open it with my products inside, and that has been a few weeks now. It should have gone away by now. I have sprayed perfume in there, and kept it open for several days before putting things in it, but the smell remains. That is the only problem with this product, other than it could use one more shelf due to the amount of space inside.", 
    "This bathroom cabinet is nice, easy to assemble, and worth the price.", 
    "Cabinet is great - had read reviews of odor. While there is a faint odor within it is mostly faint. Cabinet is solid and looks great. Would like 1 more shelf.", 
    "It was exactly what I wanted and had no problems putting it together. It looks beautiful on the wall in my bathroom.", 
    "I put this above the toilet in a small bathroom. The white does close off the space like a darker brown does. It is easy to assemble. It looks really good. I added my own knobs to add a little more character, but overall it functions as it needs to. I can fit everything I need to in there.", 
    "I love this cabinet. It has an antique look that fits beautifully with my bathroom. My only complaint is that I wish it had three shelves rather than the two shelves. Overall. I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Great value and nice quality. Needs another shelf otherwise it woudl be perfect. Arrived promptly.", 
    "This is a nice sturdy cabinet - and is really a cut above what I could find in the big box stores. The glass knobs add a decorative touch. I have this in my powder room and it hides all the extra supplies very nicely! It was a little hard to assemble - and it is true as others have noted - that you can clearly see the 2 piece backing (which is thin backer board). But this is the only flimsy part of this wall cabinet and it does not impact integrity since it is the part against the wall. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I'm happy with it. It's not cheaply made like some cabinets. It's strong and sturdy.", 
    "I assembled it during a TV program. It takes about 60-90 mins. depending if you run into trouble. I had trouble getting the hinges on correctly. You can use a power drill driver, just take it easy on assembly,skip glueing the dowels,messy and the Cams hold it well together. Also put your nuts and bolts in a cup or container as there are no extras if you use it in the rug. I am a 62 yr. old lady.", 
    "The item arrived well packaged with all the parts in place. It was easy to put together. When finished, it looked neat. It adds a Mediterranean sort of bright, white look to my bathroom. Does not look like board furniture. Totally worth the price.", 
    "This cabinet went together easy and looks really nice. I also got the floor cabinet that goes with it. They both add a real nice accent to my bathroom.I would recommend this cabinet to anyone. It is very elegant looking.", 
    "This was very easy to assemble and sturdy/good quality for the price. It's the perfect size to go over the toilet and add alittle more storage to a small bath!", 
    "The cabinet was exactly what we needed for our bathroom. Color (white) was perfect. Price and style was way better than anything local. Has plenty of space and easy to hang. Could not be more pleased with cabinet and overstock!", 
    "The cabinet seems well made and is easy to assemble, per my husband. It's an attractive design.", 
    "I like it, my bathroom is tiny so its perfect for a small bathroom. The instructions were straight forward and the price was very reasonable. It does have a funny chemical smell. It shouldn't last forever but its noticeable.", 
    "This was not bad to put together. It fit the bill and the price was decent. Thank you again OverStock!", 
    "This cabinet is just what I was expecting (with the exception of coming unassembled :() Oh well, my handyman put it together and up on the way and the storage capacity is just what I needed and the finish is lovely.", 
    "This is a great addition to our small apartment bathroom, and finally allowed us to get things off the floor. It was relatively easy to put together (probably took me an hour all together). I like that the doors cover the entire shelving area, so it looks more streamlined. The shelf inside is adjustable so that you can have room for taller items if you like. Great value for the price.", 
    "Pretty good product for the price. The chemical smell that others have mentioned was definitely noticeable. I was bummed that this unit only came with one shelf, but I used some of the packing material to make a 2nd shelf for short items (I wouldn't do this if it was going to be in a guest bathroom).", 
    "It took me 1 hour to assemble the cabinet... very clear instuctions, it went very smooth. I needed my husband to hold the cabinet on to the wall for the final attaching, it's not light. I used heavy duty anchors and screws other than what came with the cabinet, just extra security. The doors are just a smidge off, one is between an 1/8 and a 1/4 lower than the other but I can live with it. Overall I love the piece, it's very nice looking and a nice addition to the bathroom decor. I would recommend it to a friend. The missing star of the 5 stars is because of the doors not lining up exactly.", 
    "I purchase the over the comode cabinet and the floor cabinet, they are beautiful a well constructed. Have had no issues, love all three cabinets.", 
    "The 1/2 bath in my new house has a pedestal sink and no where to store extra toilet paper. This is a nice little cabinet for storing toilet paper rolls (fit perfectly) and other supplies. The cabinet was easy to put together and I did not detect any \"chemical smell\" that others have mentioned. The construction is sturdy and based on its cost the quality was much better than I expected. The cabinet is made from MDF and the finish is smooth with no defects. The door pulls are a \"crystal-like\" plastic (this is not clear in the online photo) and are reasonably attractive, but I might consider changing them to better fit with the faucet style in my bathroom. One criticism is with the drywall anchors that came with the cabinet. There are only two small anchors and would not secure the cabinet well enough for me to be comfortable hanging it on the wall. I had some different anchors purchased at the local big-box home store that I used which carry 75 lbs each. Overall a very good product if you are looking for a decent cabinet with clean lines at a reasonable price.", 
    "Love the cabinets--exactly as pictured. Able to store all the needed supplies!", 
    "This medicine cabinet is quite attractive and sturdily built. I would have given it 5 stars, however, the assembly effort and time offset the excellent price. I changed out the knobs to match the brushed nickel appointments I had and it looks very nice -- crisp and clean.", 
    "Comparable product at Home Depot and Lowe's was $119.00!! This was a breeze to put together and blends well with my existing cabinetry. I highly recommend this product!", 
    "Cabinet is great but the directions are not so fun! Two people required.", 
    "I love it. It is very good quality and the two shelves are plenty of room for face wash tooth brush etc. They are pretty narrow but that works because we hung it over the toilet and needed it to be small.", 
    "The cabinet looks really crisp and clean when all put together. The instructions were somewhat difficult to follow and I did make a couple of mis-steps which I was able to overcome.I would really recommend a rewrite on the instructions.", 
    "This was easy to together with the great instruction. Excellent quality of wood pressed products with a nice finish. This is not very deep so it is nice to hang over the toilet. I may get another one for the other bathroom.", 
    "I purchased this wall cabinet for a small space in my kitchen. It coordinates well with my other cabinets. I am very pleased with the look and quality. It was fairly easy to put together. Thanks again Overstock.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for my guest bathroom - the size is perfect and it looks great. It's a good quality cabinet and solid. Came very well packaged and easy to assemble. Extremely satisfied and have gotten very good compliments on it. I like the fact that the doors aren't glass so I can keep extra soaps, towels and toilet paper handy. I would definitely recommend this cabinet.", 
    "The cabinet arrived in perfect condition, and was easy to assemble. It looks very nice in my newly redecorated bathroom.", 
    "I love this!! It took me only one hour to fully assemble and anchor into the wall in my bathroom!! It's perfect for medications!!! You could easily put towels and other sundries! I bought the spacesaver in the same exact style and they are both made of great materal and the directions were super easy. All you need is phillips screwdriver and a drill to anchor it in!", 
    "First, it came dissassembled. This was a surprise to us, but simple enough to put together...so we thought. After assembling (only took 20 minutes or so), we could not believe that the entire cabinet was held togther basically by a piece of cardboard that is screwed on the back. There is a mounting strip at the top inside, which is ONLY attached to the cardboard backing. Very cheap design. When drilling pilot holes to set the cabinet, 4 of the screws that hold the back to the frame fell out. We had to gather 4 of our own mounting brackets to reinforce this cabinet to assure that it would not fall when items were placed inside OR when opening it. After we finally secured it to the wall, we closed the front doors and one of the doors had shifted down slightly...which looks horrible. We regret purchasing it, we regret NOT returning it. Do not waste your time - there are better quality and nicer looking cabinets out there for the same price!", 
    "I like the cabinet. The only thing I don't like is the size I really thought it was bigger than it is. In the picture it looks a lot bigger."
