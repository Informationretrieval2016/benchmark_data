    "This table is beautiful, easy to put together and extremely stylish. Got it to use with a set of Pottery barn chairs and it looks great!", 
    "We have hit for a month and are very pleased. Excellent quality. This is a heavy table for its size. Assembly was not difficult. Pieces well marked.", 
    "Very nice table that is in my informal dining area. It was easy to put together and very stable. The color matches what is in the picture. I would not use a pen/paper to write a note without something under the paper so that you do not ruin the table. The finish is so pretty. There is a leaf with the table as well so can easily accommodate 6 people easily and 8 if needed.", 
    "Great table for my Mother's dining area in assisted living. First table sent had a small problem, Overstock immediately sent a replacement which was received within a few days. Customer service was very friendly and helpful. I'm looking to use Overstock again.", 
    "I purchased this table to go with an existing hutch. The color matches almost perfect! It was easy to put together and took about 30 minutes.", 
    "This table, with the leaf, is \"just right\" for my average-sized dining space. The table, without the leaf, was a little too small for the dining space. With the leaf, I can get six chairs around it (four are the Aspen Collection chairs) and two are Tan Nail Head Parsons Chairs (also purchased from O.co). The top of the table scratches quite easily so I will either have to purchase mats or glass to prevent further scratches. I love the rich color and the sturdy feel to the table. I felt the price was fair for what you get.", 
    "We love this table, but it did not come out of the box good to go. Some of the drilled holes did not match up to the pegs. My husband is handy, and after a consult with a couple of others, he figured out how to make it work. It seemed easier than sending it back. Also, the veneer is not exactly scratch proof - so be gentle with it. Other than all of that - we like the table - it fits well in our tiny tiny dining room. We like it with the leaf in - so nice oval table - just the right size for 4 - could seat 6 with no elbow room.", 
    "I have the buffet that matches it. I wish it did not have the line down the center (but that is there for the extra leave of the table). I chose it but even my designer loves it. Good value for the money. There was a mar in the table top, which was covered over with stain, but not a glaring problem such that I would go to the bother of sending it back for a new one. Pretty easy assemble but did have to spend some time to lock the two table top pieces together so that there would be as small a gap as possible because I don't use it with the leaf in int.", 
    "Beautiful table. Love the size without leaf for our apartment, but have leaf for larger size when we move into a larger home. Finish seemed to chip easily. My husband laid it on a carpet staple when putting together (chip #1) and then when putting the chairs around it, lightly hit it with chair leg (chip #2). So just be careful and you'll love it!", 
    "Looks good, but there is something slightly off with the way the pieces fit together. I was doing fine putting it together when I hit that wall. So I called in my building's handyman. He thought the problem was the placement of a piece of their hard hardware so he moved it. As a result, we can fit the leaf in and close it, but there are spaces in between the leaf and the main body. A bit wobbly too. Tells me you get what you pay for. Wish I had gone with Pottery Barn's version of this table. Twice the price but likely twice the quality.", 
    "I love this table. It is a mix of \"old English\" and updated finish. I wish it came a bit bigger, but the size will fit fine with an additional service buffet. With the leaf, the table really only seats 4-5 comfortably. Six can squeeze in but not with much extra room. If you have a service buffet table to hold plates and table extras, then six would fit fine for an intimate dining experience.", 
    "The table is sturdy and well made but the top had some finish imperfections. I kept it, because of the hassle of returning, however, it was disappointing.", 
    "Table is very solid and wood grain is beautiful. Impressive looking pedestal, too. My husband and I put it together with the only problem being the weight of the table top. Unfortunately, we did not look closely at the table top before we had it altogether. There is a small, but noticeable flaw that I should have notified the company about, but didn't feel like taking the whole thing apart right then and sending the table back.", 
    "Beautiful heavy table. Looks great. Easy to put together. Would highly recommend.", 
    "Well made sturdy and looks good very happy!", 
    "Great table for the price. We love it and I receive wonderful compliments about it. With leaf not too extra sturdy", 
    "We love ths table. We have received many compliments on it. Just perfect for the 4 chairs we already had.", 
    "This table is even prettier in reality than the picture shows. Delivery was prompt and it took my son about a half hour to unpack and put it together. I gave it four stars because there were a couple dings/scratches; however, nothing serious enough to warrant returning it. I would recommend this table to others looking for a round pedestal table at an excellent price.", 
    "The two halves of the tabletop did not mate up properly leaving a small gap. I have covered it with a table runner because I don't want to go to the trouble of sending it back. Also several significant scratches in the wood.", 
    "Love this table. Like that it expands so you can have a larger table when you need it.", 
    "Put this together last night and love it. Table is of good quality and will be great for my new kitchen.", 
    "This table is fantastic. I put it together in just a very short time and it looks like a million dollars. The pedestal is perfect and with the extension , it is big enough to seat 6 comfortably. It really looks great in any situation.", 
    "We are satisfied with our purchase. One piece has small cracks, but we managed to make it not so visible. Other than that, it is a beautiful table.", 
    "Upon receipt of the dining table, there was a defect in the wood. I sent an e-mail about it but got no reply."
