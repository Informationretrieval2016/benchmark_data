    "These are heavy duty, sturdy shelves that should stand up to long use. Although they are meant for the bathroom, the smooth shelves are perfect for folded sweaters as they won't snag.", 
    "I shopped quite a bit and wasn't wanting to spend this much money; however the size was what I needed. When they arrived I was very pleased. They look great and are substantial, not flimsy like so many I saw in the stores. I do want to add something to secure the back to the wall, primarily because I don't want to take any chances regarding safety and it will eliminate worry about the weight of items I place on the top shelf.", 
    "I was pleased with the quality and delivery of the product", 
    "I was hesitant to purchase this shelf because other reviewers complained about the odor but I decided to risk it. I am glad I did. Yes, it does smell like chemicals when you first open the box. However, I brought down my air purifier and ran it in for about a week and the smell completely disappeared. I'm not sure how long it would take to out-gas otherwise. The \"marble\" is plastic, but it looks amazingly good. I am very pleased with it. The only reason I give it four stars is because it does need to out-gas.", 
    "Great looking shelves for any room. Mine are in the bathroom and provide much needed storage. Well made and great looking.", 
    "This shelf is very sturdy and looks good enough to use anywhere.", 
    "Delighted in look and storage capasity. Am downsizing and shelves are great for hiding needed items as storage is limited in my apartment. Tip: place items in baskets or attractive containers. Maximizes storage and enhances beauty of shelves.", 
    "We use this for additional storage in our kitchen. The shelves are obviously laminate but overall looks great in our white kitchen.", 
    "Nicely made, sturdy, attractive", 
    "Sturdy and attractive. Easy to put together. same as picture.", 
    "High Quality and a great value", 
    "using this in my master bath, but the plastic \"marble\" shelves are not really my thing., but moisture won't be a problem.", 
    "Even my handyman, after putting it together for me, thinks this is a great looking unit.", 
    "This shelf has been the perfect addition to our newly renovated master bathroom. It holds our towels and other essentials, is sturdy and attractive. I've had the shelf for about six months now. Great buy.", 
    "I purchased this unit and put it together only to find out that my commode wouldn't accommodate it. It's beautiful, well made. I hated to return it, but I had no choice. I hope my next place of residence has more space in the bathroom as I would definitely order it again.", 
    "Easy to assemble and a solid unit, looks great", 
    "Really looks nice was easy to assemble. I didn't attach the item that appeared to be used to hold the shelf to the wall. Didn't like the idea of putting holes in the wall. Shelf stands great on its own.", 
    "Looks better than expected. Solid piece of furniture that looks great in our bathroom.", 
    "Love it. My favorite scent right now. Wish it lasted a little longer.", 
    "had it for almost a year in my bathroom for the bath towels. inexpensive and chic.", 
    "I was surprised by the quality of the product at this price. It was easy to assemble, and I didn't really expect the marble look of the shelves from the computer images.", 
    "Very nice addition to my small bathroom. Assembly was very easy and the end product looks very nice - looks more expensive than the price. My friends and family like it as well - I've gotten lots of compliments!", 
    "The shelf is perfect for our Master bath. Very easy to put together, and sturdy!!! Definitely recommend for the price point!", 
    "What a Great shelf ! Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", 
    "I absolutely love this shelf & receive plenty of compliments on it. It goes perfect in my new bathroom and adds a great amount of storage to display my towels & other decorative items. The shelves look like real marble & holds up very well. I've had it for 2 months now", 
    "I recently bought a newly remodeled home and nothing I already have matched. I love this shelf it is very nice. It was nicer than it looked in the pictures. It assembled very easy and looks great in my new bathroom. It was so nice I bought three more matching pieces for the bathroom. Just for decorative purposes I can put accent pieces on. As far as cost I wish the combined cost was about $100 cheaper. Or if their were discounts given for buying multiple matching items it would have been nicer.", 
    "I like my shelf so don't take my good rating as a bad thing. But it is a little small in person and kind of shallow. but it will be fine for the space i had for it so i guess its good that it isn't too large. will be using in a corner for my bath linens. matched my theme in the bathroom. just have to harness to the wall to make sure it is safe. I would even consider the other pieces in the collections."
