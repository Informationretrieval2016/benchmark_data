    "two spots on each door, one on top, other on the bottom that look like scrapes, although they are in the paint treatment. I bought 2 of these, and it is the same on both. The look says expensive, but the price does not. The measurement listed for the depth of the unit was off by 2 inches, so my carpenter had to cut 2 inches off the back, as they were being built into alcoves. I informed customer service, so I do hope they changed the info to 14\" deep, instead of the 12\" it had posted. If not for what I wrote here, my review would have been 5 stars. The color on my monitor was true to the real thing of a medium teal and a sea green wash over a soft shade of brown.", 
    "Very happy with this item overall...however, the color is very misleading(it is a very bright sea foam green). The item also arrived with damage to one of the legs (splintered)"
