    "Unit came quickly, packaged well, is a dark (dark) espresso. Only 2 stars because the dimensions shown for the cabinet are misleading. From the inside corner to each edge is only 14.25 inches Also bought the same line espresso floor cabinet - colors matched well. The floor cabinet is only slightly more wide than this (wall) corner cabinet. All units went together well, and easily. Have a few wooden dowels but they include a little glue and mostly cam locks for tying everything else up. If you need/want small, these are ok.", 
    "Very roomy and looks wonderful. Only downfall is that the cams don't seat well so you have to make sure they are fully in and secured.", 
    "Overall ok product. it was not the best. there is a small part on the bottom that does not fit well and causes the door to sometimes sick. If they would fix this piece, would give the product for stars. Also came with some minor finds and scratches.", 
    "The cabinet arrived on time. All the pieces were there, so it could be put together correctly, however, I ordered the cabinet in Expresso Brown, and I received a White cabinet. Even the packaging said it was Expresso Brown, so I was quite surprised when I opened it to see it was not what I ordered. The only reason I did not complain or send it back was that I originally was looking for a black gloss cabinet and couldn't find what I wanted. I fell in love with this one and ordered it knowing I would be painting it anyway. Since it was going in my bathroom and would be filled with who-knows-what, I had also bought a spray paint specifically made to change clear glass to frosted glass so it was no longer see-through. I did all of the above, and the cabinet looks fantastic. It is well made and just the right size for my small bathroom. I would have rated it five stars had it arrived in the Expresso Brown as I had ordered. After all, sending the wrong color was a hugh mistake.", 
    "This cabinet was easily assembled and is well made. It installed easily in a corner of the bath and looks great. the color (espresso) matches the vanity (also espresso). It filled an empty corner and provides a lot of storage. The glass door adds to the excellent appearance. I recommend it for anyone with a corner where nothing else fits.", 
    "nice, just a bit smaller than I thought it'd be", 
    "Product rates poorly with me, difficult to assemble, incorrect and insufficient screws and tools, badly milled with bad odour.", 
    "the cabinet hangs on the wall with 2 small screws. Wasn't so confident with such huge Cabinet & small screws. To mark the holes is a real pain in the ***. And, even before you get to the wall mount, the assembly is really disappointing. the alignment can very easily go wrong & you will end up having gaps.. Actually, you might, coz if you are lucky u might not either... i returned this for a corner cabinet, which i had to exchange 2 times for similar issues.", 
    "when got the product the top was warped and had to wait for them to send us another one, which they did in a timely manner, then we finished putting it together and the door is warped also, there were scratches all over the thing inside and out, didn't want to hassle with trying to get it replaced because it would have taken to long, so it sits in my garage were it's not being used, I would order another shelf at all, but everything else I have ordered from overstock has been great until this item", 
    "Good looking product for the price point. Easy assembly. Fits well in the small space I have available in my bathroom.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for my guest bath. The shape of the cabinet fits snuggly into the corner of the small bathroom which works out great! I love the black color, it's very attractive. The only thing I don't like about it is that at the bottom of the door there is a small gap. I wish it went all the way down to meet the bottom shelf. Other than that - great cabinet! I would buy again.", 
    "I needed a place for all my holy items and to be in a place where I can see them as I walk into my room. This corner cabinet is perfect and looks great in my room.", 
    "Wall cabinet ok. I got the matching flpor cabinet which did not line up at all to put together. I had to buy some gorilla glue to put it together which was a messy process. : /", 
    "This product was purchased for our recent bathroom renovations. We had an existing corner unit that we needed to replace and this fit perfectly and the price was good. It is the perfect color that we wanted as well. I would recommend it to others.", 
    "This cabinet is just what I was looking for for my bathroom. It was easy to assemble. The only problem I have is that the color is black, not dark brown.", 
    "Attractive cabinet, fits perfect in a small desk area.", 
    "Very happy with the quality of the product. Just what we needed in our small bath area. Fairly easy and fast for my husband to put together. Very happy with ovwestock.com. Very fast delivery too and it's free.", 
    "The finish leaves something to be desired, but is still acceptable.", 
    "Push your luck ..... you could get it with some scratches , and flaws ....", 
    "Beautiful product, small, somewhat hard to assemble. Altogether, very nice though.", 
    "Product will do for my purpose; however, for the price it should have been of better quality and assembled.", 
    "I opened the box and the first piece I pulled out was broken. This is cheap fiberboard that won't last a day.", 
    "We remodeled our bathroom and did all of our baseboard and window trim in a dark coffee/espresso color. Our vanity is also this color. We order this corner cabinet and two other cabinets from Overstock. They matched perfectly. We have this mounted in the the corner and my husband had no problem putting it together or mounting it to the wall corner.", 
    "Wish we would have put this together before doing the matching bottom one, which had NO instructions. In contrast, this one had excellent instructions and was obviously made by another company, or division. Beautiful little cabinet which sits (and hangs) in my living room.", 
    "I'm just a little disappointed because it is darker than I expected and there were a few nicks and scratches on the cabinet. I also ordered a floor cabinet to match, so didn't want to bother returning. They do work for me as I had intended in my bathroom.", 
    "It came in more pieces than my husband expected. It took about an hour to put together. I loved it immediately but he pointed out what we thought was an imperfection on the door. He called Overstock Customer Service who must have referred the call to the manufacturer who called first thing Monday morning. The rep who called said it happens often from packing and we should try a little vaseline on the spot it should disappear. IT DID, SUCCESS!!! I thought it was the perfect unassuming and useful cabinet, but we had friends over that night who noticed it and thought it perfect and wanted to know where we purchased it from.", 
    "This cabinet came with shipping damage. Overstock sent a replacement out immediately. The second cabinet came within days and was in greaat condition. It was very easy to deal with Overstock and they fixed the problem immediately. I would recommend the cabinet to anyone and also Overstock. Thanks Overstock for being a great company!", 
    "I looked everywhere for a corner cabinet to match my vanity I just had installed and found this one. I was really hesitant about buying something like this on line but when it arrived it was exactly as described. It was very easy to put together and looks even better in person. Its also very sturdy which is why I gave it 5 stars.", 
    "I got this cabinet to fit in a tight corner of a bathroom with very, very dark brown wood trim everywhere. Although described as espresso, and looking that way in the pictures, it was in fact straight black, without a touch of brown. Also, it is incredibly small...no way to fit anything but small hand towels or lotion jars.", 
    "I love my cabinet. It fits perfect in my bathroom. I would recommend it to everyone looking for a corner cabinet. great!", 
    "Our daughter was looking for a corner cabinet for their dining room. There wasn't a lot of space, but she wanted a place to display wedding and heirloom china that would keep it out of reach of their soon to be crawling daughter. Although this piece is intended for a bathroom, it works great in their space. It came exactly when promised, and was everything we expected.", 
    "Perfect for my small bathroom. Fits a good bit for a corner cabinet. Might get another for opposite corner. Good option if you want to leave floor space open for hampers and such.", 
    "This corner cabinet is exactly the look, size and price I was looking for. Shipping didn't even make it more worth looking in the store. I did look at the store but didn't see it in stock and the same piece was $50 more! It was easy to install (with 2 people). Add storage and style to a small space!", 
    "Beautiful cabinet!! I love this cabinet. Easy to put together and is a nice piece. I hung it in the corner of my bathroom and it matches the vanity perfectly.", 
    "Rich Dark Espresso color, affordable price, corner unit, easy to assembly...... no complain at all"
