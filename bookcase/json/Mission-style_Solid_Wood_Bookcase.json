    "Some of wood damaged on corners and scratched and multiple screw holes did not line up. With good help I could not assemble this properly. End result was wobbly, not all screws in properly, very disappointing. Hoped to put this in living room but didn't--now strictly a lousy storage thing in closet. Wish I could have returned it! And allen wrench quit half-way through project. Do not buy this! I am usually very pleased with over-stock, not this time.", 
    "This Bookshelf was very nice looking, easy to assemble and is very sturdy. The directions were a bit sparse, so I would recommend laying the pieces out first to be sure everything is in the right direction and the top shelf is on the top, etc... We were able to assemble this in less than 60 minutes! Also, delivery was very fast and without a scratch!", 
    "This is a pretty good shelf for the price. I bought it because I liked the airy open design. My house has pretty low ceilings, so I don't want to use bulky, heavy-looking furniture. Despite the open design, this shelf feels pretty sturdy. I'm storing mostly books on it. I used common sense when I loaded up the shelves (ie heavier books on the bottom, progressively lighter things above). It was not hard to assemble. I did it by myself (with a couple beers) in about an hour. One bad thing - the little allen wrench they give you starts wearing out (ie the corners start rounding out and it becomes more difficult to turn the screws) with the last couple screws. It felt a little rickety while I was building it, but when it was all put together and standing up, it seemed much more sturdy. It does lean forward a little, but that may be due to my thick carpet.", 
    "The Mission -style Solid Wood Bookcase was fairly easy to assemble (putting the shelves in place proved to be challenging because this is supposed to take place before the back of the shelf is attached). While the shelf is lightweight, it takes up very little space, but I am able to attractively display all my knick-knacks. The shelf is sturdy, it appears to be durable, and I'm considering purchasing another!", 
    "This bookcase arrived within a week of ordering it. The color is darker than I thought it would be but it is OK. I assembled it by myself in about an hour and it went together beautifully. I suggest you assemble it on a table top or work bench. The Allen wrench that is included is not really strong enough for the job so I suggest you use a stronger one. I had no problem at all with the screw holes lining up. Every one of them was perfect. The bookcase is very sturdy and the shelves are full of books. I am very pleased with how it all went together.", 
    "Bought two of these. They are solid wood--that's the good news. What happened to me, I hope, is a fluke. In one of the boxes, I had only one top stabilizer for the mantle (instead of two) and an extra back support board, which was the same dimension, but drilled differently. As I did not have time to wait for another board to be sent to me, I re-manufactured the part with a number of complicated tricks and without a drill press. I would not wish that on anyone--nor would I recommend anyone attempt what I did.", 
    "This bookcase is a great disappointment. I \"mis-Ordered\" a previous bookcase which turned out to be the wrong color and had to be returned--but at least it was almost 50% less expensive than this one. This one was difficult to assemble because a number of the predrilled holes did not line up and once assembled is wobbly. I have two other black Mission style bookcase which I wanted to match, but would return this in a heartbeat if I hadn't spent so much time and effort putting it together. I'm usually VERY HAPPY with Overstock, but not this time.", 
    "The product fit the purpose for which it was intended perfectly. The finish could have been better but was acceptable.", 
    "So So. No instructions in the box. Phone number to call for missing items was listed on the box but it was \"disconnected.\" I called O and they said they would try to find one and MAIL it to me. Great. Waited over a week to get it and then more for instructions? One of the small pieces on the sides was broken and I had to glue it back together and put a little paint on it to hide the problem. Additionally, there are scratches and a few nicks that were covered up on the wood before it was sent to me. They are noticeable. At least it is real wood and it does look ok.", 
    "The disappointment began with unpacking this item. Faint white splotches were on the finish throughout several pieces. (Since I had the dark finish, they were noticeable.) With elbow grease and some Old English they came off. The next disappointment was three of the five shelves had surfaces heavily scratched. Sure, they won't be seen once I put books on them, but I at least want to be the one to put scratches in the furniture! Overall, it was easy to assemble, but there ought to be a law against a hardened steel hex wrench and the light aluminum screws. Assembly took only 20 minutes (but that doesn't count all the cleaning and polishing I had to do).", 
    "Of course you have to put together. Able to do by myself. Durable, and seems well made product. I got two. Put a lot of books on them and they hold up very well. Will be have to be somewhat carful due to no full back. Would purchase again.", 
    "We tightened the bolts as tight as we could until the wrench gave out and stopped working and the shelf swayed horribly. We ended up buying a new bit set for our power drill and tightened them that way and doesn't sway at all now. There is pretty much no way anyone would be able to tighten them perfectly with the tool it comes with. Other than that, I am happy with the purchase and would buy another.", 
    "One of the holes for the screws was not drilled well and the screw ended up punching through the bottom. It would have been too much effort to return, so I just kept it.", 
    "ordered these some time back and they have been perfect for what I needed. they look good in my home office. very pleased", 
    "Still use this , after many years, to store my towels in bath", 
    "While the product has some superficial flaws (tiny paint imperfections and a couple of rough surfaces), they are real wood, sturdy, functional and very good looking. I bought two of the shelving units for my home office (in black) and they hold numerous books, photos, and various knick-knacks very nicely. I'm very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I have put together 6 different items for our living area and nursery in the past 2 months, and these 2 units were by far the worst in quality and ease of construction. To begin, the color was completely different from the pic and the staining was uneven and it appeared to have some sort of dried glue or something smeared along long swaths of the finish. This was not so noticeable that I was willing to go through the hassle of returning, so I moved on to putting them together. This was awful. Something that should have been easy and straightforward turned into a 4 hour blister inducing ordeal since the screw holes not only did not line up, but were all drilled crookedly and at a fairly steep angle from the horizontal. Once put together they are fairly stable, but not great, look ok. For the price these are absolutely not worth it.", 
    "The (black) bookcase is working well for us. It replaced a larger sofa table piece of furniture and we appreciate the smaller area this bookshelf takes up. It is plain and does not in any way overwhelm our other family room furniture. Books on shelves are in good order and bottom shelf also holds a small music system. So glad we ordered it!", 
    "It is a nice for what I asked for and it is wood. Not the best wood or the worst.", 
    "great bookcase. holds all my photo albums, which are tall and heavy.", 
    "The black was good. The slates holding the books in were a little flimsy and weak. Have to be careful. But the rest is solid and durable.", 
    "Loved that product. It has a solid construction. Holds heavy weight books w/o tipping forward. Wish it was available in more color options, though.", 
    "Overall I am pleased with this bookshelf. It is pretty sturdy and looks good. It's worth the price I paid.", 
    "I bought other bookshelves.that cost more, but by far this is the better one. The quality of the wood is excellent. It is easy to assemble and the final product looks great. I highly recommend this bookshelf.", 
    "The color is a perfect match to the picture. Easy to put together. We added wood glue for\" peace of mind\" stability. Had cover caps for the screws that look good. Thought it might be too small but turned out our books and such fit just right! Best of all it's real wood!! Another great purchase from the big\"O\"!", 
    "A really nice small scale bookcase for my office. I needed something with a little height in a room with only chairs and small tables, but but not too blocky and imposing as some bookcases might be. The open slats on the sides in the craftsman style did the job perfectly, with the openness I needed. And I have now sway loading it with books. If I needed another, I'd certainly order one of these.", 
    "It was REAL WOOD thank goodness! Well built, fairly easy to follow directions, good deal for the money. One problem is the wrong color was delivered, but I kept it instead of going through the bother of returning it and then waiting, hoping someone is home when UPS shows up, etc etc.", 
    "Came in perfect condition and was easy to assemble.", 
    "This is a beautiful piece of furniture. Took all day to assemble it. The Assembly Instructions could be better. But the 6 drawer chest was worth the time spent. It is solid and good looking.", 
    "This is a perfect piece for a small room. It went together very easily for my husband - he did the assembly in less than 2 hours. Very happy with product.", 
    "I ended up keeping this set of shelves because it's a good size, it looks good, and it's pretty sturdy and it was pretty cheap. However, there were a few issues. First, I ordered the one which, in the picture, appears to be birch or maple. It says, \"Cherry,\" but the photo looks like a paler wood, Actually, it's more of a reddish cherry. So if you're looking for a maple color, they don't have it. Second, the top shelf does not have pre-drilled holes, and the structure is such that you need to drill together the top shelf with other parts in order for the whole shelf unit to come together in the end. Because I wasn't equipped to drill holes, I ended up just placing the top shelf on top of the unit (it's not fastened on). If you have a drill and this isn't a big deal, no sweat.", 
    "I was so happy with the bookcase that I ordered another one. Good, solid wood, easy to assemble, and an asset to any room. The shelve spacing is just right. I think I will order one more.", 
    "First of all, this piece is solid wood, not particle board. That is very hard to find these days in anything under $200. It is quite durable and looks nice, I was worried the Cherry would be too light, but it is just fine. This is not a tall bookcase, it is only about 6t ft tall. Shipping was fast and all necessary pieces were included. I would caution that you keep a backup Alan wrench. The one provided quickly wore down and was unusable midway through the project.", 
    "I like this book shielf very much and no problem assembling it . looks good in everyway.", 
    "I love the cherry wood color and the bookcases look really nice. My only regret is that they didn't have 70 inch height, and so these are one shelf shorter. But overall, I'm happy with the bookcases. Highly recommend, but if you want higher it will look a lot better.", 
    "Very pleased with this bookcase. Felt sold and looks like a quality piece of furniture. Put it together very easily by myself with minimum fuss. Highly recommended.", 
    "Good quality solid wood bookcase for my office. Side panels keep books contained. Good price. Functional. Sturdy. Easy assembly.Looks good.", 
    "We put this together in no time. We had a few problems. The ratchet thing it came with got stripped pretty quickly. Luckily we had another one around the house that was the same size. One of the pieces, \"F\" was broken. We called and got a replacement part pretty quickly with not questions asked. Overall, it fits our needs at the time. Not the sturdiest of bookcases, but it's nice.", 
    "These are nice for the price. They feel sturdy, but the finish is not perfect. I wouldn't buy them as a display item in a formal room. They are perfect for stashing books and games in my sons room. They were easy to assemble, but one hex bolt stripped as I was tightening it, and I wasn't able to tighten it all the way and put in the wood plug. Even so, it's still sturdy, and since the sides of mine are hidden by the wall (they were placed in a niche in my son's room) you can't see the missing wood plug.", 
    "A sturdy, strong bookcase that will hold up. No flimsy particle board or laminate.", 
    "It was reasonably easy to assemble (especially the second one, once I knew what I was doing). I had a hard time figuring out which way the shelves go (which side is up) as both options work. I finally figured it out once I was on the last one that has screw holes on only one side. The drawing could have been a bit better; it shows the shelves as symmetric. But all this aside, I am happy. They look very nice and are exactly what I wanted. One of them had a deep gouge on the frame but I figured it'd be too much trouble to send it back, given the shipping weight. They are made in Thailand.", 
    "Item received in good shape. I always worry about wood in the hands of shippers. Assembly was fairly easy and took about 30 minutes to complete. The finish is nice, but buyers who want \"real\" mission won't be happy with this knock-off. It serves its purpose well next to the bed to hold my library of reading materials. The openess of the structure is nice and the back rails prevent books from being pushed beyond the back of the shelf. This is a good, simple bookcase. It won't have the sag problem you get with all the particle board stuff out there and is far lighter to move around than the particle board bookcases that are so common. Thinking about buying the three shelf version for my spouse's beside reading materials. I would rate this a safe buy.", 
    "good piece of furniture. easy to assemble and holds lots of books, the color (Walnut) was darker than I thought it would be, but it still blends with my other Mission furniture well..", 
    "I got the wrong shelf delivered to me. I would recommend the pine one that I ordered as I have one already and I attempted to order another one to create a set, but I got a mahogany colored bookcase instead--which came to me scratched and broken in places. I am not satisfied with this order. I don't drive so I take the risk of ordering online for convenience...I am somewhat skeptical now.", 
    "This bookcase was exactly what I was looking for; even though I didn't realize it at the beginning. When I purchased it, I wasn't that excited about it, but thought it would be functional. When I put it together, I changed my mind. It worked perfectly in my daughter's bedroom. I purchased the walnut finish and it is beautiful.", 
    "I purchased the mission-style solid wood bookcase in cherry. I was amazed at how quickly the bookcase arrived. It was easy to assemble. I did use an electric drill instead of the allen wrench sent with the order. I love this new piece of furniture. I holds a lot books, is sturdy, and is attractive.", 
    "Bookcase was delivered very quickly and left right at my doorstep. My husband assembled it in about 15 minutes. It is sturdy, and exactly as described. My only wish is that it were a little taller, but the height is as stated in the description. Good value for the money.", 
    "Not difficult to put together and the final product is beautiful! Definitely recommend!", 
    "Delivery was on time and without a problem.Assembling the bookcase was simple and took only a short period of time with the only minor problem being that one of the covers for a screw hole was loose but could be fixed by glueing.", 
    "The bookcase was pretty easy to put together and looks very nice. It has a rich cherry color. I think I will most likely end up ordering another.", 
    "This is a very sturdy shelf and was easy to put together. It holds plenty of books and looks great.", 
    "I put this together easily by myself. I was most impressed with the quality and strength. I used it on my porch to hold a 32\" flat screen TV on the top with absolutely no problems. There is no wobble and it is solid! It is elegant looking and one of the best buys I've bought in a long time. I would easily put this in any room in my house.", 
    "This is an excellent buy; the kit is well made and goes to gather like a dream. Beautiful piece of furniture. I am very happy this.", 
    "How many inexpensive bookcases actually are strong enough for books? Not many, but this one is! Go with fiberboard if all you want to do is display little bisque shepherdesses, but if you actually own a giant heap of hardcover books, this is the one for you. It's real wood, nicely designed, and quite attractive if you prefer simple lines. Assembly is easy enough, but easiest for two people working together. Having your own ratchet screwdriver set, rather than using the Allen wrench included with the hardware, speeds things up quite a bit. A rubber mallet also is very helpful. All in all, this bookcase is a terrific value.", 
    "This was an excellent product for a \"put it together yourself\". It is solid wood, not fiber board which is a plus from the start. I put this together myself very quickly and without any fuss. It looks very nice in my son's room.", 
    "I bought four of these bookshelves and am pleased. They look good, are well finished and substantial.Assembly instructions are diagrams only. Take care to out the mantel on right-side up. The top piece has four small pilot holes (not shown in instructions) on the underside. Care must be taken to tighten the screws gradually and in an alternating pattern to get proper fit. I over-torqued a couple of screws and split a shelf.The trickiest part is the first step, fitting the side rails together with dowels. A rubber mallet works well to join the pieces. I used carpenter's glue on the dowels before inserting them.Overall a good product for the price.", 
    "I like the bookcases, they are solid wood like stated. The problem was I was missing 4 screws to put them together and 4 wooden pegs that cover the screws. There was an 800 number to call if you were missing parts but the message said it could not connect to the number. I tried several times with the same results. I had to go to a local hardware store to purchase the screws and wood screw covers to finish assembly.", 
    "This bookshelf is not well made and leans to one side. The holes don't line up correctly so I am not able to tighten the screws more to correct the lean. Overall, I would not buy this product again.", 
    "This is sturdy shelf unit that was not too difficult to assemble. There were a couple of dings in the shelves that were not serious enough to pack the whole thing up and send it back, but were irritating to find and would have prevented me from purchasing it in a store. It's solid wood, which is a plus.", 
    "I bought this bookcase and it's great. I needed a large bookcase to hold all my endless books and this did the trick. It's not made out of cheap wood, but it's very sturdy and holds up nice. You will not be disappointed!", 
    "This was such a great purchase! The bookcase went together with ease (besides the one tool included with the shipment, I found my electric screwdriver helpful, too.) Also bought the short/smaller version of the bookcase. Both shelves look great, hold lots of books and are a great value. A few of the shelves were \"rough\" - not finished very well, but once I got the books on them, you couldn't see it. It was packed VERY well. Although the one side of the box was damaged and a hole was in the side, it didn't get to the wood at all - just the packing! Highly recommend these bookcases! Would buy more, if I had room!", 
    "It deffinitely takes 2 to put this together. It was sturdy and looks great. Lots of storage space.", 
    "This bookcase is solid wood, sterdy, and is quite attractive looking. I assembled it myself, with ease.", 
    "I love this piece, it didn't take long to put it together. It did have a nick on one of the wood shelves but other than that it is a beautiful looking bookcase.", 
    "Elegant bookcase can be displayed in office or elsewhere in the house. Excellent wood quality that would last forever. My only regret was I should have ordered mahogany instead of the natural finish. It didn't match my other office furniture.", 
    "The twins moved home to save money to purchase a house... I was losing the room I had decided was going to be my new crafty room. This book case holds all my books, some supplies and it looks good in our bedroom. Clean and simple, holds books, lots of them.", 
    "I love this piece of furniture. For me it fits a nook entrance to my hallway quite nicely, although it would look good on a flat wall. It really needs two people to assemble, one reason being it is quite heavy. A great price for the quality.", 
    "Easy to assemble, solid and well designed parts. I would be a second but they've run out of the cherry finish.", 
    "This bookshelf really is solid wood, and was perfect for my needs (kids in college took my old, veneer bookcase). Thanks O", 
    "This is a great looking bookcase for the price - we love it. I just went to buy another one in the Cherry finish and was disappointed to see they were out of stock - I'm hoping they get more in soon. My husband put it together very easily in no time at all.", 
    "This is a nice, sturdy bookcase. Assembly is a bit of a pain though (or maybe it's my lack of patience). Go slow and careful with the assembly and you should have an easier experience than I have! :)", 
    "Good value, decent quality. Would recommend two people to assemble - I did it myself, but it took much longer than if I had help. The bookshelf looks very nice. Would purchase again and have recommended to friends.", 
    "Thanks again for quality, durability, and looks. I liked the first one so well; I ordered a second one.", 
    "I really loved this product, the bookcase was much more than what I expected. I've purchased \"self assemble\" furniture from other companies and I found them to be sub-par in quality, workmanship, and ease of assembly. The shelves are very solid and strong, as are the side panels, which surpised me by coming in one piece. The material used was nicely finished and once completed assembled, very sturdy, by this I mean it did not \"wobble\" from side to side. The finished color of the bookcase is darker than showned in the photo, which I pleased with, however, if someone is looking for the exact color shown, they might be disappointed. Although not supplied, I would suggest using white glue for the dowel plug holes, if a person is assembling the product by themselves. You may not need this if more than one person is helping This product was easily worth twice what I paid and I would gladly purchsed other products by this company.", 
    "I found this bookcase to be very nice in appearance and fairly easy to put together. The instructions were easy to follow, which is important! I am considering the purchase of a second bookshelf now that I have seen how nice it is.", 
    "I bought these wooden shelves in the cherry stain. I received them in excellent condition with no damage from shipping. I was able to put it together by myself in about an hour and a half, but I think it would only take 45 minutes with two people. These are all-wood, very high quality shelves. Definitely a quality piece of furniture, and probably the best deal out there for a nice set of shelves. (I shopped around online quite a bit, and these were definitely the best quality for the money, especially because most other sites charge about $30-$40 to ship something this size.) I LOVE them, and would absolutely recommend them. They are simple but very elegant looking and sturdy. Thanks, Overstock! You've really come through for me again!", 
    "I use a cane, the delivery service left this heavy box at the bottom of my ramp on a day that the temp. was over a hundred and five. It took me three tryes to get it in the house. It is as heavy as all get out . if you can't set on the floor to put it together then get an addition set of hands to help you, when finished it is a very nice book shelf, now holding all my cook book collection. The finished wood is well sealed so I have no problem with it in the kitchen.", 
    "I first have to say all the furniture we got from Overstock.com never disappoints. It always represents very good quality and good value. The shipment was reasonably fast. My husband finished assembling the book case using minimal time. It's functional and yet a good decoration to any room. We are such big fans!", 
    "this bookcase is just beautiful. and it goes perfectly with the rest of my mission style bedroom. i bought it for my unicorn collection and they have never looked better. it was so easy to put together only took me about 30 minutes and it was up. the color matches everything else in my room i couldn't be happier.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Good quality for the money. This is solid wood for about the same price as pressed board.", 
    "Great piece, easy to assemble, livens up an otherwise painfully plain room.", 
    "This was just what I was looking for! The open back and sides of the bookcase help keep the look light or airy. I needed a bookcase that could handle binders, and although the shelves are not adjustable, the space was generous enough between all the shelves to accommodate them. Yay! It's easy to put together, but do it with a friend. In a world full of particle board, I appreciate finding a solid wood bookcase that's both attractive and affordable!"
