    "I have purchased several pieces of furniture from Overstock and have always been happy. This was the first disappointing piece. It is very cheap looking, not to mention it was nicked and of poor quality. Tooexpensive for what you get.", 
    "Very nice, HEAVY, piece of furnature! But was disappointed that when the top was placed into position, then it gave way and slammed into the bottom shelf and split it!!! After it was glued back together... No one will ever know what happened...I love Overstock, always has good products!! This one was just a bit shy of perfect....", 
    "Really good quality bookcase for the money. Easy assembly Picture represents product very well. Quick delivery and came in great condition", 
    "Generally I have been very happy with Overstock items, but this is a cheap looking bookcase, fake printed wood, the kind that can be purchased much cheaper at any discount store......", 
    "poor quality for the money. i could have bought better at the dicount store for the same price. missing parts ect.", 
    "This is an attractive sturdy bookcase with a nice permanent finish. It was easy to assemble and all parts fit well. As with other products from Overstock, I am very pleased with the results. I shall continue to order from you.", 
    "I thought it was good quality for the price. It is sturdy and is just what I needed for my boys bedroom for all their books. Thanks.", 
    "Overstock provided fine service, and the bookcase is as described, however the item arrived with minor damage due to the lack of protection during shipping....a few more pieces of styrofoam and there would have been no pblm! Very dissappointing but not enough damage to return it. Easy assembly and a good basic shelf with the typical pressboard/laminate finish...you are getting what you pay for ( in a good way). Enjoy.", 
    "We finally assembled our two bookcases. We are extremely pleased with the ease of assembly and their look. It only took us 15-20 minutes after we checked all the parts.They are in the guest room above the garage and fit perfectly. I can't say enough about how nice they look.", 
    "Just what I was looking for, the right color and size. Of took about an hour to put together. Only need a little help when putting the two sides together, other than that, only one person can do it mostly by themselves.", 
    "This book shelf was darker than I expected. We bought a night stand with this to go in the same room together. I was disappointed that the color was much darker than the picture. It was almost as it they sent the wrong one. I could not tell the color from the invoice.", 
    "What you see is what you get. I personally was very pleased with the quality and ability to quickly put it together.", 
    "I expected a little better quality for the price but it arrived in good condition and on time. It fits nicely in my home office. The color was as expected and I am pretty satisfied with it.", 
    "Sturdy bookcase with a nice appearance. Assembly is typical difficulty.", 
    "Best Price. Bookshelf Looks great. Easy Assembly. Very Cheap Manufacturing. Delivered with minor scratches and scuffs. Most did not show much after assembly. Over all worth it.",

    "Very nice piece for the price. Bought for a child's room, matches well enough with the natural finish furniture. Adjustable shelves and not to difficult to assemble.", 
    "Very pleased with the bookcase - looks nice and very sturdy. Takes 2 people to assemble, but not difficult (screwdriver & hammer). My 14-yr old son and I put it together in under an hour.",
