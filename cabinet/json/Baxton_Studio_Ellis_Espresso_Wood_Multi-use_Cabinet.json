    "I needed a shoe cabinet and this one fit the bill as far as the right dimensions for my space. It took over an hour to put together and was fairly complicated. To my dismay, it looks and feels cheap. $*** for this is way, way too over-priced for this item. $** would have been a good deal for this. I'm not going to pay the shipping charges to send it back. I would have been better off getting something from *******.", 
    "perfect for what i bought it for ,looks good an was easy to put together", 
    "Perfect price and quality for what i bought it for. I got it to store dvd/cd's in family room. Looks more expensive that it is.", 
    "This shoe cabinet looks nice in our entryway, but the material is very cheap. Even when taking it out of the box, the legs already have cracks and chipped wood on them that we had to glue back on. Not all that easy to put together; took me a good hour to get everything put together.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for shoe storage in one of my entryways. It is a particle board cabinet with no solid back piece. Beware that it comes with just enough pieces-no extras-a lot of small parts. I could not use one of the screws for one of hinges because there were no grooves in the top. Overall, it worked well for a family gathering and the beveled doors add a touch of class to my room."
