    "I have purchased many items from overstock and have always been happy with the products and customer service. We were looking for a small cabinet to provide storage and counter space in our guest bathroom. While putting it together, the screws split the cheap particle board. The doors to not match up exactly in the front, they are crooked. And the cabinet just had an awful smell that was so strong we had to put it outside for a couple days. I was disappointed in the quality for the price paid, but it is too much hassle to return and we had guests coming.", 
    "I put this together by myself and it was prettier than I imagined. I saw this and couldn't decide if I wanted to spend that kind of money but after seeing what was out there for $69.00 and $79.00 I decided that I would try it. So glad I did! I have this in my master bath which is a Parisian theme and it just adds thst class I was looking for. Wish I could add a picture here for all to see.", 
    "The cabinet looks great for the price i paid. was very easy to put together less than 30 minutes. instructions are very easy. overall very pleased with the product. this little detail on the cabinet door gives a lot of character and looks very unique.", 
    "Color is so dark is can be called black. I was disappointed with the color but overall the cabinet is sturdy and easy to put together.", 
    "We got this cabinet to store personal items in an office bathroom. It works great for that. Perfect for a small storage cabinet in an area that does not get heavy use. Please note the dimensions... it is a small cabinet. Easy to put together.", 
    "This is not strong enough to use for heavy items. I am using this as clothing cabinet for child. It works good.", 
    "I did orfer 2 of these cabinets and placed them side by side in my family room. They look great and do provide all the extra storage space that I was looking for. the gentleman who put them together said that the instructions were accurate and all pieces were enclosed in the packaging. They are true black and just what I expected and wanted for my needs. The 2 of them do look good side by side.", 
    "This cabinet is beautiful, sturdy and fairly easy to assemble. It looks gorgeous in my house! Great item for a good price!", 
    "It is a very dark brown, thats exactly what I was looking for, not difficult to assemble and perfect for small storage items. Very happy with this purchase, think I might purchase another one.", 
    "I needed a tall cabinet for my bathroom to store towels and toiletries and this cabinet was perfect. I bought two of them so I could stack one on top of the other. I assembled them myself, only I didn't put the legs on one of them. My husband bolted them together and they look fabulous! I now have double the storage.", 
    "Easy to assemble use it in the bathroom for morestorage", 
    "Easy to put together Color a chocloate black - wish it were black black Very light weight - so dont use to store heavy items in Overall a good fit for what I needed", 
    "What a beautiful cabinet ,it matches our bedroom suite perfectly. I found it very easy to assemble . I absolutely love it", 
    "Very good purchase and was easy to assemble", 
    "I needed a bathroom cabinet that was not very deep. This was perfect. It arrived promptly. I put it together without any husbandly help. It is up and functioning. Great.", 
    "Top is hard to clean it alway shows smudge marks and it stinks.", 
    "Very nice for the price, only wish was that it had hidden door hinges. Nice detail and I love the dark brown color.", 
    "We're enjoying this small cabinet as extra storage in our bathroom. It's super easy to put together and looks great for the price. We wanted something inexpensive yet nice looking and this cabinet fits that requirement perfectly!", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for my master bath. I store extra towels, TP, etc in it and it works really well? It pretty simple to put together. I did it myself and it looks great in my bathroom.", 
    "Solid construction and smooth swing doors. Lots of space! More black than dark brown", 
    "Really nice piece of furniture. Very easy to put together, and the price was right!", 
    "I got this to go in my bathroo to store towels and toiletries and it's very pretty and elegant. Just the right size, even though I was afraid it would be too small. I folded the towels a little differently to make the fit and it works out great. Great value", 
    "I put this cabinet together by myself in less than an hour. The doors on the front were a little tricky to do alone, I could have used an extra hand to hold the door in place while trying to screw in the tiny screws for the hinges. But I managed.I'm impressed that the back panels are solid and come in two interlocking pieces rather than the flimsy folded cardboard other cabinets have. It was packaged well (lots of styrofoam) and not damaged or scratched. All in all, a solid piece.It is a little smaller than listed and the interior space is even smaller than that since the measurements are for the outside of the piece. Note that it has little legs and a lip on the top panel - those are included for the exterior dimensions.You may not be able to fit items larger than 12 inches deep inside the cabinet so just keep that in mind.However, it is perfect for my needs and is beautiful - it looks much more expensive than it was. It has a slight odor, but, much like a \"new car smell\" it doesn't bother my sensitive nose.", 
    "Very pleased with the color, size and over all look of the cabinet. Sturdy construction. I'm using it to store cook books. Would recommend to others.", 
    "Doesn't look or feel cheap at all.. Sturdy.. Just make sure you put the sides on in the correct direction :)", 
    "Very pretty cabinet. Nice finish. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "bought this for my husbands shop bathroom for storage for the bathroom basics. looks great and was well worth the money.", 
    "Love the cabinet but scratches easy. Be careful.", 
    "I bought two of these for bedside cabinets and put them together in about 30 minutes (watching TV) just following the directions. All the pieces are numbered, which makes it super simple. Much sturdier than I expected for the price. I'm very happy with the cabinet.", 
    "well satisfied.......very sturdy materials. Nice smooth finish.Color just as expected. Quite easy to assemble with little difficulty.", 
    "THIS WAS AGREAT SURPRISE , I WAS LOOKING FOR MY ENTRYWAY A SHOE CLOSET AND SAW THIS IN BATHROOM STORAGE.THIS IS SUCH A NICE PIECE OF FURNITURE . IT S HIGH QUALITY WOOD PRODUCT EASY TO ASSEMBLE IN LESS THAN I HOUR.THE DESIGN AND BORDER DECOR IS SPECTACULAR I AM SO HAPPY WITH IT SHOES FIT GREAT ! THE COLOR IS TRUE TO COLOR ESPRESSO JUST A TAD BIT LIGHT ER WHICH TURNED OUT GREAT", 
    "Serves my purpose but very flimsy", 
    "This is great looking unit and easy to put together, this unit arrived in pristine condition not a scratch or scuff. color is nice but don't order it if you have other black furniture it wont look right and remember it is very small unit it would look out of place in large room. I though it was a little over priced for its size. You can get larger units for the same or less money.", 
    "I truly love this product, but as I was looking for something else just yesterday, I came across this same exact product for $ on another website, was very upset being that everything I order is always from Overstock so now will to have check other sites in the future, but do love the unit.", 
    "The cabinet was shipped extremely fast. I was pleasantly surprised at the speed in which I received it. It didn't take very long to assemble and it went very smoothly. The cabinet is perfect for the spot I choose it to be in.", 
    "This has to be completed put together which can be time consuming. The instructions it came with were good. All you need is a screwdriver. It looks good and is exactly what I wanted.", 
    "I am very happy with the cabinet. The instructions were very clear making putting it together a breeze.", 
    "smaller then I thought especially for the price,, quality good but again for price should be better", 
    "When the box arrived it had a pretty large hole in it and was very damaged, I was expecting the insides to be just as bad but it really wasn't. There were some light scratches on some of the panels and a little crack on one. All of the damage was on the inside of the cabinet so I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it and once it was all put together you couldn't tell. I am happy with the cabinet over all, its very light and I believe its particle board so I wouldn't recommended it you are looking for a super nice durable cabinet but I think its great for the price.", 
    "Check quality control. There was a scrape on the finish that wasn't caused by shipping. Since it's not very visible where we put the cabinet, we decided to keep it. The size and color are exactly what we needed and is a perfect match to our vanity. The assembly directions are pretty clear and took about 45 minutes for 2 of us. We also got the matching medicine cabinet and placed it directly on top rather than hang it on the wall. The overall appearance is of one unit.", 
    "This is a very nice piece of furniture.", 
    "Fits perfectly in my foyer.", 
    "It's fashionable and portable.", 
    "Used this in my sons room. Love the way it looks!"
