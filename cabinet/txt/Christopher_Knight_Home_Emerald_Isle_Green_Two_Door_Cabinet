You may become adrift in the deep Emerald Isle green of the burl veneer doors, but this two-door cabinet will not be lost in any room. Dramatically set off by silver leafing, the doors are adorned with an oversized circular handle, and open to revel two interior shelves for storage â€“ as if the look alone were not enough.
