    "I use the chair for about 9 hours a day, 5 days a week and I find it to be a very comfortable chair. Great chair for the price.", 
    "Great chair, perfect size, easy to put together. Very happy with this chair.It's not too big like other office chairs. It's just right.", 
    "I am very pleased with the chair because my back ache is gone. I like the different ways I can adjust the height, forward/bacward, arm rests...etc. This allows for change of position when one has been too long at the computer. I very much like the sober, modern design because it fits nicely with the rest of the furniture ( my office corner is in my bedroom). Finally, it was not difficult to assemble, light enough to move around yet sturdy enough to swivel freely. Also the casters are extremely movable, absoutely multi directional. Thank you also for giving a regular customer an additional discount. Shipping as ususal was very prompt. Kim", 
    "This is my best purchase on overstock so far, i sit on my chair all day and this is so comfortable so adjustable its just amazing!", 
    "I'm very happy with my chair purchase. It is very comfortable. It has a nice firm seat and a supported back. It adjusts 3 different ways to accommodate a persons needs. It was easy for one person to put together. The only issue that I do have with the chair is the arm height. The arms are adjustable but I didn't measure the height of my desk so the arms at the lowest position are still a little too hight to fit under the desk to push the chair in all the way. I would still recommend this chair to others I'd just make sure they measure all the angles.", 
    "Great chair!!! The only problemo was that I realized that certain members of my team in my office can't sit in it (weight limit 250) which isn't a problem for me, but I felt sad having to forbid certain people from using my chair. Actually I was happy too as I didn't want anyone else sitting in it! I want to keep it perfect!!! I love it so much!!!! thank you overstock, no longer will my rear end hurt at the end of the day. the way I can tilt it too, it seems to take pressure off my feet. Really a great deal, can't believe the quality for the price. It was scary purchasing a chair without sitting in it first, but I'm very glad there were so many reviews. Hope mine helps someone make the decision to go for it. FYI I'm female, about 5-6\" and about 150 pounds. I wear heels a lot so I love that I can adjust the chair very easily, according to my daily footwear. Makes it extremely easy to get up and down easily. Glides like a dream. I sat in literally every chair at staples and none of their chairs were this comfy, really. I like the smallish footprint of it, too. It's not ginormous, but feels like it's made for a king :)", 
    "After 3 months the hydraulic piston has failed and wont stay at the desired elevation.", 
    "Easy to put together and is adjustable to a perfect fit", 
    "Mind you my rating is based on the overall quantity and the price I paid for this product. The best thing I like about purchasing from O is the quality of service I receive. Somehow every product I purchase from O seems to require a contact to Customer Service, which for most part is a negative experience for most of us. However, my experience with O has always been very positive. They go to extreme lengths to make sure I am satisfied. I did have to call for this product too.Now the long story, I noticed the box delivered was semi damaged shape. While unpacking, I saw a small broken piece of plastic, I could not find where it could have been broken off until I assembled the chair and noticed the back support would not stay on the height I wanted it to. Back support would slide all the way down no matter how tight I made the nob to. I am sure at times so many folks handling the shipping, it could have easily been broken anywhere from the start. Contact to Customer Service online, and 5 minutes later they sent me shipment confirmation to the part that is broken (control mechanism), no questions asked. Now that is called a great Customer Service. They even followed up with another email few days later. Otherwise, I really like the chair. I like how it feels, and is very comfortable to sit for extended period of time. I have some back pain issues, and was hesitant to buy a chain online (without trying). This chair thus far has been very good.", 
    "I was replacing a chair from Office Depot that the vinyl had ripped - so I went looking for a seat made of a woven material. I wanted something economical, ergonomically helpful and with lots of adjustment ability. This chair had a few of those features, but it is very stiff and uncomfortable and, in my opinion, cheaply made. To pay over $ for a chair it should be comfortable - my home office is my life. If you are looking for basic, not every day use for the chair, I guess it would be ok. But if you really USE your chair and desk, this is not the purchase. I would have sent back, but I recycled the box after I put it together, so I was unable to ship it back. I'm looking for a new chair already!! So sad!!", 
    "This chair is very comfortable. The various adjustments make it easy to fit to my body style. I am only 5' 2\" so that is very important to me. the only thing that doesn't fit perfectly is the arms. I have them I just did as close to the seat as possible and they are still too wide to support my arms while typing.", 
    "The product we received had a manufacturer's defect but Overstock was great and exchanged the product for us. Overall, it was a good price for the quality of chair. I wish the back were taller though.", 
    "I got it in a week after the order. It came packaged very nicely. The instructions were simple and easy to put it together in 15 min flat and start to use it. I use it for about 10 hours everyday to work from home and there is no backache - yay!", 
    "I managed to put this chair together with ease in a reasonable amount of time. The wheels were difficult for me to snap in but a neighbor did it for me. I'm 71 years old so there are some things that I need help with. Overall it is a great chair. I have to sit a lot with work so the support is great. I would suggest this chair to anyone who sits for long periods of time.", 
    "I bought 4, then 2 more. They are just what I wanted for our software developers and sales staff. The adjustability is what is really helpful.", 
    "I bought this chair for it's design and the positive reviews I had read. It is a fine chair and would probably buy another if the need arises. One thing I must note however is that the chair does not lower down to a small size desk, so keep in mind that this may not be for shorter sized persons, other than that it is a superior value!", 
    "This is a good chair and a definite upgrade on my last one. Started working from home, so needed a chair I could sit in longer. This one is comfortable and easy to sit in. I like the adjustable arms. Good for the money. The only issue I have is the back keeps adjusting down even though I have tightened it several times.", 
    "Not as comfortable as needed for prolonged use/", 
    "The chair is definitely ergo. But i feel its a bit pricey for what it is. The side handles feel a bit cheap...overall an average buy.", 
    "seat gradually drifts down most of the time", 
    "Great chair - I must have misunderstood the diagram of the tilting mechanism. The illustration made it appear that the seat would tilt towards the front AND the back. That is why I bought it - it only tilts to the back. Was quite disappointed as I need to tilt forward to ease circulation in my legs.", 
    "I had to replace a worn out computer chair. I compared many before I bought this one. This has adjustable arm rests which I needed. Most are made for long armed men but this fits me. The seat has a lot of cushion so if you sit in the chair for long periods of time you will appreciate it. It was easy to assemble. I highly recommend this chair.", 
    "adjusts to many positions -- my back doesnt hurt at the end of the day", 
    "I've invested in some nice high end leather office chairs, only to have them used as clawing and chew toys by my sweet kitty whose life I saved by taking him from the SPCA. He doesn't grasp the concept of having one's life saved any better than he does \"don't claw the damn chair\". Of course, if you had a brain the size of a large walnut, you'd keep clawing that leather chair too. I just bought this chair instead of sacrificing another cow's hide. This one he prefers to sleep on rather than clawing. Those obligate carnivores won't change.The arms seem a little cheap, but other than that, the chair is quite adjustable and comfy, even for a short person (5'3\"\")", 
    "Excellent chair! Simple to put together, also.", 
    "I purchased this for my son to use at work. He is sitting in it for hours every day, and really likes it. I got a pad for underneath it, so it is easy to move around when needed.", 
    "I am a petite built person and I have purchased several different chairs for work, I sit for long periods of time. Most are always too big and just can't get them to fit me causing much back pain after the day. Just got this chair based on reviews and it is a perfect chair so far. Hope this helps", 
    "lacks lumbar support but great chair and easy to assemble", 
    "Purchased for my son who he had specific criteria; wanted a chair with arms that are adjustable, seat to adjust to accommodate a 6'4 tall person. He spends hours setting in it computer gaming and loves the comfort.", 
    "I used these for the shop and the guys love them.. sturdy and easy to clean", 
    "I bought this for my home office occasional use chair and it's become my favorite place to sit! Fully adjustable all angles and arms, was able to fit my 6'3\", 240lbs just right!", 
    "The chair is made of good quality materials for the most part. It does have adjustments usually found on more expensive chairs and so far they work. It is easy to assemble however the instructions are a pretty sorry excuse for directions, but it isn't very hard to figure out how to assemble it. It only took maybe 15-20 minutes to assemble from unpackaging to finish. I am retired and use this chair in my man cave, I sit in it several hours a day, surfing the web and playing video games, reloading ammo and working at my table/bench. It is comfortable for me and I can change adjustments if I wish. So far I have only been using it a couple of weeks and haven't experienced the seat height cylinder leaking like some people have, it is early yet so I will add onto this if it does start. That is an issue with a great many of these chairs and I had a $700 at my desk when I was still working and after a year it starting sinking down, so I think they all are susceptible to this.", 
    "This did not take very long to put together and really seems pretty sturdy. Very nice looking. The only thing I regret is the arm rests. When I picked it up to move it to her house, one of the arms broke off and there is no way to fix it. Overall , worth the price.", 
    "Brought this as a gift for my husband. He just loves it. It's comfortable, and fits his back needs very well", 
    "For disabled or able bodied people, the 5 different options allow everyone to be comfortable.", 
    "Loved the first one so much I bought a second one. Very easy to assemble", 
    "Good heavy duty chair. Love it for its adjustability. Assembly instructions aren't great , but easy to assemble nonetheless.", 
    "Excellent buy and the chair is great for my office.", 
    "nice chair, very comfortable, great construction", 
    "very easy to assemble, very nice piece of furniture, so comfortable to sit on", 
    "I work from home, and this is a great chair to sit in all day. The seat is very comfortable, and it was easy to assemble. Great chair for the price. I would highly recommend.", 
    "Very comfortable chair that has a clean/modern look. My husband loves it!", 
    "Comfortable chair. Overall Good not Great. Now we'll see how it holds up.", 
    "I bought this as a surprise for my husband and he is very happy with it. The back is a little higher than many chairs we have tried, the double casters allow the chair to easily move around his home office space. A great purchase.", 
    "Good chair for the price. Easy to put together and nice ergonomic features. The chair however does not go down as far as you would expect. We needed to buy furniture risers to lift up the desk so the chair arms can fit with the keyboard try.", 
    "That was my gift to my husbands birthday. He loves it. Very comfy and nice looking.Thank you!", 
    "Is a good chair for short times I use it. Had difficulty in assembling it that was not satisfied by seller or Overstock. The slot the back support fit into had a piece of plastic in it. I had to disassemble the screw device that allows adjustment of height of chair back so it the chair back support would go into it and them reassemble it. It works now, but Overstock or the seller should have taken care of that for me. The seat cushion a lot to be desired it is not very plush and if I were to have to set in it for long times, I would add a removable seat cushion for added comfort.", 
    "LIKED IT SO WELL WE ORDERED 3!", 
    "I often work from home and was looking for a sturdy and comfortable chair, similar to the one I use when in the office. This chair was easy to assemble and has delivered on my expectations in the 7+ months that I have used it.", 
    "I love the versatility -- can adjust three ways. Looks great and is very comfortable offering great back support.", 
    "The adjustable levers never worked right for me. I tried fixing it several times. Overall, it was not a ver comfortable chair. It was not difficult to assemble.", 
    "I am at my home office desk for at least 8 hours a day or more. This is not a comfy chair.", 
    "Overall it's ok. The mesh on the back stretches quickly and the armrests like to \"self adjust\" down in the middle of work. Overall it serves it's purpose though.", 
    "I bought this for a home office (to use wihle I'm working on my masters) and love it. It's comfortable, affordable, light-weight, and stylish.", 
    "VERY comfortable. I need a chair with support, like a task chair. This is a good looking, very affordable option.", 
    "The bottom legs just kind of broke and shattered after a few months. I'm not over the weight limit or anything, just sub par plastic.", 
    "Chairs, went together easy, very comfortable and look great.", 
    "it has lasted us more than any other chair so far.. it's sturdy, confortable and easy to fit anywhere.. fully recommend!", 
    "Love this chair! Very comfortable and wheels roll very very well!", 
    "I bought this for my wife to use when she got on our 2nd computer, which isnt very often or for very long i'd say 3-4 times a week totaling a couple hours total. The chair was comfortable for both her and me but it recently broke the left arm when she was re positioning herself in the chair and used the arm to scoot herself deeper into the chair. She only weighs 110lb so she has no real strength or weight for any serious damage. a super disappointment to a office space that looked nice and presentable to ghetto station ******* in the room.", 
    "I work from home and needed something that I could sit in comfortably for eight hours a day. This chair does not disappoint. It's super-comfortable and supportive, and practically every part of it is adjustable. And super reasonably priced.", 
    "Comfortable, choose the way you want to sit, back support, nice padding for sitting, an hour pastes by fast with stress, chair will fit to the way you like to sit with little effort, rolls with a little push of the foot. Very nice for when a long day at the desk.", 
    "Not quite as comfortable as I'd hoped.", 
    "Noisy and an uncomfortable chair. Mesh doesn't support your lumbar at all.", 
    "great size, back and arms comfortable, seat is a bit hard for long term/daily use.", 
    "When I first saw this office chair, I mainly was looking for a comfortable chair that is not going to break down on me in a year. You can get a lot of cheaper chairs at different retailers, but they will usually break down in a year or two from just sitting in the chair without anything special happening to it. This has very cushion and the hand rails along with the adjustments made my decision very easy to invest in a great chair. ** I did not think it would be great in the beginning, but it was easy to put together and felt good and comfortable. I am able to relax in my office now even though I have a back injury. Thank you OVERSTOCK!!!", 
    "Chair was pretty easy to assemble has adjustments that I wanted and is , in my opinion, a very good value!", 
    "Not as comfortable as my other mesh-backed chair, but the adjustments are good and it is good enough.", 
    "Excellent value, chair cushion makes sitting on this all day a breeze.", 
    "good chair comfortable and good price", 
    "I will never buy YOUR chairs Only one worked its at the office.......the one for home I had to return twice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "very solid chair and very comfortable", 
    "Like chair very much. Not to challenging to put together even though I had my husband help. My husband works 2 days a week at home so the chair does get added use. He likes the comfort level and the options in adjusting for height and seating comfort. The price on this chair is also very comfortable. We are pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Poorly made. Not assembled as it says in the description.", 
    "I originally got a defective chair with a broken piece preventing me from putting it together. The second chair came and was fine for a while, but a month or so later, the right arm broke off. It didn't come part, it literally broke in half. The chair itself is nice but the plastic is really flimsy.", 
    "Fantastic chair for someone petite. Easily adjusted so your back is against the back of the chair and your feet are touching the floor. I am 5'1\" and struggle to find chairs. So happy with my purchase. Easy to put together without household tools. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "Nice chair, comfortable... kinda a pain to put together but not too bad. Arrived damage but customer care took care of it for me.", 
    "Nice solid, simple mesh back chair as ordered. No problems and quick delivery", 
    "We ordered this chair for my husband's home office. He is now working from home so sits in it 10-12 hours a day. He loves it! Says it is comfortable and well worth the price. It arrived quickly, was well packed, took a little time for him to put it together, but overall an A+.", 
    "Our family of \"smaller-than-average\" people loves this chair. We also like the fact that it's \"breathable\" and lightweight.", 
    "Chairs are fine for the price. We did have 2 out of 4 come in damaged, but Overstock took care of it immed. and we are now enjoying all 4 chairs.", 
    "I received the chair on Wednesday evening October 8th and today will be my first day of using the chair. Overall the chair is nice and comfortable for the price which is extremely good. The only complaint that I have I which I could lower the arms on the chair and they are hard plastic no cushion.", 
    "This chair was easy to assemble, and is remarkably sturdy - perfect for my new office!", 
    "I settled on this chair after a good 3 week search for a good quality and reasonably priced office chair; for some long and late night work/study sessions. This chair is comfortable and can be customized with the 3 lever adjustments provided. The mesh back offers firm - good support with good air circulation to keep the back comfortable. I only ordered one to try it out before ordering a second unit. Assembly was quick and easy as well. I am now in the process of placing a request for a secound chair.", 
    "I ordered two of these chairs and set up is easy. It didn't take me long to put together for a female in my 50s. I have been searching for a chair that would be comfortable since I work from home without paying too much money. I definitely would recommend this chair to anyone. Don't pay a lot of money for an ergonomic chair. It's just as comfortable as the over price chairs at my office.", 
    "Easy assemble. Good product. The delivery is also on time.", 
    "We purchased 6 of these chairs for our small nonprofit office and they are perfect for our needs: ergonomic, easy to assemble, easy to use, low cost. We've had them for over a year and have had no issues. They look great and are ergonomically comfortable for long work-days. Highly recommend this chair!", 
    "This chair is equal to the comfort and quality of another office chair we purchased for significantly more. Once again, O has exceeded my expectations. Would highly recommend this chair to anyone.", 
    "Great chair so far, arrived quickly. Easy assembly. Simply takes some common sense to put up. Perfect for home.", 
    "I received my chair last week, and unfortunately, one of the arm rests was broken. The plastic is really strong attaching the arm rest to the chair, though, so I believe this was not the manufacturers fault, but mostly likely the way in which it was transported. Thankfully, it was taken care of quickly by Overstock. So overall, this was a fantastic purchase. I'm really happy with it and I'd say it's well worth the money. Really comfortable- and I sit 8 hrs/ day at the office.", 
    "The chair was shipped super quick. I was excited to get a new chair and didn't pay attention to the screw sizes and the instructions. Had to take them out and follow the instructions carefully. The chair fits perfectly under the desk. Love the mesh back. If I had one thing to compare this chair with my old chair it is this: I can lean back in the new chair and the seat-back always stays in the upright position. No more back problems!", 
    "Sturdy and well constructed. Very easy to put together. Instructions were lacking but not really necessary.", 
    "Wow! This chair is incredible.The price was great, easy to put together and was shipped fast. You won't find a better value!! Highly recommended.", 
    "THIS IS A SHABBY AND SHODDY PRODUCT....THE PACKING THAT IT CAME IN WAS JUST\"THROWN INTO\" THE BOX. THE SEAT, UNDERSIDE, HAD DEFINITELY BEEN USED BEFORE. THERE WERE RIPPED PARTS (PLASTIC). FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY CHARGED (169.00) IT WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE AT 69.00 CONSIDERING THE LACK OF QUALITY. BUYER BEWARE", 
    "get what you pay for, the seat is not as sturdy as i would like, creaks a lot after a couple of weeks. the adjustments are okay. not really worth getting if you looking for added adjustments over a more expensive chair.", 
    "chair was easy to assemble but the directions don't really help as it's pictures only. didn't take long and chair is comfortable", 
    "This chair had great reviews so I thought I'd give it a try. It was easy to assemble. However, the mesh on the back and seat on the chair had an oily residue on it which made me not want to use the chair. The arms don't go low enough and the back doesn't stay close enough to the seat. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. I'm used to sitting on a very expensive chair at the office and this one didn't measure up.", 
    "I bought this chair as a gift and my son really seems to like it.", 
    "This chair is a great chair at any price but is especially great at the overstock price. I purchased the chair for my wife to use while working at a computer. It has greatly helped her back and leg pain associated with long periods if sitting.", 
    "We needed to replace some of our outdated office chairs, so I picked 2 types, the East Ends Articulate Back and the Ergo Mesh High Back and let staff test them out to decide which one they wanted. 3 out of 10 liked this one. I just put in a re-order for 2 more. It wasn't that difficult putting it together - all the parts and tools necessary came with the chair.", 
    "Like the chair, can sit in it for hours....., best chair I ever bought, even watch tv in it.", 
    "this desk chair is very comfortable. the sizing is great! I have it in my living room and it doesn't take over the room. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "This is a nice chair for the price. It is easy to put together and has lots of features including the tilt lock of the chair back. Once thing we didn't realize was that on the seat cushion (which is a little bit stiff) there is a raised part in the middle front so my husband tends to not like sitting in this chair because of that but I love it. Overall it is great!", 
    "We ordered this chair for two employees. They like them so much that we ordered two more. Everyone thinks they are very comfortable and they appreciate all the adjustable areas.", 
    "simply incomfortable. All the adjustments won't help either.",
