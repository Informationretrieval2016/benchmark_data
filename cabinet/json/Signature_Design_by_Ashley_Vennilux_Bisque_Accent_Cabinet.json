    "It was easy to assemble the 3 piece cabinet. Doors and glass already attached. The back just slid in. 7 screws only and you don't need your own tools. The only difference in the picture and the actual piece is the top being slightly more on the grey than brown as it appeard to me online. I still love it and am keeping it!"
