    "Great buy. Easy to install and works great in our home!", 
    "This wine rack looks great on our wall. As shown in the picture, the wine goes in upside down and the bottles, depending on their shape, may or may not stand vertically. That is, the wire closures you slip the bottle neck into are big to accommodate all wine bottles, so it's a loose fit. The colors are nice and earthy. Wall anchors seems study. Wine rack is made of very light metal. Overall, I love it!", 
    "I actually own 3 of these and we have created a \"wine wall\". The colors are more muted, which I really like. Goes well with our oil rubbed bronze light fixture. I am a bit of an artsy personality so I like this \"functional\" art work, 3 dimensional vibe.", 
    "This was a gift for my husband a few years ago and he still looooovveeeess it.", 
    "every loves it always the topic of conversation. I have it for 3 years in excellent condition", 
    "awesome on the wall and super different", 
    "I was afraid the colors would not blend in the spot I had picked out for this but it turns out they are almost too muted/dark on my corner wall. That said, everyone that comes into my dining room comments on the neat wine rack. We have solved part of the problem by choosing to display bottles with a brighter wine label. Was a little tricky to hang and the hubby had to try twice to get it to hang straight. Overall sweet purchase!", 
    "This is a nice item but the colors are no where near as nice as what is indicated in description. You can barely nice the colors. I still like it but would have liked it like it is shown.", 
    "I received my wine rack and have hung it on my dining room wall. It does have some indentations or dents around the edges, but this gives it a bit of a rustic look and isn't very noticeable unless your looking up close. I think that the small dents may have occurred during the welding process. The color was a little disappointing, it isn't true to the image or description. the entire rack is very dark, very little color difference between the slats. However, it still looks nice.", 
    "Love the wine rack but wish it held the bottles upright instead of upside down. So we just flip them around and set them in there carefully so that the labels can be read right. Pretty colors, goes well with our decor.", 
    "Color is different in person then picture. It looks darker in person then on the pictures.", 
    "This is a very cool looking piece! The colors are dark earthy tones (dark green, maroonish) and go really well with my newly remodeled kitchen/dining area. After adding the wine bottles to this, it looks awesome. I think we will get a lot of compliments once we start entertaining in our new area. Overstock had the best price around so I jumped on it. Got additional discount off and used my O dollars so my final cost was $X.XX. Very happy about that, especially considering that it was going for double in another store! What a deal!", 
    "Too plain - was hoping for more color...............", 
    "We purchased 2 of these wine racks to use behind our dinning table and it was a total HIT. We love the way it looks, the quality is excellent and it arrived promptly. This definitely a beautiful piece for the home and we have received numerous compliments.", 
    "colors so muted that it looked brown and black....both times i ordered it...sent them back", 
    "The colors of this wine write is very different from the picture. I was expecting bright colors of red, yellow and green. The panels were so dark, the colors are almost indistinguishable. The framd was also bent when some dents on one of the panel. Poor quality. Returned item.", 
    "i was a little dissapointed in the colors the picture shows that there is a wide amount of colors and the one I recieved had very little color differences.", 
    "I really enjoy this wine rack. The previous reviews give a very accurate description of product, I would suggest reading these. The rack weighs very little, yet seems very sturdy. Went to home improvement store and bought tougher hanging screws than the cheap ones provided. Very easy to hang, just make careful measurements for screws. Quick shipping, no damage. I receive many compliments on rack. Enjoy!", 
    "The wine rack is very good although it is made of sheet metal so you do have to be careful not to bend it.", 
    "Great addition to my kitchen. Came with a dent though. Common Overstock!", 
    "This piece of functional wall art looks great on my dining room wall. The colors are perfect and we've received so many compliments on it.", 
    "I like the way this looks in the house. I was a little worried about the way it mounts to the wall with only two screws, but so far I have not have any trouble with it. It adds a nice, unique way to display your wine bottles as well as an artistic flair that other may not have.", 
    "This is a great way to display some nice bottles of wine. The colors are cool and neutral and would work in many different rooms. It serves more as a decorative piece that a true wine rack. Plus, if you mix and match your wine lables, it stand out more. While it is a lighter piece, there's no concern that it will fail to hold full bottles of wine. Overall, very please with it. We've had many compliments on it.", 
    "Everyone loves it. We love it to.we like to change out the wines with unique wine bottles also.", 
    "I was pleased with it however there is several dents in it but it is too much of a hassle for me to return it so I chose to keep it. It is nice though. It serves it's purpose and is decorative.", 
    "if you like quality this is not for u! returned it and had to pay $XX for shipping...what a waste of $$", 
    "I love this rack. I have a Tuscan theme going in my kitchen and this fits right in. I love the fact that the bottles are stored upside down and instead of being just a wine rack it is actually more like a piece of artwork.", 
    "This is exactly what I wanted for my kitchen. Looks great and holds the wine well.", 
    "I placed this in my dining room. product looks ok. kind of cheap but does the job.", 
    "I absolutely LOVE this piece! It is in my dining room and can be seen when you walk in the house. I have gotten a ton of compliments on it.", 
    "The item was very well packaged, and it looks great on the wall of our dining room. It is very stylish, modern-chic, and above all, sturdy. I love it.. it will add sophistication in any room!", 
    "Cant wait to get it o n the wall once my replacement arrives (with BOTH pre-driled holes) other than that...this is a MUST buy! It matched the colors in my dining room perfectly!", 
    "Wonderful way to display wine. So unique! Everyone who visits comments on it and asks where to order one! Sturdy metal design, easy to hang and looks fabulous. As one reviewer said, \"it's just cool\"...I ordered and it arrived at my doorstep 2 days later! Great value. I\"m delighted!", 
    "Overall, it's a unique item that you don't see just anywhere, which is why I bought it. For the price, it could probably be more solid, but then I suppose it would probably be much too heavy to hang on the wall. The vertical pieces are hollow in the back. To be honest, I still haven't hung it yet because I want to pick up better anchors for the wall than what was provided. With a few bottles hanging, I want to be VERY sure it doesn't come crashing down. It's still an interesting looking thing to hang on the wall, and hey, it holds wine! :)", 
    "I haven't hung this on the wall yet; however, it is exactly as described online. The slots for the wine were wrapped very carefully for delivery.", 
    "This thing is just cool. Metal finished and hung easily. What else can I say it looks like it does in the site picture and it looks great on my wall. You won't be disappointed with it.", 
    "This is a great item. Colors match my kitchen perfectly and I receive compliments every time guests come over. Only complaint, one of the sides was bent. Not noticeable unless I point it out. Overall, good value.", 
    "I LOVE this even more than I expected. It looks great on my light grey wall and I added certain bottles of wine with colored labels to pick up some other colors in the room. Very happy!"
