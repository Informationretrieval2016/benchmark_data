Inspired by the simple lines of mid-century decor, this lovely
armless chair features a design that only retains the essential.
The comfortably padded seat and backrest are shaped for comfort,
while the corded edges and single-row tufting add a minimum of
detail. Angled legs provide a subtle contrast for the soft lines of
the seat. Use this tufted-back chair to create a cozy conversation
area or an inviting reading corner. Solid wood legsRich espresso finish on legsCool retro Aqua colored fabric upholsteryElastic web seat and back construction make this chair
