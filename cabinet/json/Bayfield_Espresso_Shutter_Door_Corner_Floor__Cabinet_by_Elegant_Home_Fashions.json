    "This item does the job for a small area for storage. However, it is overpriced for the quality.", 
    "This is a very nice looking cabinet. It is very well built considering the price. Looks great in my guest bath and it has some nice storage.", 
    "We put this item in our small hall bath and it fits and looks nice however it is rather cheaply made and takes a lot of time to put together the 11 pieces it comes in.", 
    "I needed this for my television to fit into the corner of my kitchen and it did the job. It looks very expensive and rich in color. My husband put it together in no time.", 
    "When I received this item I was excited to put together, but the instructions aren't very clear and its made extremely cheap which I wasn't happy about ! In the picture it doesn't show a door but when we got this item a door came with it at first I thought I ordered the wrong item. picture is a little deceiving", 
    "It is perfect for our small half bath and looks great. Super easy to put together.", 
    "Fits perfectly in the corner of my dining are to put a Kurig and a hotshot on. Stores all my tea and coffee. Matching wall cabinet is great for cups and sugar", 
    "One piece was damaged and they sent a replacement piece promptly", 
    "Excellent quality for the price. It looks exactly as portrayed in the picture. It works great in a 1/2 bath.", 
    "I love this cabinet. Fit perfect in my bathroom. Heavy and well made.", 
    "Well my husband found the directions too confusing and told me to just throw it out! But I put it together straight away, although the schematics are misleading as far as where the drilled holes are. It's bigger than it looks on line and a good buy for the price.", 
    "I have been searching for a piece like this for a long time. It is beautiful-well made as well. Brings beauty to a bathroom", 
    "This cabinet was more then I expected. The color matched my current vanity. It\u2019s manufactured well (sturdy) and was easy to assemble. It fit perfectly in the desired corner and has plenty of room for extra toiletries. I highly recommend this cabinet and the price is fair.", 
    "The product looks great! The one complaint if there were to be one is that it was very difficult to put together...the end result is great though!", 
    "Item along with matching wall cabinet was purchased for use in upscale professional office. Added just the right touch to the men's room -- very masculine color. Received many compliments on this d\u00e9cor."
