    "It's nice. You can identify objects through the glass, but the glass is distorted enough to make it look good. Assembly is easy ~20 minutes. It is MDF, but you'll only know that during the assembly. It attaches very easily into the wall, no need to hit a stud. It has a deep color; very similar to the webpage. For the price, it cannot be beat. If it could have been, I would have bought from that place. Fyi, it is made in China. Door is reversible with flipping the back during installation, door has relatively wide swing, so make sure it's going the correct direction.", 
    "Hung this cabinet in a small bathroom. It works well with the existing features in the room. Looks very nice on the wall. The only negative comment is that you can see through the glass more that I thought. Otherwise, this is a great purchase for the price point.", 
    "The cabinet was easy to assemble. The directions were straightforward. The assembled cabinet looks great in our tiny bathroom. It is a great value for $****! Just keep in mind that it is very small.", 
    "Nice rich deep brown, nearly black color. Love the clear square patterned glass. The 6 inch depth is for the top and bottom pieces. The depth of the actual storage space is closer to 4 inches which is disappointing for what I wanted it for. The shelf inside is adjustable in height. Easy to put together.", 
    "Although I exchanged this one for the other type with the solid door, these cabinets are made very well, I've had this for about four years now and still love it. The price was definitely a plus.", 
    "I have a black and white restroom and needed something to keep supplies and this really does the job. We hung it over our toilet. The window pane is very pretty but things showed through the window. So, we spray painted it lightly in black. Worked out beautifully and still shows the great window design but not my hidden bathroom products. We are very happy with the cabinet and would recommend it.", 
    "I was looking for a small cabinet to replace and upgrade from what I had. Great choice.", 
    "Was difficult to assemble and the door never fit right - but it was ok", 
    "Small wall hung cabinet just big enough for the office washroom to hold a couple rolls paper towels and TP. Easy to install.", 
    "Good value for the money. It does what we needed to do", 
    "Take your time making this work...lots of pieces to put together. Fits fine.Latch needed moving to make the door fit flush. Would be great with 2 shelves, lots of wasted space inside with only one shelf. Glass would do better if you could not see thru.", 
    "Overall, this has been a good cabinet. However, putting it together was a chore! I realized once I got all the pieces out, that I was missing one of the side pieces and had two of the other sides piece. They weren't designed to go together, so I had to modify the screw holes to make them fit the rest of the pieces. It's working fine now, but they should work better on quality control. There's no reason it should have been missing a major piece like that.", 
    "This one is a keeper. I would even consider buying another one, exactly the same one. Easy to put together and sturdy. I have had it for over a year and it still looks brand new.", 
    "Great little cabinet. Easy to put together. First unit came with broken glass, but Overstock sent us a new door within 2 days. Incredible service.", 
    "The medicine cabinet arrived nicely packaged. I am disappointed in the color. It is not nearly the same as pictured (brown in color). The cabinet is black. Not walnut, cherry, or expresso ( as described in product details) but black!", 
    "Well built! Nice satin finish. Sturdy. Looks great.", 
    "The cabinet was exactly as pictured. It was easy to assemble, instructions were very clear, and all parts were included. Very elegant.", 
    "First one arrived in a million pieces, but as always the fantastic customer support of Overstock sent another right out to me. Very easy to assemble and the glass front adds a nice contemporary look to the cabinet. Great purchase.", 
    "This is a great little cabinet. Exactly as described. Fit in the spot I purchase it for just how I wanted it to.", 
    "Product was exactly as pictured and described. It's a nice small cabinet that was easy to put together. Perfect size for my half bath. Big enough to hold essentials forr guests.", 
    "This is exactly as it looks. I thought it was a bit more roomy than what I imagined, so that is a plus. The only one negative is that the door will open all the way, so be sure there is nothing that could be damaged by the metal pull/handle on the opposite side.", 
    "The cabinet is the perfect size for a small bathroom or space. The glass was broke when delivered,but Overstock having the great customer service they have,replaced in awesome time! Thank You. Sandra", 
    "Purchased this cabinet along with the matching over the toilet cabinet. They look great. The color is a nice, rich, deep brown. I changed out the hardware to match the other bathroom cabinet hardware. Looks great. Easy to put together and hang. I will be putting some frosted window film on the inside of the doors - the glass, although nicely textured, is a little too transparent for me. Overall, very pleased with purchase.", 
    "This medicine chest is a great deal for the $. Good quality.", 
    "Several reviews mentioned the glass in the door arriving broken. This happened to us as well, but since I fully expected it, I carefully unpacked the box with that end in mind. Indeed the glass was completely shattered at the bottom of the box. I contacted Overstock.com and they immediately shipped a replacement. The entire process took less than a week. I also read that many people had difficulty reading and/or following the directions. If you've ever assembled furniture from IKEA or Sauder, you shouldn't have much difficulty. It's all number and picture based. We wanted ours to open in the opposite direction, so I merely put the back on upside down. The magnet that holds the door shut is at the bottom instead of the top... but 1) we really don't care and 2) that could easily be fixed if we wanted to take the time to back the screws out and install them at the top instead. I also didn't like how transparent the glass was, despite its texture... so I just got some of the window cling privacy frosting sheets from Home Depot. Now you can only make out vague shapes unless the item is right up against the glass. All in all, an excellent value backed by excellent customer service! Couldn't have asked for more for the price!", 
    "I'm very pleased with this purchase. It's very similar to what you'd get from a store like Target, but for about 20-25% less. It shipped quickly, only took 30 minutes and a screwdriver to assemble, and it looks good in my apartment bathroom.", 
    "Purchased two of these cabinets. They're pretty easy assembly. I have them in my bathroom, one for my husband and one for me. They look great on the wall and love the color. They are well worth the money and look very expensive. Love them.", 
    "this is a very attractive medicine cabinet. looks very nice on the wall. holds just what i needed.", 
    "the only problem i had was the glass door was shattered when i got it,i got a hold of them right away and they sent a replacement part right away i was very happy with the product and the service thank you over stock.Robert m.", 
    "I used this cabinet to replace a standard mirrored recessed medicine cab next to a bathroom sink. When recessed into the side wall it projects about one inch. Had to cut out one stud and patch wall above. very pleased with the result in a major remodel.", 
    "I actually ordered this item twice. The first time the item arrived with smashed glass. I am assuming this is the result of shipping & handling. The second delivery presented a glass insert that was seemingly cut on the bias! Again, I imagine this is a quality concern. If you can get a first run product that has been inspected and handled well, then you will really enjoy this cabinet. It is sweet and the perfect size for a small area.", 
    "I order this Medicine Cabinet to go with the other item I got and it matched really good.", 
    "Love it, it's gorgeous and looks great. Have had compliments and just the right size.", 
    "the picture does not justice to the beauty of the glass on the front. I was worried it would not look modern, but it absolutly does. It does have to be put together, which is very easy. Nice cabinet", 
    "I was extremely satisfied with this cabinet regarding its size and the amount of product it was able to hold. Assembly was very easy. I removed existing standard medicine cablinet with a large mirror and placed this cabinet above the toilet tank.", 
    "Love this cabinet great price easy tranaction quick shipping .", 
    "I found this rather difficult to put together - the instructions left a lot to be desired and as a result, I ended up with a cabinet that didn't feel all that sturdy. I'm sure that, if you're a particularly handy person, you'll end up with a quality product. It does look good and I'm fairly pleased with it.", 
    "I love this cabinet. It looks just like what I expected from the website. The wood is light and seems pretty sturdy. Easy assembly and clear instruction. The only downside though is the hardware count. It was missing 2 pcs of screw #13. It's supposed to come in 4. When I contacted Overstock about this, they sent me another set of hardware that contains this screw. But then again, they only have 2 in the package. It was enough to do the job since I only needed 2 more. But if other customers place the same order, they may have to go through the same thing. Or was I just plain unlucky?", 
    "It you don't mind assembling this item than it's quite a bargan & look elegant", 
    "This item is better than advertised. The wood is great quality. The comparative products at *** were at least *** more, so I feel like I great a fantastic deal. The assembly instructions were okay to follow. I wish they would have been written better, but they got the job done. The item was short 2 needed screws, but a quick trip to Lowe's took care of that. Overall, this was a great purchase!", 
    "A very nice piece. Easy assembly. High quality. Blacker than I was hoping for.", 
    "I bought this medicine cabinet for my (very) small guest bath which has a pedestal sink. I needed storage for toiletries, etc. I chose this cabinet not only because it looked great, but also because it sticks out from the wall only a little over 4 inches.This low profile allowed us to mount the cabinet on the wall over the toilet (at eye level) without fear of bumping into it when someone uses the toilet. The cabinet is sturdy and the frosted class panes very classy. The color of the wood is a deep rich mahogany color. This is definitely the type of item you would expect to find at high end home furnishing stores that specialize in accessories, pricey hardware, curtains, etc. I am incredibly happy with this purchase! My guest bath now has an upscale look with the pedestal sink, an oval mirror and my ultra cool medicine cabinet - all for an unbelievable price! Thank you Overstock.com!", 
    "This was a really nice cabinet for the price. The directions on how to assemble it were a little sketchy, and the glue provided wasn't the best, but the outcome appearance of the piece once assembeled is really nice. Good place to store those small beauty products, q-tips, brushes/combs, etc. that clutter up the bathroom. I would recommend this cabinet.", 
    "Awesome cabinet for the money, looks like it cost many times more than the actual price! Easy to assemble for the most part, easy to install and looks high end now that it's up and in use! I couldn't be happier!", 
    "I purchased 2 of these for my bathroom. They are just the right size for what I needed. Very easy to put together and are very sturdy. They are also pleasing to look at. Very pleased with this purchase, and would highly recommend these to anyone...", 
    "I love ed. NICE MATERIAL , NICE COLOR IS SO BEAUTIFUL.", 
    "This cabinet was exactly as expected. Easy to assemble, easy to hang. Looks very nice on the wall, doesn't have that cheap laminant look of others I've seen. Very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "I bought this medicine cabinet for my mom's mobile home, which has the espresso colored vanity. The looks of the cabinet are great--very contemporary and well suits her needs. But the directions were a nightmare! Had me install the magnetic closure on the wrong side, plus the back of the cabinet did not match up with the mounting holes. This made the back overlap the bottom edge, but it is not visible from the front. Still, I would recommend the product based on the styling and functionality.", 
    "This cabinet looks great, assembled easily, and has tons of room. I absolutely love it :)", 
    "this cabinet is beautiful, the paint is perfect, the shipping was on time, Overstock is the best place to buy!!!!", 
    "For the price, this is a decent item. The screw holes are not lined up in the back but are not so off that you can't work it. It has a good look and is sturdy (if you use the glue and tighten everything!). It is rather heavy so be sure to anchor it well.", 
    "After 10 years,me and my husband are finally able to remodel our bathroom,and because we ended up spending alot on actual materials,there wasn't much money left for accessories. I came to good ole' overstock who has NEVER LET ME DOWN! Thank you SO much overstock!We bought the Windham floor cabinet,this Windham wall cabinet,and lastly we got the wide wall mirror(frameless). All three products are just gorgeous,elegant and high-end looking. They've made our bathroom SO beautiful on such a low budget!! I use this wall cabinet to store my cosmetics in,and underneath it I placed the Windham floor cabinet! It made such a nice matched set coming in at under $*** for both pieces!!Also,overstock the $1 shipping is such a wonderful luxury that you offer and I can't thank you enough for that. It usually costs as much or more than the actual product to ship it,and theses days not many can afford that. God bless you Overstock and thanks for *everything*!is,and I couldn't be more happy with my purchase(as I am with ALL my overstock purchases!!)One last thank you to dear overstock and if you guys can afford it,please continue with the $* shipping,it is such a nice *luxury* to have when its usually an extra hundred or so dollars to ship something of this size.God bless overstock and a million thank yous&I luv you's!", 
    "Went together relatively easy, all the parts were there and also fairly easy to install. Adds a great look to that bathroom. Good value.", 
    "I purchased two of these cabinets for our two small bathrooms in our mountain condo. Not only does it look great in the bathrooms but it is a space saver. Now, I have a place to put medicines, lotions, etc without stuffing them into our tiny drawers. One of our doors arrived with the glass broken and Overstock sent out a replacement door within the week. I would highly recommend this product!", 
    "Received this cabinet quickly, but also quickly found that ALOT of parts were missing-but we were able to get the replacements fast. All in All we love it so far.", 
    "I purchased this as a gift for my Mom. I had shopped around in stores for several weeks and could not find anything I liked in the price range I wanted. This was a great value, and she was very pleased. She is putting it in her bathroom because it is so pretty instead of the closet she had originally planned.", 
    "I just bought a condo and needed a medicine cabinet for my guest bathroom. This cabinet fit perfectly with my sink stand and mirror.I assembled it with a friend in only 30 min. The wood and craftsmanship was excellent. I was glad to find this at overstock...great value!"
