    "I love the look of this desk. It is sturdy and a great size. I have no complaints about the form or function of this desk. The PROBLEM.....is that the off-gassing is SO BAD that I can't work at it. I bought this desk over 1 month ago and it has been sitting in an empty room with open windows. I tried working at it today and almost immediately I got a headache and my throat constricted. After 30 days of \"airing out\" I still can't work at my desk?!? That is totally ridiculous. WHY do these companies think it is acceptable to use so many chemicals in their products that the product is rendered unusable? I think I am going to have to sell it (to some poor unsuspecting soul) and buy something that I can stand to be around.", 
    "The desk was exactly as pictured, large top allows for speading out of files and paperwork, the industrial design works in my rustic loft. The only disappointment was that the wheels are fixed and do not roll, other than that a great functioning and great looking desk.", 
    "I bought this desk despite some of the complaints I read about it... cheap looking, fake wood, wheels don't roll...Glad I did, because I absolutely LOVE IT!! It has an urban industrial vibe, and the desk top itself looks like real wood. It is highly textured (so don't plan on writing a letter or such directly on the desktop surface) Also, the color variations in the wood give it a very realistic and rustic look. It has a very solid look and feel; and does not look cheap or flimsy in my opinion.I love the amt of extra storage it offers for my home based art studio. And it's large size gives ample room to work. It was super easy to assemble, turn upright, and position. I would say that the average person can do it themselves w/o help.I really have no concern about the lack of functionally rolling wheels. After all how many people would actually need this feature? However, If u do need something portable this would not work for you.Overall, I'm extremely happy with my purchase and love how it looks in my space!", 
    "The desk looks great (as advertised) and the shelves offer great storage space. The plastic wood that made the top of the desk and shelves had a toxic stench so I replaced the factory shelves with real wood. That was costly but worth it.", 
    "Its not too heavy and its easy to assemble. It looks very nice in my new home office.", 
    "Really like this desk. Good size and sturdy. Plenty of room on top for my monitor stand, printer, speakers and my work laptop. Like the side shelves instead of drawers. Nice wood and overall appearance is great.", 
    "This fit my room PERFECTLY. It is VERY sturdy and well made. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", 
    "I looked at this collection for months trying to decide if I would be happy with it. Super easy to put together I get lots of compliments and looks even better in person.", 
    "I absolutely love my new desk. My 16 year old daughter helped me put it together - in under an hour. Although the wheels on the desk are decorative, I am still able to move it easily for perfect placement. There was a chemical oder my first day out of the box, however I left the windows open in my office and it quickly faded. I plan to order the matching side table to put printer supplies on.", 
    "Great desk, very cool looking!", 
    "Very nice looking. A little difficult to put together and one of the shelves was damaged. But Overstock.com replaced quickly.", 
    "I bought the desk to match my side table knowing the shelves and top would be fake wood. What I did not expect was possibly a hollow core table top that deflects so you can't put anything too heavy on the top. Customer service was great and credited me a portion of the cost since it already had a deflection of a 1/4\" when I received it. I really like the design and am happy with the purchase.", 
    "It's easy to assemble. Looks fantastic, too! The only gripe I have is that the wheels don't actually move, which was a surprise to me. That really should be included in the description. Either way, I love this table.", 
    "The desk looks just as it does in the picture. Very nice and functional. My husband works from home and has no complaints!", 
    "I recently did an office remodel- this desk gives the perfect industrial Restoration style appeal.", 
    "Exactly the style I was looking for in my home office!", 
    "2 reason this desk does not get 5 stars. 1) Some of the welds were done pretty poorly and I feared they would fail when wrestling some of metal pieces into place. 2) the desk surface is textured so a desk pad or some other surface is needed to write on it. Other than that, it looks great...very happy.", 
    "This desk was exactly how I had hoped it would be. I am extremely happy with this purchase! \ud83d\ude0a I do, however, you have two people to assemble. It would have taken me 30 minutes instead of 1 1/2 hrs. Lol still I am completely satisfied.", 
    "This is a great addition to my new office. Great style and very sturdy.", 
    "This is an attractive, solid desk that took my 16 yr old son about an hour to put together. It has a large working surface and plenty or organizational space. Good transitional piece that looks good with a variety of other furnishings. Arrived quickly.", 
    "The wheels do not turn. We knew that,before we bought it and love the look. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because youwill need to put something on top of the desk if you are to use it to write on. It is grooved which gives it its rustic look. We are happy with the desk.", 
    "Amazing desk, that exceeded my expectations. Easy to assemble, working by myself it took about 30 minutes to put together. Sturdy, quality materials and a professional appearance. Couldn't be happier.", 
    "Nice looking rustic desk. Wish the wheels were real but nice for the price", 
    "Exactly as pictured. Perfect", 
    "The one I received had a glass mark on it and a few scratches. I am planning on repainting the top anyway so not too big of a deal. Nice size", 
    "Sturdy and easy to assemble...and it looks great!!!:)", 
    "Easy to assemble, but did need another set of hands to hold the shelves even while I inserted the screws. Lovely, large desk surface holds my 2 large monitors and laptop easily. Very pleased with the purchase.", 
    "I love this desk. It was super easy to assemble. Yes, it did off-gas initially, but that faded within a day or two. It's got a fantastic work surface, and I'll admit, as someone who loves to prop his feet, having the bar on the back base of the desk gives me a footrest which is super comfy. I don't have any \"wasted\" space in this design.", 
    "Nice rustic looking desk.", 
    "love the color of the wood and easy to assemble very nice for the money and style", 
    "Works well, great size. Wheels are purely decorative and not actually wheels at all. Desktop wood is a bit thin and makes the wood look cheaper, but overall great piece.", 
    "We use these in our kids study area. Good storage shelves and nice colors. Definitely worth the price for our kids. We wouldn't have wanted to buy high end desks that are the similar style for our kids.", 
    "Beautiful piece of furniture for the price.", 
    "I am using this as a desk table in my home office....with an desktop organizer on top. The tabletop is a woodgrain pattern with indentations where the grain appears (manufactured wood) so it is not a smooth surface to write on (I use a clear plastic mat to provide a writing surface). The storage racks provide about 9\" of space to store items under the top. The piece seems sturdy and reasonable for the price. It is not a piece of fine wood furniture.", 
    "Looking for something to stand out. Not the standard look that every office seems to have. The build is good and quality seems good. The distressed look works for me. Just keep in mind to accept imperfections as they make the stand look unique. I like it!", 
    "This desk arrived in very good condition externally, and there were no visible damages to the desk components. Putting it together was a 2-person job, as a bit of holding in place while tightening bolts with an allen wrench was needed. The only issue was that two of the screws holding the shelf to its frame had stripped, which was easily fixed with a bit of wood glue. The desk looks very impressive and much more expensive than it was- overall I'm very satisfied. Do note that the surface is not for writing on without a pad or blotter underneath- the faux woodgrain is part of the charm, but makes for bumpy writing. I'd order this again.", 
    "Exactly what we are looking for. My husband will fix the wheels to spin at some point.", 
    "This desk looks really nice, it appears very sturdy and did not take long to assemble. As per the details the desk top is not wood, but is very heavy and looks quite realistic. I am a traditionalist when it comes to quality furniture, this item is better than expected.", 
    "Easy assembly. I put it together myself...would have been easier with another set of hands but basically easy to assemble. The top of the desk is bumpy so writing on the top of the desk is not an option. It looks great in my office and I do work from home and use it daily. I just put a small desk pad on the top for writing. I use 2 -24\" monitors and they fit great with a rather large lamp as well. Needed a big desk and this did the trick. I get lots of compliments on it.", 
    "It is awesome - exactly what I expected from the photo. Well worth the price.", 
    "Was looking to upgrade the desk in the home office and wanted a piece that might be repurposed in the future. This desk fit the bill. It's a big, piece so lots of room for me to have a computer, monitor, lamp and paperwork all spread out. The 4 shelves have ample space for storage boxes or magazines, etc. The casters are d\u00e9cor only and do not roll. The desk is heavy so you may need 2 people to assemble, especially the flush shelves.", 
    "Fits our rustic country theme to our house, sturdy, reliable, and overall really nice quality. No smell on ours like a previous reviewer said.", 
    "great look and love the metal and finish", 
    "I think it should be all wood, the shelf's on the bottom are kinda cheap.", 
    "goes very well with my husbands study area in our family room", 
    "I'm in love with this desk. Looks better than the pictures. Great industrial and rustic appeal. Large working surface. The wood is textured not smooth but I think it just adds more character. Easy to assemble. I did it by myself but would go quicker with 2. Arrived quickly and well packaged. Some reviews complained of an oder but I noticed none so maybe that issue has been resolved. The wheels are decorative only but not really an issue for me. Was easy to place and the chair I already had fits nicely. Love the metal and wood shelves that can store a large number of things. Highly recommend.", 
    "didn't fit together too well. came w/ scuff marks on table edge.", 
    "Easy to assemble, might need four hands in places. Very sturdy and beautiful. Lots of places to put your feet with no fear of marking up the metal. I love this desk. Great value.", 
    "High Quality and a great value", 
    "Lots of room...top not smooth surface for writing. Love the look", 
    "As you should know, assembly is required, and while it's not complicated, it takes some time and effort. But that shouldn't be a surprise, and the result is very nice. If you're comparing with other local furniture, just keep in mind this should come at a discount for the effort involved.", 
    "We just received this desk last week and have already put it together and put to use. It took us about 30 minutes to install with the Allen wrenches provided. It took two of us to move the desk but it's really not terribly heavy. Our desk did not smell at all so I'm not sure if the problem was addressed from previous reviews or what but it was not an issue for us thankfully. Also the opening for the chair was the perfect height and width for the chair we already had.", 
    "The desk is much darker than the photo and it looks cheap. If I didn't need a desk right away, I would have returned it. Not worth it", 
    "No, the wheels don't roll, but the description says that if you actually read it. The desk is heavy and well made. The whole thing goes together with a single allen wrench, so be prepared for that. Overall, though, it's just ask described and pictured, and it makes a great laptop desk.", 
    "Was exactly as it was shown on line. Easy to put together and a great value.", 
    "This desk is exactly what I was looking for. The desk top has a really natural wood-grain feel and look to it and the wheels make it appear to be an antique. Instructions could have been a tad more specific, but I was still able to put it together in under an hour without much of a problem. Good quality for the price.", 
    "Easy to assemble look and function very nice,need to do a better job on out gassing.", 
    "The desk looks nice; however, the wheels do not roll, and that was what we were really looking forward to. Also, the top of the desk is textured, making it difficult to write on if you only have a single piece of paper with nothing underneath it.", 
    "If you are looking for something industrial in design this \"looks\" like the real deal. It is not. Plastic wood grain look. Wheels are not functional. If I weren't in such a hurry to outfit our son's homework station, I would have sent this back. Not what I thought I was getting. Love Overstock usually."
