    "This daybed was a great solution to a very small all purpose room. Now that we have grandchildren one spare bed was not enough for us. The bed wert together nicely, with no problems. It is quite heavy when it is assembled and seems quite sturdy. The neutral color will go with almost anything. I found a colorful daybed set and the whole set looks great. The trundle fits under the bed well but measure to make sure you don't get a mattress that is too thick. I am very pleased with this item.", 
    "I held on to my delivery once I realized that the mattresses were not included afraid that I would not be able to find the right sized mattress for it HOWEVER...I found the perfect fit with the SIMMONS STUDIO COLLECTION twin size sold at Walmart for $99.00...it is a 4 inch thick foam with very smooth and nicely yet subtlely decorated cover. I would have given this bed five stars but for the fact that there is NO MATCHING COVER for the top mattress. Does anyone know if one is available?", 
    "I am a woman and It took me a few hours to put it together by myself, not difficult but time consuming. I sleep on it every day and it is so comfortable. It looks very high-end as well. completely satisfied!", 
    "This is a great piece for an \"open\" room as it is attractive enough with some throw pillows to be a part of your living area, yet functional for 2 sleeping spaces. Perfect for my loft - for my son when he visits from college.", 
    "Just what I needed for a guest bedroom! Looks good and provides comfortable sleeping space for two as well as lounging space with the addition of a few throw pillows. The backless design fit perfectly in front of a window. Took some time to assemble but not difficult - make sure to get all the bolts tightened up.", 
    "Bought this for a guest room so it has gotten very light usage. The metal frame is thin and bends easily. After a guest had slept on the trundle I noticed that the points where the casters attach to the frame were bent in and the casters were now angled to the floor so that they were causing scratches. My parents had used the guest room and my dad who slept on the trundle is about 180lbs. I don't think this set could stand up to normal everyday usage or rough use by kids. Overall it looks nice though and I'm satisfied enough with it but I wouldn't buy another.", 
    "I've been waiting months for the daybed to come back in stock, and I bought it right away when I got the email notifications that it was available. It arrived in just a few days via UPS, in two boxes. My husband and I assembled it with only one problem, we screwed one side rail in upside down. Once we corrected our mistake we had it finished in about 90 minutes. I am using this daybed in our \"project\" room which also will be an extra tv room and guest room. I liked that this daybed doesn't look so \"bed roomy\".The linen fabric is a light tan/khaki color, and the tufted arms really make this daybed look more like a sofa. I have a bunch of tan cushions and I am making pillows for the back of the daybed, since I have it up against a wall. I've decided to purchase a solid queen size quilt that complements the pillows, and use that to cover the mattress. There is plenty of room in the \"back\" of the bed to push the excess quilt smooth. I am using an 8\" mattress on the top, but will have to find a 7\" or slimmer mattress for the trundle. In the meantime, I can use the trundle for storage. A trundled mattress would show if you had this bed sitting away from a wall.I am so pleased with this purchase. I haven't been able to find anything quite like this daybed in any a year of searching, and this is exactly the look I was hoping to have, modern but inviting.", 
    "Very nice looking bed. Very elegant and very practical at the same time. Got it for my grandson and he loves it. His room looks great now.The big challenge is find the sheet set that would match Upholstery color (tan) if you like colors to match.", 
    "this bed is sturdy. the fabric could be of a bit better grade and you should be told that there is no cover for the mattress. I am a sewer and made a fitted cover for the center in a fabric close to the upholstery. so the photo is very misleading.over all it is quite nice", 
    "I ordered tis day bed to put in a small spare room. I was so pleased with the look of it. My husband put it together and said it went together well, all the pieces where there. It took him probably 2 1/2 hours to get it all done. I bought some memory foam mattress to put on top. The trundle rolls in and out with ease. It looks very attractive. Very happy with it.", 
    "For the price, it's great. But if you are looking for high end finishes or a sturdy support, you're not going to get it. I need to create a secondary bracing, as it's a little wobbly. But overall, for my library/guest room, it looks nice and will do the job. I'm just not sure it would stand up to significant use.", 
    "Looks great & is very comfy.be sure to research what time of mattress fits. 6\" twin size memory foam worked great.assembly was time consuming but not too difficult. just be careful with the instructions as they don't tell you which way is up when you have to piece it together. All in all I am happy with the final result.", 
    "Would buy again! Great daybed.", 
    "Bought this for girls' playroom for naptime. They want to sleep on it all the time! Have had it for a year and it's easy to clean when spilled on, easy to pull out still. Time consuming to put together but very safe for 2 and 3 year old to nap on, play on. All edges are cushioned so even if the girls jump on it (they're not allowed; they have a trampoline) I don't worry they'll get hurt.", 
    "This is just what I needed for my guest room.", 
    "Love this trundle bed. This only thing, it would have been great if it included the mattress as well", 
    "When this came we were sooooo happy!! It's made great looks great and sturdy too!!", 
    "As an interior designer, I will tell you that I am a stickler about quality. This traditional-style trundle bed definitely delivers for the price, is sturdy, easy to put together, and fits a twin mattress snugly and comfortably. Pleasantly surprised.It is important to note that the color is a WARM BEIGE (a warm beige that is toying with the idea of crossing into pink territory) - not the cool taupe pictured here (or is it just my monitor playing tricks on me?) Because the upholstered pieces all come apart, it will be relatively easy to reupholster this piece which is a definite plus, but if you don't plan to reupholster, keep in mind that this tone is 100% on the warm side and will clash with cool colored walls.If you're crafty at all, know how to upholster and sew, or can afford to have it done, I would recommend recovering this piece and creating a duvet cover and Euro-pillow shams using the same fabric. I have four Euro-pillows lining the back to create a big comfy couch for my office when this is not being used to sleep guests :)Overall I'm very happy with this piece and would buy it again!", 
    "not to hard to put together,just follow the steps==== the color goes with anything I am so pleased with the look and the price....", 
    "Looks nice & assembled easily", 
    "Love it and it was true to the other reviews and I put it together by myself.", 
    "I was disappointed that this was only a frame this was not clear in the description", 
    "I should have known better - just looking at the piece, one has to ask oneself about the stability and sturdiness of the design. And that is really the problem, It is designed with only 1 (ONE) layer of connections between the 2 side arms. Imagine these 2 rather large side-arm pieces being held together with only 3 slender metal rods - in the same horizontal plane. These horizontal rods are bolted into the side arms using 2 bolts each , about 1.5 to 2 inches apart (vertically). All the engineers reading this, should get the picture immediately - no other supporting binders/connectors between the side arms, so when someone of a more portly disposition, tends to descend upon the bed with too much gusto - the potential for disaster is near at hand. Bottom line, the piece is wobbly and somewhat unstable since it is not designed well at all. I am stuck with it now. Will just have to be super careful when using it (and maybe prop up the middle with some other support - which means I will have to get rid of the trundle). Hope this helps. It looks good, but is not practical to use.", 
    "While this took what seemed like forever to ship, when it arrived it came in two large boxes. I had read other reviews about putting it together so I left that up to my husband. He had it assembled and together in a couple to 3 hours max. The fabric quality is quite nice and once you get a mattress on it's comfortable and plenty roomy for even someone 6 ft. The trundle is nice option if you did have 2 guests. We use it to store extra linens at this point. Good looking piece for the price.", 
    "This bed is perfect! Looks a little difficult to put together but really wasn't. Good price and great look! Love it", 
    "I ordered this Daybed for my spared bedroom and my granddaughter love it. I put it together myself and did not have a problem with the instructions. The fabric is very neutral and go well with any decor. They Daybed look more like a lounge sofa than a bed. The quality is good also. Happy customer!", 
    "Not only do I love the bed but, had an issue with delivery and when I did have an issue (not their fault) DHP the manufacturer immediately stepped in and assisted me. WOW! great merchandise from a great manufacturer!", 
    "We love the addition of the uphostered trundle bed in our quest room; very nice quality.", 
    "only bad thing about this bed unit is the top is exposed and it doesn't have a custom made top so the mattress is exposed. its hard to find something to fit uniform.", 
    "The bed looks very stylish and was easy to put together. Was worth the money for sure - perfect for our guest room.", 
    "Delighted to have another bed in our house but one that looks decorative at the same time. It is really comfortable!", 
    "We haven't finished putting this together but so far the instructions are good and it seems quite sturdy. It looks great! I ordered it for my office for a new look and it will provide extra bedding when everyone is home.", 
    "very good looking and well constructed. Will be comfortable for both sitting and sleeping!", 
    "It was a pleasant surprise that this looks just like the picture! It took me about 4-5 hours to put together on my own but the directions were clear and all the parts were included. It looks quite good in the spare room and I bought a $100 foam mattress from Amazon that works well with the older fitted twin sheets that are not extra deep. Thanks overstock, another good purchase.", 
    "This daybed was pretty easy to put together and looks really nice!", 
    "Great value. Easy to put together. Looks and feels like a quality piece of furniture. Goes well in any room.", 
    "Mine came well packaged but does have a small dirt spot on one arm. It has many pieces but was pretty easy to assemble. I could have even done it on my own!", 
    "Beautiful material, functional for grand children to sleep at Grandmas!"
