    "I needed a small cabinet for my bathroom, and this one fit the bill. It's easy enough to put together, so long as you are familiar with this type of inexpensive furniture. If I hadn't put together many similar pieces I would have been pretty confused by the directions (or lack thereof). The most annoying thing was how the parts came packed. They were packed with flat pieces of styrofoam that were very crumbly, resulting in little clingy styrofoam \"pills\" coating all of the parts and getting all over my living room carpet. There must a better material they can use for packing, as I spent almost as much time cleaning the parts and my room as I did putting the thing together. Also, there are four large holes that you cover with sticky pieces of paper, rather than with wood plugs or something more attractive and permanent. They are not visible from the front of the piece, so it's not that big of a deal. Overall, I like the cabinet and it is fairly sturdy and perfect for my needs. One last thing - After I had put the whole thing together I turned around and there was a random shelf that I had not used. It gave me a little heart attack until I looked further and established that it was just a duplicate piece to one I had already built into the piece. Phew.", 
    "Very surprised with the quality of the table. It was simple to assemble. I needed a side table for my cherry bedroom set. I only purchased 1 nightstand when I purchased my set 6 years ago due to space restrictions. We have since moved and I now have the space for another table. My set has a king sleigh bed and a large nightstand. I needed something that was almost the same height as the other nightstand, but not as big or as expensive. This solved the problem. I was unsure that it would not look cheap. It look great. The door has nice detail and it is nicely made. Highly recommended.", 
    "Very nice, does wonders under our kitchen island overhang for storing all the odds and ends in the kitchen. The depth is great, and you can cram quite a bit of stuff in them. It's nice as well to have a small cabinet that has a decorative feature. The space at the top is useful for either decorative kitchenware, a bowl of fruit, or in our house, the occasional cat who believes it's a perching place.All in all a good value. I can't remember any great difficulty in putting these together (we got two) other than the usual in trying to read picture directions. We did put something on backwards but didn't have any trouble undoing that and reassembling correctly. Also the color was spot on to the picture online. They are sturdy and have stood up to almost a year of use. I'd recommend.", 
    "Met expectations for ready-to-assemble / knock-down furniture. My piece included all parts, and the instructions were generally straight forward for a person who has assembled many pieces of this kind. As noted by others, the packaging is a bit messy. I bought it to keep bathroom items in a small WC. It works perfectly for this purpose.", 
    "Wood is darker. Nicks in paint not easy to put together", 
    "The cabinet is a functional accessory piece. Assembly instructions were adequate. I did not expect high quality at this price point, so quality was approximately what I expected. The wood in one of the pieces had a noticeable cosmetic flaw that did not impair functionality. Color was significantly darker than the illustration.", 
    "I needed a tall cabinet to fit in a small space and this worked. I am using it as a nightstand beside a very high bed, the only problem is that the pics show the door opening in two different directions, you are kind of left clueless when ordering it. The door on mine opens from left to right and it is a little darker than the photo shows but for the price it will work. It seems to be of decent quality and should withstand normal use. Yes, I would recommend it."
