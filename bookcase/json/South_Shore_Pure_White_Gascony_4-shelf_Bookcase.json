    "Nice book case, but hard to assemble. Some of the parts were stubborn to put in, but good value if you can get it together.", 
    "I read some of the other reviews and had a decent idea of what I was getting myself into. I purchased two of these for my living room. Putting these together was pretty straightforward. The instructions could have been better but I found it not nearly as frustrating as similar items from Ikea. I had planned from the beginning on purchasing wood paneling for the back instead of the cardboard/fiberboard that was included. I would definitely recommend this as the structural integrity of this unit is dependent on the back being in place. I would not be comfortable with the included back panel serving in this role. There were a few minor gaps where the trim ends meet (this is true even working with real wood) and filled them in with small amounts of putty. I also glued some of the pieces together to give it a little bit more strength and cosmetic appeal in some areas.With the exception of the back panel this unit is really decent on its own. A few little touches here and there and I was able to make it look like a unit that would have cost much more. Definitely recommend this", 
    "Table isn't as study as i assumed it will be.", 
    "I love this bookcase. I was able to paste the background papers on the backing wall. It came out awesome! I use this bookcase inside my closet for my invitation business. I'm glad I got this bookcase. It was well worth spent.", 
    "Easy to put together, and very sturdy!", 
    "I was disappointed with this item. The corners at the top don't fit together properly and it looks cheap. For future, I'll pay more for something nicer.", 
    "this shelf is beautiful,but it is very weak has a cardboard backing no support,the trim does not match up on the front,but my husband worked on it looks better, but if your looking for something strong like I was this item is not it very disappointed", 
    "This shelf is a nice addition to my daughters bedroom. It seems sturdy enough (on carpet) and is holding up nicely.", 
    "I bought this bookcase to replace an old ikea one. The quality and details on this bookcase is much better than the ikea one. Relatively easy to assemble, took me about an hour by myself.Two of the shelves can be adjusted for height so can fit different size things.", 
    "This is a very sturdy, easy to assemble bookcase. I always use wood glue on assembled furniture like this and have had them last years. I would definitely recommend this to anyone else!", 
    "Not too difficult to put together. Love that it has the pieces to cover the nails and perfect for my home office", 
    "Instructions could be better but adequate. The top trim pieces did not meet at the corners, leaving a unsightly gap. I elongated the mounting holes slightly with a 3/16\" drill to close the gap. As another reviewer stated, the back is a heavy cardboard. Kind of cheesy so I went to my local home improvement store and purchased a 3/16 in. x 48 in. x 96 in. Beadboard White True Bead Panel. Used the cardboard panel as a template to cut to size and installed on the back. So for an extra $** I have a really REALLY nice bookcase for much lower than our local furniture stores.", 
    "Wow...I have bought and reviewed several great pieces of furniture on Overstock that were of fantastic quality. This is NOT one of them. Yes, this shelf is inexpensive...and it shows why. It's made of cheap pressed wood. The white veneer gets damaged and flakes off very easily. When assembled (yes - I know how to follow instructions and use tools), the trim pieces do not meet properly and leave unsightly gaps. All the holes and pieces are pre-drilled, so it is not an assembly error. The back is NOT wood - it's a piece of cardboard.We bought 2 of these. Since it's assembled already, we painted the cardboard back piece a light grey and will keep it hidden in our son's playroom. As soon as I finish typing this review, I am going to return the 2nd one. I would not recommend this product unless you are absolutely desperate for shelves, can't afford anything else, and don't care about their appearance...", 
    "great furniture, easy to assemble"
