    "The set is VERY beautiful (I have it in natural color). Everyone who sees it is amazed with how beautiful it is. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.", 
    "Love the look of all the colors of wood", 
    "These chairs match the table, and are similarly a quite solid piece of hardware, with a really nice looking set of wood colors. These chairs arrived fully assembled, and ready to sit on. There are some fancy mortise joints and other woodworking terms I'm no expert on, but it looks to be put together very nicely. We are very happy to have bought these chairs and the matching table from Overstock.", 
    "We have a natural wood table made from Elm wood which varies quite a bit and is a bit more yellow than other more common woods and these chairs work really well with it. They are well made with wood peg joints and solid. A good buy for us.", 
    "This wood product looks beautiful, but closer inspection reveals very cheap craftsmanship. Overstock foreign shipments take over 2 months and they lose shipments. Avoid at all cost.", 
    "I ordered the chairs and table set. I couldn't be happier with it. The wood is beautiful. The chairs are extremely sturdy. We have 8 chairs placed around our 92inch table. It is tight, but they fit. My kids like the chairs but they especially like the boxes the chairs came in. Good packaging! :)", 
    "I ordered four chairs and a bench to accommodate the matching 92\" table in natural. They arrived quickly, within a week of ordering and are beautiful. The rustic look is just what I was looking for. The pictures online do not do them justice. They are very heavy, sturdy chairs. I would not hesitate to purchase them again.", 
    "Alicia Natural chairs arrived today. Love them, sturdy, comfortable, and pretty. One chair had a cracked leg, called customer service, new chair on the way and damaged chair picked up by UPS the next day. Incredible customer service!", 
    "Three large boxes arrived, two chairs per box. As I opened the first box, I noticed how heavy and sturdy feeling the chair felt. When I pulled out the second chair the leg was broken at the joint where it met the seat support. All in all I ordered six chairs, two chairs had legs completely broken off, two chairs had legs that were heavily splintered and the legs would have broken off with any weight placed on them. One chair had an obvious crack. All breaks and cracks were located at the top of the leg where the joint met the seat support. An obvious manufacturing or design defect. One chair was fine. So now we had the lovely responsibility of repacking them, and hauling them in to town to the UPS store to ship them back. Three trips in my Nissan Leaf. fun!", 
    "Chairs are similar color as seen on line. They are sturdy, yet comfortable. I'm sure that they will look great with the matching table when it arrives. Great quality at a great price. Utilized lemon oil to clean chairs and their color came alive. Overstock personnel has been excellent to work with-very polite and efficient. Thank you for a great shopping experience.", 
    "The chairs are solid, heavy, and the wood grain is gorgeous. They are as comfortable as an unpadded chair would be, although tI would prefer a slightly more reclined backrest for a long evening at the table. However, overall I'm very pleased with these chairs and have had many compliments on them already.", 
    "Very sturdy. No assembling required. I am very happy with these chairs.", 
    "I love this collection. It's solid (even extra heavy) with wonderful colors and wood tone. Alicia is the same product as what was called Corvallis until recently.", 
    "These chairs are very solid and sturdy and the natural wood grain is beautiful, exactly what we were looking for."
