    "I like to think of my self as a IKEA furniture assembly specialist. I have to say that this space saver tested my assembly skills. The manual was not very helpful. The wood parts were slightly scratched and painted over. The drilled holes were larger than the wood stoppers. The door nobs were a little difficult to install. It has definitely helped with my storage problems in the bathroom. It was just a lot of work to assemble properly and ensure that pieces were not damaged. I assembled it alone but two people are better. My only suggestion is that once you are assembling it be sure to lay piece A on its side and continue adding peices b, c, and d. For piece E you need to stand it up. Add the doors before you add the legs. Assemble top and legs on the floor first and then stand it up.", 
    "I liked the product. Would buy it again. I think that it's a little flimsy but that's because it's not real wood and it's not gigantic. It's sturdy enough for the bathroom. The dimensions were good. Didn't need to adjust anything. The package was missing a few nuts and bolts but nothing that a trip to the hardware store didn't fix. Overall, I'm definitely satisfied. No problems and I've had it for almost 2 months now.", 
    "Beautiful piece, just not big enough I needed one with a 15\"D so I gave it as a gift, they loved it", 
    "it looks nice over the toilet. it was easy to put together and i like how it turned out. just make sure you measure the placement of the back bottom wood piece to the toilet hose on the back. i had to saw off a piece of the wood to make some room for the hose.", 
    "I purchased this for a very small water closet in our master bathroom. It's cute and works well for what we need right now. No problems assembling it.", 
    "Love this Space saver! Ity is so classy.", 
    "I should of never bought this item , very cheaply made and waist of money", 
    "This is cheap and wobbly. Not even worth putting together", 
    "This product was difficult to put together and not all the screws/bolts lined up. I had to use glue for the wood pegs to keep them in because they were drilled to large. The back panel is also a very thin cardboard painted white which was disappointing.", 
    "This is very nice. I love it. The only suggestion I would make to someone who orders this is remember the toilet is connected to the wall so you can not just slide the back in place. You need to have all but the back bar off and the put it on once you have the fixture where you want it. Also the direction have you putting the top together then setting aside and putting the legs together. DONT flip the cabinet and attach the legs to the cabinet. It will save you a major hassle. But the piece once in is so beautiful", 
    "As with any prefab product the doors were slightly misalligned and there was a chipped border. But overall it was acceptble.", 
    "I love this cabinet! The glass doors are so classy. I love that I can fit all my creams, makeup, hair items, ect and still look great. After buying this we did add some reinforcement to it, because the structure was a bit unstable/wobbly. I would highly recommend!", 
    "Overall I do like the look of it but I must say the quality is horrible. If it wasn't for my handy father I would have had to return it. While assembling it cracked in few spots. Very cheap quality.", 
    "The problems began right away. First, two of the connector bolts broke immediately. We decided to glue it together as we really needed it for our Vacation rental property. We finally got it all assembled - and then saw that one of the doors was put on upside down (from the factory). My husband moved the magnetic closure to the other side. The we moved it into the bathroom which is when we realized that if your toilet is up against a wall, you have to disassemble the piece before putting it in place due to a bracing bar in the back... No where in the instructions did it warn of this. Since we were having to \"fix\" so many manufacturing errors, it never occurred to us that placement might be a problem. Since we were replacing the toilet anyway, we decided to keep it. We just placed it in its spot behind the new toilet - and guess what? It completely rocks and is totally unstable. THE WORST product! We have purchased so many things from Overstock and been happy. NOT happy with this one.", 
    "I like the overall look of this space saver cabinet which fitted the space properly. It's assembly is not very tough but it is a two-person job. One of the negative that I should mention is that we did notice that the shelves started sagging a bit in the middle as we had filled our cabinet with regular stuff including couple of 20oz bottles. I think it is fine for some light duty but not for regular heavy duty use. Also after putting it together, I wished I had ordered one with frosted glass instead of clear glass cabinet.", 
    "Love this once assembled. Husband got a little frustrated while assembling but now that it is in the bathroom we are pleased with product", 
    "Looked great on line, but was very poorly made. It arrived broken, but it was not from shipping, it was sent that way! It had to be assembled and the holes did not even line up.", 
    "DO NOT BUY, NOT FOR THE PRICE OR THE TIME IT TAKES TO PUT TOGETHER!!! We had it sitting in our house for too long to try to send back and had most of it put together. Now we have a piece of junk in our bathroom. The quality of the product sucks!! The hardware breaks and there are no extra pieces to put together. The holes for the screws did not line up to the pieces and the door did not have holes for the doorknob so you have to drill your own. NOT WORTH IT!!!!", 
    "I dont like anything thats not unique and I definitely dont like cheezy. This bathroom cabinet is so chic snd pretty!", 
    "Love the cabinet. Very sturdy, and heavy. Good quality. Bought one before that was too wobbly and had to return it. Then I bought this on, and it was night and day. Love it. The color was spot on too.", 
    "Really disappointed. But for the effort to send it back wasn't worth it. I will just fix the issues that I have found and paint where necessary. I am usually happy with what I purchase on overstock.", 
    "Was very disappointed that no directions for assembly was included", 
    "The bathroom vanity is beautiful, but it took two persons to assamble.", 
    "The cabinet arrived on time as promised, but one of the holes in the legs was drilled too large and didn't fit the screw. I contacted Overstock and they sent a new leg with a correctly drilled hole immediately. Once I got the cabinet together (finally), it looks great. It fit the space perfectly and holds everything we need it to. HOWEVER, teh cabinet wobbles and isn't half as sturdy as i expected.", 
    "This product for the price is good. For my use it will work as needed. I bought matching pieces to use with it and all willwork for my use.", 
    "This looks very nice and is easy to assemble. It's not a tall piece and does not overwhelm a small space. The instructions did not explain how to use the cam locks. I knew how from another piece of furniture I had assembled previously, but you can do a quick internet search for instructions if you don't know how to use them. It's simple to do. I'm happy with my purchase and do recommend it.", 
    "Nice looking piece for the price. Easy to assemble."
