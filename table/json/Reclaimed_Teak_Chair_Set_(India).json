    "I absolutely love my chairs which are a beautiful match to my wood table. The chairs arrived assembled, safely and on time. They really do have a beautiful look to them. Thumbs up! Thank you!", 
    "These chairs have clean lines, attractive wood grain and solid construction. I have a young son who is rough on furniture. I needed something strong enough to withstand him but also wanted real wood that looked nice. These chairs are exactly what I need for everyday use."
