    "I need a small footstool to get on my bed and have been looking for a long time for a nightstand to replace another tall one that has begun to fall apart. And I wanted at least one drawer; the cabinet on this one is just a bonus. Plus I don't like having to assemble furniture and I wanted real wood. Found all that in this nightstand. The drawers are small, but since there are two, I'm not complaining. The only thing that could be improved would be a larger top. There's enough room for a lamp, clock and a box of Kleenex -- but it's crowded.", 
    "Handle for drawers put in crooked. Stain uneven and unprofessionally done. Does not sit squarely on the floor (wobbles back and forth). This was cute in the picture...looks terrible in person. Very disappointed in this item, and I'll be returning it.", 
    "This chest was a great find. I was looking for something higher than most night stands and small enough to hold several things on top and fit into a small space. This is a quality, solid piece. The packing was obviously done with care and it arrived in a much shorter time than was stated, with not a mark on it. All in all, a really good match for me.", 
    "I've ordered a lot from Overstock over the years and I have to say these exceeded my expectations. They are beautiful hardwood and solid. I also LOVED that they came assembled; I hate putting stuff together anymore. They are fairly tall for a nightstand but that actually gives them character, they don't look like so many other traditional nightstands you see online. The drawers are a little small but with two of them there's more than enough room to put the basics. The inside is tall and roomy; a shelf would have made sense but we can work around that no problem. For the price we paid for two of these I believe we would have paid for just one at a nice furniture store. I got them for our master bedroom to go with a wrought iron bed - also purchased here! - and they look fabulous! Highly recommend these if you won't something classic but also with a little personalityt. For the price I don't think they can be beat (especially if you can use a coupon as I did!).", 
    "I love this next to my bed because it is quite tall and my bed is high. Small footprint, but lots of room with two drawers and a bottom space for storage.", 
    "pretty expensive for the quality. They wobble on an even floor. Poor mfg.", 
    "A very nice piece of furniture. It looks antique and fits nicely in the groove of a corner where it holds my orchid and some books. A great price for a nifty little piece of a cabinet.", 
    "Good looking piece of furniture at a good price.", 
    "Got for an additional night stand. Perfect size, matched bedroom furniture. Good quality", 
    "Look good! Great deal! Good storage!", 
    "There is not a lot of room for storage. We added another shelf inside which did help. I wanted to store potatoes and onions in it, but the smell of the stain finish was too strong. I ended up putting dish towels and dish cloths in it.", 
    "This is so nice! The color is true to description and no assembly was required. It was superbly packed and arrived completely intact. A \"varnish\" smell disappeared in 2 days. Very happy I purchased this.", 
    "These are nice to look at and functional as well as bedside tables. The height was attractive to me, most bedside tables are rather low. One chest was delivered without a scratch, the other came another shipping box, no damage to the box or inside the box, with a piece of wood having been broken off a rear leg and glued back into place. It's an obvious and poor repair. Rather than go to the trouble and time of sending it back, I've used that one on the side of the bed where the leg won't show. This is the first time I've received an obviously broken and repaired item from Overstock, and it will make me hesitate to shop here again. I'd be more forgiving if it had been damaged in transit, but thiwas clearly broken and poorly repaired befos re it was ever put into the box.", 
    "I bought this item to fit under my kitchen cabinet where no cabinet currently exists and to get a little more storage space. I bought it because it has the country look I need and is an almost perfect match for my kitchen cabinets. So good, in fact, that no ones realizes it's a \"slide in\" under the counters.The design is nice and the construction is okay - fairly light weight, though, and the two drawers are very small and don't have stoppers, so you have to remember not to pull on them or else they fall to the floor.It's fine for my needs but if you're looking for something more substantial, move on....", 
    "This piece matches the honey color on a metal and wood bed I have in a guest room. The room is small so I needed side tables that were under 20\" wide, yet high enough for the 21\" mattress height. This chest fits perfectly in the room. Construction is average, but adequate for a room that will get minimal use.", 
    "I bought 2 for night stands for a small bedroom. They are nice but don't sit level on the floor. The legs are uneven.", 
    "Love this piece. Needed small piece in kitchen with drawers & door for extra space to put odds & ends such as computer paper, napkins, etc. Just note shallow depth.", 
    "I needed a table/chest to fit at the end of a hallway that would not interfere with entry into two bedroom doorways. This narrow chest fits my needs perfectly! It came completely assembled and wrapped very well for shipping. It's height accommodates decorative items on it along with artwork on the wall above. The wood finish blends well with the wooden shutters opposite the chest. I am quite pleased with this purchase!", 
    "Even though the color of the chest was darker than I wanted, I loved it so much I found another place in the house to use it. The quality is very good (solid wood) and the style can be used in just about any room in the house. Could not be happier with my purchase!", 
    "I bought this little cabinet to put toilet paper and personal items in for my bathroom. It fits perfect and is very well made and quite perfect. Have even thought of buying another for my second bathroom.", 
    "This two-drawer desk was exactly the right size and quality we were looking for as a telephone stand. Very sturdy and attractive!", 
    "Very pleased that I finally found a night stand this tall. It arrived quicker than I expected"
