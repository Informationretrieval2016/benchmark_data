    "We purchased this for our church nursery. This product will not hold up for this kind of use. The baskets are not even toy quality. I never have a problem with items that I purchase from O.com. However, this product is not acceptable.", 
    "Avoid at all cost! Looks cheap and poor quality. The baskets are cheap made with poor quality. I would return, but there is no way I can put it back in the box and ship it to Overstock. The price should be $25 and not over $.*** I paid.", 
    "This was not at all what I expected. I was very disappointed once I got it together. The baskets don't seem very secure once we got them together. I think we will be looking for something else with similar features to replace this with.", 
    "I purchased this unit because it was just the right size & color, plus I found the basket drawers (although small) would still provide some storage. Although there was more assembly than I expected, the instructions were clear and thorough, and assembling the unit & baskets was a fairly simple task. I did encounter several bent screws and one of the baskets was missing a couple of pilot holes. Definitely not a show stopper. What I did find dissatisfying was the substandard cherry finish on the unit's top and the overall 'sturdiness' of the unit. There\u0092s a bit more side-to-side \u0091wiggle\u0092 in the unit that I cared for. After a few days of use, I started noticing small light dots in a few places on the top. I found the finish had flaked off. I did contemplate returning the unit but, since it was the perfect size for my needs and had the basket storage, I decided to keep it. I upholstered the top and had a friend add some supports to eliminate the side-to-side \u0091wiggle\u0092. Would I buy it again??? \u0096 NO. For the money - I would expect a better quality finish and a product with the proper support built in to the design so that it maintained a solid feel to the unit.", 
    "Nice little storage unit, fits perfectly in the space we bought it for. Look at the dimensions to make sure it is right for your use, it is not big but it is very nice. My husband is not at all handy but he put it together without any problems. I think other users may have missed the fact that the pieces are not interchangeable, so if you arrange them incorrectly, the others may not fit or line up as they should. If you arrange the pieces correctly, then there will be no problem with screws and holes lining up.", 
    "Cheaply made. Not worth the money. Could have bought something better at Target.", 
    "Purchased for my daughter, she is not really pleased with the item. She wanted it to store towels in, baskets will only hold a few towels and that is the larger ones.", 
    "I have never had a problem with the quality of an Overstock purchase, but this piece is awful. Not only is it very light, the baskets aren't really baskets. They are drawers with very poor quality basket weaving on the fronts. The wicker is already starting to unravel, and we just put it together 30 minutes ago. After we had it assembled, I realized one of the basket liners was missing. I've written the company for a replacement. I am super disgusted with this purchase. It would be impossible to disassemble and ship back. :(", 
    "The product had been returned by a previous purchaser. There were no instructions, holes were stripped, and there was damage to the furniture. It appears the product had been returned because it was missing two drill holes. Contacted overstock.com for the instructions and they were never sent. I gave up after two weeks of waiting for them. I think the overall product would have been good if it had not been ordered from overstock.com. Extremely disappointed with their customer service.", 
    "was very small hard to put together and over priced for what you get!", 
    "Perfect for what I needed. Easy to assemble. Nice space saver.", 
    "This item is just ok. it is pretty when set up, cheaply made. if you are using this for just decorating or for storage of mittens, hats, anything light, its good.", 
    "Bought for my grandson, very handy, nice looking and good price!", 
    "This is a good buy and has worked out well for me. It isn't the highest quality but for the price it's more than adequate.", 
    "Instead of a dresser in a small bedroom, we got this and put it in the bedroom closet. Very attractive.", 
    "DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! It is TOTAL JUNK! In fact, it's going in the trash..., and it was just delivered today. The baskets have \"wicker\" - which was broken in areas. I was willing to live with the broken spots.., but it's almost impossible to get together. By the time I got ONE basket half way together, the thing had spilt and cracked. It's too much of a hassle to try to send back, and therefore, it's going in the trash.", 
    "Well, the good news is that this unit is easy to assemble, and very light weight. The bad news is that it is probably the lowest quality piece of furniture I have ever bought. Not what we expected and wouldn't purchase again.", 
    "We use it for our little girls clothes. It is not huge, but perfect for her room.It looks great.", 
    "Not worth the ***.***. It was very cheaply made and the size to fit a play house. I really thought it would be larger and taller. I have purchased wicker pieces similar to this for both my bathrooms and they were both under **.**.", 
    "I am in an retirement residence and the head mechanic tried to put this together - what a piece of junk. There is no way I can return it Off to the dump", 
    "My daughter wanted this with her first child due to limited space instead of a full size dresser to go along with her crib and changing table. I purchased this in 2011 and my daughter is still using this now for her second child.", 
    "You have this rated with 5 stars.b that's why I purchased it. Now we, reading the reviews I realized the five star rating was very wrong. I can depend on ******* ratings This item came in a zillion pieces. Assembly was time consuming. Looks ok, but very flimsy. Will not purchase items from overstock by your rating. If I purchase again from you, I'll do my homework.", 
    "Great storage for under the window space and very well constructed.", 
    "I bought this for storage in the nursery. It is perfect.", 
    "The bottem of the baskets keeps falling off or won't even go on in the first place with 2 of them. I just decided to throw the bottoms out and the white bag can hold lightweight items. If you put too much weight it's difficult getting the basket out. But overall its a very nice looking piece.", 
    "Very cheap construction was disappointed. And a pain to put together if I knew it was so cheap I would have returned. Ended up giving it away", 
    "Prefect for storing my smaller handbags.", 
    "We are really disappointed with the storage unit. Assembly was a huge project -- the storage unit AND the baskets had to be assembled. The quality and the stain color of the unit are disappointing as well. Just not a great quality product. Three thumbs down.", 
    "Definitely not what I expected. I had hoped to use this as a changing table but the top of this literally hits me at the knees. Baskets are already falling apart too.", 
    "very poorly made product, baskets are falling apart with minimal wear and tear. Poor design, sorry that we bought this.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Not the most sturdy piece of furniture but holds most of my son's toys without issue. Very cute when assembled. Much smaller than I thought though. Barely stands 2 feet in height. Wish I would have double checked that. Worth it for the price.", 
    "The framework of this product was great. Went together easily. Nice finish. The baskets are a junky material, but okay for the price. However, unless you are handy with power tools, stay away from this. There were no pre- drilled holes for the 8 screws that were needed to assemble the basket drawers. This was a project for the five baskets. The muslin basket liners ripped as I tied them. They must be used or you can see thru the baskets. Too expensive to return.", 
    "poor quality but it look cute. more for decor then storage. im scared to put some in it. not stabile. its in my dinningroom and looks awesome. very cute. way overprized for the quality. i want to order a second one, but after i see it is not stabile enough. i wont order. not for this price. for the half of the price i would me get a second one.", 
    "I would recommend this to a friend looking for extra storage. Although, I think you could find something cheaper that isn't as flimsy. Do not let your kids climb on it because it is not strong at all! However, it is great to keep toys in a toddlers room separated! I put blocks in one basket, balls in another, cars in one, legos in one, and little people in the last. It is nice for neurotics like me that like the toys to stay separated and not in just one big messy toy box!", 
    "I was looking for something to help me organize my workstation around my chair in the living room. I saw this and loved the color. It was easy to put together and serve the purpose well.", 
    "Overstock offered the best price on this furniture, coupled with no shipping charges and no tax, the decision to buy was a no brainer.", 
    "I bought this for my daughter, she's away at college. She uses it for an organizer and loves it.", 
    "I really wanted to switch out my large dresser for a smaller storage unit. This unit seemed perfect but it's way smaller than the picture. I still use it as a mini dresser but i wish it was bigger. It arrived in very good condition.", 
    "Item works fine for light storage, but baskets are a little on the cheap side (u have to actually put baskets together) and were somewhat hard to put together. Would not use if going to be in and out daily. We use it for bathroom storage in utility room so not heavily used.", 
    "It's small. Could've spent money on another storage that was bigger and paid less. The wicker on the drawers falls off easily which is not good for my 16 month old who likes to put small things in her mouth. Would not recommend for small children. Very disappointed in this product.", 
    "Works perfect for me. I prefer lightweight furniture that performs the way I need. In this case I used the top baskets for clothing that can't be hung. And the bottom two I lined with plastic for my shoes. Looks really cute in my room. I know it came in a lot of pieces but thankfully my son in law can put anything together.", 
    "I thought it was about the size of a dresser, but it is smaller. I thought it would match my cherry wood crib, but it is more of an orange color.", 
    "I was expecting to be a lot higher than it was i wanted it for our office instead looks like for a childs room.", 
    "I was surprised when this product came in the mail. My husband and I worked together to assemble it, which took loner than expected. Also the cherry is more of an orange tone. which is fine but it clashes with my other products. Also, the wood is sort of flimsy, so it is not going to stand the test of time. That being said, I love how it fits in the corner of my sun room. It is perfect for storing light-weight items. I stack colorful pillows on top of it, and this piece looks great.

    "This is Perfect! I bought a few of these to store my clothes in while switching seasons. The instructions were easy to understand though the ones for the larger basket were a little difficult. Instructions were in the form of picture instead of words so it took some time to decide how to turn the pieces to fit. But when it was complete, it is a classy piece! I may buy another one later to put cds, books and living room stuff in. VERY NICE!", 
    "I had read several reviews which caused me some concern about the quality and workmanship. I found no fault with either. I was looking for a storage unit which would fit behind my desk chair next to the couch. This fit perfectly. It was easy to assemble and the baskets fit perfectly. The large bottom baskets are large enough to store my laptop computer and all its components. The others hold paper, pens, cds as well as the label maker. No more desk clutter and I still have room for a lamp next to the couch. I really love this, just wish it came in a variety of colors.'", 
    "I was expecting to use it in my nursery but finally the dresser was so cheap built i sent it back", 
    "It was not made well and not worth $$$, after it was put together, which took awhile because the pieces were not marked, it was not what I expected, its small and short, the style is what I wanted but needed 3times the size, its cheaply made the wood is thin and knicked really easy, I was really disappointed, and cant send it back because the box ripped so kind of stuck with this useless piece of furniture. Believe me stay away unless it cost 20.00 which I believe its worth.", 
    "We ordered one of these storage units realizing that it isn't the heaviest duty unit but figured it would be good for our light storage needs. And it meets just that. It's attractive and versatile with light storage needs. In fact, we liked it so well we had the space and ordered a second for our bonus and sports room. The assembly was a breeze and it was shipped promptly and arrived with all the parts intact. The baskets were simple to assemble and may be used with or without the basket liners. This would be great also in a baby's room where you have a light storage need. It also doesn't look \"cheap\" either, nice presentation and style. I would recommend this as long as you realize it isn't a heavy duty piece and buy accordingly.", 
    "I was looking for a useful, good looking inexpensive piece of furniture that I could use in my sewing space for material, items to be repaired and sewing projects in progress. I like the two different size baskets and the liners keep my material from snagging on the baskets. The baskets were strange. Who screws baskets together? I would have preferred normal baskets. The packaging was plentiful and secure. I am considering buying a second storage unit for my sewing area.", 
    "I was concerned regarding the K D . At 83 years old I could barely drag it in off my front porch when I found it. I had a blast putting it together. Just like a jig saw puzzle. took me about 2 half hours. It,s perfect. I also purchased 4 kitchen chairs from you last month. I love them. So easy to assembly", 
    "It is a great SMALL piece of furniture for us to fit a small nook. We are using it to help hide all of our childrens toys in our common living room area. I would not see it useful for a main piece of furniture as it is pretty short/small. Have an electric drill available to help put it together as doing it by hand would be too hard. Some pre-drilled holes were not done well and really needed the force of the electric drill. Looks nice overall for display.", 
    "Wow it looked really nice in the picture... A real piece of @$$^# when inspected. Not worth the hassle to return to manufacturer. Should just send me my money back. Even if product were not shipped damaged there is no way it will hold up to the requirements of a children's' dresser. Overstock has never let me down like this before. Very Poor Quality", 
    "returned. cheaply made. would not withstand 3 small boys.", 
    "very easy to put together but my one complaint is it look so big in the picture but small in size. Since i brought it for my son extra toys storage it did the job.", 
    "Enjoy it , Baskets fit items from socks to Jeans. We use one large baket to hold 3 pairs of jeans. Baskets remove easily for ease of loading and then reslide onto shelf. Big Pro = No rollers or slides like drawers have.", 
    "The baskets are great for storage! It takes a while to put together, but it looks great when your done!", 
    "Easy to put together with only one person. Looks wonderful. worth the price and holds a great deal.", 
    "Though it was easy to assemble, this is by far the worst value for the money. I don't see it lasting more than a year.", 
    "This is a cute, versatile piece but be aware that it is more the size of a storage unit for the end of a bed than for a doorway or similar. The measurements are correct but I somehow thought it \"looked\" bigger. It's easy to assemble and the baskets seem reasonably sturdy.", 
    "I had to go out and buy glue to hold this together. The screws were worthless! I'm sure it will be in the trash in a few months, if it lasts that long.", 
    "This is a nice piece piece for a laundry or play room.", 
    "I was so excited when I got my delivery but when I opened the box, all screws were missing! Going online to the Badger Basket website was easy to request missing parts. However, I wan't excited anymore and waited about a month to put it together. You have to put together the baskets yourself and along with everything else. Guess I would have been happier if it were a bit bigger. I needed more storage in my townhome and didn't feel like buying $1000 drawer set. I now have the Badger Basket in my closet. It is pretty and works for me because I love using baskets for storage they bring a little country to town. I am not hard to please.", 
    "i was very nice and but, not what i was expecting...", 
    "I love the dresser and I thought it would have been a little taller like the picture. But, it is a good size for when my daughter gets a little older so she can put her toys or etc. in the drawers. It was easy to put together without any problems.", 
    "I got this to go in the nursery closet to keep baby stuff organized. Works well for that purpose.", 
    "This lstylish storage center has converted an \"unusable space\" in my master bathroom to a pleasant and useful focal area. I was very please with the quality, look and size.", 
    "This storage unit was easy to put together and fit perfecty in my large pantry area. I am using the storage unit to store tools that I need handy in the house, dog leashes/ shampoo etc. and misc. items I dont want laying in the pantry. This item is exactly what I expected and I would recommend!", 
    "This product was awesome... It looks just like the picture! It wasnt very hard to put together either.", 
    "I like this little chest now that I've got it together. The manufacturer left the hardware out of the box so when it arrived I was unable to put it together. The directions were unprofessional - 5 separate unnumbered sheets, not even stapled. There was no parts list. When I went to the manufacturer site to request they send the hardware, I had to go through the directions, read each step and count each kind of screw I needed for that step - the manufacturer website wanted me to enter a quantity next to each part. They did ship me the hardware - it took around a week and a half to get to me. The directions weren't great, but not impossible. There was one area where I felt the predrilled holes for the hardware were poorly aligned and I had to struggle to get the screws in. So the whole assembly experience was very poor. But now that it's together, it's quite attractive and useful. Check the measurements carefully - this is a petite little item. I've used it on the floor beneath a set of shelves - it's just a little longer and juts out just a little more than the 3 foot by 10 inch shelves, and works perfectly to carry the storage all the way down to the floor. Altogether this is a nice little piece especially considering the price range.", 
    "i bought this wicker basket storage for my under close and socks the wood is very light and cheesy. but its cute.", 
    "I recieved mine today and it is very flimsy, the instructions are not clear at all and it does not seem like it is going ot stay together well. It is also a lot smaller than I was expecting it to be. All in all I would not reccomend getting this. I will most likely be sending mine back!", 
    "Like other reviews have stated.....this is a small piece. If you are looking for something small to store your stuff in, then this is for you. Don't get your heart broken, if you expect something bigger. I haven't used it yet. Just put it together last night. Comes with a million screws though but is easy to assemble.", 
    "This shelving unit was just what I was looking for. Although it was not difficult to piece together, it did take me over an hour. I am using it to store my dvds. Fits perfectly with my existing table. Dark Cherry Finish is excellent.", 
    "This is a good looking items and perfect for storage anywhere. We use this in our home office to keep the clutter at bay. It fits perfectly under our large desk. Easy to assemble, the canvas liners are great. You can't beat the price and I got free shipping when I bought it. Awesome!!", 
    "I love this little unit. The baskets are incredibly sturdy and durable. My only complaint is that it is much smaller than it appears in the picture. My own fault, I should have looked closer at the dimensions! I am very impressed with the quality and the price.", 
    "This is smaller than you would think, and the wood and baskets are on the flimsy/lightweight side, but it's perfect for what we wanted -- toy organization without plastic bins. Easy to put together, only need a screwdriver.", 
    "I do like this unit, but it really is a relatively small piece of furniture. If that's what you want, it's great. But if you think it's larger or more substantial (as I did) then you might want to keep looking. Very attractive and not difficult to put together."
