    "Comfortable, good quality and looks great!", 
    "I like how this couch is a futon sofa but looks like a normal couch. The bed is comfortable. This couch brings modern to my living room. Its easy to clean. It was so easy to put together. I would recommend this couch.", 
    "A comfortable stylish couch would buy it again", 
    "This is my first purchase of a piece of furniture online that is not a small cabinet type of piece. This soft sleeper came shipped in a box and needed to be put together. I really hate putting things together and did not expect to do that for a sofa, but thankfully a friend put it together for me or I would have screamed. He indicated that it was fairly easy to put together.I have a guest staying in my family room and that was the reason for the purchase, so I am hoping the sleeper will hold up to nightly wear for the next 1-2 years. I love the color. It is a nice dark grey. The sofa is soft and the velvet feels great to the touch. It is also comfortable to sit and sleep on. I would buy this sofa again and would also recommend it.", 
    "Needed a comfortable sofa, but able to convert into a bed for DH man cave. Very comfortable to sit and lay in. Assembly was very easy and delivery was great. Only con is the color I was expecting a dark grey, however it is more of a greenish color.", 
    "this is a vbery easy to assemble very attractive extra sofa witht he ability to turn into crash space. it is not an every day sofa, but is perfect for that extra room that you need to furnish", 
    "I was skeptical, but the reviews were so good. I have to say this is a great couch and VERY comfortable as a bed. The box was very tattered and banged up when it arrived and one of the bars was slightly bent. They really should address this as I noticed other reviews mentioned this as well. It was easily fixed so I didn't mind so much. I would definitely recommend this couch!", 
    "Had a bit of trouble getting the correct part, but the customer service for handy living was excellent. The couch is beautiful and very comfortable. I love it.", 
    "The sofa is great. Easy to assemble and very comfortable for a Convert-a-Couch. It did come in with some damage on one of the braces that I was able to repair and to the inside of the front brace that I'm not able to repair.", 
    "Received my couch the expected day of delivery, but when the UPS guy showed me the box it was tattered and torn, pieces were falling out every which way. I reluctantly accepted the package, and was relieved all the pieces were there, but there was some damage, fabric torn and metal bent. Nothing Major to effect the appearance or structure of the couch, but an inconvenience to fix before assembling. Once the pieces were fixed the couch went together easily and is very very comfortable. Over all I am satisfied with the purchase, but the state at which i received this package is a matter that needs to be looked into.", 
    "Very satisfied. Kids are enjoying.", 
    "The assembled couch is very nice and well made. The directions for assembly are not very detailed and not all the illustrations are clear but anyone who ever built a model airplane or played with lego's will have no problem figuring how this goes together. Even if you put something on it incorrectly, you can see quickly what you did wrong and fix it which is usually remove the part and turn it around and reassemble. I built this on an afternoon where I had to leave for a trip and had no problem getting it done and making my trip."
