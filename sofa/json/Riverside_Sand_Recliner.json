    "This recliner arrived in about two days and was well packaged. Setup was a breeze--about 15 minutes with most of that time taking it out of the box and unwrapping it. (Read the one page instruction sheet--there is a strap preventing the chair from reclining during shipping that needs to be removed for normal use) I would describe the color as tan. The material is soft and feels good against the skin. The arms are dark brown, almost black. This chair is super comfortable. I'm about 5'6\", average build and the proportions are just right. The leg rests stop at the ankles, my head rests on the back cushion, and there is adequate lumbar support. Taller people may not be quite as comfortable. The seat part is firmer than the back so I expect the chair to hold up well to use. What I really like is the smooth reclining motion. There are no latches or levers, just push back on the seat back and slide forward with your butt (you will have to push on the armrests to get leverage). There are two \"locked\" positions--closed mode like a normal chair and reclined mode with leg rests out 180degrees and seat back about 30degrees from vertical. I find the reclined position ideal for watching TV, reading, or napping. There is an \"extra reclined mode\" that puts you almost completely flat (think business class on a plane). However, you have to use your weight to keep it in this position. I find that I just need to sit a little higher in the chair to achieve this. It's a very small annoyance but i don't see myself needing to lie flat too often. Another thing I like is that when closing the chair from the reclined position, the motion is smooth, quiet and takes little effort. Other recliners I've used require an extra kick at the end to lock it in place--this chair will snap back in place. The design is well done. Overall, I really like this chair. The style and color match the clean, modern look I have in the rest of the living room. The mechanics of the chair is superb and the seating is very comfortable.", 
    "The laminated arms started to separate after about four months. THye are very unsightly and I had to relocate the chair into my bedroom.", 
    "These came within a week of ordering. No damage - super easy to put together. I LOVE these chairs. They are very comfortable. Fabric is nice and they look great in my family room. My mo is short and they fit her perfectly. My husband is ^foot and he likes them too. I wouldn't get them if you were over 6\"3 though as your head will not rest on the back of the chair. Great purchase! Thanks Overstock.", 
    "Absolutely fantastic!!!! It's not oversized but it is very comfortable and I am 6 foot plus. Looks great and half off what you find in a local furniture store. Very easy to assemble", 
    "Great chair. Great price. It arrived missing a few nuts and bolts, but was easily replaced and/or tightened. Very comfortable chair that does not take up much space.", 
    "I purchased this chair for our apartment living room. The chair is a little small for tall individuals, but otherwise perfect. It is very comfortable, came exactly as pictured in tan, and was simple to put together. It does recline far back, but not a requirement if you have it near a wall. I was very satisfied with the purchase. It was shipped immediately and arrived quickly.", 
    "Used as conversational chairs, but wanted for comfort and reading as well. They are exactly what I was looking for. I am 5'9\" and my husband is 6'. I could easily fall asleep in them. We have had a few Christmas parties and I have gotten many compliments on them. Because the arms aren't a solid piece they do not appear bulky like most recliners. The arms are very dark - but exactly what I was looking for. The set up took 2 minutes, but the unpacking took 20min. Like most other reviews I have read, they did come with a few scuffs, but in places that were not noticeable, however I do not think any more packaging would have helped, the company really tried to protect the chairs. Also, the fabric is not the best quality, and If my children were still young I would be worried. I plan on spraying a fabric protector on anyway. The fabric looks like anything that gets on it will stay on it. I bought the sand color and It looks beautiful with the dark arms. All in all a great product and recommended.", 
    "I like this chair a lot. It has a firm feel, which is what I wanted. I was also looking for a recliner that didn't look like a recliner and this chair fit my needs. It is very comfortable. I would like the back a liittle longer, but this one will do. Everything is great except that the arms were damaged in shipment. I call Overstock and they were very nice and sorry that it had happened and replaced the chair immediately. Unfortunately, I received the replacement chair and those arms are damaged also. Overstock was again apologetic and replaced it again. I'm hoping that the third one arrives without damage.", 
    "A little difficult to get it to recline because I'm short (5'3\") and my feet dont touch the floor to push back effectively. Not that much of a problem though. Easy to put together. Accidentally spilled coffee on fabric the 1st week and it came right out. No evidence of stain.", 
    "Oh well where to begin---Packed pefectly, perfect condition, delivered quickly-- no complaints. The chair looks and is exactly as stated. The reviews were awesome. But boy is it uncomfortable. My feet don't reach the ground, and my husband avoids it. We bought two (what was I thinking) and they look great in our family room. But boy are they uncomfortable. Foam is hard as a rock- not your cozy get comfy kind of chair. Very comfy when reclined. It just wasn't a good choice for us. We've never bought furniture on line- may not do this again. Nobody's fault but our own. Product is as stated. Luckily we have a bunch of grown kids who will be more than happy to take themoff our hands. Caveat Emptor.", 
    "This chair has a very odd recline. When you use the foot rest in the first position, the chair tilts rather than sits upright. This is very bothersome for watching TV or reading. I am 5'6\" and the head rest does not support my head. I would send the chair back if it wasn't such a hassle. So much for buying furniture online. Next time I will pay a little more and get something that really works and fits me.", 
    "This chair comes in two pieces - seat frame and back rest. Takes about 30 seconds to snap the back onto the seat frame and there you have it - one complete BIG cushy reliner that doesn't look like your average BIG*SS recliner. No hardware or tools required. The seat is firmer than expected, but still comfortable. Wood tone is darker and the fabric is a slightly warmer sand color than pictured. If you're planning to spent all day in front of the TV, you should probably cut the beer budget and save up to buy a more expensive overstuffed Big*ss recliner. But if you want an attractive contemporay chair to relax in awhile, this one's for you.", 
    "I'm 5'8\" . In the recline position I find the length to be a little short for my height. It's comfortable in the upright position and to throw my clothes on or getting dressed for the day.So far it's firm and there's a back piece that supports lower back. I like this. A nice reading chair too. I have bought furniture from Overstock that was a nightmare putting together(ask my husband),but this piece came in 2 pieces and super easy to put together!", 
    "Needed a smaller size recliner with an open look. Saw this one after shopping brick and mortar stores and said lets give it a try. Other than coordinating the shipping to arrive when I would be there it has been a most pleasant surprise.Arrived intact,easily assembled in less than a minute. Color was fine,comfort great and a most satisfactory price. My recommendation if you need a smaller size recliner stop searching,you have found it.", 
    "I purchased two of these for my living room along with a new couch. The couch has not gotten very much use as I only choose to sit in these chairs! Love the style, the fabric, and the cushions. They recline very easily and are easy to lock back into place. I have been in other recliners that you really have to use all of you force to get the mechanism to go back to original position. I would recommend these to anyone and the customer service/delivery is unbeatable!", 
    "BOUGHT THIS CHAIR FOR OUR DAD...THE HEIGHT IS PERFECT FOR SOMEONE WHO MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY GETT OUT OF A CHAIR. HE IS VERY HAPPY WITH THE CHAIR, SAYS IT IS COMFORTABLE, WITH WELL BUILT ARMS. IT TAKES UP MORE VISUAL ROOM THAN WE EXPECTED, BUT NOT MORE ACTUAL SPACE.", 
    "I bought this chair for my mother who is 4'11\" and crippled with rheumatoid arthritis. The chair fits her short frame well and she has no difficulty in pushing the chair into a reclining position. She loves the chair. I also bought the same chair in grey for my home and I'm still loving it a year later.", 
    "The chair is comfortable and the price is right. My only negative is that it is difficult for me to push the chair back to recline. I am 5'2\" and my feet do not touch the floor when I am sitting up in the chair, therefore I have to use my arm strength to push back. My strength is not as good as it used to be but I am now getting more arm exercise with this chair, which should help after awhile.", 
    "This recliner is fine for a large person, by reading reviews I thought it should fit me, but my feet won't touch the floor. Also no lever to raise the feet, so have to push back on arms, then you can't sit up straight to see the tv. Please if you are 5'3\" this is not the chair for you. I would send it back but probably to expensive to do that.", 
    "I love the chair. It was easy to assemble as there are only two parts, the back fits into the seat by sliding it onto two metal parts.", 
    "I recieved this item in record time 3 days, but when it arrived the arms went not only scratched up but had a slight dent in both of them, which suprised me because the packing was very good. So I assume that both the scrathes and dents occured prior to the packing and if that is correct they should not have sent this chair out in that condition. I did put some wood stain on scratches and kept it because it would have been more of a hassle to return it. I pretty disappointed about all that. But the chair is very comfortable but one thing to note is it takes up room when you recline it, it is not one of those space safer recliners.", 
    "I replaced the tired worn couch and loveseat in our family room for four of these. I couldn't be happier and my beau's 145 pound german shepherd who ruined the couch and loveseat is thwarted from jumping on them due to the arms and their not being big enough to accomodate her. I love they don't look like big ugly bulky recliners and the arms are wood thus easy to clean. The cloth covered armed ones can tend to look shabby after a few months. My 6'+ son can comfortably sit in them. Comfortable seating for everyone who joins us in the family room. Thankfully the room is large as these are not wall huggers so that might be an issue for some. These chairs need at least 2.5' behind them to recline fully.", 
    "I ordered two Riverside recliners in the sand color which were delivered 3 days later. After struggling to get chairs out of the well packed boxes (it took me some time since I'm a 67 female and weight 125 lbs), I found 1 chair in perfect condition and the other with a splintered leg. I called customer service and was offered a new chair without any hassle. Expressing concern about now I would ever get the damaged chair repacked the Overstock rep suggested I glue and then stain the splintered piece and that I would be compensated accordingly. We reached an agreeable amount which was immediately credited back to my credit card account. The customer service was great. Now about the chairs---they were easy to assemble but be sure that both sides are locked in at the same time. The fabric color is more creamy than appeared on the website but is still very light and neutral. The wood is a dark brown rubber wood. The chairs are comfortable and slide back without a lot of effort. The seat is high so if you are under 5'4\" your feet probably won't touch the floor when sitting erect all the way back in the chair (I barely made it). The style is great and will work well with both traditional and contemporary furniture styles (my decor is Asian inspired). I saw similar chairs at several local furniture stores and can say this chair is priced very reasonably. You are not purchasing a $800 chair so don't expect to see a $800 chair. But I believe chairs of similar quality are priced $100-$200 more at furniture stores, plus delivery is free. I applied scotch guard to the fabric and may add a clear coat to the wooden arms. I can't speak about durability since they are still new, but I don't think the chairs would stand up well to a lot of rough housing, In summary, I've very pleased with the chairs and my experience with Overstock. I would definitely recommend this chair to anyone looking for an attractive, comfortable, and reasonably priced push back recliner. Thanks Overstock", 
    "Review: I ordered a Riverside Sand Recliner, Item # 12403948, order # 125204585. I had a great deal of help from the on-line chat salesperson and she was accommodating and did not pressure me. I paid extra ($100.00) to get it before my surgery and it did arrive on time. However, it was damaged. It was carefully wrapped and although there was a puncture in the packaging, it did not correspond to any of the damage. I believe it was shipped damaged. I did not want to return it since my surgery was the following day. I am sending a letter and email to Overstock. I am asking Overstock to look at the pictures I included. There are scratches (which would be acceptable if that were the only problem) and some small chunks of wood from the leg of the chair. I have asked that Overstock send me wood glue, some filler and paint to use to fix the damage, or send me an appropriate rebate for the damage. I have used it constantly since. It is comfortable although it only has two viable positions. It will lay flat if I put my arms up above my head. I am not sure if I should even try it in that position for long. Arms are an issue on this recliner if one plans to use it for longer periods of time. I have slept in it and found my arms and wrists ached in the morning. I have tried several positions for my arms to no avail. If it had cushioned arm rests, it would feel better. My knees, feet, and back however, love this recliner. It is smaller than most recliners and very attractive aside from the damage. It fits well in a smaller space and works harmoniously with my spare Asian-inspired furniture. I would highly recommend this chair if I thought it would arrive undamaged. I will buy from Overstock again if the company\u0092s response to my complaint is satisfactory. If not, Overstock has lost a customer.", 
    "Arrived package extremely well and literally can be put together within minutes. Click the two pieces together and your good to go. Needed to fill an area and looked for months for a recliner that wasn't chunky and didn't take up too much room. Reclines quietly and smoothly. My husband has lower back problems and the lumbar support is perfect for watching an entire hockey game ... exactly what he needed.", 
    "This chair came so fast and it was very easy to assemble. The chair is the most comfortable chair we now own. I would recommend this chair to all my friends and family.", 
    "I go through lots of recliners because my son who is autistic is heavy and plops on them when he sits. I was tired of spending six to seven hundred dollars on recliners that he would break within a year. So I turned to overstock and bought this chair about a year and a half ago. Yes it is a cheaply made product but it was easy to assemble (the top slips onto the bottom) and I paid under 300 dollars. So what do you want??? It lasted up until a week ago. My son weighs 350lbs and plopped on it daily and it held up. With care it would have lasted longer. It was very comfortable, easy to assemble and looked good in the living room. I liked it so much, I am purchasing another. Why pay more? Most furniture these days does not hold up so don't throw your money away. If it can stand up to my son it can stand up to anything.", 
    "I recieved this package by UPS with box smashed, ripped, and NOT \"this end up\". However, it was packaged so well and the fabric was protected by cloth packaging material that there was hardly any damage during shipping. I was pleasantly surprized by the color and pleased that even though the website (or my computer screen) showed it a darker tan color it actually looks like the yellow/cream color sand on a beach. The arms match my black and merlot color furniture quite well. The contrast of wood and fabric make it look very classy. I would caution people to not pull the chair by the arms though, since it will destablize the chair and it will become wobbly. People believe this chair came with the living room furniture as a set it matches so well! They are equally impressed when they find out that it is a recliner! The fabric seems heavy and cushions are firm but comfortable so it will last a while I think. It was extremely easy to assemble. This chair came just in time when my daughter broke her ankle and she lived in that chair all weekend with no complaints. My daughter is 5'2 and I am 5'4 and the chair fits us very well. My younger son is 5'1 and has trouble getting the recliner to lean back since his feet don't touch the floor sitting all the way back. My husband is 5'10 and it fits him comfortably. I think anyone over that height it might not fit so well, but for sitting in would be just fine. All in all, I am happy with this purchased and I looked for a recliner (that didn't look like a recliner) for 4 months now. I am relieved the search is over and may consider getting another one to match.", 
    "The recliner is for very short people... 5' 5\" or less, ...if taller the back of the recliner will not support your head at your recline. The reclining mechanism is also rather difficult. I plan to return it.", 
    "We have this recliner in our bedroom so it doesn't get family living area use, but it feels substanial and is very comfortable. It looks wonderful and definitely nicer than what we paid for it here on Overstock. My husband spends time working in it & says it is very comfy. Great look, comfort & price for this recliner - very happy with the purchase!", 
    "Purchased a year ago and still like its color and shape.", 
    "I had wanted to buy this exact style of chair from Lay-z-boy....but they were prices at $1300 apiece. I bought two of this chair for less than $600! While I'm sure the quality is not the same, I am more than happy with this purchase! Another great point of this purchase was the free shipping - it arrived quickly and was delivered by 2 nice men who carried it to the location in the house that I wanted. Assembly was super easy also - just 2 pieces that clicked together. I had 2 of these chairs out of the box and assembled in less than 30 minutes by myself!", 
    "My husband is 6'1\" and he finds it comfy. Easy to assemble.", 
    "These seemed to be exactly what we were looking for. Beautiful and the style we liked and frankly had a hard time finding. Quality is terrible. Very rickety/wobbly. Materials and finishes are what you would expect from price but workmanship poor. Bought individually actually. First one was rickety but the reviews were such that we thought we got a bad one so we bought the second (taking a gamble) and now we have two. Was going to return but the hassle and cost not worth it. Suggest buying things in a store where you can actually have a tangible experience. Hope that helps.", 
    "The chair had several nicks on both arms when I received it. I don't think I would buy furniture online again. What you see is not always what you get.", 
    "What a comfortable and great looking chair. Bought it for our den, and it fits perfectly. I highly recommend it!", 
    "The 2 matching recliners look great in our living room. Comfortable seating and reclining. The open wooden arms don't make the recliner look big and bulky. Easy to operate. Easy to set up. Arrived quickly after ordering. I would certainly recommend these recliners. A great value!", 
    "Very Happy with this Chair. Simple to unpack put together in just a minute.Ready to sit and watch a movie!Classly looking chair, and comfort too relax.", 
    "This is an attractive, relatively large lounger that's very easy to assemble and quite a lovely,neutral color. It is not very sturdy or well made but for the price, I would recommend it.", 
    "This recliner has the look of a Chair and functions as a recliner. We bought 2 of these for our office room. It does look a bit bulky, but functions well. Easy to recline. Feels more comfortable in the reclined position than in the upright position. One of the arms has a hollow spot under the veneer. Hope the veneer doesn't give in.", 
    "Ordered the chair for some expected houseguests who were older and had problems getting in/out of some of our lower / plush chairs. Given the price (including delivery) it seemed that if I got even minimal use out of the chair, it would be OK. It worked out great for them and I use it sometimes as well when my own knees are acting up. As other reviewers say, you can't recline unless you leave room behind the chair, but that isn't an issue where we use it. The light sand color may get dirty over time; I'm considering ordering one of those 'chair covers' to protect it from kids/dogs and general dirt. The seating is higher vs. my husband's recliner and its pretty firm (at least to start). It is attractive and has the advantage of not being a huge, looming presence in the family room (unlike my husband's recliner). I'm pleased and would especially recommend it if you were looking for seating for someone who (a) is not a very large person, and (b) perhaps has some mobility issues and could use good arm support to get in/out of the chair. It's entirely functional, attractive, sturdy, easy to assemble but its not a piece that will likely become a family heirloom.", 
    "After receiving one shipment with a damaged leg, we had quick service to send a replacement, which came in fine shape. This is a very classy chair that looks great in our bedroom. I can't believe how comfortable it is, too. It's the perfect chair for napping or reading a book in, just what we wanted it for. For the price, the quality is excellent.", 
    "Bought two of these for the living room. They are extremely comfortable. I have no complaints. We've been using them for a few months now and they seem well made. I have lower back pain and these chairs give me the support I need. Good chair to read in or watch TV. We're very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "This chair is just what I was hoping for. The dark wood arms keep it from looking like typical chunky living room chair but it sits like an old favorite right out of the box. I have some physical challenges and was able to put the two pieces together by myself. Because it is so sturdy and solid, I find it very easy to get out of -- reclining position is great! I'd order this chair again.", 
    "I have been using this chair in our master bedroom for about 6 months. I wanted to have a comfortable chair to read. The other one we had caused back problems after about 30 minutes. This one is very comfortable. The only issue I have with it is my elbows keep hitting the arm rests so after a while, it becomes uncomfortable for me. My husband on the other hand loves it.", 
    "A front leg of the chair was cracked due to their incorrect nailing in of the peg. There was a black mark on the footrest and appeared to be some water stains on the seat. Either there is no quality control prior to packaging their items or they sent out a item that had been already returned, I liked the style of the chair for a smaller person but I didn't pay for a messed up chair. By the time you have take the chair out of the huge box that it is shipped in, undo all the packaging you will then find the problems. I had to take the chair out of the box on the porch since it would not even fit through a standard front doorway. So, with this company, I guess you have a XX% chance of receiving an unbroken, clean chair. Beware.", 
    "I ordered two of these chairs early as a Christmas present for my husband, who has been begging me for a recliner for a few years now. I was REALLY happy with how nice it was. The fabric is soft, and the chair itself is VERY comfortable. I'm really happy with them. They don't look like your \"typical\" recliner, and they are beautiful. They are a *little* bigger than I expected, but that's fine - that's probably why they are so comfortable. Because other people were describing heights and how the recliner fit them, I will do the same. My husband is 5'8\" and about 150, and he says it hits him in \"all the right places\". He doesn't see himself pushing it all the way back that often, as you do lay almost flat, but he seemed to like having the option. My oldest daughter is 5'11\" tall, and weighs about 190, and she pretty much said the same thing as my husband. As for me, I'm 5''4\" tall, and my weight will remain a secret between me and my doctor ;) I found it to be wonderfully comfortable. The cushions are that perfect in-between of not-too-hard and not-too-soft. It *does not* slide down the wall, so you need to have ample room for the chair, and have it set far enough away from the wall so you don't hit it when pushing back. A couple of people have mentioned that the chair legs seems a bit wobbly, and I can attest to that. It DOES wiggle a bit, but nothing alarming. I figure some screw-tightening will be in order. Now, the downside: one of the chairs came with the legs unattached, and pretty damaged. It appears (if I were to guess) that someone put it together too quickly, and didn't notice that when they put the screws in to attach the leg to the body of the chair, it wasn't biting into the wood of the leg itself. The screws are firmly in place from the back side of the body, but the back of the leg was just resting against the screw tips, and they are eaten up pretty badly from the movement and rubbing against the screws in shipping. I don't know if I will be able to obtain a replacement. (I do hope so - I know it's past the 30 days, but when I got them, I opened one box to check and the chair was fine, so I stupidly assumed the other wine was fine, too. So I put them aside for safekeeping until today.) I gave the chair 3 stars because the one chair did come to me pretty mangled. The chair *itself* is better than I expected (the one that's not damaged) and I'm really happy with it. I'd just be a lot happier with BOTH of the chairs I purchased. So if my review numbers are weird, it's because the chair is terrific - the condition the one was in when it got to me was not. I've never had to use overstock's return system before, so we'll see how well it works for me. (I'll be reporting back on how well it goes. Keeping my fingers crossed!)", 
    "I am redoing my living space..and needed a chair..it arrived in great packaging, but a little beat up..put together myself EASY..I order all the time from Overstock..love it! The color was perfect..exactly as shown. I am little and it was very comfortable and stylish chair..looks great in my small living room.", 
    "This chair came fully assembled and is sturdy, comfortable, beautiful and it's a recliner without all the bulk. It is a full sized chair that doen't take up visual space.", 
    "I bought these chairs in gray about 3 years ago and loved them although the packaging back then was not very good and they were slightly damaged when I received them. Overstock made it right even back then. We have just moved and needed to change colors so I bought 2 in beige. The packaging and quality are light years better then before - the chairs are absolutely the best. I saw the same ones at a retailer who specializes in recliners at 4 times the price - it's the same chair. I went on line to another site and the same chair in a different fabric was twice the price. This is a great chair at a great price.", 
    "Getting the chair out of the box took longer than assembling the chair. It works perfect for my shape and height.(5'6\"). I would not recommend for someone taller or wider. The arms restrict movement from side to side. Its not too wide and takes up little space.", 
    "You cannot beat the quality, comfort and ease of assembly of this chair for the price. Be careful when you fit the top to the bottom (only assembly required and no tools needed). Be sure to line up the brackets evenly and make sure the \"male\" part is in the \"female\" part before pushing down and securing the top of the chair. When I secured mine, I only had one side in the bracket and had to take it off and start all over. Getting the one side to release took muscle! There are directions to remove the top of the chair if you ever need to, but it takes lots of strength. Just don't rush like I did and you'll have no problem!", 
    "The chair looks like the picture, was easy to assemble and is comfortable for my 5'2\" frame and my husband's 5'11\" frame. He's claimed it as his, however. We're glad we sent the first faulty chair back and tried again.", 
    "Chair is easy to put together, one advice, have an extra person there so they can make sure both sides line up before you lower the top onto the bottom, if you miss and only one side goes in, on the side that is connected there is a little tab, gentely with a screw driver pull forward have the other person lift up on the top peice, then aline correctly on both sides and click into place.", 
    "Nice chair, arrived quickly, well packaged, no damage. It took me, a 53 yr old woman, a max of 10 mins to open box, remove packing and put the chair together. Granted, I'm pretty strong and 5'9\" but still, I was amazed at the simplicity. Pull out the seat section, remove the protective covering and set it down on its feet. Take out the upper section (now this takes a little muscle) and insert the top section's 'male' blades on the left and right into the bottom section's 'female' inserts and you're finished! Be careful inserting the top into the bottom as I did pinch the tip of my finger in the process. The seat is a bit firm but I am sure it will soften up with use. When I reclined in the chair, the support for the head left me wanting more but I always use a neck roll anyway so it won't be a problem. If you're tall, you may want to consider this feature. For this reason, I gave the chair 4 stars. I will be using this chair in my living room for guests to use so it meets my needs quite well. I immediately wrapped the wooden arms of the chair with the protective covering that came with the chair and sprayed the fabric all over with 'Scotch Guard' fabric protector. I will add a second spay today. The color is a light beige, true to the color on my monitor.", 
    "The chair is ideal for us. It will not be used a great deal which I'm sure will help it last. Please be aware that is not the 'wall-hugger' type of recliner. This will need to be pulled away from the wall to use the recline feature. It is an attractive and comfortable recliner.", 
    "I've always been happy with my purchases from Overstock, so when I needed a \"temporary\" chair for the living room, I went with this one. I've been seeing this design all over the place for a much higher price, so I am pleased. Delivery was quick and it was packaged well - no damage. The size is perfect for most of us in the house except for my husband at 6 foot. He's a little big but still reclines in it. The only issue I've had is the fabric coming apart under the foot rest...nothing that a staple gun didn't fix. And certainly nothing I'd be willing to pay more than double to avoid. Overall, worth the price and I'd recommend to a friend.", 
    "I ordered a pair on these chairs. On my first shipment, one was damaged on the feet, so a replacement bottom was sent. This replacement piece was missing bolts, so we had to take pieces off of the damaged one to fix the new one. In about 2 months, the chair broke, so we had to take the one with the damaged feet and use it again. The wood the chairs are made out of is not real wood, it appears to be particle wood or something. That is the peices we kept having problems with. I would not recomend getting them if you are going to use on a daily basis, they may be fine in a room where you might use only occasionally, and gingerly.", 
    "chairs came damaged on arms very easy to put toghther color is lighter than pictured ending up sending them back because of damage very poorly packaged", 
    "i purchased 2 chairs like these in another color and was happly with the product but the new chairs were damaged. the legs were all chipped up and backs did not fit in lhe slots completely, i have purchase products in the past and have been happy but i think this is my last order.", 
    "I love the Riverside Sand Recliner! It is just what I needed for our small beach house. The chair provides lots of comfort but takes up only a little space. It arrived quickly and was very easy to put together. The color is perfect. I look forward to getting lots of use from it.", 
    "The chair is nice looking and easy to put together. It is comfortable when you sit for awhile. The padding is not top quality so you feel and hear a bit of stiffness when you sit. Best thing is it does no look like a recliner.", 
    "Solid chairs for the price. It was delivered quickly, some nicks on the wood in some spots. The material tore off from the recliner piece rather easily in the first week. Overall a solid chair for the money.", 
    "These chairs are shipped in the most flimsy packaging. I can't believe they don't arrived seriously damaged every time. My first chair I ordered was damaged. The wood was cracked. Easily understood why since there was absolutely no protection. The second replacement chair arrived in good condition. No problems. Overstock customer service was excellent and responded immediately.", 
    "I was eyeing almost the exact same chair at Macys for months but didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars. I was going to purchase 2. Lo and behold I started browsing on Overstock.com and found what appeared to be the identical chair for hundreds less. Of course there wasn't a choice of fabrics but I was pleasantly surprised because I liked the fabric at Overstock better. The chairs arrived quickly. The UPS man delivered two huge boxes and left them outside and unfortunately it started to rain. I was able to cut through the boxes and lift all four pieces into our home by myself. Yes, I am a pretty strong woman. I sprayed the fabric with 3M scotch guard because of the light color. They are absolutely fabulous chairs. Super comfortable and worth every penny!! They are very comfortable and have great lumbar support.", 
    "Very similar to the big name recliner for half the price. I've received many compliments on this chair.", 
    "Overall, I like the chair. I don't like the look of most recliners, but I wasn't willing to shell out a ton of money for the high-end \"recliners in disguise.\" This is for a visiting family member with a bad back who has a difficult time sleeping in beds. It's comfortable, and I think it'll work just fine. It's not quite as streamlined as it looks online; if you look closely at the side view photo you can almost get an idea of how puffy the back cushion is. It's definitely got that traditional recliner pouf. But I suppose that's what makes it so comfortable, and it doesn't look terribly out of place -- the rest of the chair balances it out. The seat is more firm than the back, so I don't sink into it. I didn't notice there wasn't a handle until it got here; the seat reclines with body pressure. It's not difficult, but it does take a little oomph (5'6\" average build woman -- might be a little harder for someone smaller or weaker). Once it reclines, it stays (no constantly fighting it trying to slide back up, so far anyway), and was easy to push back into an upright position with my legs. Unfortunately, when reclined, it exposes two screw holes on the top of each arm. I would have at least appreciated some caps to cover those up, although you'll never see them with someone sitting in the chair (and they are stained inside the hole, so they're not as glaringly obvious as they would be otherwise). One reviewer said the arms were huge, 6\" wide -- that's definitely an exaggeration. The arms are 3 1/2\" wide, and a nice espresso finish. Like other reviewers, I wound up with a couple small dings on the arms (nothing that wouldn't have ended up happening in my house within the first year anyway), but I don't know how they could have protected them more -- the arms were wrapped in foam sheeting, then cardboard, then styrofoam. I bought the \"charcoal\" version, which turned out to not be charcoal, but a nice grey with some brown in it. If your interior is strict blacks, it might stand out (then again, so would the espresso finish on the arms), but otherwise I think it's a color that will blend nicely with a variety of decors. It actually works better with mine, since the hint of brown warms it up a tad. There is an odor, so I'm hoping it off-gasses quickly. It smells like furniture stain, though, not nearly as offensive as some of the put-it-together-yourself stuff I've bought in the past. Assembly was easy; the chair ships in two pieces. The seat, base and arms are already put together; that's the heavy part. The back is very lightweight and has two metal channels inside it. Those channels slip over two metal prongs on the seat base; push down, and voila, your seat is assembled. Oh, and there's a velcro strap keeping the footrest in for shipping; if you don't read the assembly instructions, you might be wondering why it doesn't recline. All in all, I think it's a good deal for the price. One star off for the exposed screw holes at top of the armrests.", 
    "Great comfortable chair. Shipping was quick and free. Chair came unassembled but was a breeze to put together. No tools were required. Great chair goes great with my chocolate brown sofa.", 
    "Chairs look good, but there are a few cosmetic flaws. There are 2 screws used to hold down the arms, and they show when in the recline position. Also, the end of one of the arms had a dent and the bare wood can be seen, but it is not worth sending back.The chair can be wiggled from side to side pretty easily, so the consttruction does not seem very sturdy, though this may just be way this type of design is. Despite the flaws we are satisfied with the purchase, since we needed something modern looking and didn't want to spend a lot of money on 2 charis.", 
    "I was dissapointed with this chair. It is a way bigger chair than I read in the reviewes. I am 5' 3 inches tall and it is way to big. My feet won't touch the floor. Also you cannot just raise the foot of the recliner without reclining it, so you cannot sit upright to watch t.v. I would return this chair but know the shipping charges would be expensive. Also the wooden arm had a gough in it.", 
    "Bought this chair for my master bedroom. The color matched my drapes(also purchased from Overstock) perfectly. Quick delivery, easy assemble made this purchase a breeze.", 
    "Initally the clair is difficult to push back into the reclining position. It takes several uses before it can be done with ease.", 
    "Very pleased with this chair. Comfortable and easy to asssemble.", 
    "This recliner is so comfortable and looks great in our living room. We picked this one because it isn't a typical recliner that has an older frumpy look. My husband loves it!", 
    "A gift... and it is truly loved, comfortable, and a great buy", 
    "This chair is stylish, comfortable and was the perfect fit for our home.", 
    "Super comfortable chair; took us a while to find where to put the two screws that seemingly anchor the back portion of the chair to the base. Ordering another.", 
    "Good price for a recliner . Very comfortable , and reclines all the way back for sleep. Bought for an elderly parent with small living space.And fits well. The fabric is mediocre quality, but I am picky......", 
    "Love this recliner! I have had it for years. Stylish & comfortable, simple", 
    "Nice quality and great price. Modern look for a recliner.", 
    "Very comfortable chair and stylish. I have enjoyed it and love that it reclines for a very comfortable reading chair.", 
    "The Riverside Sand Recliner looks great in my family room. It's very easy to assemble. It comes in two parts: you snap the two part together and voila! You have a very nice recliner. Note: the chair does not have a handle to push it back to recline so some people may have a challenge going pushing back the recliner with just body motion. My mother had a difficult time. Otherwise, the recliner is perfect! The sand color is nice but I may have to scotch guard them because I can see they can get dirty very easily, especially with young children in the house.", 
    "Delivery was extremely aggravating. The chair however, is amazing. It's very comfortable and was easy to put together. Perfect fit for an RV too!!!", 
    "This was a great chair for our small living room. If you are tall, you may not like it, but for the shorter individuals (5'5\" and under), it was perfect and comfortable.", 
    "I love this chair! I have had it for several years now and it still works with all my furniture, old and new. I have moved several times and have had to take it apart and reassemble it, and it was easy. My favorite furniture purchase thus far.", 
    "We ordered two of these chairs and loved them. We could start scene where in the cushion pretty soon quickly. Also we can see sawdust under the chair from the recliner. After less than a year they are to warn to sit in and look awful as well. We have screwed them shut so they don't recline anymore so they can't be broken any further. And the where that you can see in the cushion is bad. After one year of the chairs look like they are 10 years old, not one year old. I love the look of the chairs and was really hopeful that they would be a chair that would last. We did not sit in the chairs very often and we rotated them to make sure they both were worn equally. And they still didn't last. Beautiful chairs, not worth anything though.", 
    "Big gap between the seat cushion and the back cushion. Really uncomfortable. Sis in our basement as an extra seat.", 
    "If you want a good quality chair and get your moneys worth, this ia a chair you can't go wrong with. This chair is nice and confortable very goodlooking also. I'm not sorry at all. I read as many of remarks and reviews and went from there.", 
    "This chair is just what I wanted!! I have ordered another one, in fact. It's just like the picture. It came in about 10 days. Dressy enough for living room and very comfy--we love it.", 
    "Looked high and low \ud83d\ude0a For a chair to put in my living room. This is a great choice. I had to much browns going on. The first chair that came had a defect. I called them up in within days they picked up the chair and had me another one . They were very kind and understanding and got the job done very quickly I love this chair it also reclines and it comes in different colors and patterns !", 
    "Started to fall apart after one month. Very hard and uncomfortable. I don't recommend this chair.", 
    "But arm broke off pulling it out of the box. Sent it back and they sent me another. Unbelievably, even though I was careful, the same thing happened to the second chair! Said the he'll with it and gave it to a friend who drilled a hole in the arm and put a large screw in there to hold it together.", 
    "Very happy with the two chairs I bought. Very comfortable and worth the price.", 
    "Very comfortable but did not last very long -- less than 2 yrs and the chair legs were bending askew.", 
    "most comfortable chairs ever. great for the movie room", 
    "This chair provides the room with a more modern look. Comfortable, but not as much as a recliner with the padded arms. But this is the look we wanted. After 1 yr use, chair seems a little wobbly, but for the price, great chair.", 
    "It's not in the way, it's so comfy and the perfect place to read.", 
    "I have bought 5 of these chairs for different locations. Great look, very comfortable. Not very durable. We have had to rebuild and lock out recliner feature.", 
    "Perfect for small space and. Very comfortable. Bought two!", 
    "The first one we ordered wouldn't recline. Overstock replaced it but the replacement broke in just a few months. Complete junk!", 
    "I picked this chair for the color scheme because it went well with my other new furniture. It's comfortable, it reclines and it was easy to assemble!", 
    "Chair is much larger than I thought it would be. It is extremely difficult to push back and then get the chair upright again. Have moved the chair to another room and is no longer used.", 
    "It wasn't the most practical color for a well-used chair and the paint or coating on the arms didn't stand up to heavy use, so I moved it into a bedroom where the use was much lighter. It works well and looks good in there.", 
    "After using the chair for 4 months the cloth was ripped at the sim.I didnt think for the price will last for ever but only four months of usage is a rip off.", 
    "My Cocker Spaniel likes to sit on my lap and the open design of the arms on the Riverside helps keep us both cool. Plus, his head and legs can stretch out and hang-over the sides. The arms are typically the first thing to show wear, so I really like the solid wood because it will be easy to clean and it's durable.My only complaint is that I could feel a board through the cushion, right at my belt line. Fortunately, this was easily resolved with a small pillow.", 
    "I've had this for three years now, and still love it, very comfortable.", 
    "This chair was everything I hoped it would be. Color was exact; comfortable beyond compare; couldn't be happier! We bought two!", 
    "We bought this chair for my mother in-law. She is 85 and just had hip surgery. The chair is absolutely perfect. The arms are solid and can be used securely to assist in and out of the chair. You can use the arms of the chair not the legs to recline or lift out of the chair. Extremely comfortable for back and hips! The chair reclines so far back one could sleep in it. You will need to have some distance away from the wall for full recline. I have set in this chair and have had lower spine fusion surgery, and I want this chair! Excellent chair for an elderly person. It is easy to get in and out of the chair. The color is a nice color. Picture is what you get. I have a friend who has this chair, but in a different fabric and different maker, they have had it for at least three years with no problems. If you need more than this chair you'll need a power lift chair.", 
    "Very comfortable, well priced and well constructed. Would improve it with side lever to lift foot support.", 
    "I have chairs at three times the price that are not as comfortable. Finish on arms may not hold up to rough use, but seems to be a substantial chair overall. Would buy again.", 
    "We bought this product for the master bedroom. It is comfortable and seems to be well built.", 
    "I bought two of these. One of them was damaged slightly in shipping. They were easy to put together (just slip the back onto the frame) and are very comfortable. They do not take the amount of room normal recliners take up. Many guests to my house have had positive comments about them.", 
    "Nice recliner for the price. Holding up to tall 26 year old son. I wish it would stay declined in the prone position. It tends to want to sit back up unless I sit way back on seat, which makes my head off of the top.", 
    "This chair is perfect in my bedroom. It is not too big but it is large enough for a full-sized adult. The seat is comfortable and I love the style.", 
    "Very nice! Easy to put together and looks great and husband loves it.", 
    "I love this recliner. Bought it almost a year ago, and it's going strong. It came in 2 pieces and was super easy to put together, even for a 65 year with a heart condition who can't lift heavy items. Guest love sitting in it and keep asking where I got it. I highly recommend it. Gave it 4 stars because it wasn't the color I was looking for, but it's neutral and goes with anything, so I don't regret the purchase at all.", 
    "It's not an expensive chair so it's not expensively built. First, it sits and naps great! But the arms are scratching and they wiggle a little. The leg got chipped in shipping but we kept it because it looks good, sits well and the price is right!", 
    "We use this in a corner of our bedroom suite with a nice reading lamp by a window and a nearby bench that has storage baskets for reading materials and a place for setting down a cup of coffee. This recliner has wonderful mid back support and is tall and long enough for my 6' 3\" husband. We both love it. Easy to open and close, modern designed for smaller spaces where a traditional recliner would be too wide. Ours is the sand color and has a very warm tan colored cloth. We also have a charcoal one in another bedroom with black furniture. They are both very firm while still being cushy.", 
    "Very disappointed in this chair, paint/varnish started coming off within a month after purchase, I covered it up with black majic marker and forgot about it, until now I would have to paint the majority of the arms to cover.", 
    "I purchased one of these in Orange that I absolutely loved! This one is slightly whiter in appearance than it seems in the pic & I swear not quite as comfortable as the orange one, but over all I am still very satisfied!", 
    "Great Item 5 Stars, Will purchase Again From Overstock", 
    "I bought this chair for someone who sits in it for considerable periods of time and it has not worked out for that. The seat has broken down and is now so uncomfortable I will throw it away. It is not an expensive recliner so I remind you that you usually get what you pay for. The other problem is that it does not recline easily. You have to be strong to recline and get back up, as well.", 
    "Despite looking nice and being comfortable, this chair is of poor quality. The chair that was originally delivered was damaged. The 'wood' arm rests had dings and slivers of wood missing. The fabric puckered and had holes where the hardware was in the back. It was rickety. It was replaced,but still not much better. Buyer beware!", 
    "THe fabric has a texture that was not visible online. But its' construction is very good and it is a comfy recliner. Size is perfect for the area and it has a chic clean lines look", 
    "It looked similar to the one we bought at *****, but not near as comfortable.", 
    "Quick delivery.....no damage....needed to use a dolly to get up the stairs to beach house as it is a bit heavy. My daughter assembled this in about 30 seconds by just snapping the back into base of chair. Very satisfied. No problems. Color (sand) exactly as shown in photo and nice 'chenille type ' fabric that is comfortable to sit on. Just like the fairy tale ......'not too hard, not too soft...but just right'....so I'm well satisfied for the value vs. the cost.", 
    "I first saw this chair (the one with the circle pattern) in a local furniture store for ******. I've since gotten 3 for my home and one of them I spent more having it reupholstered to go with my rust/red sofa than what I paid for the chair! My husband mostly sits on them and he's 5'10\" 200 lbs. They are comfortable and I bought him a little pillow for his neck for when he watches TV in a reclining position. They have a nice modern style with the wood arms and aren't bulky looking. Everyone that comes over comments on how nice they are and you can't beat the price!! They seem to be holding up well and when and if they do wear out, I'll probably replace them with the same!!", 
    "The fabric is wonderful and matched our two sofas! The wood arms also matched another chair we already had. Very comfortable with a nice lumbar curve to the back. Easy to assemble and move around. The recliner portion fits my 5'6 frame as well as my husband's 6' frame. The price was very competitive with other fabric chairs.and we are very pleased with this product.", 
    "Very comfortable chair with firm feel. Arrived quickly but chair did have a slightly damaged leg. Since it did not show; we didn't complain. Enjoying the chair very much.", 
    "It was love at first sight with this chair. Bought it, love it, did not disappoint. Amazing quality for the price. Comfy, has lumbar support that, having a chronically sore lower back, I really appreciate. This chair is not large, so it works well in our smallish living room. What really sold me was the bentwood-style arms -- wood, not fabric. I can't keep upholstered armrests clean!", 
    "UPS guy was sweating after the flight of stairs --excellent packing--easy to assemble-- no damage- did spray it with scotch guard- I am 6'6\" and weigh in 300# range and all seems fine-", 
    "A great chair. Quick delivery and it was quick to assemble. A very cool modern style. No complaints.", 
    "Adore the modern style of this recliner. It has fantastic fabric in that perfect neutral color. We bought it for me, being disabled I need a slightly firmer and higher seat than most chairs. This is perfect! Very comfortable, great low back support and so stylish. The wood is such a dark brown it almost looks black and the tan fabric is excellent! I would recommend this chair to anyone!", 
    "This recliner is simply gorgeous. It is comfortable, elegant and affordable. I love it, love i, t love it. So easy to put together. Everyone that sees this piece of furniture can't believe it is a recliner, and praises me for the great taste in decor. If you want your room too look good you should get this recliner.", 
    "The 1st chair I ordered came in a time, but had some construction issues. One leg was shorter than the other and was missing a plasticbutton on the end. I contacted customer service and they immediately arranged pick-up of the defective chair and delivery of another chair. All went smoothly. They were very responsive to my concerns and questions. The new chair arrived when they said it would and in good condition. It was easy to assemble and I like the look of it. It is a comfortable recliner without the heavy chunky look of so many recliners. I like the fabric and feel it is more comfortable than leather. I would definitely recommend this chair to anyone who wants a good looking comfortable chair that also reclines.", 
    "There's that old saying that \"you get what you pay for\" but I think we got more than that with this product. It is very attractive and true to the pictures in the ad. The assembly was so easy you can't even call it assembly, really. A video was provided online and it was very accurate and simple. The comfort is medium--a little hard, not the most comfy chair in the world, but considering what we paid for it (around $XXX with the use of a coupon code) we can only rave. My husband, who is not picky, loves this chair and has claimed it for his own, so we are considering getting a second one. We can't say how it will hold up as it just arrived recently but we think it will be great for a long time to come. Really, i am delighted with this purchase. It is a very good value.Good luck!", 
    "I decided to wait and review this chair after we had owned it for over a year and I am glad to say that we are VERY pleased with this purchase! We searched high and low for a recliner that did not have the \"over stuffed' look and we found it with this chair! My husband is a 6' tall man around 220lbs and is very pleased the comfort and feel of the chair. I am 5'3 petite, and I have to give the chair a bit of a push to recline but really enjoy the chair. It is shipped very well packaged in two sections and all you have to do is slip the back of the chair into the base and it locks in place. Extremely simple assembly! The recliner is unique in design and the bent wood arms give it a more contemporary, sleek look. Love this recliner!!!", 
    "Our first chair was damage in transport, making it unsafe. I called overstock with my concern and the chair was replaced with no difficulty. Thank you for the excellent customer service. I would definitely order from overstock.", 
    "We purchased two of these recliners. They were very easy to put together. The color was true. The size is just perfect - not too big. They are so, so comfortable. We are very happy with our recliners.", 
    "Nice fit to my house. comfortable to sit in. easy assembly. fast service from overstock.", 
    "I am very happy with this purchase. The color, comfort, style, and delivery were what I hoped for. The only issue we had was that one of the screws came out in shipping and several others needed tightening. This was my first overstock purchase and I have already made a second one.", 
    "It was between this chair and the *** version at a popular chain furniture store in town. So glad we took the gamble and got this one. It is such the better value!! very comfortable, fabric is great and perfect size for my husband who is 6'2\" and my MIL who is 5'2\". A great chair for the price can't beat it!!", 
    "Looked at this recliner in 3 different furniture stores, best buy with Overstock. Comfy, nice fabric, wears well, looks great. Love quality of Overstock items. Fast delivery. Packed well. Ty. for this great recliner. ****.", 
    "I LOVE this chair. The color is a little darker than it looks online. but, it is really comfortable. It has lumbar support and it feels theraputic. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars is that it is much bigger than it looks online (i guess this is my fault). It worked out, but not the way i expected. also, the packaging was terrible. the box was falling apart when delivered. you only need to slide the back into the grooves of the seat, but not as easy as you might thing. however, i would have to say assembly was easy. overall, i love it. i would definitely recommend this chair if you have room for it.", 
    "Nice looking chair. Comfortable. Not as comfortable for taller people (6 ft 6 in)!", 
    "Very satisfied with my first on-line furniture purchase. Quality and comfort are quite good and assembly was quick and simple. I would not hesitate to recommend this product. Shipping was timely and delivery was made on the day promised.", 
    "This recliner chair is smaller that an average which is great for a small place. The wooden arms give it a modern look and it is very comfortable. Great purchase, and very affordable!", 
    "Its very disappointing to wait over a week for this chair and it is defective and not usable. The packaging was a pain in the butt, it was dirty and nasty. The chair is defective, the right arm became detached from the rest of the chair. I have requested a refund. My position on this chair is do not waste your time.", 
    "Love these chairs. They were very easy to put together and they look expensive.", 
    "Tried to put together the chair by myself and that was a mistake. One of the sliders moved out of position as I dropped it down, one went down smoothly and locked. Now I can't get the one unlocked to line up the other side so the chair is unusable. Contacted the online chat help only to be told it would be 1-2 business days before anyone could get me instructions on how to release the locked bar. Checked into returning it only to be told I would have to box it up and take it to a UPS store to return it, or I could leave it blocking my front door for 2-5 days for them to pick it up. My first large online purchase and my last. Definitely my last purchase with Overstock.com.", 
    "Very comfortable recliner, easy to put together. Stylish, modern", 
    "I had to furnish a vacation property and used Overstock to help me do it in a cost-effective manner. I was very worried about ordering furniture, sight unseen, for my living area. Also, I am not the best at putting things together. The chairs look terrific, in fact much better than expected. I bought two chairs and they are extremely comfortable and easy to recline. My son put them together easily. They also were delivered so fast I didn't have time to tell the office they were arriving.", 
    "Needed a recliner to fit in a very tight place and did lots of searching and this chair was perfect. Arrived early, very easy to assemble-only two pieces. Very happy with this chair.", 
    "Wanted a recliner for my significant other but didn't want the puffy overstuffed LARGE guy chair in the living room. This chair is great. He loves it and spends a lot of time in it. And I like the style. Mot people don't believe it is a recliner. Putting it together was a breeze. The hardest part was getting it out of the box. My 15year old grandson had it together before I found the instructions. I did spray it with ScotchGuard and would have liked something with a darker tan upholstery. But aesthetically I love the color, Will have to wait and see how it holds up.", 
    "Many compliments...comfortable...easy assembly.....modern motif", 
    "My son bought this recliner and loves!!! it. He is over six feet and has plenty of room. My husband wanted one but ours seems much too soft in the seat when I use it. I weigh considerably less than my son so I am not sure if our chair is lacking adequate support. I do love how it looks and it was just as pictured.", 
    "Great chair! I had been looking for a streamlined recliner for months when I came across the Riverside. The chair is very comfortable with great lumbar support. When I take occupancy in the chair I do not want to get out of it.", 
    "When I received my product I didn't get chance to enjoy it before you went up on the price if I wanted to purchase another.", 
    "I took a chance by ordering furniture online -- my significant other likes to sit on everything first to determine whether something is comfortable. The reviews for this product are accurate. These chairs are quite comfortable, and are very attractive. No one can believe that I ordered them online! They came in two pieces in very large boxes and were a breeze to put together. Had them in my living room within five minutes.", 
    "Very pleased with this chair. It looks great and is comfortable, and still looks brand new despite heavy use in a family room with two young kids for a few months. A great piece of furniture so far.", 
    "Love it. I would buy another if I had the room. It is the perfect recliner for condo. Takes up less room but still has the comfort of a recliner.", 
    "arms are up too high for your arms to rest comfortably on them. Very hard to push into a reclining position. My mother who is older cannot do it at all. The chair was a present to her, but she is unable to use it that way.", 
    "Received the recliner in under a week which was excellent. Only had it for 3 weeks but the recliner appears to be study enough and is comfortable to sit on. I found the seat just right, not too firm and not too soft, It reclines smoothly and quietly. It comes to 2 pieces but the instructions are a waste of time, however it is easy to put together. Not sure how to dis-assemble it if I ever have to as the \"joins\" of the seat and backrest appear to be permanently locked now. Be sure to install it correctly the first time or you may have problems! Overall a pretty good buy particularly with Overstocks 10% discount.", 
    "We re pleased itch our purchase. They are comfortable an nice looking in our living room. I fall asleep easily in a reclined position. .", 
    "Thrilled with the chairs. We got two and they were shipped as promised. Love how you can track the shipment and just how accurate it is. They keep you up to date very nicely. Both chairs were shipped in separate boxes, both came at the same time. Unpacking them took more time than putting them together. The \"some assembly required\" was a snap - simple. There were no tools required, although it would have been easier with two people. I ordered them as a surprise to my husband so wanted to get them assembled before he came home. My husband was thrilled and even our grandchildren love them. I like that even though they are recliners they do not look like the traditional recliner. Of course, the kids love sitting in them and pushing them back to recline. I wanted a fabric covered rather than the leather because we have a cat who will claw. Once the leather is \"injured\" it's difficult to repair but I can at least recover if necessary. Or guess I could get rid of a cat too! =o) But that won't happen. Love the chairs and recommend them. Also love the wooden arms, which should hold up to \"dirty hands.\" Thanks Overstock.com. Once again you've made me very happy!", 
    "The chair was easy to assemble, and attractive - except for the armrest which had laminate peeling apart. Not something that can easily be fixed with glue and clamps either. I should have returned it, but it was really big and I destroyed the box when unpacking it. Spend a little more to get solid wood.", 
    "All this product needs is a little tine spent on tighting the screws and correct size washers used in the assembliy but for the price I can take some time adjusting and tighting screws. This chair is nice and priced fairly. I would purchase another one.", 
    "this is the second chair I bought from this site and I don't think I will be buying another,,furniture should be selected in person...", 
    "Being a smaller person, this recliner fits me well. It is compact and looks good in my room. I think the cover will clean up OK and it looks like it will wear well. It arrived very quickly. I took it out of the box and pushed the seatback into place. That's all there was to it. The arms are more of a painted look than a stain. Very dark and they do scratch easily. I've considered putting a coat of polyurethane varnish over them to help prevent scratches. Maybe I will. For the price and the convenience of not going many places to locate a smaller, compact recliner, I'm very pleased.", 
    "We ordered one of these chairs to try it out before ordering a second. The first showed up quickly, in good condition, went together easily. We're quite pleased with it. Very comfortable and it works well. We sprayed it with a fabric guard since it's light colored. Since we liked the first we ordered the second... unfortunately it was not delivered properly. The box had several holes in it and the backs of the wooden arms were very scratched and scuffed. Overstock immediately sent out a replacement - it should be here in a couple days. Meanwhile, we have this big ugly box sitting in our entry, waiting for the delivery people to come get it:) Hopefully the replacement chair will show up in good condition like the first!", 
    "I read other reviews and want to say this is a pretty chair. For me it is a little too easily soiled and our family is just two adults, and it is not a comfortable recliner for me (5'6 female). It is pretty though and I kept it. Really easy to assemble, only took me a few minutes. It is a bit too firm to relax in if you are watching a movie. It's not the kind of chair you sink in to but having said that it is a very pretty chair and it looks good in my room. I'm probably moving into a bedroom where it won't get a lot of use.", 
    "Cheap, the wood feet and arms were scratched, I had to tighten all of the bolts and screws. it is still very wobbly. The moisture package in the box split open and there were thousands of tiny bead all over my house. They still come out of the chair when we sit in it.", 
    "Very easy to put together, very comfortable. Great quality for the money. Doesn't take up too much space. Perfect for me.", 
    "Love this chair -it's a nice neutral color and a good size considering some recliners are so big! Assembly was a breeze and I received it in less than a week from the time I ordered. I am looking forward to reclining in this chair as often as possible!", 
    "A very nice product... I was actually pleasantly surprised by the condition of the chair. I'd never purchased anything like it on the net before. The chair has a bit of heft to it so be prepared. Feels like it will last a while.", 
    "The chair arrived on the day stated when we placed the order. It came in 2 pieces and was very easy to set up. The cloth is softer than I thought it would be. I expected more tweed texture. The mechanics work very well. My wife and I are not very tall and the chair fits us both very well. I would expect someone over 6' might hang over the foot rest. The cushion is firm but I expect with our 8 year bouncing around on it that will soften.", 
    "arms would like them to be brown not black brown is more rich looking if i good changes them i would", 
    "Pretty to look at but not very sturdy when sitting on it.", 
    "the chair is good for the price. it looks nice and fits small spaces well. I doubt the chair will hold up over time if we use it a lot. nevertheless, for what was paid, I think I got my money's worth.", 
    "This was really easy to assemble. The chair is incredible for the price. Has a very modern look. I saved hundreds of dollars and believe I got a similiar product to those that costs hundreds more. Highly recommend this chair.", 
    "The chair is beautiful and very comfortable. Is big enough for a man to sit in, but compact enough to fit in my bedroom.", 
    "I am delighted with my purchase. Even the packing was impressive. Great care was taken to see that no surface could be scratched. Both pieces were encased in gauze bags to keep out dust, then lots of extra packing insured intact delivery. The two pieces quite literally just snapped together in seconds. The fabric is of good and, apparently, sturdy quality. The color is exactly what I had envisioned and works with my other furniture. I especially like the curved wooden arms. It arrived within a week of purchase. I am 100% pleased with my purchase.", 
    "We bought the same reclining chairs from a furniture store in leather (name brand) and paid far more. This chair is just as good except far less expensive. We are very happy with the purchase.", 
    "I've had this chair in use for about two years. It doesn't have a huge amount of use and because the color is so light, an off-white, I keep it covered. It is an extremely comfortable chair for me...I'm 5'4\". Not sure how it would work for an extremely tall person. It's attractive and I've been very pleased with it.", 
    "Very pleased with my purchase I may be buying a 2nd chair, becasue they fit well in small places and are ver comfortable.", 
    "love these chairs. bought the sand for my tv area. wood is dark expresso, easy to assemble. plan to buy the red-patterned \"twin\" for my livingroom. I read negative reviews and am glad I have had all great experiences with Overstock.com Also, get the O credit card and save MORE!", 
    "We are so happy with the purchase of this recliner and my husband and I love it. I highly recommend this chair for both the price and the comfort.", 
    "I like this chair. However, I've had it a month now and it is already beginning to \"wiggle\" a little. It's not for a big person either. I'm small an short and the chair almost feels too small if I sit in it very long. For an occasional chair, I think it would be fine. It's a little hard to get the chair to recline because there is no handle. You have to use your strength to make the chair recline. An older person would not be able to do that. Also, there is a piece of material that attaches to the bottom of the seat of the chair when reclined, but it isn't tight so there is a \"hole\" in that area. My cat usually sits with me and she falls in the hall. The seat is firm and feels good to my back. I like the color, it coordinates well with my other furniture. The arms are a dark wood.", 
    "We bought these to put in front of our fireplace where they will get very little use. They are a bit stiff when you first sit on them (not sure if they will break in/soften with use) then...within seconds you are very comfortable. I don't want to get up once I sit in them & now I'm debating whether to use them in the family room instead of by the fireplace. Wonderful buy for the price. They seem solid. Arrived with NO damage.", 
    "Comfortable and good quality chair. Perfect for family room :)", 
    "Nice chair. Great value. Back tall enough to support your head. A little hard to push into reclining mode. Bought it for my husband to sleep more erect after shoulder surgery. I think he will be pleased. Everyone is fighting over it already. I agree with other reviews about packaging - the box was pretty beat up when we got it. Fortunately the chair was ok.", 
    "I ordered two of these chairs to go with a brown leather sectional I have in my living room. They look great! They are lighter than I thought they'd be but I actually prefer the lighter color. I am 5'4\" and can perfectly recline with my head resting on the head rest. My husband is 6'5\" so he can't rest his head on it but he still likes them. The back is pretty soft but the seat is a little firm but it's nothing normal use can't break in. I bought ScotchGuard and sprayed it on the chairs to protect them from any spills or stains. I am VERY happy with the purchase. Shipping was fast and the chairs were packaged well.", 
    "Very easy assembly. An extra hand will help, if you have one. It's a lot more comfortable than I expected for the price. Soft but supportive and the back is just high enough to make is a good nap chair when fully reclined. Great for just sitting too. It's a good choice and I'm glad I made it.", 
    "needed an extra chair for our living room in florida and this chair is just perfect for the room. Its not big and bulky like a lot of other chairs, and it is comfortable and small enough to fit in most rooms.", 
    "We needed something neutral so go with a brown leather couch. We have a small area that needed some attention. They were very easy to assemble and the construction and quality of the furniture added to our satisfaction. I have never ordered furniture online before and saved several hundred per chair on this purchase. The entire process was easy from order to on time delivery thru assembly. Great find!!!", 
    "I just received it today. Set up literally took 2 minutes by myself! I'm 5ft and very petite so very very easy to put together. The chair is so soft, comfortable and very easy to recline even for a short person. I definitely recommend it.", 
    "I ordered two recliners. They arrived at the same time and in two different boxes. One box was completely banged up and when we opened it, the chair was in bad condition. The fabric on the chair was damaged and a piece of wood was broken off on the back leg. The right arm was loose so we turned it over to discover a loose screw. My husband tried to tighten the screw but found in the process that the frame of the chair was broken. So here is the good news. I contacted Overstock and they sent a replacement chair. I received it a week later. I dealt with customer service reps Marilyn P. and Carolyn G. They were both very professional and courteous. We love the recliners. They are modern recliners that aren't big and bulky. So simple to assemble. Thanks to Overstock for correcting the problem... without a problem! It was refreshing.", 
    "this is a comfortable chair. Don't move it around too much, it became a bit shaky. Needed to be tightened up several times.", 
    "Never having received a piece of furniture by UPS, I had my concerns -- but the chair arrived right on time and in good condition. The arms weren't perfect, but nothing a black marker couldn't take care of. Set-up was remarkably easy, and I find the chair comfortable. Shorter people may find the arms a little high.", 
    "We are very pleased with this recliner. It doesn't take as much room as rnany recliners but does the same thing they do. Very comfortable and the color will go with any kind of sofa, etc. We have chocolate brown and it is perfect with that. Delivery was exactly as scheduled by UPS and was received when they said it would be and was in perfect condition. A good buy! Thanks, Overstock.", 
    "I had been wanting a reclining chair that wasn't a recliner and have been researching for several months. I love the design and comfort of this chair. Assembly was very easy, joining the top piece to the bottom piece by simply clicking into place, then removing a strap that prevented reclining during shipment. Honestly, it took much longer to get it out of the shipping box! The chair is very comfortable and reclines at the right angle for me. Great modern styling matches my other furniture perfectly. It is a great chair and money well spent!", 
    "It is perfect, and more comfortable than I expected", 
    "Chair is comfortable and of good quality. Even though it was well packed, it arrived with a gouge in the arm.", 
    "the chair was just perfect very happy with the fact that the color match the pictures.", 
    "Chair came packed very well. Only one small ding on the wood that you cannot see at all...a little Old English with stain took care of that, but it probably would not have needed even that. No other damage. It was protected very well. Three simple instructions to assemble the chair...and gals, don't let your husbands put it together...they don't read instructions! The mechanism on the bottom of the chair had a tie on it, so remove it. Went together within 3 minutes. COMFORTABLE!!!! Color matched decor perfectly. It took me longer to unpack it and dispose of the heavy cardboard box, than it did to put it together. Wonderful chair at an unbelievable price. I would highly recomend this chair. Doesn't take a lot of space, and works great for a female that is 5' 6\" tall! And my husband, 6' 2\" fits ok too. It is my chair though!", 
    "We bought this chair for our daughter who has a small apartment. It works perfectly in her space and is very comfortable.", 
    "We love these chairs. We wanted a recliner that had a more contemporary feel and was not bulky the way most recliners are. The open arms really add to this feel. Comfortable in all positions. Great back support for medium to tall adult. Seat is a little too deep for my short mother in law. Color matches the color in the catalog well and it is well priced.", 
    "I read reviews prior to purchasing this chair - everyone agreed it was a good chair for the money. And that is exactly what this is! I love it! I didn't assemble so I can't comment on that part of it because my boyfriend put it together before I get home! It looks wonderful! I'ts very comfy for a reading chair or watching tv --- I have no compliants and I am sure glad I made this purchase! Definitely would recomend anyone to purchase it! Happy relaxing.....", 
    "I hesitated to order because I really did not want wooden arms (rather fabric). I went ahead because I felt comfortable with the prior reviews. The chair is very sturdy and the fabric and overall construction are good quality. I was not terribly pleased with the wooden arms (mostly the finish). The finish is not glossy and feels \"flaky.\" It's for this reason that I rate the overall quality of the chair as \"good.\" I will use the chair, but I've actually draped a couple of small throws over the arms to soften the feel.", 
    "We received the the two chairs we orders so fast. The boxes they came in were very thin and beat up. We thought the chairs would be damaged, but the chairs were in great condition. A few scratches on the wood legs, but not bad. The reviews we read that stated if you are short your feet do not touch the ground when sitting were right. Chairs are some what comfortable. We knew that from other reviews. They fit the need we have for them. This is the second time we bought furniture from Overstock and we are very pleased and will do business with them again.", 
    "We all love it, I gave it to my newly married son and his wife for Christmas. Fits the girls 5'7\" very well and for the taller men, 6'2\", just as comfortable. Love the dark wood and modern look. Hopefully it holds up well for many years.", 
    "I saw this chair in a discount store for 500 I looked on line and there it was! Nearly half price , and no tax or delivery fee so less than half price. Not exactly the same color but I had pined over this chair for months. It is so comfortable, it's perfect for me. Looks great with my red sofa. I recommend it. I have not had it long so cannot attest for it's longevity. Very easy assembly.", 
    "Dealing with Overstock on shipping was a great experience especially for fuirniture", 
    "very easy to put together (5 minutes - really!!); not bulky like a typical recliner; color is perfect; very very comfortable!! highly recommend.", 
    "Great chairs with good cushion support. They were a bit larger than we expected, so that was a nice surprise. Easy to assemble. A little tough reclining back, but we'll get used to that. Not ideal for anyone over 5'11\" without using an additional neck pillow. But otherwise, very nice and great value.", 
    "This is a great looking chair. I bought it for my bedroom but if the color was different,I would put it in my living room. It is super heavy. I'm 5'6\" and the fit is perfect. The only drawback is that it's hard to recline it. I'm very satisfied with it.", 
    "Recliner very easy to put together. Only one simple step. Very pleased with the comfort and the price was a fraction of what I had previously paid for another recliner. My pets also love it and we compete to have the opportunity to sit in it. The size of the recliner is perfect for me as I am a short person and the area that the recliner needs in the room is minimal.", 
    "I was very pleased. It came exactly when promised and was exactly what I was looking for. The arms match my bedroom furniture and the size is perfect for my sitting area.", 
    "Comfortable recliner. Well made. On time delivery", 
    "We needed extra chairs but had no idea of the quality that we'd be receiving! The look is very sleek and modern, and the comfort with the reclining option is incredible! We actually rearranged the whole room so that they would be the main focus. Not only do I recommend, I recommend getting TWO. Symmetry!", 
    "items were delivered slightly damaged, scraps & chips on wooded arm rests", 
    "Chair is comfortable and well assembled. I would recommend this to all.", 
    "Looks good, good quality for the price you pay! very easy to assemble.", 
    "Very comfortable and reclines nicely without looking like a typical recliner. Bigger than I thought it would be. I like the color and the feel of the material. Easy to put together.", 
    "My whole transaction in purchasing this chair was pleasant. Product arrived on time and in 2 pcs, just put one into the other and the chair was done. Very comfortable and great looking. Another great product from Overstock.", 
    "I sent this chair to my daughter and son-in-law and they love it! Very comfortable and nice looking.", 
    "We are enjoying this chair. I have decided to buy another one, maybe in a different color.", 
    "This is the most comfortable chair ever. It looks amazing and you can't even tell it's a recliner. I have found my spot! I was nervous to buy a chair online but it is perfect. No real assembly required...easy and beautiful!", 
    "I was coming to visit my son who was going through a relationship breakup. Most of the furnishings had been removed and I was worried that there wouldn't be any place to rest my arthritic bones. The chair arrived with one day of my arrival and my son assembled it in 5 minutes. We both love the chair (wish I could afford 2!). It doesn't look like a recliner. There's no exposed mechanism, but it's super easy to tip back into recline mode. My son likes a minamilistic, Asian look and this fits the bill beautifully.", 
    "I ordered two of these recliners after seeing very similar ones at 3 different furniture stores (one regional chain, one national chain, and one local store) that were going for $XXX-$XXX (and in some cases in fabric with a horrific pattern). We were looking for two chairs to round out our living room. My husband loves recliners and I hate the look of recliners. This recliner has great lines and the open wooden hand rests make it look a lot more streamlined than other \"hidden\" recliners that I have owned. There is a bit of \"puffiness\" to the seat back (lumbar support) of this chair, but it by no means looks like an overstuffed recliner. I will take others' advice and use a furniture fabric protector to help keep the material looking clean. The look of these chairs goes really well with our deep red leather sofa with modern lines. The chair was easy to assemble and arrive quickly. Each box is very large and weighs 86 pounds. Luckily, my living room is right off my front porch so we opened the boxes outside and hauled the pieces in. One of the legs had poked through the packaging, but it was not damaged. There were two scratches on one of the arm rests (one was about 1.5 inches long), but a black permanent marker fixed that problem.", 
    "I purchased 2 recliner chairs for my bedroom and they are nice and comfortable. The price was great compared to other chairs, its a great value. They arrived in less than a week and took very little time to set up. When you see the chairs, you can't tell that they recline, that was my main reason for picking them. You sit down and lean back while holding the arms and the chair reclines, and they also close easily. The color is like a sand/tan color and the arms are really dark brown, it's a nice contrast. I really like the look and the feel of the chairs and would recommend to others.", 
    "Pretty chair, too bad about the shipping. If it had arrived in good shape, I would have kept it!", 
    "This is a very comfortable chair that was very easy to put together. It looks great. It does need to be a little bit farther from the wall in order to recline than the recliner it replaced, but it still fits very well in my small living room. The price was far better than similar chairs (almost identical!) that I found elsewhere--on the web and in local stores. All in all, I'm very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "First, Overstock's ordering and fast service is a huge plus for me. I received this chair in record time. The color was exactly as shown and the positive reviews didn't disappoint. Although the chair is a bit larger than I would have liked, I'll make do. I bought this chair for a small corner in my bedroom, and it's a good addition. The material is cozy and the chair is comfy. What more can you ask?", 
    "The only problem with this chair is opening the reclinner part. I have arthritis in my hands. But, I manage it. It fits my frame perfectly. I'm 5'3\" and 124lb. It is so comfortable. No damage was noted on arrival and it makes a wonderful knitting chair for my bedromm. Thank, again for a quality product.", 
    "We took our time and finally decided on your item. We didn't want a large, overstuffed chair to take up more room. Your chair fit the bill and is so stylish for our taste. It looks like it could have been purchased with the livingroom set we already have. We were so excited about it, we bought another chair to compliment the theme. Way to go, Overstock!", 
    "Nice size chair - comfortable and great color. Will buy another when I have more room.", 
    "This is a good fir for my back. I am 5 ft 6 inches. Provides good lumbar support and with it's open wood arms is not obtrusive in the space. The only thing I don't like is that the arms are high for me but overall a nice chair.", 
    "The important fact is that the chair is now being used and enjoyed. The box came all torn up with holes in it, which actually didn't surprise me since I had read the reviews before ordering this product. Inside the box the chair was well wrapped, but not well enough. With one screw missing, and the other three floating around the box, I was puzzled since the product was supposed to be put together without any tools. Since my husband had hip surgery, and I bought this chair for him to recover afterwards, a carpenter friend came over and fixed the problem. Without these screws in place the chair would have been a safety hazard for anybody who reclined in it. One leg is damaged, but better than an armrest. I will fix it with some black paint. A wooden side bar underneath is also badly chipped. My husband had quite a few visitors, and all of them had to try out our new chair. From short people to about 6', all of them commented how comfortable the chair is.", 
    "Love, Love, Love this chair. Perfect fit for the room. Would definitely consider a second one.", 
    "Like the chairs - nice size, work well, great price! Had some difficulty with the original order as the arms were loose but the company was very helpful and made arrangements for the chair to be picked up and a replacement sent. Wood was very nice and am happy with these chairs. The mechanics work well and they slide back and forth very comfortably. I am 5'4\" and they fit me well - my husband is 6' and it fits him nicely as well - no problems - would recommend to anyone!", 
    "We have had this chair for a few days and have no complaints. Both my husband and I have sat in it...I am 5'3\" and he is 6'0\"...and it fit both of us comfortably. It reclines easily and goes back to sitting position just as easily. The fabric is soft to the touch. The chair is easily put together and it took us longer to unpack it from the carton than it did to put the chair together. I think that we will enjoy it for a long, long time, and I will be ordering other chairs from Overstock! You cannot go wrong ordering this chair...", 
    "Great lumbar support. Purchased it for a senior who is a little frail and you must use your back to recline, no lever on chair. Because they are frail, they need assistance to recline. Leg motion will upright chair easy enough. So my problem is more on a personal lever. I am considering purchasing this chair for myself. It came packaged with care. The chair was covered with a cloth to protect the upholstery. I think you will love it. It does not have the the overpowering recliner chair look...thank goodness.", 
    "I ordered two of these recliners for my sunroom. I was a little leery since this was the first time I ordered firniture from overstock.com. They came in about five days and I was pleasantly surprised. They were easy to put together and they look very nice. They are firm and comfortable, except the back is a little short for my husband who is 6'. The color is very light so I sprayed them with scotchguard which worked well. I love the wooden arms which are almost black and go with my decor. They are very nice chairs for the price and I would recommend them to other customers.", 
    "Happy with this recliner. I bought it on a whim. It's a bit bigger and heavier than I expected- which is great. Very comfy. Needs a bit more space behind for reclining than some others.", 
    "We have been getting new furniture. Found a chair I liked at Ethan Allen for $1600, then looked on overstock and found almost the same thing for under $300. It arrived within a few days, was easy to assemble, and is very comfortable. I no longer fall asleep watching TV because I am not lying down, but am comfortably reclining. I have short legs so most couches are not comfortable to sit on without tucking my legs under me. This chair is awesome. Eventually I plan to move it into the bedroom when the new living room furniture arrives. I would highly recommend it!", 
    "I ordered two of these recliners to put in the TV room. They worked out great.", 
    "The chair looks great aesthetically, feels comfy, is priced right and is not too big and \"poofy\" like some recliners. The color is light and lightens up a smaller space. It arrived quickly and well packaged although there was a minor scuff on the back of the arm rest that was easily touched up. We love it! It's a lot of chair for the money but, you can see that it is not a top quality chair. Some of the lines are not as well padded as they might be and structurally it could be made a little stiffer. This is not to say that the chair wobbles or deforms in any way. Someone who is a little heavier or of large stature may have a problem with the minor lack of stiffness. Other than that, the chair is a great buy.", 
    "Chair arrived quickly. Box was damaged, but chair was fine. Chair is completely assembled except you push the back of the chair onto some hinges and snap in place. There were a few marks on the chair cushion, but they came right out with warm water. A minor scratch on the wood arm, but for the price, you can't really beat it. I think the chair is really comfy and looks great!", 
    "Would give this a 5 but think it is important to note that I am a 5'8\" female and I can barely put my feet on the ground. I have never sat in a chair with this seat height. Other reviews are accurate...the chair is quite firm to sit on, which is why I gave it a shot. I have a bad back and thought it might be good. It is. Also wish the back did not go back as soon as the foot bed rises. Other than that, great buy. very timely delivery.", 
    "Love this recliner, perfect for someone 5\"8/12\" and smaller. it went together very quickly and easily. the only problem was a stain on the seat, which showed up really bad since it is light. we used spot remover and cleaned it up, could not figure out how in the world the stain had gotten on it, it looks fine after the clean up and looks wonderful with the other furniture.And how wonderful to have it delivered to the house.", 
    "The chair is very comfortable. The only thing I wish is that it have more recliner positions. You either have to sit up or lay down- and when you are down you have to use a pillow behind your head. I still really like the chair, and do not regret getting it- and do recommend it, more as a regular chair than a recliner. Also, the price is right.", 
    "I bought two of these. They are beatiful and exactly as pictured. I recommend spraying them with a fabric protectant since the color is so light. My husband stained one of them with a bleeding cut he had on his foot before I could spray them and I am still trying to figure out what to use to clean the blood off that will not discolor the fabric - so spray them!! Great value - I priced around and went to several furniture stores looking for recliners that don't look like recliners before I chose these. I paid about $400 less for these and they are as sturdy and well designed as ones that were higher priced. I love overstock. i was concerned when they arrived and one of the boxes was practically desintegrated, but the chair inside was well wrapped in plastic and undamaged, thankfully. Very pleased and I recommend overstock highly.", 
    "It lookes great in my family room, very comfortable, easy to recline. I purchased it as an accent chair and it serves its purpose very well.", 
    "Pleasantly surprised at the comfort level of this recliner. It doesn't take alot of floor space either. The back section all the way down to the footrest is firm and supportive. One of the wooden arms was slightly damaged (just the finish) and Overstock readily gave me a partial credit since I had no plans to ship back the chair for replacement. I can fix the flaw with a bit of 400 grit sandpaper and some Old English furniture polish. All in all I'm very please with the recliner and Overstock's customer service!", 
    "I would recommend this chair to anyone it's very comfortable and easy to assemble.", 
    "Liked the simplicity of the chair; doesn't look like a clunky recliner. Could only guess as to the color (I ordered sand) since if I tilted my laptop screen, it was one color and if the screen was upright, it was another color. Took a chance and am very pleased with the outcome. It is really a cream color and a very nice fabric. I had requested a fabric swatch, but Overstock doesn't provide them. The chair arrived quickly; the delivery person and I got it into the house (80lbs) and it took me all of ten seconds to attach the back to the seat. (an hour to dismantle the box). I had priced recliners online and at furniture stores, but none were as nice, attractive and inexpensive as this one. Factor in taxes and local delivery charges and I reckon I saved hundreds and got a really nice chair. You cannot beat Overstock for value.", 
    "chair is supper comfortable and reviews were spot on...i woudl read the other reviews for yourself, they are accurate and i agree with them. firm, good for tall people, does not take up too much space, very modern look, firm cusihios, my husband falls asleep easily in the chair, we fought over chair so much that i ordered another one for myself!", 
    "the quality, the color and style was what i was looking for ..the only thing is that it takes a lot of room to recline but all in all, a very comfortable chair", 
    "Great & comfy quality recliner at a tremendous price!", 
    "I bought this chair as a replacement for a comparably priced recliner that did not hold up to daily use. So far this chair is comfortable and looks good in my room.", 
    "It is very comfortable. I wanted a chair that didn't look like a recliner for my bedroom and this fits the bill great. I am only 5'3 and it fits me very nicely. If I was tall, I think the chair would have my feet spill over the end. But it is everything I hoped for and I like it.", 
    "THIS IS THE PERFECT CHAIR FOR SMALL SPOTS -PLUS COMPFORT", 
    "I have chronic back pain. This recliner is much more confortable than the one I replaced. At first, I had difficulty pushing on the arm rests to get the chair to recline. The mechanism has loosened up and is now easy to recline. I recomment it to anyone who has backpain and wants a firm upholstered recliner.", 
    "The chair came promptly and in good condition. My only complaint is that UPS just left the chair outside with no notice. I happened to be home but if I had not, the chair was left with no protection from the Texas weather except the cardboard box.", 
    "This chair is easy to set up and sits very comfortable. It has a very good cusion for back. It reclines down and up easily. We all like it.", 
    "I was looking for a recliner that was not typical (heavy, oveersised and large) and these are perfect. The clean lines of this recliner, along with the more compact size, fits beautifly in our home. I purchased two to replace the large leather recliners I had. I am impressed with the comfort and style of these chairs. Getting them at such a good price was an added bonus. I highly recommend this chair.", 
    "Amazed at speed of delivery---just a few days. Easy assembly---one step. Very comfortable. Great choice for our living room.", 
    "I needed a comfortable recliner that wouldn't take up too much room. For its size this recliner is very comfortable with good lumbar support and has a sleek modern look. (I did not want a big puffy looking chair!) It came in two large pieces that locked together, so I was able to assemble it myself without any assistance or tools. My two small complaints with it are: 1) I Scotchguarded the fabric and some of the Scotchguard got on the wooden arm and mildly marred the finish. This is not a big issue for me, but if you do Scotchguard it, cover the wooden arms! 2) It has two reclining positions, the second one being all the way flat, but it does NOT remain in the fully recumbent position without effort on your part. This is not as issue for me, but if you want a recliner that goes all the way back to flat this chair isn't for you.", 
    "Love this recliner. I wanted a recliner for my living room but didn't want something big and bulky like a lot of recliners are. This one fit the bill. I had been looking at other web sites that featured this particular chair, but couldn't find the perfect fabric choice. For the price and color choice, I am very happy with this chair. The only feature I would change on this chair would be the height of the back of the chair. I'm pretty tall (5'9\") and my head just barely fits when I am in the reclined position.", 
    "We think this is a great chair. Its comfortable and easy to recline. A bit bigger than we thought it might be, but works great!", 
    "We love this chair. It is very comfortable and doesn't look like a recliner. My only complaint is i wish the foot rest would come up without having to recline. I find it great for watching tv or taking a nap in the reclined position. I don't think it would work for a short person. I love that the seat height is high enough that it is not a strain on my knees to get out of the chair. Most furniture is too low. I searched and searched for a chair with a higher seat. The chair arrived with a crack in a rear leg. Overstock offered to replace it but unfortuneately the chair was out of stock. I could have received a refund but decided to keep the chair and receive a 40.00 credit from Overstock. Customer service was great.", 
    "2 months since delivery and very pleased. Looking to add a second chair to balance room and will repurchase this chair when available. Thank you OS", 
    "I like the upholstery on this recliner, it's firm and comfortable. I am only 5'6\" though and could not comfortably recline completely - there's insufficient head support. If you don't ever want to recline completely, this is perfect.", 
    "bought this chair and liked it so much bought a second one. These are just as advertised and worth every penny.", 
    "Package arrived broken box was a mess. If it rained chair would have been destroyed. Product is great. If you are over 5'9 then head will not be supported without pillow. Chair is two parts and very easy to put together. Perfect for me. Everyone loves it. Arms are surprisingly comfy.", 
    "The fabric is lighter and shows no brown (which still worked for my decor). The fabric is not as tight as it could be in the seat area and the chair back had wrinkles that I had to steam out. The structure and quality are good for the cost. The chair is very comfortable to sit in.", 
    "I am so happy with this chair I immediately purchased a second one! So easy to assemble and it looks way more expensive than it is. Very comfortable, I nurse my daughter in it, and it matches our Lane couch perfectly. Very stylish and the fact that it reclines is just an added plus. you will not regret this purchase!!", 
    "This chair has a sophisticated look but is functional. It's not a bulky recliner, I didn't have room for that. It has sleek, slim lines, yet it's comfortable - I've fallen asleep several times watching television. I'm 5'7'' and there's plenty of room, although a large or tall person might find it a bit confining or short. The reclining mechanism works well with just a gentle push. It arrived fast and was a breeze to assemble (it took longer to get the packing materials off than putting the pieces together.) It's a great value and perfectly completes my living room. I am delighted.", 
    "This is the first time I bought larger furniture online without seeing and touching in a store. I wanted a smaller scale recliner for my husband that would not dominate the room. He loves it!", 
    "Love this recliner. I wish I had bought it years ago. Saw one in a local store for price the price. Buy it you'll like it!", 
    "Bought this chair for my husband who was recovering from knee surgery. He is 6 ft. tall with a fairly large frame. He has been very comfortable in the chair and spends lots of time in in for the last 3 weeks. Couldn't ask for better. It took 2 minutes to assemble the back, longer to disposse of the box! Overstock, you've done it again!! Thanks for a great product that surpassed my expectations!", 
    "THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I'VE ORDERED ONE OF THESE CHAIRS. THE 1ST TIME FOR MY DAD'S SITTING AREA IN HIS BEDROOM. THIS TIME FOR MY HUSBAND. BOTH SAY THESE ARE THE BEST CHAIRS FOR LOUNGING, OR SITTING. STURDY, EASY TO RECLINE, HIGH BACK FOR RESTING THE HEAD. GOOD DEAL AROUND.", 
    "I wanted a small recliner with modern lines and this fits the bill beautifully. Very comfortable; recliner mechanism works smoothly; back might be a little low for someone over medium height. I have rarely ordered furniture this way -- not sure how easy it would be to return. Fortunately, I have no intention of returning this one!", 
    "this chair is a replacement for the original which was the same except well worn! The chair is a recliner but does not take up a lot of room. My husband is a good size man and loves the way the chair fits. The chair is well constructed. When I saw the sale on a new chair I ordered it for my husband's birthday. A real winner.", 
    "LOVE LOVE this and I'm considering a second one! Great chair for the price. I'm sitting in it now and loving it. I'm a little worried about my kids and the light color (...and yesterday when I was showing friend I saw they have two new darker colors! Darnit!). I'm 5'8\", 160 lbs and it's perfect for me. The color is \"off-white\" but not beige. It's super neutral and looks god with a small pillow on it.", 
    "Just like the video shows the recliner was easy to assembly. It comes in two pieces and easily snaps together. The quality is great and will look great in a formal livingroom or bedroom. The plus is that it is very comfy and easily recline and retracts. Would recommend anytime.", 
    "Our chair arrived so quickly. it's great, comfortable, easy to put together. The wood had a couple of dents/scratches, but with some stain easily repaired. One black mark on the back of the chair which doesnt matter so much. I felt so good about the price that I didn't send it back or complain, but I still can't believe this huge chair shipped in less than a week for 2.95! i'm on the overstock team!", 
    "The first chair received was in a broken up box with punched holes and tape all over. Customer service sent us another chair all put together except for the back of the seat and that was easy to assemble. Thanks for the good merchandise, and great customer service!!", 
    "The chair was easy to put together. The fabric is very nice. If I had a complaint it would be that it was a little too high for my short legs. When you recline in it I've found it to be very comfortable.", 
    "Great chair for the price. The color is soft beige. Arms are dark mahogany color with elegant curve. Very easy to operate even for 9 months pregnant woman like me who does not have any abdominal muscle.", 
    "I bought two of these recliners after seeing them in my local furniture store for twice the price. I purposely waited a few months before writing this review to make sure they would hold up, and they have. They look great, are very comfortable and are nice quality. We use them every day and they look new. I put them together myself; they come almost completely assembled so the job was done in a few minutes. The fabric color is a little darker than the photo. I'd call it a true tan. We scotch-guarded the fabric ourselves when they first arrived and have had no problems at all with staining. These are great recliners, don't hesitate. Shipping was really fast too!", 
    "Like everyone said, the arm of the chair was damaged in shipping. It's annoying, but not as annoying as boxing it up and shipping it back would be. Luckily, the damage in toward the back of the right arm near where it meet the chair so it's not super noticeable. Also noteable, there are exposed screws on the arm of the chair right about where your elbow hits. It's not super noticeable, but not ideal either. The quality seems decent and we saw these same chairs at a major furniture store for more than double the price... so - I still feel like it was a good purchase. I guess we'll see how it holds up!", 
    "Love this chair. Product far exceeded my expectations.", 
    "I was very pleased with this product. It arrived in just a few days and was very well packed. It was a snap to assemble, only two steps. It also came with a packing strap for future moves. Everyone who has seen it thus far is very impressed. You cannot beat it for the price. Two of my friends have since purchased one for their homes.", 
    "A VERY GOOD CHAIR FOR THE PRICE. COMFORTABLE, EASY TO USE. SIMPLE ASSEMBLY.", 
    "This is a wonderful chair and extremely easy to put together. If the headrest was 3 or four inches higher, it would be perfect for people over 5' 7\".", 
    "This recliner was purchased for a vacation rental and will get lots of use. It was incredibly easy to assemble, merely placing the back section onto 2 braces that protrude from the back of the seat. Simply pushing back while holding the arm rests and you're reclining effortlessly and comfortably. Construction seems sturdy and we look forward to years of use.", 
    "Great chair for the price. Arrived in just three days. UPS was awesome and delivered the chair upstairs. easy to put together.", 
    "I looked and looked and looked for an appropriate pair of chairs for my sunroom and this fit the bill perfectly. The only fault I find is that they are not as solidly sturdy as I would prefer, but for the price and the intended purpose, they are entirely satisfactory.", 
    "Love this recliner!! UPS brought it to my front door, it was wrapped very well and was easy to put together. I did it myself and the hardest part was unwrapping it. I am a tall and large person with knee problems and I thought it might be to small for me but I bought it any way because the seat was 20 inches high. Well it is working out fine. The recliner is well made and I feel very stable well I am sitting in it. It is also easy for me to get in and out of it. Oh ya, I like the price too!! Thanks O.CO", 
    "This chair reclines easily and is a perfect fit for my 5' height with additional head and foot length. There is a pre-adjusted reclining position; however, the user can exert some additional pressure and achieve a super relaxed supine position. The compactness and style of the chair can accommodate modern and traditional styles and suit numerous color schemes. This is not an overstuffed chair but has firm support that I know will provide me with comfort for a long time. I am considering purchasing another for guests who enjoy reclining while watching TV.", 
    "I was looking for a chair for a small room that had no real purpose. I wanted a chair that would be comfortable but not bulky in the space. I hoped to find one that was a recliner or had a nice ottoman that wasn't too big. I wanted clean lines but not too modern. I wanted one that wouldn't be too hard to assemble. I got all of that with this chair. The reviews were great about comfort, size, ease of assembly. And accurate. Everyone loves the look but are amazed at the comfort--it is a very comfortable chair that has turned my no-purpose room into comfortable and nice looking reading room. I'm still looking for a table to go with it and I'm sure I will find it on Overstock.", 
    "This recliner is everything I hoped it would be. It arrived in near perfect condtion. It is everytLophing I hoped it would be--good looking with supportive, comfortable seat cushion. The price made this chair a great bargain!", 
    "We LOVE this chair. Finding a modern lookling recliner at this price is unheard of. We were going to purchase another one but it i out of stock, please Overstock bring it back!", 
    "Delivery, as usual, quick and efficient. The two pieces \"snapped\" together without a problem. Looks very nice in my living room, is as comfortable as I'd hoped. You've done it again Overstock!!", 
    "The chair arrived the day I was told to expect delivery. It was easy as could be to slide the back on. It looks so nice and is the perfect size for the corner of my living room. And it is very comfortable. I enjoy sitting in it reading, knitting or watching TV. First time I ever purchased furniture over the internet, and I was pleasantly surprised.", 
    "very happy with recliner, not too hard to put together and it is just the right size for a small room that I wanted it for. Nice piece of furniture.", 
    "I purchased this chair based on the reviews it had received. I was not disappointed. The quality for the price is exceptional. The assemby was simple too. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.", 
    "Love this chair. Perfect for my mom who is 81. No problem reclining or kicking the bottom back when she gets out. She operates with her arms and that works. Nice quality Very easy to assemble too. LOVE IT", 
    "Bought 2 of the recliners and they are wonderful. Very comfortable and give good lumbar support. My husband and I really feel they are great for the price, compared to other brands that were very expensive.", 
    "I bought this chair for my elderly mother after she broke her hip and found that she could not deal with the low arms on her old recliner. This one has great support, arms are high enough for a person in a walker to navigate, and the mechanism for reclining is very smooth and doesn't require a lot of effort. I was so happy to get this at the price offered. What a great value!", 
    "Let me first say that my parents had purchased these recliners in a different color for their home, so I was lucky enough to see these in person prior to purchase. My brother is about 6'3 /190 lbs and I figured if he could use them comfortably they may be a good deal. I did watch the pricing for a month or so before purchasing as the rates ketp increasing. The price finally dropped and I had a $$$ off coupon so got a really good deal for the pair. We have an older home with a smallish living room, but they fit just right as far as their size goes. The tan color is very easy to work into any color scheme and I especially liked the dark wood of the arm rests they are stylish without the bulky look of a typical recliner. My main concern was the assembly. My husband got them while I was at work and was able to assemble them simply on his own. * This is an important note and he is not the most handy when it comes to that sort of thing, God love him. My only complaint ( and I consider this rather minor, but worth mentioning ) is that when you recline them fully they do not stay put. Not a huge deal but can be annoying if you are trying to say nap. I would not hesitate to recommed this purchase to anyone interested in these chairs!", 
    "I never write reviews, on any products I purchase on line, but I have to say I was very happy with my purchase! I was able to track it, it came in a few days(which rarely happens with other on-line companies) I have used. And best of all ... the video shows you how simple it is to assemble.I will continue to use Overstock.com and have told several of my friends about the great service,and products Thanks Again I love my Chair", 
    "THIS CHAIR IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND MORE THAN I EXPECTED. IT WAS SO EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND LOOKS GREAT IN MY BEDROOM. BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT COLOR, I SPRAYED IT WTH SCOTCH GUARD.", 
    "Like others, I was a bit wary about ordering furniture on line. What a lovely surprise this chair is. One of the arms had slight damage, but fortunately it was in an unseen area. This is a very comfortable recliner. I am going to wait to see how the cushions hold up with use and if they retain their comfort level and plushness, then I will order another. As others have said, this chair is not beige like the photo--really has more yellow in it. However, it is still neutral enough to go with most decors. Love this chair so far!", 
    "It is a comfortable recliner and is stylish. I am not a big fan of bulky lazy boy type recliner, and this one fits better with our modern decor in the living room. The only problem was that the leg of the recliner came damaged, and some parts of fabrics had some wear from rubbing on the package during the shipping. Overstock customer service dealt with my complaints on these issues very well. Overall, I will recommend this product to others.", 
    "It arrived within 7 days of ordering. Very easy to put together. Very Large Box, but the UPS man put in my garage for me. Looks like it cost way more.", 
    "Like everyone else, we were hesitant to order chairs on line. We read all the great reviews and decided to just go for it. We are SO happy we did and absolutely love these chairs. They are extrememly comfortable and give a nice contemporary look. The fabric is very soft to the touch. They recline in two positions and fit both of us just fine. The reclining action is very easy to open and close - a problem we had experienced with other (higher priced) chairs. The color is exactly like the picture ( it is lighter than the little swatch pic). They are not a \"cheap chair\" even tho' they are low priced. You will NOT be disappointed in these. We searched every store for 200 miles and didn't find anything that can compare in look and price. We got two chairs which arrived in good condition within 3 days. There was a little strap made with the same fabric that works great as a decorating swatch for paint, drapes, etc. This was our first purchase...Thank you Overstock for having such a great chair and an even better price. Couldn't be happier!", 
    "Just ordered this chair and it's really a great buy. My husband and I searched for months to find a recliner that I could agree to. I did not want a recliner that looked like a \"recliner\" but could double like a chair, and alas we found this. It's super confortable and for the price you can't beat it. It is large so make sure you do your measurement for the space before purchasing. It's easy to put together and works really well. Great job Overstock!", 
    "I purchased this chair and received it within 7 days, its very comfortable sitting in it or reclining in it, it doesn't look cheap its very classy looking. The price is awesome and with the $2.95 shipping it can't be beat. I could not find anything comparable in stores in my home town. I am tempted to buy another one for our condo. If they had it in green I probably would.", 
    "Assembly was so easy! Takes like 2 minutes! It is a bit bigger than I thought. The back is more bulky than the picture so it is not as slick as I thought it would look. My personal preference so others might not find it that way. But I guess function vs. look, it has to be more padded to be comfy for a recliner. Overall, love the chair! Good quality and the fabric is nice to touch. Reclining mechanism works really well too.", 
    "Overstock did it again! This recliner is absolutely beautiful. I love the size of the chair and the sleek design. The color is neutral and is a nice addition to my existing furniture. The wooden arms are stained in a rich dark espresso color. Very comfortable and and so easy to assemble. The chair was packaged so nicely - thrilled to see no damage in shipping. I would recommend this item to anyone. Thanks to overstock I have a quality product for a very reasonable price. I've been shopping the local furniture store for something like this for the past year and couldn't afford their pricing. This is a great find-- I love it. .", 
    "Looked at many recliners for my art deco livingroom. Some were as much as $2300. Eveything affordable was huge and overtuffed. I ordered this chair as a last resort, worried that it would not be comfortable. I should't have worried! It's more comfortable than the ones for over $2000. It is smaller in scale and fits perfectly in my space. Assembly is a no brainer.....took 2 minutes. The color is neutral so adding a neck roll in any color looks great. Only problem? I can't get my husband out of it !!!", 
    "Highly recommend this chair. Wasn't sure about ordering furniture online but after reading all the reviews about this chair went ahead and ordered. I love this chair, bought 2 of them and they are perfect. Color from picture matched exactly, great lumbar support, very comfortable. Too easy to put together, was able to snap the back onto the chair by myself in 2 minutes. Came packed very well, the hardest part was unwrapping it :)", 
    "It looks much better than picture on site..I really like this chair. It's very comfortable. It's gives great back support while sitting. It has two reclining positions. it's a compliment to any decor, I have the chair in my bedroom.", 
    "I was looking for a recliner that looked more contemporary. I didnt want a big, bulky lazy boy. This recliner matched exactly one that I was looking at at ****. However the one at *** cost $600 and was going to take 6-8 weeks for delivery. I took a chance on this recliner based on the reviews. I have purchased from Overstock before and usually the product you see is not what you get. In this case I was pleasantly surprised. The chair arrived in two parts and simply requires you to slide the back into the base. The color was what I expected -both the fabric and arms. There were a couple of marks on the arms but you can't see them once you put the chair together. The chair is very comfortable and fits both me- I am 5'3 and my husband who is 6 ft. The chair reclines into two positions easily. Overall, very happy with my purchase.", 
    "These chairs are simply gorgeous... and they are comfy recliners to boot. They were packaged very well and were assembled in 2 minutes with no tools - simply slip the back part onto the base and voila! The wood arms are substantial and the whole look is really appealing. Everyone who sees them comments.", 
    "We were considering the purchase of a La-z-Boy recline that is similar in style to this chair, however the price tag was $1100 for one chair. This chair is VERY comparable to the La-z-Boy (except there weren't as many fabric options). It does not feel or look cheap. This chair is comfortable and easy to put together. It is a FANTASTIC value and we're very please with it.", 
    "I ordered this chair based on the previous reviews and am not disappointed. The color is definitely a sand color and fits perfectly with the other pieces in my living room. I love that it doesn't take up much space AND that it's a recliner and quite comfortable! It was very easy to put together and the delivery time was amazingly fast!", 
    "This chair was just what I was looking for - a small, comfortable recliner. It is a little homely; it looks better in the picture than in my den. It is lightweight and I can easily move it. Assembly was easy and delivery, as usual, was fast and worry free.", 
    "I ordered 2 of these recliners. It only took about a week to get to me. Very easy assembly. They are comfortable and attractive. I would highly recommend these recliners. Thank you Overstock! I will order from you again.", 
    "I have walked a dozen furniture stores and finally found the recliner that was comfortable to me (have terrible back pain) and it turned out to be double the price of this one. This recliner is very comfy and the color goes with everything I have. It is a nice fabric in a light color beige with dark wood arms. It does not take up much room even when sitting back in it. I love it, love it.", 
    "I hate recliners-my husband loves recliners...This solved our issue! It has the style of a chair, something traditional recliners lack, but it still allows my husband to \"kick back\" and watch TV. It is very comfortable and looks great!", 
    "The Riverside Sand Recliner is a great chair! It looks just like the photo. It's so comfortable, the cushions are really soft. It took less than 5 minutes to assemble. There were only 2 pieces to attach and no tools were required. The longest part of the assembly processs was unpacking the pieces. My only complaint is that a piece (about 1 1/2 inch) of the wooden arm rest was chipped. Its only noticeable in the reclined position. Its fixable if I repainted or polished it. The fabric color is awesome and totally matches the scheme of our room, but we have little kids and we always make sure they aren't anywhere near the chair, in fear they'd stain the light-colored fabric. Nonetheless, I'd highly recommend this great chair!", 
    "This chair is so comfortable and well worth the money. It looks just like the picture. Don't wait on any more reviews. I love overstock.com and I will buy again.", 
    "This chair is great. Comfortable, sturdy, looks wonderful, reclining is solid and smooth. The HUGE positive here is Overstock. They charge $1 shipping and this large item (I ordered two of them) came to my door in perfect shape in solid boxes and protectively wrapped inside. What's more is they were ordered on the 3rd and here in the morning of the 6th!! This, to me, is unbelievable service, speed and customer care. A killer price on the chairs and only $1 more for such fast, perfect delivery on a large, expensive item to ship?? Wow! Overstock has one very happy repeat customer here!", 
    "Wanted a recliner, have a studio apartment, and this was perfect. It looks classy, it's fairly comfortable, and takes up less space than the bulkier models of recliners.", 
    "This chair is true to fabric and wood color. Easily and quickly assembled. Sturdy and well made. This chair is exactly what I expected it to be. I received the chair within 5 days of placing the order (during the holidays)! It fits nicely in a small place. I would definitely purchase this again.", 
    "The recliner is beautiful, compliments my eclectic style. Sitting position and first recline are great for relaxing. Don't expect it to have the real \"laid-back\" comfort of one of those big ugly monsters of a recliner. I've had it for about a week, and am still trying to put pillows strategically against the hard arms so that it provides \"fall asleep\" comfiness. It will not go back to full recline position unless I prop my legs up (for more even weigt distribution, I guess). The color is great, not pinky, not yellowy, not browny...just sort of an off white, very neutral. I would buy it again if I had tried it out in the store.\" Shes's a so beeeeeee-u-ti-ful!!\"", 
    "The recliner is very comfortable and cozy. It is not bulky like most recliners and the color of the recliner and the handrest coordinates well. I give it four stars because the cover on the back of the recliner didn't have to be velcroed.", 
    "This chair is about half of what other manufacturers are selling it for. The sand color is a light tan--like coffee with tons of cream in it. The dark brown bent wood arms definitely have a reddish tint. Very comfortable recliner and a killer price point. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "The chairs were the perfect color...sand. The boxes arrived within one week and it came in two pieces, which was a \"snap\" to put together. I couldn't find anything like this at any store I searched for on the internet or in person. Customer service was very personal and answered every request or question I had. I found one very small dot on the back that was discolored, other than that they were perfect. Everyone that sits on the chairs say they are one of the most comfortable recliners. Thank, Overstock!", 
    "This is a well-built, comfortable chair. Having wooden, open sides make this chair appear less dowdy than the usual recliner type chair which was just what I needed. It was well packaged and very easy to put together [just slip on the back of the chair to metal posts]. All in all, a great buy.", 
    "I ordered this chair for my apartment because it only needs limited space to lounge. It was fairly easy to put together and is comfortable. The chair is also very sturdy. The box weighed 89 lbs. One thing though, I would agree that the chair is not really made for tall persons, since my feet just go over the foot stoll and I'm 5'6\". Another awesome buy from Overstock.com", 
    "I chose this model because I had experienced it at my daughters home. Limited color choice was an issue but I've adapted to it. Two flaws stand out. When reclined in the first position the angle of the back leves a bit too much space to comfortably sit up. I need to have a pillow behind my head to give me a comfortable position. The second is that the chair doesn't stay in the reclined position when pushed all the way back so I can't use it that way without fighting to keep it back. Perhaps I connected the 2 pieces together incorrectly. Otherwise, it is comfortable and smooth in changing positions.", 
    "I ordered the riverside recliner and it came with in a week. When it arrived, it had some damage from shipping, and a split in the arm. I called overstock, and they were very helpful, and sent a replacement promptly. The customer service is second to none, and the recliner is perfect. They bent over backwards to make sure everything was perfect. I have never experienced such amazing service. Certainly a model for all companies everywhere of how to do it right! Because of this experience I will check overstock for absolutely everything I need before I go into town to shop. The recliner is easy to assemble, firm, but comfortable, and very classy looking. I am so thrilled with it. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "This chair was exactly as expected based on prior reviews. It is comfortable and looks very nice in our very yellow living room. As others mentioned, make sure you have about 3 inches of space behind the chair to be able to enjoy it fully reclined.", 
    "It is a heavy package - 85 lbs-but there is virtually no assembly needed, just slipping the back onto the base until the parts click. It arrived in perfect condition, provides much better back support than most recliners as well as taking up less space. You will LOVE it.", 
    "Was about to buy this chair elsewhere in a different pattern at a much higher price when I found it in this color on Overstock. The price is much better here and the color was more of what I wanted so I was thrilled. When it arrived I couldn't have been happier. Went together in seconds, is very compfortable and looks great. Would highly recommend this to anyone considering a small decorative recliner.", 
    "Once again overstock has exceeded their wonderful service! this chair arrived in perfect condition in two days! That was faster than we expected! Never have I put together furniture with such ease. The chair is wonderful and supports my bad back well. it is easy to recline and oh so comfortable! The color is perfect and it fits perfectly in the space where we chose to put it! I am sold on overstock.com for life! The best customer service in the history of customer service! Keep it up guys! This is now the only place I will shop for most of my shopping needs! Thanks so much we love this chair!", 
    "I purchased this recliner recently only in charcoal and I'm delighted. I'm a large woman and was afraid it would be too small. But it's not, I fit. The chair is sleek and stylish and the material is of a good quality. This chair is definitely worth the price. The chair arrived in a timely manner, and was in good condition except a little scratch on the side of one arm. The color of the wooden arms is a dark brown, another review stated it was too red. Mine did not. It has one reclining position which is perfect for watching TV or taking a nap.", 
    "The recliner is very comfortable and was easy to assemble. The chair comes in two sections that easily snap together no tools required. We are completely happy with the experiance of shapping at overstock and would go back again.", 
    "After reading the previous posts, I'm wondering which chair they received. My chair is the perfect sand color and the wood is a dark rich espresso color. My only complaint was the damage. I'm sure I could have returned it for n/c based on previous experience, but I love the chair. I'm going to sand down the edges of the arms and cover it with some furniture stain. The chair is VERY comfortable and compact compared to most recliners. You need room to fully recline, but that information is readily available in the video that was on the site.", 
    "I purchased two of these recliners. The chair is quite comfy and the material is attractive. The only problem I had was that one of the chairs was a bit damaged on the back of the arm and on one leg. Not so much I can do about that but to try to repair it myself. I can't imagine shipping it back once received.", 
    "I just received this recliner and put it together. It is a beautiful chair and very comfortable. However, I will be returning it . The chair is a light buttery yellow - not sand as indicated in the description and color swatch. I realize computer colors vary but this is really lighter and more yellow than indicated. Also, you have to sit the chair 2-3 feet from the wall to completely recline it. This is fine if you don't need to place it by the wall. In my family room there is not enough room to place it that far from the wall. On the plus side, the chair was super easy to assemble and came packaged very securely. Customer service was excellent in processing my return. Great chair for the right spot and color scheme.", 
    "This recliner is well constructed and very attractive. The bent wood arms have a slight reddish tone that compliments the beige fabric. Chair is well padded yet slightly firm, quite comfortable for long term sitting. Reclining is smooth although I wish the back was a bit higher. I am 6 feet tall and the top of my head reaches the upper end in the reclining position. A taller person may find this a bit uncomfortable. Assuming you are not much taller than 6 feet, I highly recommend this product.", 
    "Love the color, beaiutiful redish wood tint and very comfortable. This is a very solid chair.", 
    "I was looking for a recliner that was not bulky and would fit into my d\u00e9cor. This chair is perfect. It is stylish, comfortable, and roomy. It even provides lumbar support. I saw similar models for as much as $800.00. It is well worth the price. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. You can\u0092t go wrong if you buy this chair!", 
    "We purchased two of these chairs. They are very comfortable and look nice! The upholstery is quality fabric, and the wood is beautifully finished. They arrived quickly, but they were not packaged very well. Thankfully, there were no scratches or rips. One of the chairs, though, had rusty, loose screws, with one screw completely stripped out. We had to replace the screws before we could use the chair.", 
    "Great chair. Very comfortable to sit in. I'm 5'3 and the back supports comfortably all the way through my neck. Color is slightly darker than on screen, but only slightly (or it could just be my screen). If you like the convenience of a recliner but prefer something not so bulky and more streamline, this chair will definitely make you happy. Hopefully the chair will last me years as I can see myself using it quite a bit.", 
    "I am very pleased with the quality and comfort of the Riverside recliner. Most recliners are bulky and unattractive. This chair is streamlined and contemporary looking. Extremely comfortable for a woman, my tall husband thinks it's a tad too short for him. Arrived in perfect condition.", 
    "Great chair, good price, and easy-to-assemble. Product arrived in terrific condition and it took less than 5 minutes to assemble. The chair is an awesome addition to my bedroom. The material is durable and the color is a match for any decorum. I am very pleased with this purchase and I highly recommend to anyone considering purchasing a chair.", 
    "Did not want a large or bulky recliner. This one fits perfectly and coordinates with room decor. It's comfortable, but firm. Quality exceeds price.", 
    "This relatively sleek design (for a recliner) seems based on Lane's Julia style, but the price point here is a better fit when owning a destructive pet. It came well packaged -- the box was beginning to fall apart, but the contents were well wrapped. As another reviewer has said, it comes in two pieces, and you just have to slide the back piece on. No tools needed. One problem -- my own fault in not visualizing the measurements correctly -- is that the recliner is proportionally much larger than my other furniture, especially in height. Also, I'm 5'3\" tall and find I cannot sustain easily the full recline position. My center of gravity, maybe? But that's OK since I want this chair to read books, use laptop, and watch TV, not to take a nap -- the first recline level is perfectly comfortable for that.", 
    "I bought this chair based on reviews of the same model in other colors. Ordering and delivery were easy. \"Assembly\" took one minute. The back just slides on and you're done. The chair is super comfortable and I can't wait for the cable guy to come so I can really use it to watch a game. To recline you just give it a little nudge back and it slides into place very smoothly. It's definitely the new favorite chair in my house.", 
    "I like the sleek style of this recliner, and the dark wood armrests. It is easy to adjust, the style goes really well with my dark furniture and light carpeting, and provides for a very comfortable sitting area in my bedroom."
