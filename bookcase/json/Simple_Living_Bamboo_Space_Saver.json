    "I was surprised - wood quality is very, very nice. Fits together well (took me 90 to assemble, but good instructions) . Sturdy,roomy, looks great. Great value for the price! My only wish is that they would supply plugs for the screw holes.", 
    "Absolutely love it. Thanks to this cabinet, the bathroom is by far the only room in my house that's really complete. This is fabulous for small spaces like mine, but I think every bathroom can benefit from something like this. As long as you have a toilet, you have room for this kind of cabinet/shelving. It's not possible to install regular shelves above my toilet because the mirror extends along the whole wall (the previous owners just had a really awkward medicine cabinet on the opposite wall. They were constantly banging their heads on its corner). This is an excellent storage solution and it's actually quite handsome. Feels tropical. I suck at assembly, but this was simple, fast, and I didn't even injure myself (a remarkable acheivement). This is very sturdy, and I don't even have it screwed into the wall. It does come with supplies for wall mounting, but remember that it won't do you any good if you have a baseboard. Because the legs have to be so tall in order for it to fit over the toilet, be forewarned that there will always be a bit of a wobble to it--but that's true of every single piece like this. It's been successfully minimized here because of the choice of material.", 
    "This Bamboo Space Saver is beautifully designed yet it is poorly made... I ordered this space saver and the first one was broken straight out of the box...Overstock sent me a second one and it was broken as well... So I never even got a chance to actually see it assembled... That's why I graded it so poorly...", 
    "mine was a disaster. assembly was long and difficult because components did not fit.", 
    "Feels unstable and cheap. The board that goes across the bottom of the unit does not work with the pipes under the toilet so the whole unit is very wobbly", 
    "This is a very nice piece of furniture, great color, a great alternative to the white particle board type. Very good quality. One bad thing: one front leg is about 1/2 inch shorter than the others. It seems secure once attached to the wall but I still have a piece of folded cardboard under it. I really like the look and the sliding doors are nice. The open shelf is quite a ways above the toilet so you are still able to put things on the toilet tank lid.", 
    "I really like the looks of this cabinet. I wanted it to match a light oak woodwork that I have in the bathroom and it does. The main thing that I wished it had and doesn't, are finishing plugs where the screws are screwed in. This went together pretty well, but I had to build it in the bathroom and for me it was tight around the toilet. Directions are good, it took about and hour to put together. All in all a good purchase.", 
    "Doesn't fit exactly the space, but we shimmed it and left off the back rail and it works very well and is quite handsome.", 
    "The space saver fit my small bathroom perfectly. Had some problems with the assembly however when that was worked out everything worked out great.", 
    "I'm pretty happy about this purchase. The finished piece looks very nice, except that the pre-drilled holes - when used per the instructions - are not perfectly drilled, so the pieces do not all line up perfectly at the end of assembly. As noted in another review, it would have been nice to have screw covers, too. However, all in all, it's a natural-look piece, being bamboo, so I don't think that these two things really detract that much from its attractiveness that much.", 
    "this is better than many space savers in this price range. i can't give it five stars because one shelf inside was bowed so it did not lay flat.", 
    "I love this shelf. It was very easy to put together and it looks so much nicer than the one I had before. It is smaller, but has an amazing amount of storage. I would definitely recommend. My bathroom looks more like a spa now.", 
    "It arrived with damaged sides and doors that would not fit. The manufacturer sent replacement parts and now it's great. I like the bamboo much more that other options. We did need to screw it to the wall to make it sturdy, but I think that's the case with any of them.", 
    "Just what I was looking for!!! This product is awesome. I love the bamboo natural look! Quality product for a great price. Could not have done any better!!", 
    "This shelf is beautiful, studier than most, and functional. It has a nice neutral color, and stores quite a bit. I like that it has two shelves, and doors to hide them. I could see the doors fraying from wear after a bit of use, but I estimate, with good care and conditioning, that this product will last for greater than 4 years. Not a bad investment and a great space saver. It would be nice if the bottom bar had adjustable heights as not all toilet piping is at the same level (mine pipes into the wall). I have adjusted the unit a bit away from the wall, and it still stands sturdy and looks great.", 
    "Great product for the price. Looks very pretty over the toilet, dresses up the bathroom and the bamboo looks nice. Does not have the cheap particle board feel to it. Would buy again and have had many people compliment me on it.", 
    "Looks nice, fits space, easy to put together. Only complaint is that one of the sliding doors is a bit larger and tight and takes two hands to slide", 
    "I love this cabinet. It looks stylish in my powder room and holds everything so that my bathroom doesn't look cluttered. My only issue with it is that I had to do some altering on the bottom bar in the back. The bar sat so low that my toilet's plumbing prevented the two rear support legs from making contact with the floor, thus causing the cabinet to lean forward and possibly fall. I didn't have the tools to perform the alteration myself, luckily a family member did, and now it's a beautiful addition to my home.", 
    "Though it isn't perfectly machine fit everywhere (e.g. the back panel didn't end up flush against the unit, but it doesn't show anyway) it just took a little finagling and finessing to assemble. Color is true to photo, material is higher quality wood than I predicted, and it was actually mostly doable with one person (the instructions say to use two people). I only needed my husband once...", 
    "Mine was broken when it arrive to me not one but both items I ordered never ordering anything I have to put together from here again..", 
    "Bought 4 years ago for my renters. They have 2 kids and use this item a lot, it's fully loaded. I'm happy to report that it's still in perfect condition! The bamboo holds up well, absolutely no splintering at all. The finish is still perfect, the shelve doors open easily. It was simple to assemble. Highly recommended product.", 
    "This is a nice, high quality piece and was easy to assemble. One star off because the motion on the sliding doors is not smooth.", 
    "Seems to be a quality product", 
    "wobbles, difficult to get to sit right over toilet.", 
    "Not too hard to put together and it looks and works great.", 
    "This is really a Great Piece to put into your master bath if you don't happen to have a medicine cabinet in there. As long as you have room around and above your toilet this is the ideal solution. (Important) Be aware that it will have to be anchored to your wall. Most of the weight of this piece is at the top and you won't be able to slide those doors without moving the cabinet somewhat, so anchoring it to your wall is a necessity! Other than that. It really looks Great (As pictured) and is very useful. Yes, I would recommend this to my friends.", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks great in our bathroom.", 
    "Very easy to assemble. Goes with my oak cabinets perfectly.", 
    "Easy to assemble, Looks very nice", 
    "The doors looks cheap so overall does not look nice.", 
    "looks very cute in my bathroom but not sturdy", 
    "Hard to assemble but worthed! It looks great", 
    "This could be a solid 4 star product but the one I received had major building error. The notches for doors on top are on the opposite side of the bottom. I needed to put it up so I did not install the horizontal wood bar. However that bar was needed because it has holes to screw the unit to the wall. I ended up anchoring it through the thin particle board and it stopped the wobble. You have to anchor it, otherwise it's not stable. Also the wood bar at the bottom is useless because it would not fit behind my toilet. Even with these flaws I give it 3 stars because it's a very nice looking and solid unit.", 
    "I wanted to like this bathroom spacesaver. I liked that it was made of bamboo, and the color worked with my bathroom. The space saver is put together in two parts: the leg section and the top shelves and sliding door section. I got the legs together first and installed them in the bathroom, having to remove the bottom support bar and reinstalling it to put it over the water pipe. Then I put the top part together. When I started to put the finished top part on top of the legs, the while thing became scarily wobbily. I was afraid that the legs would not support the top part, which was somewhat heavy. If someone knocked it with an elbow, or if the cat jumped on it (something that was likely to happen). I was concerned the whole thing would topple over because it was so top heavy, taking the water pipe with it. I rent, so there is no option of screwing it to the wall, which I think would be necessary. I think that if the designer/manufacturer had provided two or three more support bars in the back, the legs would have been more secure and sturdy. Sadly, I wasted money in buying this spacesaver and had to find another one.", 
    "I love the look of this bamboo space saver. I think it took my husband and I about a half hour to put together.", 
    "I was very impressed with this Space saver.", 
    "My husband and I are really pleased with the bamboo space saver. The first one delivered had a broken piece, but one call to Overstock and another unit was shipped within days. It went together easily with all pieces clearly marked. We secured to the wall as we would with any tall unit. The inside is roomy enough to hold my tall cans of hair products. The color is gorgeous and true to the picture. The only con I can think of is it would look more finished with wood plugs for the screw holes, but it's still a very nice looking unit.", 
    "Like the unit, but a l little wobbly if not attached to the wall. The back brace on the bottom needs to be about 1-2 inches higher to clear the water line. Had to notch it to make it fit. Was impressed with the manufacturer. One of the pieces came broken, they replaced it with a little info from me.", 
    "Better than most I've seen.", 
    "Bought this item with a little hesitation, but it exceeds my expectations when compared to some high priced ones in some popular home stores, looks fantastic, durable and very easy to set up!.........took me less than 35 mins tops to complete setup, don't tighten the bar at the bottom before placing over your toilet if that's were your placement will be, would buy again in a second, but I won't because it will last!", 
    "The one I received has a large white stain of some sort on one side of the shelf, and of course it's the side that noticeable when you enter the bathroom. Also the small bar that attaches in the back on the bottom, the screws do not tighten and I didn't know you had to screw the whole shelf to the wall afterward. That...I am having a problem with because I live in an apartment and they do not allow us to put large wholes in the wall, without paying a big price later.", 
    "I looked around many places before deciding to purchase this space saver. It's beautiful quality wood and just the right amount of extra space for a small bathroom.", 
    "This was fairly easy to put together. It holds ALOT of stuff and looks great. It is sturdy and made of real wood. Just make sure that the lower wood bar will fit where your water line is...we had to improvise a little. :o) But no issues with the unit itself. Love it!", 
    "This cabinet looks excellent in our bathroom. We had a problem with fitting the bottom part behind the toilet though due to our water supply line. My husband made a few adjustments and it fit perfectly", 
    "Not very sturdy but certainly pretty and versatile.", 
    "Took off the legs. Mounted on the wall with a couple modifications and it is looking good. Great price better than crap at *****.", 
    "Great space saver very nice to look at", 
    "Easy to assemble in just an hour or so. Instructions were clear and easy. Only problem was that there were sixteen tiny screws to attach the backing but no pre-drilled holes. I don't have a drill so my only option was to use a hammer and nail to make pilot holes. This was not a very good option because I have arthrits which make the hammering and screw-driving rather uncomfortable. Also, I live in a small apartment where the bang-bang would raise the ire of the neighbors. The backing is currently held on by just a few screws, otherwise the whole unit went together with no problems.", 
    "I put it together today, the hardest part was the base and the sliding doors. All parts and hardware were in alphabetical order and no missing hardware. I only bad thing I encountered 2 of the short screws for the back did not tight to the frame. I used simply 2 nails and since they were a bit longer I just bent them in the back. I was so proud after everything was put together. I is beautiful and roomy, looks great in my bathroom.", 
    "I get so many compliments on this. Love the natural bamboo and it gives an expensive look to my bathroom. The back and shelf aren't staying put as well as I'd like though.", 
    "well made, pleasant to look at. But, you need to fasten this to the wall. You cannot have it freestanding, it's very top heavy making it unstable if not attached to wall.", 
    "Was ok purchase...small delivery issue. Not sure that where the brace in back was worked for me so had to rig it to work.", 
    "The color looked like the picture. The detail on the two doors did not match up and there was a little unevenness when assembled - not too noticeable from a distance. Ok for price.", 
    "This storage unit looks beautiful and was easy to assemble - even for a single person, age 66 and female. The doors slide effortlessly and the shelf below is the perfect place to showcase some interesting toiletries.", 
    "This unit looks nice and functions nicely in my bathroom", 
    "Easy to assemble, looks great, be sure to check your water valve position against the bottom cross member. I notched out a little on the bottom to fit over the valve. Great addition.", 
    "Very sturdy nice bamboo color matched my other bathroom wood perfectly. Ordered 2 more for my other bathrooms.Easy to assemble .", 
    "Great quality and very easy to assemble.", 
    "Exactly what we needed in the bathroom of our new place. It isn't very deep but provides several levels of storage. In addition to the inside cabinet space, I use a pull out basket on the bottom shelf, and stack folded/rolled towels on top (I'm only 5'3'' but this is still accessible). Doesn't feel obtrusive when using the toilet, and bolting to the wall, it is very secure. Bathroom looks way cleaner as the doors can be pulled shut to hide clutter. Great way to compensate for bathrooms with little counter space.", 
    "I really like this bamboo space saver. It was easy to put together, and is very functional. Good looking, and seems well made. Good price.", 
    "good quality. nice looking.", 
    "Very satisfied with the assembly, space, and looks. Simple to assemble, but took a little longer than it should have to assemble, because had trouble getting one door (looking at the cabnet from front, on right side rear track)to slide open & close. Still not working easily like other door. Also came with one of the screw holes in top right panel/top is stripped out from the get go, but it doesn't affect anything since it just helps to secure the top on cabnet which can't go anywear anyway. Overall very satisfied. Lots of room.", 
    "The bamboo is good looking", 
    "It was relatively easy to assemble and served the purpose nicely, but after a year one of the doors is pulling apart and will have to be glued.", 
    "It is a bit pricey, but I like it enough to kind-of look that over. The assembly was simple. The bamboo is a nice touch to the bathroom, and the shelves hold plenty of extra storage items or towels. I've gotten many compliments on this unit. The doors move smoothly too. I only have 3 issues with my purchase1.) The bottom piece (that runs behind the toilet and stabilizes the unit) should be adjustable. They should have varying holes (further) up the legs to place the final stabilizing piece so it can fit behind the toilet. The holes they have assigned for this piece have run right where the water cut off nozzle is on the toilet, so I've been unable to use the piece, causing the unit to be wobbly. (I've tried this space saver on 3 different toilets and its the same problem with all of them)2.) While assembling this unit, one of the screw heads completely fell off while I was screwing it into the hole. So I am unable to disassemble this unit should I ever need to move. The screw head broke off completely leaving me no way to remove the screw or get it all the way in.3.) Some of the bamboo looks warped and has very visible warped streaks in the wood. It came out of the package in that condition.Overall, however, I do recommend this unit (despite the price).", 
    "This cabinet works well in our small bathroom, provides a lot of storage and looks great. Very easy to put together.", 
    "I got more than I was expecting in this product I love it the quality was better than some I seen in the store even though the back part of the cabinet is thin I like that its held together with screws and not those tiny little nails that a lot of put together products like to use. I have no complaints so far", 
    "This unit looks really cool, however the quality leaves much to be desired. I received at least 5 splinters from the u sanded rough \"wood\" while assembling this thing. It's quite sharp, kinda like little razors that pop up out of no where. It's really quite a shame, because it looks nicer than the much more expensive units being sold at other stores.", 
    "I really like the style, material and ease of setting up the unit. It looks very stylish in a small bathroom. Have already recommended it to friends.", 
    "Stylish, high quality, and easy to assemble. Would recommend.", 
    "It took about an hour to assemble and was fairly easy. All the parts were present and numbered for (no-screw up) assembly. It looks fantastic in my small bathroom. And gives a perfect amount of privacy for the items I want to put in it. THANK YOU OVERSTOCK!!", 
    "I will start all three reviews the same way, I bought each of the three pieces in this 'set' for my bathroom. I am not initially thrilled about this space saver shelf. It is attractive looking, more so than other pieces. As with the shelf, I find it pretty flimsy. I put it together by myself, though not without some issues. Had to constantly loosen screws to get pieces in and I left the screws pretty loose to begin with. The backing was particularly annoying and gave me the most trouble. The instructions have you put the base together first which is problematic if the water line to your toilet comes from the wall. Thank goodness mine comes out of the floor or would have to take it a part to get it in place. The sliding doors are not impressive. Other reviews raved about the quality of the wood, etc and I honestly do not agree. I have not owned many of these types of pieces of furniture so maybe it is of higher quality in comparison. Though it is an issue only for my space, the matching tall five tiered shelf was the reason for purchasing the set to put between my toilet and vanity and is the only place a shelf of that height could go. unfortunately this piece makes the available space not big enough, rendering the other shelf unusable. This is my error, but I find the tall shelf more useful than this space saver shelf.", 
    "I was really wanting to love this but I came upon a few problems. First, the bottom ledge behind the toilet could not be used because of the pipes that connect to the toilet from the wall (this may not be the case for everyone). Second, the back board along the shelf that has holes in order to drill into the wall for support is not high enough and its tile rather than wood wall (again, a case by case issue but even in the picture the wall behind the shelf is tile). It feels wobbly with no support so I'm stuck trying to figure out how to solve this issue. Easy instructions, however, back boards do not have holes to nail together so I had to improvise there as well. The wood is nice but not amazing. One drawer slides well, one is less smooth. Hope this helps. I would see something like this in person before I buy it next time.", 
    "The space saver was a little lighter weight than I expected, but style and color was lovely", 
    "This is a beautiful bathroom spacer, once assembled looks great, BUT the quality is poor. I am glad I had a coupon and bought it cheaper, but it is not worth the asking price. Like all the assembling instructions from China is always missing some details, so you have to use your common sense to finish the assembling process. Once finished and placed at the bathroom, looks beautiful.", 
    "Purchased this as a gift for my daughter who has a very small bathroom with little storage space. She was very pleased with it. Likes the way it looks, it is very sturdy with a good amount of storage. She put it together by herself and said it was not difficult.", 
    "Beautiful addition to a small space and it holds all my towels. The assembly instructions were clear. It was packed well and contained all parts. Very satisfied.", 
    "After looking at countless space savers and etageres and not finding what I was looking for - something that looked natural, not plastic and chrome, with doors to conceal toiletries etc since I only have 1 bathroom in my apt - I saw this! Took about an hour to assemble. I've had it several months now and it still looks amazing!", 
    "I love this space saver, it was well worth the money, the other ones I found looked cheap easy to put together", 
    "The quality of this cabinet was beyond what I expected! The materials are real wood and not just pressed board as so many are any more. Easy to put together, but either be sure to have two people to do so as it is very heavy (another sign of good quality!). I put it together alone and had to put the bottom half over the toiliet and then lift the top half up and screw together while over the toilet as once the whole thing is together is is too heavy for one person. It looks just like the picture - exactly what I wanted - couldn't be more pleased with this purchase!", 
    "This i a well made piece that is very pretty and add a touch of class to the bathroom!!", 
    "My fault with thisw product was that we hace floor board heating which runs behind the toilet so we had to re-build the item to fit. It was so well made that with a few wood screws and glue, we made it into an above toilet cabinet with a towel bar made out of the excess. We had to use ome of the other excess wood to keep it away from the wall, and to use very long screws making it very sturdy on the wall. We have a wood surround jacuzz (very large) so it matches perfectly. It all worked out fine, without the cost of sending it back and trying to find another of this quality and matching color. Overall, I'm pleassed with the purchase, and pleased to have such a handy husband.", 
    "Easy to built, nice looking, I'm very happy with this item. will recommend this to my friend.", 
    "This was exactly what I was looking for. I'd been to a million stores and couldn't find one and I get on Overstock and within 5 minutes I have it ordered. This item is perfect for my bathroom and so far I love everything I have brought at Overstock.", 
    "This piece was easy to assemble, is beautifully made, and I would recommend it highly to anyone. It's one of the nicest pieces of \"kit\" furniture I've ever bought.", 
    "For this price I could've bought some basic mdf equivalent that would've been very basic looking and may not have provided sturdy shelving-prone to disappoint me within the 1st year..I was SO excited to find this as an alternative!!! The bamboo is an eco-choice--which I try to make, when I can afford to* the unit is sturdy--wobbly til you secure it to the wall with the screws & anchors provided. The directions were very clear and it was packed well to protect all pieces. All of the holes were pre-drilled and in place to produce a level unit. Even though it said it requires at least 2 people to put it together. I did it on my own within an hour. Only took me that long because I had my 3yr old \"helping me\". Matched well to the light honey cabinets already installed in my apt. Perfect fit behind the toilet as well. Couldn't have asked for more! I'd buy another if I needed it in my guest bath!!!", 
    "This space saver surpassed my expectations. It is elegant and beautiful and functional. I looked everywhere before I went online and found this spacesaver and nothing else comes close for the price. My husband said it was easy to assemble and it provided plenty of space for items we needed to store in the bathroom. Buy it, you'll be pleased!", 
    "Love the space saver. The bamboo color matches may sink cabinet perfectly. The inside shelves hold all my items I need quick access to. It was fairly easy to put together and fits perfectly in the space. I had been wanting one for some time but waiting for the right one. Glad I waited, this one is perfect.", 
    "Love the spacesaver. Came with one door that had the bamboo insert crooked, but after many attempts to get it right, O sent a new door and it loooks fabulous!", 
    "Very great value for the price. Sturdy and very easy to assemble. Bought two of them.", 
    "This was exactly as pictured, and worked well in the space that I had. Being extra careful to ensure that it is square when you assemble it, and that everything is level is important to having it sit correctly. It went together quickly and easily. I really like it. Good value for the price!", 
    "This is a great space saver. I put it together in about an hour by myself without too many issues. The issues were with me (I am not that handy) not with the product at all. It is very sturdy. I did secure it to the wall with 2 screws - more for stability than anything else. The sliding doors work smoothly and it hold a LOT of stuff. It is perfect for my small storage-deficient bathroom.", 
    "I like my new space saver a lot. It went together easy enough and there were no issues with fitting it around the plumbing. The color is subtle and it's just the right size. I wish the manufacturer would have included something to cover the screw holes though but aside from that, I'm quite pleased."
