  "description": "Comfort at its finest, this Easy Living Swiss Power Reclining Loveseat features a power adjustable recline on each seat at the touch of a button. Located in the power button controls, a built-in USB port means you don't have to get out of the seat to access your devices. Construction of superior kiln-dried hardwood for durability, this loveseat has a pocketed spring foundation. Each spring is placed into its own distinct pocket and sewn all around to isolate it from the next spring ensuring no overlapping. Charcoal grey top grain leather that is double sewn inside and out is used for longevity, giving you a quality piece that will last. This recliner has a smooth gliding feature when upright, and the sleek rounded track arms add extra panache. The reclining mechanisms are built on a heavy duty steel rail system to give you generations of trouble-free use. To ensure optimal longevity and comfort, the seat cushions boast a 2.6 density rating and 33 indentation load deflection, numbers which exceed industry standards for durability. The foam under the cover is 6mm thick on the seat and back for ultimate cushiony comfort. This product is compliant with California Technical Bulletin 117 TB\u2010117 Flammability Standards. To care for this product, vacuum and dust often using a crevice tool in seams to avoid grime and grit damaging the surface. Clean with approved leather cleaning products on a regular basis and rejuvenate regularly with only approved rejuvenating products. Avoid direct sunlight. Clean up spills quickly, blotting the stain rather than rubbing. Do not leave newspapers or other printed material on surface, the ink will leak into the leather. Take extra care with sharp instruments and animal claws. Never use harsh cleaners, chemicals or saddle soaps as they may damage the finish. Before using any cleaner, test clean on a hidden area. \u00a0\u00a0Seat height: 18 inchesInside seat depth:\u00a020 inchesInside loveseat width:\u00a042.75 inchesBack height:\u00a028 inchesArm height:\u00a024.5 inchesArm width:\u00a04.5 inchesWall clearance:\u00a015 inchesFull recline:\u00a065 inchesFurniture Pattern: SolidType: Loveseat, ReclinerProduct Features: Power ReclineStyle: Contemporary, Modern, TransitionalMaterial: Leather, Steel, Wood, Synthetic LeatherAssembly: Assembly RequiredExact Color: CharcoalColor: GreyStyleContemporary, Modern, TransitionalMaterialLeather, Steel, Synthetic Leather, WoodTypeLoveseat, ReclinerAssemblyAssembly RequiredColorGreyFurniture PatternSolidProduct FeaturesPower Recline"
