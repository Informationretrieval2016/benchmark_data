    "Excellent Quality .. Great for cooking", 
    "Easy to clean and enjoying cooking!!", 
    "I love this set. Strong and made well", 
    "Never received rebate as promoted on sale", 
    "Was received on time (thanks Overstock). The pieces in the set are well constructed - but as mentioned in earlier review - are a bit 'smaller' than anticipated. BUT work just fine for daily cooking.", 
    "The whole set is adorable. :} Seems like it will hold up well. I hope so.", 
    "Pans were a little smaller than expected, but good quality", 
    "Heavy, smooth surfaces, love the cool-to-touch handles and clear covers. Will handwash them as I didn't like the appearance after washing them in the dishwasher. The slotted turner is unexpectedly handy.", 
    "what I wanted, but did not see rebate because they were gifts and I guess rebates were inside of each of the three gifts.so it looks like I missed 90.00 dollars savings.", 
    "These pans are fantastic. Perfect weight. They can go in the dishwasher which is a huge plus!!", 
    "My daughter loved these pans. Good Quality.", 
    "This is a great set. Well made and has everything you need. The teal color adds a little flair.", 
    "excited to use this! I see its oven safe up to 400 degrees, can you put the lids in the oven as well?? they are glass and haven't read if you could or not.", 
    "I have not opened the box yet but I am very familiar with the Rachael Ray brand pots and pans as I purchased on little pot at a discount dept store many years ago and could not believe the quality. I can't wait to get cooking with these. This high quality cookware set would make a great wedding gift and would be very appreciated every day for many years by any bride.", 
    "Very nice set. Very pleased.", 
    "great pots and pans especially because they are dishwasher safe.", 
    "Wonderful set of pots and pans",
