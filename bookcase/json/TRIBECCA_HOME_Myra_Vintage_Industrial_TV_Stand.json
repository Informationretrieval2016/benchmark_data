    "I purchased the Myra TV stand along with matching Myra bookcase because I really like the design style and the price was decent. At first, I was a bit concerned about the quality of the product after reading a few reviews about problems with the wood splitting or arriving broken. However, those same reviews also mentioned Overstock's phenomenal customer service with shipping out replacement parts as needed. So I decided to take a chance . . . Both products arrived within 5 days on my doorstep. No one was home at the time, but luckily I live in a nice gated community, so the furniture was still there when I came home. I was worried cause the boxes looked a little beat up and I braced myself for broken pieces inside. I opened up both boxes and inspected all the parts. Everything was in perfect condition. Assembly was simple. I really like the clever design where the middle shelves simply drop down and stay in place without needing any screws. The only tool I used to complete the assembly was a phillips head screw driver, which was semi difficult due to the screw holes not being pre-drilled. The holes are only notched in a bit to let you know where the screw goes. So having an electric screw driver would be handy. I had trouble getting some of the screws to go in all the way with just my manual screw driver. But with persistence and some upper body strength, I eventually got the screws in place. The other thing to know about this product is that the wood shelves are not actually one solid piece of wood. They are made up of about 3 inch wide slats that are glued together. So that is why others have had problems with the wood splitting apart. The wood slats are also not uniform throughout, which gives this product more of a rustic, reclaimed wood look. That's why I love it. This is not the ugly particle board with fake veneer furniture that comes from Wal-Mart or Ikea. So far the wood shelves have not split apart. They look and feel really solid. I'm not sure what the recommended weight capacity is, but my tv stand is supporting a 40\" flat screen with no problems. I'm sure it could support an even bigger, heavier tv. I would highly recommend this product!", 
    "This stand looks just like the pic...arrived timely and a breeze to put together! The only negative for me, and it isn't anyone's fault but my own, is that I didn't realize, if you are using this for a tv stand, then there are a lot of cords that are going to show behind it...I should have bought a stand with a back on it. If you aren't using it for electronics then you won't have this issue. Otherwise, love it!", 
    "Using it to hold a 55\" tv and home theater equipment..no sagging whatsoever. Simple to assemble, with only a philips screwdriver.", 
    "I almost returned this when I realized that two of the shelves had ends that were almost off and there were no pre-drilled holes for placement of the top piece. Instead, I spend about an hour making sure that everything lined up and with my electric screwdriver and some wood glue put it together. It is a beautiful piece and I\"m glad I chose to keep it.", 
    "I can tell you with out a doubt , it was very simple to asemble ...I did it in no more than 30 minutes ...i will recomend to use an electric drill it will make your assebling it much easier ...loved the product and would recomend it ...........", 
    "I LOVE this media stand. I use it as a sofa table, not a media stand, because it is the perfect height and also because I wouldn't want to see wires hanging out in the back of the shelf. It's super sturdy, was very easy to put together and looks way more expensive than it is. I got it on sale too which was a major bonus. I love it so much I bought the matching end table. This table looks like it came from ****.", 
    "First bought the desk and then went back for this table. It is really nice looking and pretty sturdy once the back braces are put on. Looks great in my office, super casual but with a contemporary edge!", 
    "I am not a fan of the typical TV/media stands or cabinets. I do not want to have a family room that looks like the whole thing was planned around the television. This stand is a good solution because it holds the TV at a good height, but doesn't scream \"TV STAND!\". The open shelves below are perfect for books, decor, storage, whatever. I am happy with the purchase, it looks good, etc. but I do think the price is probably a bit high for what is essentially 3 pieces of wood and some metal bars. That being said, I searched pretty exhaustively and this suited my form and function desires better than anything else I could find in stores or online.", 
    "Metal is thin wood is very soft and won't hold screws (need glue) looks OK but paid twice the worth.", 
    "love it. perfect fit. Solid piece of furniture. love the rough hewn of the wood. easy to assemble.", 
    "Product arrived quickly. It's very easy to assemble even though the instructions are very simplified. It seems very sturdy sitting in my living room. My 46\" TV seats comfortably on top with room to spare. The wood does emit some light smell. Maybe it's just me not being use to this type of furniture.", 
    "Arrived in a timely manner. Very easy to put together and looks great!", 
    "We already had the matching bookshelf, and needed a TV stand. We loved the bookshelf and felt confident we'd love the tv stand too. It fits our space perfectly but it really is enormous. The wood seems to be high quality and my husband didn't have much trouble putting it all together. We love the way it looks and keeps all of our media stuff organized.", 
    "I needed a minimized way to place my flat screen TV next to a Stereo (old technolgy, I know but it's great system). Since I have limited space, a big entertainment center was out of the question. With this table I could put my TV an Stereo on the top shelf, with plenty of room for DVD and Satellite receiver box, and I was even able to place one of the tower speakers on the middle shelf. The bottom shelf is great for DVD sto rage, or whatevr you may have. The wood is very unusual, but light weight and strong. It's an okay contemporary/transitional look that will work for most people. IThis was the only table/shelf that I could find on the internet that would work for me. Really happy I found it", 
    "So here's the thing. This is NOT the media stand for those with hundreds of cords and media accessories because it's completely open and would show all the ugly cords. In my client's home they have a big screen tv, a sound bar, and a wireless cable box so there is little visual clutter and we wanted to keep the room airy and open. This stand is perfect for that! You could also use it as a kitchen shelf, extra storage in a dining space, office, bedroom... Perfect style for so many types of decor!", 
    "This is a decent stand, not bad looking. When I assembled the item, the end piece on the back broke off - will be able to repair, if i feel like it (but would need to disassemple) Just a note for anyone else that may purchase this item. Overall, this is a good item for the money, and I do like the rugged-ish look - not too industrial or rough.", 
    "This is a great value. This piece looks like it came form a high end furniture store but for way less money. It arrived in only a few days, and was really easy to put together. My boyfriend and I put it together in less than a half hour. It's a definitely a two person job in my opinion, because the wood is pretty heavy. The shelves are well made and the wood finish is similar in color to what is shown on the website, but since its real wood there are some slight shade variations between each shelf. The wood is rustic looking, like a hand scraped look. The finish on the metal is even and looks like real iron (it's not, but who cares?!) it's gorgeous!", 
    "Purchased this to use as TV stand for our 50\" while I find that piece I love and can afford..Actually works well with our decor but seeing that tangle of cords behind the unit drives me crazy..Shipping was timely, one corner was chipped but easily glued back and it took about 15min to put together ..Real wood med dark color but hollow black faux iron thats surprisingly sturdy . Good deal for price", 
    "This stand was a great find! It fits my 40 inch TV, cable box, playsation and little knick knacks all on the top shelf without looking overcrowded. I used the bottom as a mini bookcase and the last shelf for some storage with nice baskets. It also doesn't feel or look cheap at all!", 
    "The wood is very rough, sort of a warehouse type look to it. The finish does not fill in all the rough textures of the surface. All that said the shelves are ok and I am happy. I may add a poly stain to the shelves in the futuire to give them a more refined look.", 
    "this piece fit my needs perfectly. i would buy it again! i love o.com!", 
    "Arrived damaged. I'm repairing it myself because I like the look and heft of it, but FOUR pieces are broken off. FOUR. The packaging was in pretty good shape, so it seems like it might be an inherent problem with the product or production. I was going to order the book shelves, but that ain't gonna happen.", 
    "Looking for something to stand out. Not the standard look that every living room seems to have. The build is good and quality seems good. The distressed look works for me. Just keep in mind to accept imperfections as they make the stand look unique. I like it!", 
    "My husband opened the box and saw the contruction of the item, showed me and we put it back in the box. He took pictures of each foot where the finish was chipped off. He showed me the workmanship where the metal was connected with just a touch of sodering...with space showing around it. Just very cheaply made - even for the price. And we got it on sale.", 
    "This item is pretty sturdy, looks nice, but smells of chemicals. I was hoping to get something made of solid wood with a rustic look, but the chemical smell is making me question whether it is solid wood or not.", 
    "Nice piece of furniture - converted it to be used as a bathroom vanity and have been very happy with the result. Not as sturdy as the picture looks, but great value.", 
    "I was looking for a media center for a beach house rental with a rustic current feel. This fit the bill. It was easy to assemble; no problems like some have listed in the past. The wood is solid and looks great. I knew that the back was open and the wires would show so I planned ahead and placed decorative items in front of them that work. Perfect for what I needed.", 
    "I absolutely love this table! It looks sharp! It has a modern feel but goes well with my other furniture. It updated my look quite a bit. Easy to put together, it does have a strong smell but it dissipates within hours. If you are on the fence, buy it! You won't regret it.", 
    "Looks just like it does in the pic online. Easy to put together and is great quality for the price.", 
    "Great price for a console and the assembly was pretty easy. The wood grain is more realistic than I expected it to so I was pleased with that!", 
    "I ordered this piece for my city apartment. It looks great, not cheap and was easy to put together.", 
    "Very good looking piece of furniture. I only have one remark: when product arrived it was a darker wood, not as light as in picture.", 
    "This came with a weird smell to the wood but after 6 months it has disappeared. Shelves are sturdy and my TV looks great with it. I bought the shelving etegere and they look really good and rustic in my family room.", 
    "The wood boards were very hard to place within the wrought iron posts. After following the instructions the board still didn't fit - it was too snug - and one of the pieces cracked. The board wouldn't sit flat it angled towards the back since there notches for the board to go around the metal post were not wide enough. The wrought iron details were hollow, not solid, so it looks a little cheap since you can see the crease where the thin iron was folded to make the knuckle shape. If it wasn't such an ordeal to get the shelf into my apartment and out of the box I would have returned it.", 
    "The TV stand is everything I expected and more. As others have mentioned the wood shelves are not one piece but 4 planks together. I personally love the look, the scraped and aged wood is a great mixed with some of my more modern furniture. Delivery was super fast and assembly was so easy. No I have put together many piece bit never something this large that I was still able to assemble in 15 mins alone. Also got the end table and it fabulous! Read measurements for this unit bc it is much taller and slimmer than most TV stands. Works for me perfectly. I have seen similar units for much more $$.", 
    "The best thing about these shelves for me is the way they unobtrusively blend in to my space. They are very functional for me but I will not be giving them any sort of heavy wear. If you anticipate heavy use, I would get something sturdier and more substantial. Other reviewers have commented on the lack of guidance for the screw holes and they would be correct, I did have to start a couple with my drill.", 
    "I really like this media stand; it's perfect for my needs. I had a tough time putting it together; I stripped the holes and sat on my living room floor in tears. I ended up having a friend come over and fix it for me. It took him about 45 minutes and it looks amazing. If you're super lame at this kind of stuff like me, you might want to have someone (someone with a cordless drill LOL) help you.", 
    "I had read about broken shelf ends but bought any way. Should of resisted since both I ordered had broken shelves. Customer Service did replace. What is annoying is having to keep packaging for possible inspection wile waiting for replacement. Does look good and are of good size.", 
    "looks nice as we got it put together fairly easy. was a little concerned as it wasn't very stable to start out with - but once you get it completed, it should hold up nicely. it is pretty short (narrow) so make sure you know the size of items you are going to put on its top", 
    "I love this console- I use it as a media stand for my TV. I was looking for something that had deep enough shelves to house my sub-woofer, which is 14' tall. Though my sub doesn't quiet fit between the first and second shelf, you can easily remove the bottom-most shelf for more space. Every other similar \"industrial\" \"rustic\" looking console table that I was looking at was upwards of $450- even on craigslist! The assembly was very easy to do- it took about 20 mins. Be careful to use the SMALL screws with the top-most piece of wood- the larger screws will go right through (ooops..)", 
    "Easy to assemble (with just 9 screws!) but very sturdy. Loved the quality and the color, and the rough-hewn style of the wooden shelves. After seeing the quality of this piece, we ordered two bookcases to match. It was our first experience with Overstock and it was very good. Very much appreciate the quality and the style.", 
    "I was really impressed w/ the quality and look of this tv stand. It has a great rustic appearance for low $. I would definately compare this to anything I would buy at Arhaus or Potterybarn for a fraction of the price. It is also super easy to put together. Took me 20 minutes. We have a 42\" tv on top. Could have a slightly larger or smaller tv and it woulf still look good. Shipping was really fast and product was well packaged in box to prevent damage.", 
    "I'm going to keep this media stand because it fits all the requirements I had for height, simplicity and color. However, this is NOT real wood. Part of the wood BROKE while I was assembling the table. I had to use wood glue to repair it. The \"metal\" legs are lightweight and obviously not real. All this being said, I still like the way it looks in my family room. For the price, I'm okay. I would have returned it, but I'm so exhausted from searching for furniture that I'm keeping it.", 
    "well, it arrive and overwhelmed me a bit. not a lot of pieces, but the holes for the screws weren't easy to find. once i did find them, it went together quickly. i've turned it into a bar, and added glass to the top of the unit to prevent the wood from getting stained or sticky. it's really a great piece for the price. i saw the end tables, but decided not to purchase. i assume they are as good for the price.", 
    "Just what I needed and wanted to put my new pride and joy on...47 inch flat screen! extremely easy to assemble. It did have a slight odor... like a stain odor for a few days.. but once out of the box it dissipated.. great purchase!", 
    "The stand arrived in great condition. I was worried after reading some reviews. It went together easily and looks great. I am glad I got this.", 
    "I ordered this TV stand for my office and wanted a stand large enough to put a TV and turntable on the top shelf. The stand is perfect for this. The product is very good quality, easy to assemble, and very attractive. Please be aware, the shelving surface is not smooth, the wood, while nicely finished, is intended to be a bit weathered, which I think makes the piece more attractive. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.", 
    "Super quick deliver, super easy and quick assembly, great quAlity. I simply loved!", 
    "Love this piece for the TV and components in our modern industrial condo. Fit perfectly and love the look.", 
    "This purchase was a mistake. I spent some much time trying to get it together that I decided not to return it. very poor quality. there were no pre-drilled holes to screw in the shelves and the shelves bow in the middle. Save your money...", 
    "We get so many compliments on this piece. We searched for hours online for the perfect TV stand for our home...we just wanted something that would fit in, and this is perfect. It was easy to put together and looks beautiful. It has a very industrial look to it which is exactly what we were looking for.", 
    "This is a very inexpensive piece of furniture but it suited what I needed. I added a glass top to it and it turned out to be a wonderful side dest", 
    "Love this whole set, have the book shelves and TV stand pictured here. I pesonally would not use it as a media console, it is a perfect shelving unit for storage or behind a couch. We use ours as shelving in our library/office. Rustic texture to the wood and sturdy shelving. Great price for what you get and easy to esemble.", 
    "Love, love, love this furniture, nice look and value!", 
    "Beautiful bookshelf! Looks like a much more expensive piece.", 
    "Purchased for our new home during construction. It looks great in the house!", 
    "I had my eye on this for a awhile , It was a little pricey for me, Was excited to see it on a black Friday Sale. I love it!", 
    "I love the industrial look of this piece. I use it behind my sofa that faces my kitchen and store school paperwork and cookbooks on it. Perfect for the space and looks great with baskets for a rustic look. Easy to assemble by myself.", 
    "We are using this in a office. We don't love the gray finish but once everything was put on it, it's fine.", 
    "I like this piece but had to leave it in a different room to air out for several weeks. It also came with the top shelf very split - almost in half so the smell may have been glue from someone \"fixing\" the split. I was very disappointed. However I called Overstock and after sending them pictures, they discounted it for me. I did keep it but given the defect I do not like it as much. I am using it more for storage - not sure I would trust putting a TV on the split shelf. Nice looking piece though.", 
    "Very impress with this piece. Looks great and assembled easy!", 
    "We are using this is my husband office for a book case and also to hold his printer and fax machine. It is perfect. We also bought the desk from the same group. Well made, easy to assemble looks very good.", 
    "This table/TV stand looks nice, but I am not sure that it is real wood. It was also more expensive than I think it is worth. The other thing I really didn't think about from the photos is that if using for a TV stand, since it is very open - no doors or drawers - you can see all of the cable,TV, accessory cords and it sort of defeats the purpose of having a clean = industrial lined piece of furniture.", 
    "Using the TV stand in our master bedroom-- great color, simple, easy to assemble.", 
    "very nice looking piece - sturdy - good packing - easy assembly", 
    "Nice and wide, easy to put a flat screen TV on top. The height is good. Its easy to assemble and sturdy. Its not tippy at all.", 
    "Super nice product, may not be Restoration but for 1/4 of the price what a steal.", 
    "These shelves are beautiful! We put them in our basement to give an industrial look. Looks wonderful!", 
    "Excellent product. Easy to put together, good looking, and just what I expected.", 
    "The Tribecca TV stand in grey is a solid piece of furniture once assembled. It is a deep grey. The shelves are not smooth, giving it the look and feel vintage wood. Assembly is easy and the instructions are clear; I knocked off one star because there are eight wood screws that require drilled holes (that were not already provided) for a full installation (although I think those screws are not necessary). The stand looked larger than I had envisioned once I put it into place, so I am returning it, but it's my fault, not the product.", 
    "I have the desk, 2 bookcases, console table and an end table. They are sturdy, and very handsome.", 
    "This peace is solid and beautiful. I have mine behind the sofa with plants books and candles arranged in it. Only complaint was that the holes for the screws were not predrilled in the 2 lower shelves and the wood was to hard to screw into without drilling first. Just an extra step that would have made a big difference in the assembly process.", 
    "Needed a side table in my dining room With a rustic look. This is perfect! No problems with product and looks great!", 
    "Subtle chic- I get complimented on this piece often. My mother in law loved it so much she bought one for herself. Love the industrial look", 
    "Ordered this along with the 40\" bookcase. They look lovely together in our living room.", 
    "Very well made and sturdy. Nice industrial design.", 
    "I ordered the tall book shelves last year and really liked them. Decided to complete the look with the TV stand. Very happy with them.", 
    "This stand is well made and looks exactly as the picture. Nice quality!", 
    "Bought this to go with the Chandler coffee table I bought and really like how well it goes with it. Beautiful reclaimed wood look and is pretty sturdy. I have my 55 in tv sitting on it along with my movie collection and a bunch of assorted things. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend this media stand to anyone.", 
    "was disappointed that the legs were black.", 
    "This was a great deal for the price! Very well made", 
    "The product itself is wonderful, and I knew looking at the pictures how hard it would be to hid the TV cables, but I got it anyway, because I like the wood and I have the matching desk. I got a large basket to put my router, Fire TV, power strip, and other cables in, so it's not as noticeable, but if I were doing it again, I might get a stand that makes it easier to hide the cables. Very easy to put together. Very nice furniture I can see lasting for decades.", 
    "Just like the picture. I love it.", 
    "I was looking for a media center that didn't overpower my living room. This piece is stylish without being too ornate and holds your tv, books and knick knacks. I have almost zero skills with tools but after a couple of attempts was able to put it together very solidly. Would recommend a power drill though - the holes are shallow as has been mentioned.", 
    "This is exactly what I was looking for. The bookcase came quickly and was packed nicely. It was easy to put together and the is good quality. May actually order another one.", 
    "Love this TV stand - overstock is one of the few places that still has it in stock and at a significantly lower price than one of my favorite high end stores. Be careful with the color. I ordered what I thought would be the rust color and it actually is brown - chocolate brown. Hence I returned the item however I have the bookcase and they are great! don't hesitate to purchase !", 
    "Arrived in reasonable time, easy to follow instructions and met all expectations. Great piece we are enjoying!", 
    "For the price it is a great piece. I love the style of combination of distressed wood and metal. It is bigger than I expected, but I don't mind at all. Great storage/decoration table", 
    "Nobody mentions that the tables do not have a wood top. They have a plastic resin coating. The table tops are also bowed. The set up was easy but not the quality I expected for the price.", 
    "The package arrived ahead of schedule which was good, however when we removed the pieces from the box it was very clear that this was a sub=standard piece of furniture. There were numerous spots on all of the shelves where the finish was rubbed off exposing the MDF board which in and of itself was cheaply made. The legs were very light and not what one would expect from viewing the photos.Due to the defects and the inferior quality of the materials, we sent this piece back. We were extremely disappointed and felt it did not justify the price..We ordered two different pieces with the same rustic look and it would have been nice if this one was of the same quality as the other..Overstock was extremely professional, understanding and helpful...We will continue to order from Overstock because overall we have been satisfied with merchandise and service", 
    "I'm using this in my breakfast room as an accent piece. It is study, good quality, easy to assemble and priced lower than at a retail store I've seen. I'm very pleased.", 
    "The wood and metal are a nice look together. I wouldn't move it around too much. It has that feeling where the screws may start to pop out if you keep moving it around. It looks great where it is though.", 
    "Great quality and perfect as a tv stand", 
    "love this look, good buy, works with a lot of things", 
    "Good looking stand, it does not take a lot of space and was easy to assemble.", 
    "I bought a pair of these to put in a playroom. They hold toys and books and are sturdy and attractive. Rustic Industrial, but not over the top. Easy assembly. One wood shelf was a bit misshapen and while it would have worked just fine for most other uses, we opted to get another sent to us. Overstock responded promptly and to our satisfaction. Thanks for a great product.", 
    "Well made, easy to put together! Looks great!", 
    "As described. Great wood accents", 
    "I ordered this for my office and am now about to buy another for my home. It's well made and looks fantastic!", 
    "We bought this to be at our front door to 'seperate' the door space from the living space and it works wonderfully! My husband put it together in about 30 mins and he said \"It's not the best quality, but it looks good!\" I think it looks fabulous and is good value. I love the textured timber and the steel frame. Perfect fit for our new living space.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Good quality.", 
    "Looks amazing and very easy to put together. Feels and looks like a more expensive piece. Very sturdy.", 
    "Nothing too special about this. Super easy to put together, each board has a different look from each side so it isn't super uniform, which adds great character. Overall I'm really happy, happy enough I bought a second to have a matching pair.", 
    "Only my second time ordering from Overstock.com and I'm so happy that I did! I was looking for a rustic/industrial looking TV console (not too big, not too small, just right lol), and the Tribecca Home Myra Vintage Industrial TV Stand seemed just right, so I ordered. I absolutely love it! My husband put it together in under 30 minutes, it's sturdy, looks more expensive than it was, and give our family room the rustic touch we were looking for. This stand will go with so many decorating styles, you'll see. Buy it. Don't wait. You're going to love it!", 
    "The only negative thing is that it is a bit shaky. And we should have gotten something with a back. The cables are very unsightly. Otherwise unique table.", 
    "Extremely fast shipping. Item packed perfectly, no damage whatsoever. Assembled easily. Would definitely buy from this manufacturer again. Thanks!", 
    "Looks great for a masculine beach look", 
    "This is perfect for my printer and books in my home office. Looks great with the matching desk! Easy to put together.", 
    "Looks great, exactly as pictured", 
    "From placing order to receiving package took just under a week. Nothing was damaged; assembly was easy (mine did have pilot holes for screws); and it looks great in the room! I think this is a great table for the price and very versatile in how you can use it. Completely pleased with this purchase!", 
    "This media center is a great bag for your buck. It is easy to put together as long as you have a screw driver and it is surprisingly sturdy. It holds up my 50\" TV no problem. Looks great too. Would recommend to a friend.", 
    "I bought this shelf stand for my kitchen. It was so easy to assemble - took me 15 min or less. I love how the wood looks, and once it is all put together it's really quite sturdy. Great buy for the price!", 
    "I am so happy with the quality and look of this piece of furniture. It is true to its pictures--- and more sturdy and even better quality than expected. I would highly recommend.", 
    "Very easy to assemble. I think it's a little overpriced, but it does look great in our living room. The smell of the wood shelves when just taken out of the box and for a day or so afterwards is strong and could be offensive to some -- especially with breathing issues.", 
    "exactly as expected and wanted", 
    "Tv fits perfectly, great for a nice clean look", 
    "I bought it for my daughter. She loves it. It's very spacious and strong. As shown in the picture, the color is exactly the same. It is a good organizer.", 
    "Nothing bad to say about this console table. It's exactly what I was looking for. Saw it elsewhere for about $$-$$$ more expensive", 
    "Looks good. As a 63 yr old woman I was able to put it together by myself. Products used for wood finishing are smelly!", 
    "It was easy to assemble, looks exactly like the picture, and feels pretty sturdy. We are very happy with the quality!", 
    "My husband and I ordered this to use in our living room in our apartment. We were looking to upgrade our old TV stand but did not want something very expensive since we are in a temporary space. This piece is PERFECT! We have been blown away by how nice it looks for the price - it is really a beautiful piece. The shelves are very sturdy and much more solid than I was expecting. They are holding our 40\" TV, sound bar, cable box and decor items with no problem. The color is beautiful and nicely finished. Everything arrived in excellent condition. Also, it is a breeze to assemble. My husband had everything put together in about 20-30 minutes with his electric drill. I also love that this piece could be so versatile. Even if we do not use it as a TV stand in the future, I could easily use it as a bookshelf, hallway table, etc. If I have to think of a negative, it would be what others have mentioned about cords showing from behind. We knew this when purchasing, however, so we were prepared for that. We ordered a cord organizer online and everything is wrapped up in one neat little line down the back of the piece that we aligned with the metal bars on the back, so it really does not look bad at all (hardly noticeable once you put other items on the shelves). Overall, we are absolutely thrilled with this purchase and would highly recommend this piece! It is also worth mentioning that the customer service is top notch. This was our first Overstock purchase and I had some questions after purchasing about shipping. The customer service team could not have been more helpful or accommodating. We received our piece within 5 days. Very, very pleased!", 
    "This tv stand is simple, and looks great. It took less than 30 minutes to assemble it. It uses phillips head screws. the wood is solid. I wish the caps on the bottom of the feet were plastic or rubber instead of foam but that is a minor issue.", 
    "This is just as pictured. It's solid and sturdy. I set this up as a bookcase at the top of our stairs. It's perfect for our purposes.", 
    "The tv stand was exactly what I expected. Very god quality at a reasonable price. Recently purchased the matching the no table.", 
    "Easy to assemble and does what I want it to do; TV stand as in the pic.", 
    "I use this piece in my home office. Put crates on the shelves for file holders.", 
    "Purchased the TV stand with Cocktail table and I love them both. They were both easily put together and blend well in the room together. The wood and metal combination look great together. I would definitely recommend them both!", 
    "The stand was a little difficult to put together but the pieces are marked with a letter which helped get organize. It is nice looking and sturdy", 
    "I have received several compliments on the bookshelves. So I purchased the tv stand as well. The bookshelves compliment any room decor.", 
    "Looks amazing with the Myra end table and coffee table. This pieace fits my large TV and all my dvds perfectly. An awesome addition to my living room!", 
    "This tv/console is great. Just as pictured. Easy to assemble, made with strong sturdy wood. Has a nice industrial look. Fits my 50\" tv perfectly. Shipped quickly!", 
    "It looks nice, but the pine is not a sturdy wood. Not sure if it will last more than a move or two. I ended up cracking part of a shelf during assembly and had to glue it back together. Also, the pictures in the instructions don't highlight the fact that there are screw holes in the metal sides only on one side so you want to make sure those align. Otherwise you have to disassemble and reassemble.", 
    "I bought one set for den. Moved to much larger space so needed more. Ended purchasing four more for living room and entryway. Two high and two low. Get compliments often.", 
    "I really like this unit and would have given it 5 stars except when we put it together we discovered a piece of the wood shelving that was broken off. It actually looks as though it had been broken and attempted to be glued back together. We were able to fix it ourselves and it is not noticeable. The unit assembles very easily and fits well with any rustic decor.", 
    "This looks great, the wood is awesome. Assembly was very simple and straight forward but the screws don't fell that secure. I am honestly worried about it falling apart later. IMO they drilled the starter holes too wide. I will likely replace the screws later.", 
    "I get so many compliments on this piece I love it.", 
    "it was a nice stand. nothing too fancy and very practical.", 
    "Very nice looking not that sturdy", 
    "Really happy with the quality and look of this shelf.", 
    "I love this shelf unit, it is perfect for our room and purpose.", 
    "Item arrived promptly in very well packaged box. The assembly was easy. One person can do it fairly quickly. It's modern rustic looking, sturdy, wide shelves hold plenty of storage. It doesn't look or feel \"cheap.\"", 
    "The piece is sturdy and easy to put together. However the color of the wood wasn't exactly what I expected - not as dark as the picture (more of a red then brown). We actually took it apart and stained it - so for the price, it's a good buy, but just be warned the color is not exactly as pictured.", 
    "Very sturdy & industrial looking. Fits in a modern as well as a country home.", 
    "I Love This stand it is so sturdy and fits my 50 Inch just right", 
    "I actually use it as an entry way table. The wood is a perfect stain and I love the black wrought iron. Exactly what I was looking for. Easy assembly and very sturdy.", 
    "This stand is perfect for our media room - it matches up well with our two brown leather chairs. It's easy to assemble; it took one screw driver and less than 30 minutes to unpack it, assemble, and put in place.", 
    "Perfect table for just placing books, accessories on. Not of great quality but good for our needs as a sofa table.", 
    "Excellent product! Very happy with it!", 
    "Was exactly how pictures and described.", 
    "Very easy to assemble, took me maybe 10 minutes. Quality and sturdy. I was pleasantly surprised!", 
    "I am very happy with the quality, really simple to setup. It took less than 10 minutes.", 
    "Great peice for apt Compact but holds tv all tv components and much more Easy assembly too", 
    "I love this TV stand, it fits perfectly in my apartment. I'm not usually one for and industrial look, but this TV Stand is the perfect in-between for me. Its not too industrial looking, I love it!! Great buy. Easy to put together.", 
    "This is a very nice looking piece, I was afraid it might look \"cheap\" but, it does not at all. It arrived in 2 days, I assembled it in about 35 minutes and it is being used in a bathroom to put towels and sundries on. It looks great! Reminds me of piece I almost paid $$$$ for from **. Glad I gambled on this, it is an excellent buy.", 
    "We purchased both the TV stand and end table and they look great. Very easy to assemble. The wood has a nice, rustic finish and feel, but is not super strong. During assembly a piece actually broke off, but we were able to glue it back easily.", 
    "Was exactly what I needed in my living room to accommodate my stereo receiver and CD player, but looks more like furniture then an entertainment center.", 
    "I wanted to buy new office furniture for my home office and all I could find was put it together yourself MDF. I ordered this piece and the matching desk. Both arrived quickly, each in one large box. I put them together myself which really just entails building the metal frame and laying down the wood board. There was a slight smell but it went away after a few weeks. I'm not sure what type of wood but it beats mdf with a paper or vinyl coating for sure.", 
    "The \"vintage\" industrial look of this TV stand is made complete by the detailing of the shelves. Each shelf is made to look vintage by the weathered patina. The one downside to this authentic timeworn look is that the shelves do not have completely flat surfaces. This wasn't a problem for how we use our shelves, but it could be an issue for others.", 
    "Perfect for our kid's playroom and the rustic look gives the piece so much character! Can't beat the price or quality of the product.", 
    "Easy to put together, looks like picture.", 
    "this is a nice tv stand, but the middle piece of wood was warped, so it doesn't sit properly. assembly was easy. quality of materials is average.", 
    "So easy to put together. Looks great in my kitchen.", 
    "Great detailed stand. Very sturdy.", 
    "This is a beautiful to our industrial look d\u00e9cor but not overbearing or too \"beat up\" looking. Solid and heavy and the packing for shipping was well done.", 
    "I love it. It's 50 inches long as stated. It did have the chemical smell but I left it outside in the shade for about an hour and the smell was gone. Easy to put together. Exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "I looked at this piece for a long time before committing because of the price. There is not much to it so it is easy to assemble, but price is too high", 
    "Perfect height, good quality, wood shelves are sturdy with a rustic appearance. The black metal legs and supports are of good quality and very attractive. We are very pleased.", 
    "Love the look of this tv stand - super sturdy and easy to assemble. I just didn't think about the amount of wires that would show dangling from the back of it from my tv/cable box/blu ray player/game consoles/etc! I'm going to have to do some thinking in order to make this as pretty as it is in the picture!", 
    "I've been using it as a TV console. It looks great! The only thing is that you need to organize the wiring behind the TV because it will be visible.", 
    "Wide and deep shelves fits all my components, nice wood grain. Not as sturdy as i hoped, screws are to short and came out of the bottom of the shelves when we picked it up to move it.", 
    "I bought two of these and slid them together to create a long media console. We are very pleased with this stand. It looks just as described in the pictures, if not better in person! It is well made and the natural etches in the wood creates an elegant, but rustic character. If you're hesitant about buying it, don't be. :)", 
    "Table was packed very well for shipping...no issues putting together and looks great with our new hardwood floor...am so pleased going to purchase the matching tables....great media stand for the price!", 
    "Perfect for our den. Heavy support for TV without big visual dent against the wall.", 
    "I love the distressed, vintage look of the unit, however, the instructions weren't CLEAR enough about which size screw to use where and I used the wrong sized screws which ended up poking through the top shelf. While it does show the size, I just assumed the biggest ones went on the top because the wood was thick...there should be more guidance. Further, the longer screws which go on the bottom, strip out and won't hold, so they fall out. They're not really critical to the unit staying together, but they are there for a reason, so they should have something for the screws to grab on the wood side.", 
    "I really like this. It was easy to put together and looks just like the picture.", 
    "We the Tribecca Home Myra Vintage Industrial TV Stand as a console in front of a set of windows. My partner assembled the piece in under one hour. The middle shelve is unattached but not adjustable. I'm impressed with the quality and look of the reclaimed wood shelves. Great appearance for the price. I purchased side and coffee tables from Ballard Design but Ballard's matching console lacked depth and a third shelf. I've spent over a year collecting \"pins\" via pintrest to find an item to coordinate with my Ballard purchase. I came across the Myra Vintage Table twice. This piece had the shelf depth, third shelf, and the rustic black metal legs I've been seeking. The first time I waited to long and it sold out. When more stock came in, I grabbed it as soon as possible. I'm happy with the purchase.", 
    "This is just what we were looking for as a TV stand. This is not our permanent home, but I like the way it looks for our apartment. I would have given it an excellent, but my boyfriend disagreed. He thinks the quality could be better.", 
    "Attractive and easy to assemble. Securely supports my 55 inch TV and tons of heavy art books.", 
    "Ordered this to hold my new flat screened tv and it looks fantastic, I have received many compliments. Has a nice modern industrial look to it and only took about 15 minutes to assemble, that was the best part!!", 
    "So glad I finally purchased this. It looks great in my bedroom and is a great size for my 32'' TV and books. Only complaint that there is no screws that hold the middle shelf, its just resting but I haven't had any issues with that.", 
    "Matches great with the bookcase, again it has a great look and simple to install. Other reviewers talked about how the boards broke coming out of the box, but I had no trouble like that. Had it a couple of months now, and so far, it's a great product.", 
    "So happy with my choice. Sturdy, beautiful and easy to put together.", 
    "This is a beautiful, solid piece of furniture - VERY easy to put together!", 
    "I bought this for my small sitting room and it's perfect. It came packaged nicely and was easy to put together. Made of real wood. Very very pleased with it.", 
    "This rustic TV stand was very easy to assemble, looks great, and is a solid value for the money. If rustic is your style, this may be a good choice.", 
    "Beautiful piece and well made. Have had for about a year and very pleased with the piece.", 
    "Looks great in my den, and its held up well even having been moved around the room a few times. I have a 47\" tv on it.", 
    "Very sturdy and easy to assemble", 
    "Nice looking piece. Easy to assemble....but the wood is soft so be careful. I broke a corner off one shelf, but just moved it to the back.", 
    "Not a sturdy piece of furniture", 
    "We have the end tables so purchased this to complete our set. Other than a few blemishes, it is ok", 
    "The stand looks like the picture except that the word was a little darker, and while the wood does have a rough, distressed look, it has been finished off smoothly.", 
    "This was so easy to assemble. My husband did it within 15 minutes. It's sturdy, but lightweight so it's easy to move around. And the best thing is that it looks great.", 
    "I love this piece, its different than what I usually go for. I love the rustic feel to it, my only issue is the the middle shelf is a bit warped.. Going to store some heavy books on it to see if that evens it out.. Its a great value for the price.", 
    "Goes perfectly with the shelves. Looks wonderful together.", 
    "This is a very pretty price of furniture. It works well for our living room with our TV on the wall and all of our av boxes on this with some pictures as well.", 
    "I bought this piece after I bought two of the same style bookcases from Tribecca. The pieces go together so perfectly for our rustic style decor. Works great as a TV stand. I dont like to see a lot of TV cords, etc. but I love the piece so much that I just added decorative pieces to the shelves to hide the cords and it looks great. Highly recommended, so easy to put together. I did it in less than 15 minutes.", 
    "Viewed so many different ones, took a chance on this one...it's WAY more quality than what we expected for the price!", 
    "We bought this tv stand and other matching pieces, it's great! It's sturdy, beautiful, really good quality and affordable. I love the industrial look of the wood with the black metal. This is nice, clean line furniture, not bulky at all. This is great furniture for someone just starting out in their first place, or retirees. It's timeless and lends itself to different styles of decorating. You won't be disappointed, it's even nicer in person that the pictures convey.", 
    "This product is great quality for the price! Arrived quickly...", 
    "I love this tv stand. It was my first OS purchase. I would give 5 stars if the middle shelf had nail holes, but it sits without them.", 
    "Looks great, fairly easy to assemble and accommodates all video and audio equipment. Item is heavy and a bit cumbersome to move. Would recommend.", 
    "Solid piece- easy to assemble and very stylish. We use it in the office and the shelves are deep enough for the printer. Great piece for the price.", 
    "I bought the book case first, loved it and then bought the TV stand. Both were packaged very carefully, easily assembled and very attractive. It has the rustic look but is open and airy so neither piece looks too dark or heavy. Great price for great, wood furniture.", 
    "This is my 3rd one. Using for tables!", 
    "side table, buffet, tv media area....endless and very nice", 
    "I love this look of this and the quality is great.", 
    "This is a great tv stand, great value and looks awesome in my family room. Be creative with the open back and the rustic look is perfect.", 
    "This TV stand was very easy to put together. Made really well for the price. I ordered the side table also after seeing how nice TV stand was.", 
    "I BOUGHT THE COFFEE TABLE, END TABLES,BOOKSHELVES AND TV STAND. WE JUST MOVED INTO OUR 3K RETIREMENT HOME ON A LAKE AND THE FURNITURE IS GREAT EASY TO KEEP CLEAN AND LOOKS LIKE I PAID MUCH MORE THEN I PAID. HAVE RECEIVED LOTS OF COMPLEMENTS FROM OUR FRIENDS. ALSO MY HUSBAND ENJOYED PUTTING THEM TOGETHER , THE DIRECTIONS WAS EASY TO FOLLOW. THANKS' WE ARE ONE HAPPY CAMPER LOL", 
    "Very solid and great looking. Easy assembly.. Very good value..", 
    "Great quality, real wood and iron used to create. Purchased for my son who just graduated from college and moving into his first apartment that won't look like a college mismatched apartment. Love this piece, gives a masculine addition to a room. Highly recommend. Incredible value.", 
    "The table arrived well packed and in good order. The assembly instructions were simple and easy to follow except the screw locations on the top were not marked. I am sitting at the table as I write and I am well satisfied with it. The looks and patina are exactly as the ads. I used some of the Styrofoam pieces for shims under stanchions to assemble the top piece.", 
    "Love these so much. Wish I could add a picture of mine set up. My loft is complete!", 
    "By far my favorite piece of furniture. I love this and am considering other sizes in this line. Very sturdy. Easy to put together. Classy.", 
    "Bought this with 2 matching etageres to go on either side for a beach condo and they look amazing.Easy to put together and a great value compared to what you can find in stores.", 
    "My mom bought me this for my new apartment. I put the entire thing together myself, and it was a disaster. The whole entire thing rocked back and fourth. I wouldn't put a t-shirt on it let alone my TV. So then I called overstock and they were great, except that I then had to fit it back in the box, that was more stressful than putting it together, overall I would't buy this product. Cheap.", 
    "The legs are bent and they do not attach to the table top. There is a gap between the legs and the top.", 
    "Very nice looking addition to a home office. Love the style, and easy to assemble ... just a few blemishes on the wood - more than those which add to the \"aged\" look of the piece. But I turned them toward the back and they are not noticeable. I am using it at a bookshelf, not a tv stand - it is just the ticket!", 
    "Sturdy metal frame, powder coated. Was really easy to assemble. Really was pleased with the quality and was pretty reasonably in price.", 
    "Looks even greater in person. Very solid and finished looking pier of furniture-considering ordering the bookshelf", 
    "i love it, its beautiful I was happy it turned out the way it looked on-line.", 
    "If you are looking for a simple piece that has a little detailing.THIS IS IT!. It is very easy to assemble, although you will need two people. It looks exactly like it does in the picture and I love the wood detailing:). It is also very spacious. I would recommend this to anyone.", 
    "Got if from the Black Friday sale. Great value. Really easy to put together. Can't wait to get another one when it comes back to stock.", 
    "This TV Stand is gorgeous. It is exactly what is stated. It arrived very well packaged and nothing was damaged. Very easy to put together. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Very stylish side table with reclaimed look. Not too difficult to put together. There was a noticeable order coming from the wood (stain or lacquer perhaps?) but it dissipated in a couple of days. Very nice product from overstock! Item arrived quickly and was packaged well.", 
    "Love this piece. It was super easy to put together and achieves the perfect rustic/industrial look we were aiming for. Looks great as a book case in our family room.", 
    "Great Stand...looks just like described. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "Works great for what I wanted. With the help of my daughter-in-law we had it put together in a flash. Kind of rustic looking which is what I was going for.", 
    "Great table.Good quality and looks really nice in my living!! Super easy to put together! Now I'm looking to buy the matching end table.", 
    "I needed stand with open design for small area and this looked good. Delivered quickly and assembly was not bad plus it provided the open storage I wanted.", 
    "Using this as a lower display shelf in my Tuscan style kitchen. Looks terrific, easy to assemble.", 
    "Excellent tv stand table. My 47\" LG fits great on here. Very rustic appearance and great in a man room!", 
    "We love the design and look of this piece! The wood texture and size is perfect and looks awesome in our new home!", 
    "My search is over...I've been searching for an inexpensive but good quality tv stand to complete my nyc studio and this was the winner! It fits my 50\" tv perfectly with room to spare. So happy with this. Easy to put together...having a power drill helped. Looks great! Arrived in 4 days too.", 
    "This is a really nice piece of furniture. It's exactly what I wanted. High quality for a great price. I'm using it for a bookcase, more than a TV console. I'm not sure how to hide the TV cords.", 
    "Love it, I purchased this, along with two end tables and the cocktail table. Achieve the exact look I was looking for at a great price.", 
    "The wood might actually be a little darker in person. But the quality is definitely has me sold! I love this piece and always get compliments on it! Great purchase!", 
    "This bookshelf was awesome. The wood was weathered appropriately and it was a really nice looking piece of furniture. I did return it, but only because all of our books did not fit and unfortunately we live in a condo that cannot accommodate extra pieces of furniture.", 
    "I selected this piece for my boyfriend's townhouse. His style is classic/rustic, with a hint of modern. Well not only did this piece work aesthetically, the fit was PERFECT in the allocated space. I highly recommend in both styling and workmanship.", 
    "Great table!! Will add character to your room while being extremely sturdy to hold whatever you need. I was very pleased with my purchase and would recommend to everyone.", 
    "This table looks much more expensive than it was. I needed a larger console table for my entry and it fits the bill perfectly. I read the other reviews about it breaking, so I was careful unpacking and assembling. The wood did start to make a cracking noise during assembly, but I proceeded with caution and it was only a very small hairline crack that is not noticeable. For this price, I am very pleased. It is a beautiful piece.", 
    "Love this. Bought this for a TV console and I was on the fence if I liked it bc there is nowhere to hide the cords. We actually got a new tv where there are no cords and now I love it. Great quality.", 
    "I wanted the industrial look with out the big price tag. My designer showed me a similar item for over *** I bought this and the matching bookshelf for about *** I really love this piece! I may get another for another room in the house", 
    "Looks exactly like the picture and was easy to assemble. Great quality piece that I hope to have for many years. It is exactly what I was looking for and I am very happy with the product.", 
    "The tv stand and the bookcases with the coffee table looks nice", 
    "The box was a bit banged upped -when I opened it the top shelf was a little scratched and a corner was damaged. I called and O said they will have a replacement top shelf sent out ASAP! Can't ask for more than that! Love the rustic industrial look.", 
    "This product is exactly what i expected after reading the description. very happy with this purchase!! love the wood!", 
    "Would recommend. In fact, my daughter purchased the same stand after seeing mine.", 
    "Well made, nicely finished. Adds a touch of style to LR and holds a lot. Bought straw baskets to add storage. I love it. Excellent value. I think Overstock has accent tables that match. May buy them also. I have never been disappointed with anything from the O and customer service is great!", 
    "Product arrived damaged, with pieces of the wood damaged and broken. However, the customer service was great and remedied the problem immediately. We love this table -- it is exactly what we expected: rich, dark wood with character and a solid build.", 
    "Great piece at a great price is a very close match to a table found at a local retail store! Nice storage piece as it fits 3 12\" cube wicker baskets if you would like to have unseen storage", 
    "Nice piece, very classy and versatile. Fairly easy to put together. My first shipment had one shelf that was broken but the customer service team at Overstock was AWESOME and they got the replacement piece out to me asap. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "We needed a table to serve as a buffet/storage for our dining room, which has a Napa wine theme, and this table is perfect. We have placemats and cloth napkins in big baskets, and a wine rack and pitchers on it as well. One of my favorite dining room remodel finds. Great workmanship, easy to put together. We get tons of compliments on it. I just with there were more pieces in this collection that we could use. Fantastic!", 
    "I was worried about the package quality from reading other reviews, but I took a chance. This product was packed well and I received it within 5 days with no damage. The wood was perfect and installation took me less than 10 minutes. It looks good and I would highly recommend this product.", 
    "I bought this as a sofa table. great quality and very sturdy. I bought the entire set and they look great together! highly recommend!", 
    "I DO LIKE THIS STAND, BUT IT IS A LITTLE MORE RUSTIC THAN I THOUGHT IS WOULD BE. SO KEEP THAT IN MIND.", 
    "Love the Myra TV stand. We didn't buy it as a TV stand, but rather as a sofa/library table and it's such a great product for the price! I've been looking for a table to go behind our couch that wouldn't look bulky or too skinny for the area and this was a great find! The extra shelf that you normally wouldn't get on a sofa table is a plus! We got this right before Christmas and it worked really well for all the cookies that grandma bakes and brings to our house! It was very easy to put together - it took me and the hubby about 30 minutes with both our kids hovering nearby and the \"time worn\" patina is just what we need in this hectic household!", 
    "This is my new affordable sofa table. I was going to spend $800+ on a piece from Pottery Barn, but came across this piece and really love it! It is solid and is heavy. It is not just for a T.V.!", 
    "Never sure what to expect when ordering online, but this tv stand exceeded my expectations. It went together quickly and easily. I have already gotten many compliments on how nice it looks and it is very sturdy--the combination of iron and solid hardwood is a great looking alternative to other tv stands in this price range which are mostly made of laminate and particle board.", 
    "This TV stand was very easy to put together. It looks great.", 
    "Great piece for the price. The metal is just a little on the wimpy looking side, but for the price it's just fine.", 
    "I am only giving this 4 stars due to the trouble receiving a non-broken item. The product is beautiful and Overstock customer service was incomparable. The first item I received had 2 of 3 shelves broken in identical places. Overstock immediately sent another item. Unfortunately....that item was cracked in the exact same place as the first.... so it was only a matter of time before it broke too. Cstmr Srvc asked if I wanted to rtn or if I wanted them to send only the shelves (if they could send only the shelves...instead of complete package...maybe they could pack it better so it wouldn't break). I wanted this stand so I agreed. The shelves were in perfect condition and we just used the prior delivery to assemble with new shelves. I dont know if I would want to go through all of the above again as it was a little frustrating and took a long time to receive a complete product. But...I feel Overstock customer service was/is superior and I really love this TV stand. I ordered matching book shelves with no problems and am contemplating ordering the End Table.", 
    "Overall good value, however frustrating to have one of the shelves damaged on arrival. Appears to be a packaging problem, has been noted before on this review list", 
    "I love these pieces. I decorated a vacation rental condo with these and they look great", 
    "Received with a few nicks in the top shelf (of course), but since the wood has an overall \"worn\" look to it, it's not worth returning. Good size and good value for the price.", 
    "This was very easy to put to together and the finished product is sturdy. It is exactly what I expected.", 
    "Step 1: Find the assembly instructions. Step 2: Throw them out! The instructions are useless, but I was able to put it together on my own in 20 minutes. Just use common sense. It's a sturdy and beautiful piece for the price (Made in China). Even though I measured, it looks too small in the space so it's going back.", 
    "What a great looking piece for my living room! The product was easy to assemble and looks better than I thought. I highly recommend this for any style home."
