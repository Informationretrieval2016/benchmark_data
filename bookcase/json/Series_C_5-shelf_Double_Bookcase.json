    "The first bookcase arrived with ripped exterior packaging due to the fact that the corrugated cardboard was the absolutely cheapest kind made. Consequently the edges of the shelves, which were inadequately packed (with foam) on the interior as well, were damaged. I called Overstock to report this but the effort of returning everything - when I was in dire need of shelving - was more trouble than it was worth. But I did suggest that they pay more attention to the packaging before sending out other bookcases. I was given a $&%. discount against future purchases. It turned out that I needed a SECOND bookcase. I called, again, about the packaging. When the second one arrived, it was far MORE damaged than the first one. I photographed the package - which was ripped and torn at every corner AND in the middle of the length of the (cheap cardboard) box. The edges of the shelves were again damaged. Why would either Overstock or Bush - whoever is doing the packing - use a) shamefully cheezy cardboard to pack something as rigid as shelving. And b) why, after one episode, wasn't someone - either Overstock or Bush - more mindful of the situation? It's unprofessional, irresponsible, sloppy.", 
    "Purchased two bookcases. The first bookcase went together with little effort. The box it came in was pretty beat up, but the pieces did not have a mark on them. The second case - not so much fun. The box was in good condition, but the pieces were nicked here and there. I could not get the back on straight because it was not cut accurately. I did have trouble getting the nuts in and out and finally had to leave one the way it is. I still did get it put together, but was disappointed. The cases are now filled and are just what I needed for the room. I would recommend the bookcases to others, but I would say that you take your chances.", 
    "Beautiful. Has a high quality look. I get so many compliments on it.", 
    "Overall I would say this is a pretty good quality bookcase for the money and was relatively easy to assemble. However, there are two problems I have encountered. 1. I have some heavy books on one of the shelves and the shelf is bowing. 2. There apparently is an option for doors to be installed over the bottom two shelves. I did not get this option but there are pre-drilled holes on the side panels for installing the doors that detract from the appearance.", 
    "Do not like the cheap back but overall is very sturdy and nice to look at.", 
    "Aside from a few dings and chips that occurred during the shipping process I am very pleased. The bookcase, when compared to others in the same price range, is extremely well made and has a nice look too. I gave a four star rating because there are a lot of bookcases for sale that are of higher quality all around, and those would get the five star rating. For the pricing of this set though, I would give it a \"5\" because I don't think you will find a nicer bookcase for cheaper.", 
    "Purchased 2 shelves for toy storage. They were simple to put together. They are sturdy and their depth (15\") allows you to put a variety of toys and baskets on them. The cardboard backing has visible seams running top to bottom from being folded for shipping, which look \"cheap\" if there is nothing on the shelf to cover them. However, I feel they are a good buy if you're looking for large, deep, bookshelves.", 
    "The book shelf was great and easy to put together. The only thing I don't like is that it tilts slightly.", 
    "Decent bookcase for the money. Be ready to spend a couple hours putting it together"
