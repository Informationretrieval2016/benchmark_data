    "We purchased 2 of these chairs, thinking we'd probably have to return because of quality for the price they were. We were very wrong! The quality is great on these, they were very easy to assemble and the scale was perfect for the room we used them in. They're a recliner that is still stylish-never thought that was possible. We couldn't be happier with our purchase. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "Nice style, color and fabric. Small and nice that it doesn't look like a recliner. A little worried about long term use of the recliner.", 
    "This chair is the perfect size if you don't have a large living room. It's not huge as most recliners are and is very comfortable but does not take up a lot of space. We are very happy with this chair.", 
    "It's not at all comfortable to sit in. Also, it's super small. Doesn't look right for a grown man to sit in. However, it leans back really far which is nice.", 
    "I've just received two of these chairs for my small living area. I ordered the \"beige\", rather than the \"light beige\" color. The color is true to the photo representation. The fabric seems to be durable (time will tell). I love the channeled stitching on the back and seat. I was looking for something with stitching to prevent shifting of the fabric. The chairs are quite comfortable; just keep in mind that they are small recliners. Note the measurements carefully. Assembly was a cinch....just attaching the back and screwing in the legs. I'm very happy with these chairs!"
