    "Gave them to my son and his family for Christmas, Christmas morning I got this text from him \"Best pans ever... Thank u.... Merry Christmas", 
    "If you are considering purchasing, you should know that they can't soak, not that they need to, and you can't use dishwasher tabs if you put them in the dishwasher. They work great, but still have to use spray when cooking eggs, but you can't use spray on the cookie sheets. One of the pot kids fits the large fry pan, but no lid for the small one. Good quality overall. I've used the set a lot and I'm pleased with my purchase.",
