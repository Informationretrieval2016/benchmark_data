    "Let me start by saying that although this set is very nice, it is NOT worth ***. I bought this set two weeks ago and paid under *** for it. It's a very nice set, but if you compare it with other sets in this price range, you can get more bang for your buck on something else (perhaps, something with back cushions!). It fits my second story deck very well and still leaves enough room for my grill. I've received many compliments from my neighbors on how nice it is. Make sure you buy extra cushions for the backs. You'll be uncomfortable if you don't.", 
    "I bought this set and it wasn't to hard to esemble but it is not comfortable on the back , we are going to buy some cushins to make it more comfortable, it came with seat cushins but not back cushins and also my wife read that the set is only for indoor use, it does not say that in the add for this set.", 
    "I bought this set before there were any reviews on Overstock for it. I am happy that I went with my gut and bought it. It is SUPER easy to put together (I did it alone and I am 6 months pregnant). It looks exactly like what I expected. The back of the chair is not padded-- so it's a bit uncomfortable (but nothing that a throw pillow can't fix!)I actually bought the matching lounge chairs too for around my pool and everything looks great. I would suggest covering the items when not in use- it does appear that they may rust if left out in the rain/weather.", 
    "The creme cushions collects a lot of dust and very visible.", 
    "For the price, this is a great looking and functional set. We've added it to our outdoor patio space and are happy with the setup. It was fairly easy to put together. The first set that was delivered had several broken pieces - snapped wicker and cracked pastic...i would absolutely recommend that buyer CAREFULLY REVIEW each of the pieces before putting together. Overstock was great with it though and made sure that we got the pieces that were needed. We've had it for a little over a year and have noticed just a few of the wicker pieces unraveling from the chairs. We should be able to fix with superglue. I'd also consider a set with back cushions, or you could buy outdoor pillows like we did. Overall, this is a great option for the money, though obviously not a lifelong solution.", 
    "They are pretty good for the money, we just got them so we'll see how they weather.", 
    "I had to return it as the maximum weight it can hold is 200lbs and all my friends and I weight over 250. Also it came with missing hardweare so overstock shiped it to me seprately. The return was easy.", 
    "The set was so hard to put together that I had to get my friend with very small hands to do it. I would not recommend this set because the cushions are not thick and the set is very uncomfortable.", 
    "The furniture arrived and was very easy to put together, 20 minutes.We are very happy with the set.", 
    "This set looks so nice under our deck. I waited to write a review to see how it would hold up. I have no complaints and the price was the best around for this set....", 
    "Great products and outstanding customer service!", 
    "This is light weight, on the smaller side which works well in our small courtyard. It is a stylish look for the money. Not sure how it will hold up, especially in outside 24/7 coastal location, but this is not the kind of stuff you expect to last forever.", 
    "Great looking set. I added throw cushions for back comfort and a pop of color. Holds up very well. Very happy with set.", 
    "It is exact as in picture, right size to my space. Great price!!!!!", 
    "This set is quite nice looking. It is very modern and looks great on my bluestone patio. We assembled it in a couple of hours. Invest in a ratchet tool to make it go faster.", 
    "Not the easiest to assemble due to odd angles of the screws, but great deep, low seats. Works great with the table height, as well as a fire pit we purchased.", 
    "The items came damaged, overstock replaced quickly - Looks nice -I would buy this again - Love overstock", 
    "This set turned out to be a bit smaller than I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised by how cute it looks on our back porch. The cushions are comfortable and the table is a nice addition that can be used as a foot rest. The seat backs aren't very high, so I will need to buy some additional decorative outdoor pillows. The really strange thing about the set...the instructions say \"Not for outdoor use,\" but the picture that is displayed online clearly shows an outdoor set by a swimming pool!", 
    "Easy to assemble and light to carry/move around. Fits perfectly on a small deck where we have them, but definitely not heavy duty if that's what you're looking for.", 
    "Super easy to put together, came surprisingly all in 1 box, the cushions are a little more tan than off-white but works either way as darker is probably better for outside. It's completely outdoors (similar to picture) so we put the cushions up when not in use. We'll see how it holds up in the FL sunshine!", 
    "Totally amazed that the set came in ONE box! Relatively simple to assemble (you need a friend) and quite sturdy when assembled. Very stylish, tho the cushions are sub-optimal but that will be remedied next year. The season is over here in NE PA (I purchased at the end of the season for sales, obviously) so will remain to be seen how it fairs in next summer's sun! Looking forward to a great summer on my new deck!", 
    "Good pieces for a small back yard. Style is beautiful and comfortable with an addition of a pillow.", 
    "To quickly summarizeBest customer service. One of the back rest was not right, they promptly sent another piece.The product itself is good for the $ price range.The back rest of each piece will need some cushion. Rods of the assembly hurt your back if you don't have any cushion.Looks are great.Assembly little bit painful. Things dont match the hole perfectly. But bearable.", 
    "This set is super cute! I bought it for our front patio area and it is just great! So inviting! I will say that the only thing I'm not thrilled about is the cushions but easy to replace. I'm so glad I purchased this set, fabulous deal for the money!!!!", 
    "Good quality and came in a timely fashion...It was easy to put together in less then 2 hours. I would definitely buy it again'' hank You", 
    "Easy to put together. Some of the plastic wicker was not fully adhered to at the bottom of the love seat and chairs on the legs. One of the holes for the bolts has a staple in the way when I tried screwing the bolt in, but easily remedied with a screwdriver. The instructions said inside use only and do not have in direct sunlight. That annoyed me quite a bit since it is advertised as an outdoor set... In reading the questions on this site, they say it is an outdoor set and the instructions were incorrect. So I guess time will tell...", 
    "I would recommend this to a friend but would also tell them to try mine first and see if they are okay with the comfort level. The backs are too straight and rigid to feel relaxed.. the cushions are thin but okay.. not all that comfortable. Very pretty set and very good quality and pretty easy to assemble but to rigid for my liking...", 
    "I bought these during O \"Flash Deals\" Boy am I glad I did. These are so comfortable, the cushions are thick, the material of the whicker is smooth to the touch. They are really stunning in my outdoor space. I added some additional pillow for a splash of color that compliments this set. So glad I purchased this set!! The only con: It takes a while to put all pieces together, but they are packaged very well.", 
    "We got this set a few weeks ago and I love it! It took my husband a couple of hours to assemble, but it was easy. The set is sturdy and the perfect size for my back yard. The only thing I would recommend to all is to buy pillows for the back. It will be uncomfortable after a while without it. I purchased orange pillows and it looks fantastic. For the price - it was a terrific buy.", 
    "Excellent value for the price. So comfortable for outdoor living.", 
    "You can't beat the value of this product. I assembled all four pieces in approximately 40 minutes. While they supplied one 4mm Hex Wrench, I used my own as it made it a little easier. All of the pieces fit together. The instructions were incredibly clear. The furniture is sturdy and looks pretty good - in fact it looks great for a four piece patio set for under $. The pieces were true to the represented pictures on the overstock.com web site. If you want a \"great value for the money\", by this set."
