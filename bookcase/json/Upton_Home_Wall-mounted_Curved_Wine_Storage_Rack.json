    "I bought two of these \"s\" shaped wine racks for my basement bar. We have two large plasma TVs on a wall which has a brick arch so there was little room left for conventional type wine racks. My husband found these on the web so we ordered two. They arrived within days of placing the order even though it was right before Christmas. They are well made, look great with my bar decor and were easy to hang. We did buy stronger wall anchors but that was our choice. I would encourage you to buy this item if you are looking at it!!", 
    "I ordered 2 of these wine racks. The quality was very poor on both. Also one of them was damaged when they arived but there was no damage to the outside of the box. I was very disappointed as they looked really nice online.", 
    "They say that it make out wood NOT, very poor quality. Love the style.", 
    "Wine Rack with a very original design , displays Wine Bottels beautifully .Doesn't take up too much space. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I was hopeful, but unsure how we'd like this, but we love it! Sturdy, unique, and beautiful. A great fit for our new home!", 
    "Everyone that comes over comments on how stylish and unique this wine rack is. Quick delivery and a great price.", 
    "The design is unique and contemporary. It adds to the richness of the dining room", 
    "Love this hanging in my dinning room, though it was very difficult to hang (lining up both slider hooks at same time)", 
    "Beautiful! Even better than the picture. Great look for any wall!", 
    "heavy, attractive, makes a bold statement ....probable would be equally impressive if loaded with other decorative bottles ie: imported olive oil...vinegars etc", 
    "Artistic way to store and display wine collection", 
    "It is so cool, very well made . love it", 
    "Item was returned. This item was made not from the asian hardwoods as described, but from cheep plywood and other composed materials.", 
    "Holds wine and looks great!", 
    "It looks great on a narrow wall!", 
    "I love being able to see a portion of my wine collection on the wall!", 
    "Arrived on time. Produce quality wa beeter than I had imagined. very slim lines and well made. Thank you", 
    "The overall style is very pretty and unique but I found it after I purchased it, It was on Amazon for less price, very disappointing as I often purchase from Overstock.", 
    "A little more than I wanted to pay but I am happy I did. It looks great and keeps my little wine collection safe!", 
    "Ordered this for our new kitchen. The product looks nice in the picture, but when it arrived it was of very poor quality and even had scratches and blemishes on it. It also doesn't come with any mounting hardware. It's obvious why \"made in china\" is much less expensive. Thank you Overstock for a great return policy!", 
    "I love this wine shelf. It looks wonderful on the wall in my kitchen. I would recommend this item to someone else.", 
    "I was nervous because many reviews said their rack came with tons of scratches and wood scrapped off. Mine only had 2 small scratches - not a big deal. I had someone hang it for me because I was nervous to do it, although it is super easy to hang. Took 5 minutes, if that. I did go out and buy heavier anchors (50lbs) because I didn't trust the ones that came with the product The piece alone is 12lbs then you add 8 wine bottles which average 2 lbs each... No way the anchors that come with the package can hold all that. Maybe they can but I didn't want to take that chance. Overall, it's a lovely piece. The moment people walk in they can't help but say how nice it looks. Adds so much style. I find myself buying the cutest wine bottles to go in it. Great buy. Great price, especially when used with a coupon ;)", 
    "Like the shape and size of the curved wine storage rack. It is solid and looks great on the wall. The mounting hardware that came with the rack is a joke. The wine rack is quite heavy and if you add eight bottles of wine, it would rip through the wall. We needed to make a run to the hardware store to buy heavy duty mounting gear . The design on the actual wine rack to mount it to the wall has two vertical holes , one at the top and one towards the bottom. The holes need to be lined up and is difficult to do so, it took a long time to mount this wine rack. I really like the rack but the length of time it took to mount it to the wall as well as the poor quality of mounting gear along with the difficulty to line up the holes made this a \"project!.\"", 
    "The hardest part was getting the two screws correctly spaced on the wall so that they wine rack could be placed. A template with the exact measurement between holes woud have saved some time and the extra holes we made getting the measurement right. Overall, love it! Everyone that sees it loves it as well. If I had space for another one, I would definitely buy it.", 
    "I like the idea of this item, but the color is much more black than brown", 
    "I love this wine rack. It is very comtempory and I have received alot of great compliments on it.. :O)", 
    "I was thrilled when I opened the box and saw the wine rack. The wood is exquisite and the piece loks like artwork on the wall.", 
    "I haven't mounted it, yet. I'm giving it as a Christmas gift.", 
    "is a very beatiful product, fit well in every place", 
    "I had seen this rack on other sites. Yours was the best price by quite a bit. The rack is exactly as pictured and looks great on our dining room wall.", 
    "I LOVE this wine rack and love the look of it on the wall...however, buyer beware - this is NOT the easiest thing to put up. As other reviewers mentioned, the screws and wall anchors included with this product didn't seem (to ME) to be strong enough to hold the weight of all the wine bottles so I purchased some heavy duty wall anchors and screws to attach it to my wall. I LOVE THIS and get many compliments from visitors on this piece. Highly recommend, but again suggest more substantial screws and wall anchors. When I initially installed the rack I used the hardware included and once installed and with a few bottles of wine in the rack I didn't feel secure that it would hold up so I removed it and with the stronger screws its wonderful.", 
    "Our first wine rack arrived crushed and broken. O.co fixed it immediately and sent out a replacement piece. It arrived very quickly and we are pleased. Secure on the wall and it supports 8 wine bottles nicely.", 
    "I purchased this product after looking for a unique wine rack for a while, and have to say I am very satisfied with the result. Its a little hard to mount on the wall because of the awkward \"S\" shape, but in the end it looks great and holds my wine! I've gotten a few compliments already (only put it up last week). I recommend this product, its quality, and fun!", 
    "IT'S A GREAT PIECE....PERFECT SIZE AND COLOR...EASZY TO MOUNT!", 
    "I loved the look of this so I bought it for my wine themed dining room. The first one arrived broken in half, despite an undamaged box. I called and overstock immediately sent out a new one and sent me a pre-paid label to send the damaged one back. This rack is made of cardboard. It's super flimsy and I'm afraid to put full bottles of wine in it. I've been keeping some of the empty bottles that I like and putting those in it instead. It's not worth the money, it's not worth half the price!. If I had known, I wouldn't have bought it.", 
    "Very nice looking product, easy to hang. I am a little disappointed in the detailed finish of this item.", 
    "I recently purchased the wine rack and have been overall very satisfied. For less than ****, it is a great deal compared to what my other options were. I have received many complements on its style and artistic nature. It was very easy to hang and seems sturdy on the wall. The color is a little darker than what is shown in the picture, but still very attractive. The only downside I noticed about the product was that if closely investigated, you can see the seams where the different pieces of wood are put together. When I say \"closely\" I do mean closely. At any normal distance, this is not seen. I am very satisfied with the product and I would buy it again after having seen it in person. It is a very good deal for the money and looks more expensive than it was.", 
    "Gave this to my daughter for a house warming gift for her brand new condo. It sort of looks like an \"S\" and that is the initialof her first name, so it made it extra cool. It is roughly finished on the inside of each circle opening tho so it didnot meet my expectations for quality. It is vert unique however and she loves it !"
