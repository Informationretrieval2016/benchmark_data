    "This is way darker than the picture. It says and looks like light sand but is almost a dark taupe. I decided to keep it as it works in my house but am disappointed it is not lighter.", 
    "Needed a headboard that would match our current dressers and end tables and this matched perfectly. Very attractive and well manufactured. Great value for the price.", 
    "Very happy I made this purchase! The headboard looks excellent with my coastal theme.", 
    "This is very nice item. Prettier in real life.", 
    "I love this headboard. I am 5 feet and it is around my height when mounted to bed frame. It brings out the entire room and goes with so many different colors of bedding. You can get the same thing for well over $800 from pottery barn. So happy with my purchase", 
    "This is what I had in mind it is perfect and a perfect color!! Love it!!", 
    "We really like the way this headboard looks, and it is comfortable to lean on. We were also pleasantly surprised that the fabric is prettier than we expected. I would have given it 5 stars, but we had trouble attaching it to the bed. We ended up just putting it against the wall and pushing the bed up to it, which actually works quite well.", 
    "This beautiful headboard arrived quickly and exceeded my expectations. Great price, too! Good experience with Overstock.com.", 
    "The sand color was the perfect mid-toned taupe I was hoping it would be. The fabric has a very nice and thick linen texture. The batting is thick and the tufting is tight. It looks like a very expensive headboard. I have a Cal-King bed and although the headboard does stick out a couple of inches in width on both sides (I knew it was going to), it doesn't look bad. Once all the bedding is on, you can't really tell. A friend loves it so much, her and her husband are getting one now too.", 
    "I love it! I want the Chesterfield Sleigh Bed from Restoration Hardware, but opted out until I buy a home. I was able to achieve the high end look for my bedroom in my condo and I did it for 2500 less! I believe that you get what you pay for, but this will exceed your expectations if you do it right. :) I have the sand color. I love it because I have used all natural linens ranging from white, light grey, natural linen all from Anthropologie, Restoration Hardware and Pottery Barn and it blends well and looks great together. I didn't want beige because I was afraid it might have yellow undertones in it...Idk though b/c I have not seen in person. Sand is very neutral to me.", 
    "Love this headboard. Installed it by myself using strategically placed wood blocks for suppprt. Color is as it appears in photo. A great buy for the $$", 
    "Love the headboard. The color is a little bit more taupe than I thought it would be but I made it work in my room and like it very much. The quality is great!", 
    "For just a headboard, I am impressed. The quality is nicer than I was expecting based on what I paid. I would buy this again. I got the light beige because I wanted it to match with an assortment of greys and it is going to match everything perfectly. The color on the screen is exactly what I am looking at.", 
    "Nice headboard, but the adjustability of the supports was not satisfactory for my application. I made some supports and attached the headboard to the wall. It took some engineering, but it looks great installed with the bed.", 
    "Looks exactly like the picture. Nice quality for the price for sure...Highly recommend.", 
    "Headboard is beautiful! But the color is totally not what I ordered. It arrived yesterday and is grey.", 
    "Fast deliver and easy to assemble.", 
    "This is a nice item and worth the cost.", 
    "The color is perfect and the quality is great! I have a cal King bed and it hangs over the sides but it still looks great!", 
    "Nice piece for the price!!! shipping was great as well!!! Thanks Overstock!!!", 
    "Great deal! Great peice!Updates your room in a instant!", 
    "I cannot believe how great this headboard looks for the price. It is the perfect finishing touch for our bed. I love that it is adjustable as our mattresses are very tall. Super easy to set up, although you need 2 people.", 
    "We are satisfied with the material and the workmanship", 
    "It's always hard to tell what color these things are on the computer, but the beige was the neutral that I was looking for. It was easy to attach to my bed frame, looks great, and is comfortable to lean against. Would recommend.", 
    "It is exactly what I expected from reading the description. So easy to put together. It looks fabulous!", 
    "This headboard was exactly what my bedroom needed to compliment my d\u00e9cor. Very well made and a piece of cake to mount. I would , and do, recommend this piece of art.", 
    "Purchased sand in king size. Very happy with it!", 
    "Very nice, everything I expected and a great price, easy to put together, really pretty color.", 
    "Nice headboard, easy to assemble, good quality.", 
    "A lot smaller than the picture depicts.", 
    "Gorgeous look! Satisfied!!!", 
    "I love the color of the headboard! However, I can't attach it to my bed. The \"legs\" that attach to the frame are made of metal and the screw holes are totally in the wrong place. We will have to have someone build a wooden piece to make the headboard work.", 
    "Perfect beautiful with my new bad", 
    "it is very elegant and looks must more costly... love it!", 
    "Am very pleased with Christopher Knight tufted headboard. Was easy to attach to new bed frame and is very attractive.", 
    "Perfect ...best bang for the buck !", 
    "I bought a king bed, but I want ready to commit to an expensive headboard. I decided this would work until I know what I really want. It won't surprise me if I just keep this headboard. The color is neutral, the height is adjustable, and it seems sturdy. I Scotchguarded the fabric just to be sure it stays clean looking. I highly recommend this headboard.", 
    "This headboard is absolutely beautiful. Glad I made this purchase. I ordered on a Monday and it was delivered by noon on Friday. Color looks like shown in photo.", 
    "It's a beautiful headboard it looks great in my guest room, the price was very reasonable. I will recomend everybody to buy from overstock.Minerva E. Sanchez", 
    "It looks great but hardware was not included. Once we purchased screws and had the headboard set in place we wanted to make minor adjustments to its position and could not get the screws out, we had to cut them out. Very frustrating. The rails are cheap and not sturdy, I'm afraid we will need to replace them in the future. Would not purchase again or recommend.", 
    "I got 'Sand' which I would imagine would be a warmer color. I got a beige/grey color which was very cool (in color that is) would definitely not work at all with my room. Did a ton of research about dyeing/painting upholstery, went through a lot of thought about re doing my whole room to accommodate it, stressed out about it, finally contacted Overstock and they were awesome. I did have to pay $ to return it, but that was a bargain for how big and heavy it is if I had to ship regular UPS and pay for it. I was so relieved. I am going to buy a different one, but a sleigh bed with wood instead of fabric. After all of that it is a REALLY NICE HEADBOARD, but be careful if you are concerned about color.", 
    "Purchased King Headboard.. Very Happy with purchase. Love the fact that the headbaord is adjustable. and it adds a great look to the bed..", 
    "I love this. It warms up my room. Well made.", 
    "There is no indication on this site but on the back of the headboard is a warning that this headboard contains chemicals known in California to cause cancer. I decided to look into it. It seems that the Polyurethane foam used in the board (97% of the product) is a respiratory toxin.***\"Avoid furniture cushions and mattresses made from polyurethane foam/plastic as well as any fabric with acrylic, polyester or polyvinyl chloride, all of which can be toxic to the respiratory system. Polyurethane foam, which can cause bronchitis, coughing, and skin and eye irritations, may also release toluene diisocyanate, which can produce severe lung problems.\"I will be returning this..."
