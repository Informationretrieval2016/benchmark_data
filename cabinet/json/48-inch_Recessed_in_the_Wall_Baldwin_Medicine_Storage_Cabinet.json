    "This cabinet was exactly what I needed as a storage solution in a small bathroom. It is unfinished, so you can paint/stain it as you like. The only little thing wrong was that the screws for the knobs were too short. I will probably use a different knob handle, anyway, so it works out OK.", 
    "We wanted a medicine cabinet in the bathroom but also wanted large mirrors. There wasn't a medicine cabinet on the market that gave us both. We had wall space for this unit. It was easy to install--fits between studs. I added an electrical outlet inside for our electric toothbrush. The quality of the wood is excellent. It took stain beautifully. I was able to match it pretty well to our new vanity. The doors can be installed to open left or right. The hinges are sturdy. The chrome knobs that are included are heavy and well made. It came with 4 glass shelves so I made 2 more of wood to give us even more storage space. I am pleased that I found this unit. It gives us a huge medicine cabinet and it looks great. Excellent product!", 
    "STAINED IT,INSTALLED A OUTLET INSIDE OF IT TO CHARGED TOOTHBRUSHES AND RAZOR .THIS CABINET ALLOWED ME GET ALL THE STUFF OFF OF MY VANITY. GREAT BUY .", 
    "Great looking cabinet. Wood is good quality. It is very hard to find a cabinet this large.", 
    "I purchased three of these for a blank wall in the kitchen for additional pantry space nicely narrow holds narrow things including canned goods and cake mixes. I purchased a fourth one for my daughters bathroom behind the door the wall was blank anyway made great sense -she can keep all of her hair sprays and hair products without having to bend down and dig underneath the sink and eventually never find what she needed. Easy to install come fully assembled a great space saver. Looking around my house to see where we can install more!", 
    "Oh how I love having all the extra storage. Yes, I cut the hole and installed it myself. This is a very nicely constructed cabinet. I'm looking at other walls for even more storage!", 
    "We needed a vertical storage unit for inside a new toilet room and this works perfectly. The cabinet doors and trim have an attractive, traditional look which we painted our trim color. Our contractor installed the cabinet but I put on the doors which was fairly easy. It comes with door knobs but we decided not to use them. Be careful with the glass shelves...the long edges are polished but the ends aren't and they cut skin easily...there is a warning label but accidental slips happen quickly. Overall this is a well-built, attractive storage unit at a reasonable price.", 
    "Love this recessed medicine cabinet! Fit in between studs, in a bathroom that is small. Perfect!", 
    "Love them! Great quality, well worth the price. Love that you paint or stain to fit where you are installing. Sorry I did not but another one to use as a \"mega spice rack\" in my kitchen...so use your imagination, these are great for other places other than the bathroom.", 
    "We are thrilled with this item. We are using a bathroom wall for great storage that we needed badly. We installed 2 of these-one on each side of a stud(we widened by adding another stud beside it so they would be about 2 inches apart). We had to sand between paint jobs but they now look like they have always been there.", 
    "See my review of the other 36 inch cabinet. These are both the same construction and quality - excellent in every way. If you need more storage space and have a small wall space - get them. They are a little more expensive than others, but solid wood construction. Perfect item!", 
    "I INSTALLED 2 OF THESE IN WALL CABINETS IN A VERY SMALL KITCHEN AND THEY ARE PERFECT! THEY ATTACHED TO THE STUD AND ARE COMPLETELY HIDDEN IN THE WALL ONLY ABOUT 1\" IS THE TRIM. A COUPLE OF SMALL HARDWARE FOR OPENING AND YOUR GOOD TO GO. THEY ARE 4\" DEEP AND HOLD A REGULAR SIZE CAN PERFECTLY AND ALL THE SPICES YOU CAN IMAGE. THESE CABINETS ARE JUST WHAT A LITTLE KITCHEN NEEDS. I'M LOOKING TO INSTALL MORE IN MY RENTAL UNITS. LOVE THEM!", 
    "We are planning on staining the cabinet a light color as the bathroom will be light marble and limestone. Also discussed putting in two GFI rated outlets inside the cabinet for our electric toothbrushes to be charged out if sight."
