    "Before purchasing this, I read the reviews and was pleased and decided to go ahead and buy it. I am so glad I did. The product was just as stated. It needed to be put together but that really was easy. It looks great and is very sturdy. If you think you may like it, don't hesitate, it is actually nicer than it looks in the picture and you sure can't beat the price.", 
    "This product is great. We just remodeled our bathroom with a sort of rustic appeal. This spacesaver goes great, but it versatile enough to go well with most decor.It is really sturdy once you fully assemble it.The only thing I can think of that you may have to concider is if your plumbing or anything on your wall would interfere with the brace bars in the back of the spacesaver. We drilled a couple of holes above and attached the bar a little higher, above our plumbing. It was easy and definitely worth it.I searched for two months for spacesavers. For the quality and price I couldn't beat it.", 
    "This item was easy to assemble. The shelves are narrow but perfect for plants. (I wanted my orchids to be in a sunny window and enjoy the humidity of the shower.) The shelves are wide enough for rolls of toilet paper, trinkets, decorative boxes, etc.", 
    "I purchased this entire bath set and all the items were so poorly manufactured that I had to modify the parts just to get them to interlock and stand up straight. Holes were drilled at angles that were definitely not perpendicular to the pieces with screws that were supposed to fit in them. A huge disappointment. Save your money.", 
    "The shelves of the spacesaver could have been wilder.", 
    "Looks nice but the screw holes were drilled on the wrong sides. We had our own tools to take care of the problem which is less trouble than a returns process. In the end, it fits perfectly and is a great space saver in my bathroom.", 
    "I received the product within a week of ordering. The packaging was intact and all parts that were need were present in the box. It was not too difficult to put together and fit very well over the toilet. The shelves are too narrow to hold large towels but I use baskets and decretive containers for shampoos, toiletries etc and it works very well and looks nice.", 
    "The shelves are very narrow and have very little practical function. I needed extra space for my small bathroom that has no cabinets to store anything,but other than towels no other use is possible. The shelves do not have a solid base therefore no smal items can be sat on the shelves unless the are in some kind of container.", 
    "I had to adjust the bottom bar so that it could fit over the tank top of the toilet. Otherwise, it is perfect for my bathroom. I don't have a corner space for the corner unit, but there is a space for the three shelf unit. I'll purchase that next. I would recommend this product to others.", 
    "Very nice shelves, good investment! gets a fair amount of abuse and still stands strong.", 
    "Looks nice. Easy to assemble. Pretty sturdy. Wish the shelves were deeper. Not really deep enough to store extra towels but would be more suited for knick-knacks.", 
    "Needed extra space in the bathroom, and other than bamboo or an expensive piece, this is satisfactory. I did not find it easy to assemble, the instructions were pictures.", 
    "I wasn't as impressed with this product as most reviewers were. It arrived super fast as Overstock is awesome about shipping!! The product was packaged fair, but when I opened it, tons of Styrofoam crumbled out as if a rat had torn it up??? The bottom shelf was bent on the outer edge and the top support rail wouldn't hold a screw. The color is an antiqued look, kind of silvery/rusty. In my bathroom that color doesn't matter as I have poor lighting, but this may be noticeable in a lighter brighter room. It looks like something a college kid would have in their house. Not too fancy, just super simple. I will add my own personal touch to it to see if I can make it more elegant. Just remember when you put this together that you should do the bottom literally around the toilet. Most people have tubing in the spot that he lowest bar comes. I just screwed it in there then brought the top half in and placed it. Much easier than moving and messing with stuff on your toilet. If it weren't such a hassle to send it back, I probably would have. I just didn't feel like repackaging and hauling to the UPS store.", 
    "Overall not a bad product but several of the screw holes don't align well...and one of the holes I wasn't able to put a screw in at all because it didn't align at all with the hole.", 
    "this is a great product. the only issue i had with it is the last bar (the bottom one) would not fit due to the toilet plumbing. there was no way to make it fit. however, with the upper portion of the shelving secured with the provided screws, the shelving appears quite stable.i unfortunately did not take into consideration that i had to remove my towel ring in order to install the shelving. due to a very small bathroom, i no longer have room to hang a towel ring on the \"sink\" wall.", 
    "Took about 30 minutes to assemble, looks very nice.", 
    "The space saver is something my wife has wanted for some time. It was very easy to assemble, and is a attractive addition to the bathroom. It definitely serves the purpose for which it was purchased.", 
    "My only surprise the the option to attach to wall. I did not do this, so I hope I don't regret it. Otherwise, it looks great-but be careful when putting together. The bottom cross bar should be put on AFTER you put into bathroom in case the toilet is against the wall. You almost have to build it around the toilet.", 
    "A wonderful set, great for my bathroom and would be great for a dorm as well and will last to their first house. I have had people ask where I bought them and am betting you got some orders after my friends seeing mine. The square ones will hold towels and cloths. magazines, prettys, any thing you want.Yes the bar under the toilet was not the best design,but it is pleanty sturdy enough for about anything. It's been moved to a different home and takes seconds to move the shelfs in place and all take a very small space to store. I bought 2 corner ones, 2 square ones and one over the toilet one as I had a small bathroom. I put the two corner ones in my bedroom and one of the square ones in my kitchen. It all looks wonderful. Great value for the money, pretty, easy to clean, no daily dusting as it is heavy wire shelves, good for me with my illnesses.", 
    "Excellent for a tight space between the shower and vanity. Shelves are narrow but pairing of baskets and boxes with fabric for holding 'stuff' works perfectly over the toilet. Easy to assemble. Definitely recommend.", 
    "I bought this shelf because I moved to a new place and there just isn't much storage in the bathroom. This shelf fit exactly where I needed it and it totally serves it's purpose. I am very happy with everything about it.", 
    "I like the shelves, sturdy and light at the same time. Our bathroom is spacious so we use it to put different accents (candles, bath salt, shells, some cosmetics) to make the environment more interesting. Under last self we arranged laundry hampers, So the unit serves as an organizer and decoration at the same time", 
    "Easy assembly; very functional; fits very well above the toilet; the mirror adds a nice touch of elegance.", 
    "I have a tiny apartment bathroom, and... WOW, how this unit dresses it up! Actual unit is much more elegant than anticipated, sturdy, and well crafted. Opens my tiny space with plenty of shelf space for all the things a bathroom should have. Don't miss this great shelf unit at a great price!!", 
    "I read the mixed reviews on this product and bought into the idea that it was a good buy so it was fine in a little used space. I wasn't real picky about where it was going--I just needed something functional. Even at that, it was so cheap in appearance that even dim light could not hide it. I sent it back--my first ever return to Overstock.com.", 
    "I was disappointed that I didn't get more than just the spacesaver. I suppose I was so delighted with how it looked on the website, that I didn't pay attention well enough to realize that not all three pieces in the picture came with it. It is very pretty and well-made. Maybe in a year or two, I'll be able to afford the other two pieces;)", 
    "It's fits my bathroom perfectly l love it", 
    "I purchased this space saver shelf unit for my master bath as I do not like all my toiletries on the sink. It was rather easy to assemble as the directions were easy to follow. I would highly recommend this product.", 
    "This is exactly what I was looking for. It is very nice and makes the bathroom look pretty.", 
    "Great look great work very well simple assembly", 
    "I have this and two of the shelving units in my bathroom and get lots of compliments.", 
    "You think it is a little flimsy when you get it. However you do it want to be lightweight. After fully constructed ( quite easy) it's pretty darn awesome! Got compliments! I love it and am pretty satisfied.", 
    "I returned this but will now re-buy it because I like the quality", 
    "Probably the best deal in this category, but not awesome. The finish looks like a smeary stain over the metal underneath, and it's not nice. It looks streaky and dirty, and in a bathroom who wants that? The left side did not slide together and I had to hammer the supports into shape because the pieces wouldn't line up. One shelf was a little bent, and another had to really be jimmied around before it fit. the wire shelving is not good for hard bottles and such (like hairspray etc) because they tend to wobble and fall off. I'll need baskets and maybe a piece of glass to line the shelf? But it's together now and it looks pretty good in my dinky bathroom.", 
    "Not as high as I expected, but serves the purpose", 
    "Very easy to set up, It's doing the job for me!", 
    "Easy to assemble. Was too wide for behind my toilet (my fault I didnt measure correctly) so I am using it in another room for nick nacks.", 
    "Received this and went to put it together... the main top piece did NOT want to fit into the main bottom piece (both pieces are 'fixed' and designed to be machined to fit easily, top into bottom). Had to hammer out the crooked leg to make it work... simple but annoying to have to do.Also one knob of the shelving holders came already broken off straight out of the box. The shelf works with only three holders, but the edge missing a shelf holder is flimsy due to the lack of support.All in all, it's definitely not super sturdy, kind of rickety, and it was a PITA to put together, but it does look pretty.", 
    "This is a bulky piece, but it is very strong and aesthetically appealing in any bathroom. I was surprised that the color of it was more green than it appeared in photos- I do like the shade of green, however.", 
    "I love this it works good even for a small bathroom.", 
    "A little disappointing because when my husband assembled it, the item was shaky, not stable, and the shelves were narrow to accommodate toiletries.", 
    "This is a very nice spacesaver shelf. I did have problems with the lower bar assembly. The directions should have been clearer regarding the difficulty of assembling the lower bar - it has to be done IN PLACE if there any water pipes coming out of the wall to the toilet. And it would be best to join the top to the bottom before placing the unit. In fact I had to make special risers to accommodate both the water line and a comfortable distance from first shelf to toilet lid. But the final product looks great.", 
    "I'm using this as a rack over my garbage can in the kitchen. It's sturdy and doesn't wobble. Looks classy and doesn't look like it should be in a bathroom. Holds the items I want on it.", 
    "This is a very well made shelf stand.", 
    "Looks great in the bathroom.", 
    "Great value and quality is as good as the expensive ones you get at stores", 
    "Great fit, very attractive, ample storage!", 
    "just perfect detailed for my bathroom..keep all my perfumes and towels that I use for decoration", 
    "Adjustable feet on bottom allow for easy leveling. Fits our needs perfectly, looks nice and good quality.", 
    "Fits perfectly over the toilet and between the wall and bath. Perfect size for towels and candles, etc. Looks very pretty.", 
    "I thought it was the whole set", 
    "Really nice product and just what my bathroom needed", 
    "this adds nice configuration to my bathroom. wish I had more room for the other pieces too.", 
    "We had to take bottom bar out to fit around the toilet, which was an easy fix. The color was a bit lighter than shown and I am planning on spray painting it to match my bathroom. I also will cover the mirror or paint that as well. Overall, not a bad unit.", 
    "Nice accent for the restroom...", 
    "Very easy to assemble and steady (heavy material)~ I did not attached it on the wall, but it is still steady. Great looking in my bathroom.", 
    "I really like it. Easy to put together. Its very stylish. The shelves are small, but that's what it supposed to be so it can fit over the commode part. It's smaller than the commode so you don't hit it. It looks chic. If you are trying to store a lot of things over the commode then don't buy it. This one is for smaller items and to be more stylish. Love the look. I personally don't care for the mirror, I think it cheapens the look, so I am going to paint a stain glass effect over the small mirror. The mirror is just a diamond shape and can easily be covered up by fabric, paper, or paint to personalize it. That's what I am going to do. I love being creative and decorating so its no big deal. I thought fro the price it's looks very good. Not overpowering. It would be great to add a few succulent plants on it. Very stylish.", 
    "I already have oone of this shelf. Had tobuy another one for my bathroom upstairs. I bought a coule of shelf before and they all tarnis within the year. Have this one for two years now and still look new.just wipe with a damp cloth.", 
    "I love this item! It goes great with my bathroom d\u00e9cor and I love the design of it. The mirror at the top adds a nice touch as well. The spacing of the bars on the shelves are a bit wide so I had to use containers to hold items, but it didn't take away from the spacesaver. But other than that it adds a nice look to my bathroom.", 
    "I have bought a couple different styles for my house. This is a good product, a little pricy but feels and seems sturdy and functional.", 
    "This spacesaver is very easy to put together and looks great. the style is modern and would great in any bathroom. the item is just as described in the write-up. You can't go wrong with this item.", 
    "I purchased all three pieces for my bathroom (large but no linen closet). The corner unit and the small shelving unit are great and look nice. The over the toilet piece was a mess. It didn't fit around my toilet right, the bottom bar coming where the plumbing comes out of the wall, so it couldn't be put together correctly. It went together otherwise okay, but two of the three shelves seemed to be warped since they didn't fit in the holes right, one side would go in and the other would pop out. And the levelers were crooked, so the height I needed ended with the shelf being crooked. I was so disappointed with this one piece that I sent it back. The other two pieces I love!", 
    "The item serves its purpose and was not hard to put together.", 
    "The color was totally different from picture. The mirror was broken but you could tell it was not due to shipping. Put it together anyway and stand was wobbly. Not good", 
    "This shelving unit is very fragile. The shelves are next to useless because they are so narrow and flimsy. They do not fit well in their brackets.", 
    "I purchased the item for my daughters college apartment with a small bathroom. I wanted a good product for a reasonable price that would be useful for cosmetics and hand towels in the bathroom. The shelves are narrow as described. The shelf is good for what I want it for but the finish is a little cheesy so I wouldn't purchase this if you want a high end look. However it was absolutely worth the price and its function will be good.", 
    "The unit was assembled and in place within minutes of its arrival! The shelves are narrow, which I was aware of since I had read the dimensions prior to ordering it! The shelving unit suits the needs of the bathroom...adding surfaces on which to store folded towels, washcloths, tissues and decorative items. We are pleased with the shelving unit and would recommend it for any bath needing exposed storage.", 
    "These 2 items that I bought were very easy to assemble. The color was slightly off from description but not enough to return. have had alot of compliments on them.", 
    "Overall- this was not a simple process. Parts were missing and hard to put together. I had 2+ people help me with the process after learning there was pieces missing. I got so frustrated I gave up this was stressful than needed. Sometimes, its best to stay simple so I went to to a local store.", 
    "The unit is as pictured; but not as heavy duty as I expected. Not frail, however and will serve its purpose well.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this spacesaver for the price I paid. It looks great in my bathroom and I like the fact that it does not have glass shelves like so many I found at local stores. Extremely happy with the spacesaver.", 
    "Great product! Very sturdy and good quality. Worth the price", 
    "I had no trouble at all assembling this. The instructions were very well done.", 
    "This specific spacesaver product is very good quality and are planning to purchase more for gift if the product is still available. I have been pleased with ALL the products I have purchased from Overstoock the last 7 years.", 
    "Made a bit cheaply. Arrived broken but was an easy fix and looks good but not worth the money.", 
    "FIT PERFECTLY IN THE BATHROOM. I ASSEMBLED IT MYSELF WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE. IT LOOKS GREAT AND KEEPS EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE VERY NEATLY. GREAT IDEA!", 
    "This is so far from being a space saver because the shelves are so narrow you can't fit anything on it. That was the whole purpose of buying it but I guess you have to closely examine the measurements before purchasing something. I set it up and not it's just sitting in the bathroom with pretty much nothing on it besides a basket and couple of other things. Besides the shelves being narrow they are useless because it has gaps between them so when i put something smaller it falls or doesn't stand still because of the gaps. I don't have the time or patience to take it back apart, box it, take it to UPS and so therefore it is a useless purchase. I'm very disappointed.", 
    "I would not purchase this again, but once assembled, it does look nice. The difficulty of assembling it was the worse part. That and the fact that the screws were not of the best quality. I'm not sure why some of the screws already bent and others stripped.", 
    "We don't have enough space in our bathroom, nor do we have any kind of storage space. This has been a perfect fit.", 
    "can't put up regular shelf over toilet since it is behind a pocket door so space saver floor unit is only option. Shelves are rather narrow so don't expect to store lots but good for spare toilet paper, air refresher and a few hand towels. Unit is very easy to assemble. We could not install the bottom cross bar because the toilet water supply line is in the way. Even without the bottom cross bar, the unit is still quite steady. There are screw to attach the unit to the wall which we didn't use but the adjustable legs are a plus to level out the unit and make it lean against the wall for extra security. Bottom line, not a fancy unit but does the job for the price.", 
    "The spacesaver looks great in the bathroom. Doesn't look like it is taking much space; and, the quality seems pretty good. The only thing, it mentions \"with Mirror\". The mirror is just a small thing, which is for decoration.", 
    "Good Buy. I was not sure what I was going to receive. It's always hard shopping online.", 
    "The shelves are smaller then what I was hoping for, but it looks ok..", 
    "This piece adds a nice touch to any bathroom. Good sturdy quality. However, only downside is, the shelves are not that wide to hold bath towels (a bit too narrow). Other than that, piece itself is a good quality and easy to assemble, took me 15 mins.", 
    "My mistake for not reading the specs closer. The top shelves are not ver deep at all. I'm sure that is described in the specs somewhere, but it wasn't readily apparent by viewing the photos. But, it was cheap and did the trick.", 
    "Overall quality is decent. Attractive piece for the money. Product too wide for area intended, hence make sure to read dimensions and measure!", 
    "nice concept. product not too chunky, fits perfectly in a small bathroom, very easily assembly,(15 mins) not particular about the shelves, they are just wires, so it's impossible to set things down on it, the just keep falling off/througs the open spaces, I had to purchase two nice trays at Home Goods so i could put my make-up, lotions, perfume etc... in. otherwise this is a nice peice of furniture", 
    "I was pleased with the product. It was exactly what I needed.", 
    "We just moved into a new home. Our guest bathroom is small and had no space to keep additional towels and stuff. We saw this item and looked at the reviews. We got the item and we love it. It looks nice in the bathroom. It's got god design work. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Easy assembly it was about 15 minutes, I think getting it out of the packing material was more difficult then putting it together. It is very sturdy and does not require the anchor screws. The mirror is only decorative and smaller than it appears in the photo.", 
    "Was impressed in how easy it was to put together. It was a perfect fit in my bathroom. Nice color. Have gotten lots of compliments.", 
    "I purchased two of these bathroom organizers a couple years ago from another online retailer and as soon as I received them I regretted not buying one for our third bathroom. I am so happy to finally see it again. I highly recommend this product. It was easy to assemble, it can be attached to the wall if desired (I did not attach mine), is a sturdy shelf and is an excellent shelf for stacking towels, etc. If I had a fourth bathroom I would purchase another one!", 
    "matches nicely in the bathroom. great additional storage.", 
    "Hi, I just received my order today for this spacesaver within the time promised. All parts were there and it was very easy to assemble! Light enough to carry and position into place. Just loved it! The color was like a muted gray with a hint of tan. Just Beautiful. I have it set up already. The diamond shaped mirror gives it class to make this product standout from the cheaper ones on the market. I feel like I really got more bang for my buck! Rosemerri", 
    "Although I was hesitant to order on line, I was pleased with the quality and the ease of assembly. Although my toilet is higher than average, the etagere fit in nicely, and was close enough to the wall that I didn't need hardware to attach it. I would recommend positioning the lower part and then adding the top if you have room to work (the hardware screws in from the back). The design is classic; the diamond shaped mirror is a nice touch. I was delighted that despite how nicely it fit in a small area, I have plenty of shelf space. I looked at a lot of products and am glad I ordered this one, both for price and quality.", 
    "I put it together fairly easy, I did have to turn a few poles at the same time while I tried to tighten some screws to get it to tighten. I wish it was the color it looks in the picture,but it was too pretty to return..", 
    "This piece totally brought my bathroom together. It looks more expensive than it was which is always a plus! My only negative is that the shelves are a bit shallow for my larger towels, but there is plenty of room for decorator items, candles, etc.", 
    "This spacesaver is very nice looking. The wire shelves are not really big but I think they will be big enough for what we are using it for. Easy to put together.", 
    "Great piece, easy to assemble looks great in my my bathroom!!!! Great price.", 
    "This is a very sturdy built unit. The color goes beautifully with my bathroom. The color is perfect for earthtone colors. Looks much more expensive than some units I have seen elsewhere and the price is good for the quality. I would tell anyone not to hesitate on buying.", 
    "Good quality, and the price was very affordable! The shelves are rails, but if the bottles aren't too narrow, all is well and secure. The structure looks very classy- waaaay better than the oogly shelves that preceded it. It dresses up the spare bathroom. Fits like it was made for the space I had. Bolts to the wall for extra steadiness and stability. I am totally happy and satsified with it. I was able to put it up myself, and the shelf structure and design does NOT look cheap at all-looks like I'd spent more money than I did-Thank you, Overstock, for yet another quality item at an excellently good price! I will be a customer for Life-and Life is good!", 
    "TOTALLY different color than what is shown and the brown stain that is so haphazardly thrown on the gray frame makes it look almost olive brown. I actually went out and bought stain to paint on all the spots that they totally missed. The width is very narrow so not much fits on the shelves. I don't even use the botton shelf because it rests right on top on the toilet and the toilet has more space on it than the shelf .I would have returned if it wasn't so hard to get back in the box !!!", 
    "I purchased this rack to store towels in a very small bathroom. It arrived quickly and you just can't beat $2.95 shipping. The rack went together fine but it did not stand evenly and rocked back and forth. I ended up folding up a small piece of cardboard and placing it under the short leg so that it would stand firmly against the wall. I was also hoping for a little bit different look as the picture appears a darker almost rustic metal but it is very silver looking more chrome than rust. The shelves are narrow so I was only able to store two towels per shelf but that isn't a fault of the product - just didn't realize the towels would be so bulky when I measured everything out. Other than the wobbly leg, it is a good rack just didn't turn out to be what I was looking for as a solution.", 
    "I liked the look of this online, so I bought it for our new bathroom. It's a bit more rust color than it looks on the picture, but not much more. It's a little flimsy, but comes with anchor screws that will fix that right up. It took about 20 minutes to put together, and looks good in our bathroom. The only problem is that you have to put the bottom bar on after you put it all together or else it doesn't fit under the toilet.", 
    "We ordered a shelving unit for our bathroom. It arrived on time; was easy to assemble and install and has helped us with additional space in a small apartment. We would recommend this to others. Thanks.", 
    "The shelves are very nice, the only problem I had was that my toilet is so close to my wall and I couldn't place the unit behind the toilet and it is not tall enough to stand over the tank so I had to use blocks for it to stand on. But it is anchored to the wall and very stable. This was my first purchase from overstock.com and I am very pleased.", 
    "This is a nice looking piece, although it is not the color the description says. It's more of a darker tan instead of pewter/silver. That's ok in this instance because my walls are brown. If they were any other color, I would have been upset because there's no way you can get this back in the box.", 
    "The picture makes it look alot glamorous than it really is. Besides that, it is not as tall as I thought it would be. It is easy to put together, and was good for the price!", 
    "This was so easy to put together that I threw the box and packing away before I even finished.Two of the shelving loops(what the shelves slip into)broke off so now they're attached with zip ties.Also,the shelving is not deep enough to hold much,and my cat doesn't appreciate that either,since the last one I had was able to accomodate him.", 
    "This is a perfect piece for my bathroom. First of all, this is a DECORATIVE piece. It's very pretty but it's not meant for rough and tumble storage. It is extremely sturdy considering it is very dainty. However, I was unable to attach the lower bar due to the location of the toilet's water spigot. And I was unable to attach the piece to the wall due to the baseboards. If you have baseboards, you will not be able to attach the piece to the wall because the piece will not be able to sit flush with the wall. I'm a young woman with no tools and I was able to put it together just fine in a few minutes. I use mine for my makeup basket and the jars containing cotton balls/qtips, and the tissue box to get them off the vanity/sink. I would highly recommend the piece with the caveat about baseboards not allowing it to attach to the wall, which is how it would be most sturdy.", 
    "This spacesaver was true to size and color. It was very easy to assemble but a little shaky until secured to the wall. The shelves are not solid so small items may slip thru but, they are easily removable for cleaning. I was going to purchase this same spacesaver from another site but happen to find it on Overstock for 30.00 less. In all it was a pretty good buy .", 
    "The bathroom space saver is a must and I would recommend it to anyone. LOVE IT.", 
    "The box was very beat-up when I got it, but everything was in good shape and was easy to assemble. If you're looking for a light weight spacesaver, that needs to be attached to the wall, this will meet your needs.", 
    "I bought this because my master bath does not have a linen closet and I needed somewhere to put my daily use toiletries instead of underneath the sink cabinets which was breaking my back. However, I have a toilet that is not the standard and is slightly higher than most because I am tall. I didn't think it would be an issue however the shelf does not fit over the toilet and is currently balancing on the back of the toilet while I figure out if there is a way I can maybe bolt it to the wall or return it. It is nice looking shelf, but the shelves are not very wide - so if you want this more for looks than function, I would recommend it.", 
    "The rack is just OK. The finish is actually painted.", 
    "This over-the-toilet shelving is nice and not too bulky. It works great. It's made out of a rustic brass.", 
    "Really like the look of the product, took alittle time to put together, but holds up well.", 
    "I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SPACE SAVER. THIS WAS MY FIRST PURCHASE . I WAS HAPPY WITH THE PRICE AND QUALITY. VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. I DID'T MEASURE HIGHT FROM FLOOR TO TOILET. ONE OF THE BARS I HAD TO LEAVE OFF, BUT WAS STILL STURDY.CARMEN", 
    "This spacesaver is great for a small bathroom. The design lends itself to modern or traditional decor. It was very easy to put together.", 
    "It\u00bfs a nice bathroom accessory, but I wouldn't call it a space saver. The shelves are narrow and if you keep things like mouthwash or lotion (i.e. a large bottle of Listerine) on the shelves, it can only go on the top shelf because it would not fit on the other shelves.", 
    "This was very easy to assemble, and looks good in my bathroom. Couldn't fit the bottom support bar due to the plumbing behind the toilet, but it's still very sturdy. Shelves are narrow - don't plan on storing large stuff on it. You can tell it was put together - the fit between the top and bottom assemblies isn't seamless - there is a little bit of lopsidedness and the fit isn't perfectly flush and square. Nevertheless, it looks good.", 
    "This rack is too short and too small to actually hold anything. If you need space to display your stuff, this is not the one to get. The workmanship is not great but it was easy to asemble.", 
    "This product was very easy to assemble and looks the same as pictured. I put it as a shelf in my living room rather than an over the toilet shelf. It is nice, but i wish it were bigger. It looks as if it would be perfect as it is meant above a toilet, but sort of scrawny for a living room shelf. Overstock was very professional and my package arrived timely and unharmed.", 
    "I had a very old style shelves system and this one really worked out perfect for me. This was the one of the best purchases I ever made. It looks perfect in me bathroom and I am more than happy with this item. I sure did get the best deal all the way around.", 
    "The space saver is compact and fits well in the smallest of bathrooms. The 8.5 inch depth is ideal when you place this over the toilet.The rusty finish is suspect.", 
    "I have tried so many over-the-commode items, most are too bulky, too deep, or too narrow. This one went together in 5 minutes, it's a little wonky, but it fits so nicely and does not interfere with use of the commode.", 
    "This is a good product, easy to put together. It goes with my brushed brass theme in my bathroon. Great price.", 
    "I love this shelving unit for my bathroom. It pulled it all together. Real nice.", 
    "I have bought a lot of stuff from Overstock. com. I have to say that this is the best deal. It came on time, well-packaged, and fully assembled. It is a beautiful piece of furniture and fits with any decor.", 
    "Wow - 2 day delivery is almost unheard of....So well packaged and easy to assemble. A real touch of class added to the bath....Highly recommend for a quick bath redo -", 
    "This product is great. It was so easy to put together; it's attractive; I love it.", 
    "Our shelves arrived as beautiful as they looked on the OVERSTOCK.COM webpage. No surprises. They are easy to fold/unfold and set up. Thanks!", 
    "I'm very satisfied with this item. It was easy to assemble, and looks great in my newly painted bathroom. The only negative comment I have is that your description of this item stated that the shelves are 8 and 1/2 inches deep. In fact, they are 5 and 1/2 inches deep. This is not a problem for me, but potential buyers should be aware of this.", 
    "I got one of these for each of my bathroom. I couldn't be happier. They are both durable and beautiful. What an awesome deal, too. Highly recommend.", 
    "The space saver is attractive, unusual, and sturdy. It finishes out my mediterranian bathroom decor. It's assembly was a snap with all needed parts in the pacakage and easy to install.I LOVE it!"
