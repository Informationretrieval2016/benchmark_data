    "Where have you been all my life? This coffee table is our favorite piece of furniture in the house! I use one side as my office and the other side to keep remotes, Kleenex, snacks and other items within arms reach of my boyfriends recliner. The living room looks clean and organized with all that clutter tucked away in our new coffee table :-)", 
    "I was a bit worried this would look cheap, as I feel the picture on overstock portrays, but it looks great in person and the color is darker and richer. Lots of storage to hide all your stuff, and apart from the top sliding a bit even when fully closed, I really like it, especially for the price!", 
    "This was a great find. I needed toy storage in my play therapy office. This is stylish, functional, and a great price.", 
    "Just be careful when putting it together, it is particle board and things line up well just need to be patient plus have a co-helper to lift things down at the same time. This is a must buy item, we love ours. The only thing I would do different is to purchase some wheels so that it is easier to move once it has items in it. Lowes has the kind I'm looking to purchase.", 
    "I would highly recommend this table. It was inexpensive, but with high quality. It will be a great addition to my new living room furniture. The table arrived quickly, was easy to put together, and looks very high end.", 
    "Please do not waste money on this. Matierial is poor quality plywood and MDF boards, some pieces are very flimsy. Many of KIEA products might be better and cheaper than this. Assembly is easy and straight forward. Looks decent in living room. It is not brown but black in color. It wil not survive shifting to another house of town. I could have bought a far better piece for probably $50 more locally at some furniture store. I am not sure how genuine some reviews about this item are.", 
    "no complaints, easy assembly, every part was number, and goes great with my furniture. highly recommended.", 
    "I recently moved into a new house and have been looking for all sorts of furniture. I wanted a solid wood coffee table, and also to have something unique. I could not find any solid wood coffee tables in modern design for less than $400. I saw this table and it meets all of my needs, dark, modern, and has a unique sliding top so that I can eat on it from the couch. I was concerned that the MDF would make the product creaky and cheap, this is not the case. The table assembles easily and is quite sturdy when tightened up and glued. The top slides on wooden rails, and there is some play (will rock back and forth) but does not move up and down. I am concerned that it will scratch very easily, and have put felt pads on the trays I normally leave on the table. Bottom line, you cannot buy nicer furniture for the price. Unless you find something on craigslist, solid wood will cost you alot more.", 
    "I love the look of it....tons of storage space. Fits all four of my throw pillows in the top when necessary. Plus the drawer space! Only complaint I have which is a big deal is that it scratches extremely easily. I've had it three weeks or so and already can see several scratches on the top. Anything hard set on it will scratch it. Keys, a toy, etc. I recommend some sort of glass top or not sure if there is an additional finish for it when its not real wood to start with? Overall happy with it", 
    "Customer service is awesome! She was willing to credit my account for chips on my table.", 
    "The table fits perfectly in our den. With the drawers and the top moving, it will be very useful. It was not difficult to put together. My husband did it in a few hours. We are very pleased with our choice.", 
    "Initially i was disappointed with the color of the table. I was expecting a lighter color, more like walnut but instead it was a dark sort of roasted coffee bean color. Either way its still a brown and not a black. That aside, it comes flat-packed so set aside a day or a couple hours if there's more than one person. As far as quality and function go its outstanding. The two small drawers work well for things like remotes and manuals/warranty type papers for the electronics in the same room. The storage under the sliding surface is the best though. It's a big space with tons of potential things to fit inside. The design is nice and the sliding top is convenient as a foot rest or reaching things while laying on the couch.", 
    "Tons of storage between the two pull out drawers and the slide out top compartments. Relatively easy to put together, but definitely needs two people to handle some of the larger parts.", 
    "I love it! The only thing is I had to get someone to put it together for me. It took them hours. Once it was assembled, it was a sight to behold. Another friend has one similar, but without the drawers, and slide top. He paid $400, for his. I just smile and said, \"mine didn't cost half that.\" Thanks Overstock.com!", 
    "Arrived in a huge box, nicely packed to prevent any wear and tear. There are multiple pieces, and you have to assemble yourself, but the directions are easy to follow. I would recommend having a power tool on hand as screwing the slats the top pieces slides on it difficult. Other than that, its true to its color and a nice, sleek piece. I think its a great buy.", 
    "Product is great. Exactly as advertised. The instructions were easy to follow and assembly was easy.", 
    "I bought this for my niece after NYU graduation. She was setting up her first apartment. She loves it. m", 
    "overall im happy. it's sturdy/heavier vs other coffee tables i've looked at in stores. i love the storage, drawers on bottom are well crafted, it fits flush. track wheels make them smoothly glide open/closed. main storage is accessed by sliding the top of coffee table back which reveals a HUGE compartment. took me about 30-40 minutes to put together, and it was pretty easy....it will be harder/longer for others whom suck at putting things together...definatly a 2 person job to line up the top of coffee table on the final step though. only quam/quarrell i have is that the top of coffee table that slides back is NOT on a track like the drawers are....instead it slides on slots of wood...you can hear it scrape/rub as you open and close since it's just wood on wood. you have to evenly apply pressure to both left and right side while sliding open and closed otherwise it goes all cockeyed and wont shut/open properly. this is such a great coffee table, i just wish manufacturer would've gone the extra step in making track wheels or a better way for the top to function. but with it all said and done i do enjoy this coffee table and am glad i purchased it,", 
    "It took a while to put together but wasn't difficult to put together. Looks good and was just what I needed to store DVDs and video games.", 
    "This piece is great for under $*. I put it together slowly to make sure I got it right, but assembly was pretty straight forward and simple. All pieces line up and junctions are tight giving this the look of a more pricey item. The only minor complaint is that the slide open action could be smoother. Would buy again!", 
    "I read all the reviews and I am not sure why every one says this is hard to put together. I put the table together by myself in about 45 minutes. I spent 20 minutes taking the pieces out of the box and cleaning them because they were quite dusty and had a lot of broken styrofoam on them. I have had no problems with the top \"sliding\" off either. I love the table. I only have one complaint and that is it holds fingerprints very easily. I feel like i am wiping the top off every day, but because it doesn't take very long, I am ok with that.", 
    "No complaints for this table other than I wish there was a locking mechanism for the top sliding panel. It tends to move quite a bit with kids around so we're constantly sliding it shut.", 
    "It is a very nice looking coffee table, and the compartments are awesome. But...There were only pictures for each step of how to put it together, so it wasn't that easy to follow because we kept trying to decipher which end of the pieces were supposed to go where. Also, when we got to the drawers, we were missing two screws. I know what you're thinking, you're thinking that we lost two screws in the process of putting everything together, but no. All the screws and such were individually packaged, and what was supposed to be 8 screws for the drawers were only 6. Like some other reviewers have mentioned, the sliding top is not good quality. The drawers easily open because they're on rollers, while the top is sliding wood against wood. You can hear it and you can feel it when you open it. Not cool.", 
    "I love the table! It's beautiful and the storage is perfect. It was fairly easy to put together (it is helpful to have 2 people). The only complaint I have is that the top slides a bit too easily but overall it was a great purchase!", 
    "Works OK, quality is fair, parts were correctly labeled, relatively intuitive assembly.", 
    "Easy to build. Suitable for a first apartment. I would recommend too anyone", 
    "This table went together really easily for my husband and I. It's a very dark brown with accents. The only thing I don't love about it is that the sliding table top is on wooden rails instead of metal ones, which makes for an extremely NOT smooth slide open. And it never slides evenly. So, as long as visitors don't touch it, it'll keep being a great buy.", 
    "This is a good coffee table for a family room or game room. Easy to store games and toys and not so expensive that it can't handle some wear and tear. The sliding top is a little wiggly, but still looks nice. Overall I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "Good product, a little difficult to assemble but got it in the end. Color is darker than picture but that's OK... know that espresso is VERY dark.", 
    "Coffee table has a lot of storage! Shipping was fast. Took about two hours to get together with my husband and I working on it. Would def recommend 2 people. Once the glue dries and all the pieces are together it is very stable on our carpeted living room floor. The finish is nice and looks good with our dark green couches . We use it to store out laptop and our two year olds toys, and the couch throw pillows. He has been inside and on top if it and no damage/ cracking has occurred. The top slides easily enough for him to get his stuff out. You do have to push on the center of the table to get it too slide open smoothly. Very pleased with this purchase. <a href=", 
    "I am no stranger to Overstock.com's MDF, veneer furniture. I have bought plenty. This is better than some items I've bought. It really is very pretty. It doesn't look too cheap. Though don't kid yourself, it doesn't look like I spent a ton of money, either. I think it's fair to say that I got what I paid for. My biggest complaint is that it came with several chips and scratches in the veneer. Luckily, none of them are really visible at a cursory glance and most were on the inside panels. The other problem I noticed right away is that it is very susceptible to fingerprints. I will constantly have to wipe them off. Overall- it's way better than my last Overstock.com coffee table. And I do love the extra storage. Super easy to put together.", 
    "Perfect size, great storage space, just what I was looking for in our small 1bedroom apartment. The only problem we have with it is sliding the top layer, it kind of gets stuck at the end or wobbles side to side. I am probably not explaining it right, but it is still okay and manageable still. We use it to eat on practically everyday so we love it. I would grade it EXCELLENT otherwise.", 
    "I was very impressed with workmanship. Love the storage which allows me to hide all my papers and access them easily", 
    "This coffee table looks nice, and has nice perks-with the sliding table top and drawers, but the pieces that make it up are equivalent to every bookshelf you've bought at IKEA that fell apart 2 years later. Table was complicated to put together-for example you have to secure two sides to a middle piece with little wooden pegs-and when you push one side in-it pushes the other side out. Make sure you build this on top of a rug or a piece of cardboard, because you will be sliding the fake wood back and forth for some time before you get it together. We have placemats under everthing we put on this table, so we havent scratched it yet.", 
    "A very convenient coffee table, with plenty of storage space plus it matches our living room. It was not easy to assemble, though, and one of the decorative parts was cracked but I was able to repair it.", 
    "This coffee table works great. We needed extra storage space in our den and now it looks so much less cluttered with this coffee table. We also wanted something inexpensive that we wouldn't mind if it got a bit damaged by our kids, so it is perfect for us. The coffee table seems a tad smaller than what I imagined based on the picture. The color is a deep brown, not black as another reviewer said. The top slides open easily. It was pretty easy to put together, has about 20 different parts when shipped to you. It took my husband and I about an hour to put it together.", 
    "i can't believe how much of a bargain this coffee table is! shipping was incredbly fast, and so was setting it up. Love all the storage space and the color goes very well with my sofa. I can't believe it was such a bargain for a good quality coffee table. just like the picture online, is exactly what I received. Love Overstock, it's the best.", 
    "This table is wonderful and very nice addition to my living room. I received my coffee table in just 2-3 days and it didn't take too long to assemble, so that was great! I also like the two drawers that came with the table, it's more than what I bargain for. Great price, with very nice quality.", 
    "The cabinet looks great. The sliding top is a bit stiff and wobbly when trying to open it. This might be because you have to assemble the items yourself and I might have not done it correctly or because the product isn't made with the most quality product. But for the price you are paying this product is great and it does look very nice.", 
    "I bought this table to place in our living room. It is a very pretty color and the amount of storage is great! I do agree that the assembly is pretty crazy so just set aside most of your night to try to assemble it. It took my boyfriend and I about 2 hours or so. But it is pretty much exactly as advertised and I am happy with my purchase!", 
    "Not the greatest piece of furniture, but I love the storage!", 
    "This item has very chip quality", 
    "The table was difficult to put together and is flimsy.", 
    "I wont even allow my son to touch it nor sit anything on it...granted it comes with a bunch of pieces so I ended up paying $*** to have it put together..but maybe you have patience....drawers move in and out easily,no complaints with this buy...really looks good in person", 
    "Setup was challenging especially since some of the parts didn't fit exactly together, namely the drawers. The finish product is nice and functions as advertised so all and all it is worth the minor challenges of setting it up.", 
    "Putting this coffee table together was horrifically frustrating. I thought it was going to arrive in one or maybe two pieces, but it was more like 100. The instructions were not the clearest, and they included the wrong number of screws (according to the instructions) so we had to improvise. After a couple of hours and a few swearing sessions, it was built and now we are very happy. It's very attractive and we love the storage. The only draw back is that dust and dog hair gets stuck underneath it and it's too narrow of a space to fit a broom or mop, so you have to move it to clean (and it's quite heavy).", 
    "it is not as well built as it looks. it has drawers, but they do not work as well as I hoped. the materials to make this are not high quality.", 
    "Great piece of furniture.", 
    "I put this together about a week ago and going from memory, but went together pretty easily. Originally did seem that all the pieces were lining up (could see edges of the particle board), but tightened things up and moved into position and I don't see particle board edges now. So, yeah, great. The storage is great. I live in a large studio, but can always appreciate more discrete storage!", 
    "Easy to put together and it is very strong and holds a lot.", 
    "It is very pretty. I'm very pleased", 
    "We needed more storage for books and photo albums and this is a life saver!", 
    "a little flimsy but easy to build and durable when built", 
    "We are very happy with the purchase of this coffee table. It has storage area to hide away things or to store things to be handy in need of them. It matches with our leather sofa set very well. It's a good piece of furniture.", 
    "This table is perfect! It's a great size for our living space with tons of storage in the top and drawers. The only thing I'll caveat is that it looks more black than brown in person, but is still a good neutral color.", 
    "For the money it looks great", 
    "Very sturdy and made of good material. Wasn't that easy to assembly.", 
    "This is a really great piece. Easy to assemble, matches my entertainment center. The color is really pretty and there is lots of storage. . I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Looks great, drawers and table top both slide with ease!", 
    "This table was fairly easy to put together. It is a substantial piece of furniture. It has a lower profile but lots of storage space. The sliding top is better than having to lift it and the drawer hold quite a bit.", 
    "It is nice to have a place to put the remote, magazines, books and other little things that are laying around. Not one for assembling things, It wasn't too bad, but not something I would want to do again.", 
    "It looks like the picture but very flimsy. The top has no latch so when you are cleaning or putting your feet up it moves easily. I was expecting something a little more sturdy.", 
    "this coffee table is VERY dark brown...appears almost black without sunlight. I love the storage compartments.", 
    "I won't let me son stand in it and jump again, cause it kinda cracked one of the shelves lol. It was a pain to put together, but out was a great price so I can't complain", 
    "this coffee table has served as well. great storage that we use to keep from throw blankets, magazines, books and remotes. great purchase!", 
    "I love this coffee table! I got a great deal on it. It is a bit heavy I set mine up on furniture sliders and it stays on them so I can move it easier when vacuuming . I also didn't realize how big it was so for me its a little difficult to find room for it but I saw it and just had to have it LOL I Love it!", 
    "Hard and time consuming to put together, and a bit of finish chipped off the back. Looks fine if you like the 'G-plan 1970's' look, not so good if you have even a modicum of good taste.I wish my wife would spend the extra money and get some proper, assembled furniture instead of making my Sundays an absolute misery trying to put this junk together.", 
    "Very nice coffee table. Instructions were clear and assembly was easy. We recieved alot of compliments on it already. My only complaint is the delivery. It stated that this package required a signature yet when it was actually delivered it was just left on my front porch. In addition, the delivery date was off by almost a week which is very annoying when you are adjusting your schedule in order to wait for your package. Because of this I will have to think twice before ordering from overstock again.", 
    "Beautiful table at a great price! Easy to assemble and a TON of storage space. We get a lot of compliments on this table!", 
    "Package came neatly wrapped. No damage to any pieces during delivery. Took about 1 hour to assemble with 2 people. I hesitated because Many people commented that assembly was difficult but it was actually very easy ( and this is coming from somone who's never used power tools before). Looks great in our living room and the storage is VERY useful. Only wish it was a bit wider, but nothing to complain about since the dimensions are posted and I knew what I was getting into prior to buying. Highly recommend", 
    "Nice looking piece of furniture with good storage space.", 
    "Great investment! Easier to put together with a second pair of hands. Highly recommend this item!", 
    "I have two small kids and I love this table. It's great to hide all their craft stuff and coloring items. It is very pretty and easy to clean as we'll.", 
    "little time consuming to put together. Love the storage and exactly what I was looking for", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for. I can't think of anything negative to say about it because it's perfect!", 
    "The storage is perfect, exactly what I was looking for.I keep DVD/Games/Books in the larger storage which does not work ideally. The sliding top has never fallen off, but I need to tighten the screws at least once a week or else it will become wobbly.Drawers work great, and so great price for this item", 
    "Highly recommended!!! Was a gift for my daughter and she loves it!", 
    "This coffee table adds an edge to our living room. Very Happy with purchase.", 
    "I love this coffee table so far. It's a great value for the price and there is so much storage- you can't beat that! The design is pleasing and it fits well in our living room.I'm knocking off a star for 2 reasons:-Picture is very misleading. It is extremely dark brown, not the rich brown you see in the photo-Assembly was difficult and time consumingOverall, I would recommend this product.", 
    "a little larger than anticipated, but assembly was a breeze!", 
    "The table is sturdy and the finish matched our other espresso furniture very well, but it was difficult to put together. The instructions are just pictures, the screw heads strip with one missed turn of the screwdriver, and the drawers wouldn't come together without altering the bottom of the drawer.", 
    "I absolutely love the table! It's very nice, had no issues with delivery. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's very difficult to put together and the instructions are horrible! Otherwise, great purchase.", 
    "The picture seemed to have some brown tone but is very black. Ok. Very involved assembly about 2 hours", 
    "Love this coffee table! I bought it to hide my paperwork and it does a great job of it. Eventually I may use it as a filing cabinet. Other reviewers complained that it was difficult to put together but I didn't find it to be that way at all.", 
    "This cofee table arrived quickly as promised. My husband was able to put it together in less than 2 hours with help of a power drill. The only tricky part was building the sliding top. It stores a lot of stuff and looks great!", 
    "a put together pressboard piece of furniture. Disappointed at the value for this item", 
    "I have been looking for a coffee table like this for a while. I am thrilled with this purchase. It is modern and functional. The color matches perfectly with my living room and the storage is great. I highly recommend this table. You can not beat the price also!", 
    "The particle board could be more dense. It comes with glue for the dowels which is good but the pocket holes are drilled into the least dense wood so the fit is sloppy. It was NOT hard to put together. Follow the instructions but make sure to read them fully and understand it in total before assembling it.", 
    "This is an amazing coffee table that the kids and I enjoy. It took me about 45-1 hour to build and the directions were a little confusing. I personally do not like using glue so I chose not to use it and so far this table has lasted. For the time that is has been in my house it seems durable.", 
    "I recieved this coffee table about a week and a half after ordering. Considering how much it cost I was expecting at least some of it to be put together but when I opened the box there were several pieces tightly tucked inside styrofoam that crumbled right when you touched it. There was styrofoam everywhere!! Anywho, now I am not a beginner by any means at putting things together, but I actually had to stop and get my mother to help me finish putting this together because there are sevral pieces that have to be put together at the same time, at the exact same angle! very frustrating! The end result was nice, a little smaller than I was expecting, the only thing was the instructions require you to add the sliding compartment pieces last, but if you do it that way you will end up with one side sliding and the other just leaning because you can't put both ends in at the same time.", 
    "I also purchased the end table, and there is a lot more then some assembly required. I had just had rotator cuff surgery so box was opened in garage and brought in piece by piece. It took two days and the help of a friend for me to finish. I do love it, just not sure a person in their 70's after surgery should attempt this.", 
    "A very convenient coffee table that provide lots of storage. Not the best quality but it functions well. Instructions could be better but not hard to put together. So far I'm happy with the purchase.", 
    "I was really surprised at how many pieces to have to put together, but it was really pretty easy. I did it by myself in about 2 hours. and that was only because I have trouble sitting on the floor. I love the extra storage.", 
    "I am not in satisfied with this table, but I expected more for the money. I don't find the quality to be much better than something that you would purchase at IKEA. VERY difficult to put together. It took me almost 5 hours and pieces do not fit well together.", 
    "Rather easy assembly - I put the product together in about 2 hours which is pretty good for me. Overall, a great looking table.", 
    "It is great for storage. It fit a lot of toys and still looks great as a coffee table.", 
    "The table was good, but we had a hard time putting the top on it.", 
    "Coffee table was just what I wanted, love the extra storage!", 
    "This was absolutely miserable to put together. The instructions are bad, the holes are poorly drilled, and this is definitely a two person job given the size and the convoluted positions you have to get in to put the whole thing together. The back of the interior drawers both chipped because the holes didn't line up; you can't see it but there you go. But put together it is beautiful. It is MUCH DARKER than pictured--almost black. But the slide away top and drawers are great. One of the drawers (due to the lack of a clean flush because of the holes) sticks out just a bit. But I'll deal. It is a steal for the price, and seems much more expensive than it was.", 
    "The instructions were just awful for this table. We used the wrong screws in the beginning, so we had to go back & take it apart & start over again. took us a total of about 4-5hrs to put together. BUT the product is great! it's very sturdy & a great buy for the price!", 
    "This coffee table looks nice, and i love the storage space but the quality is cheap. Its very flimsy. Save your money to buy a quality table.", 
    "The product has plenty of storage which is the only good thing I can say about it. The quality is Ikea-like but much harder to assemble due to less than acceptable instructions quality (I am a technical person and I never have issues with any assembling). The material is rather cheap and I do recommend putting some kind of cover on the table as it will scratch easily - for the price it's decent but it's not the great deal I thought it was", 
    "It falls apart easily, I would stay away. it was very easy to put together though. I'll probaby trash this coffee table in a month and buy one that's more solid. god what a disappointment....", 
    "although it provide extra storage space the top of this table will come apart after few months of use. my husband moved it a few times and one side fall off.", 
    "Photos looked like would match my brown leathe r trimmed sofa set...it is black finish...they call dark expresso...it is dark alright..not like these photos you see and the two end talbes to match were same dark black color too. I can't return as Overstock wants me to take them apart again and box the pieces... It took me over 3 hours to assemble the table there are smaller cams and larger cams and used the small ones in the large holes and broke them in half...so when came time to use them had to glue all those parts together. Recommend you buy real furniture.", 
    "The assembly directions were not straight forward. The last step in the assembly process was baffling and was key to the final product.", 
    "The table looks so nice, however the top that slides is not secure. So it will not support what you may be wanting to sit on it when extended. I am presently trying to figure a way to secure it so it won't drop. I did lose my plate of food do the floor, I forgot to mention! Otherwise I love it."
