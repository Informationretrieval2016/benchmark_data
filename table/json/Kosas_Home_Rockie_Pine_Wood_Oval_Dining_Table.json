    "it is smaller than the measurements on the website. It has a big crack on the side, the color is very different from the picture. A disappointment!", 
    "We love our little table. Perfect for a breakfast nook and looks great. We paired it with upholstered chairs and it gives it a really classy look!", 
    "This table comes in 2 pieces, but was very easy to assemble. It has an ivory colored base, with browns and greys on top. The top coats were scratched off throughout the piece, and you can't really see this in the photos, but it matches almost everything because this woodwork. it was definitely worth the money. All of my friends and family shower me with compliments about my table. It will stay in my dining room always."
