    "I bought this mattress to replace a cheap foam futon mattress that had become very thin and uncomfortable. I've only had the new one for a couple of days, so I can't comment on how well it will stand up over time, but it is VERY comfy! I can't feel the bars of the futon frame underneath me when I sit on it or lay on it, and it has a very firm and \"springy\" feel that is similar to real furniture like a couch or chair. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. For the price, this is a significant improvement over what we had. The only reason I'm giving this four instead of five stars is because the product description says that it is 10 inches thick, and it's really more like 6.5 inches. That on its own doesn't bother me (comfort is more important than thickness), but I ordered a futon cover to go with it, and specifically got the bigger size intended for futon mattresses that are 10 inches thick or thicker. The cover is a bit large and looks wrinkled and sloppy. If you're ordering a cover to go with this mattress, choose the smaller size.", 
    "I recently downsized and lost my spare bedroom. A friend gave me a futon frame and I wanted a good quality mattress so that my guests would be comfortable. I shopped locally and found the nicer ones to be $600-$800. This mattress is as nice as the best one I saw in the futon store. I find myself crashing in the living room on weekends and putting guests in my bed because it's so darn confortable. I am very happy with the purchase.", 
    "We have a really nice futon frame, but the mattress was 11 years old and battered after 3 kids, 2 dogs and 3 cats have lived on it. Didn't want to buy a new couch or futon, so decided to buy a nice mattress instead. This mattress is so thick and comfortable, the kids, now teenagers, want to sleep on it instead of in bed! So comfortable and beautiful. Bought a zip-on mattress cover that's washable. A must for a busy home. I'd definitely buy it again and highly recommend it to anyone.", 
    "I moved into my new Manhattan apartment and got the mattress within 4 days (at 2.95!) The only glitch was that they didn't register my tracking info on my account. The mattress smelled strongly, but I covered it because I use it for a bed, and it's fine. I bought a non-slip rug pad to keep it from slipping of the frame, and it works like a charm when I put it up!", 
    "I just received the mattress yesterday, but it appears to be very good quality - certainly as described in the listing. The depth was 8 rather than 10 inches and I had been counting on that (picked up from other customer reviews) because I wanted to reuse my outdoor cover, made for an 8 inch depth. But, I detected no issues as I placed it on my frame and then sat comfortably. So far I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I bought this product about 6 months ago to replace a regular foam futon (which I used as my main sofa) that had compressed over the years and was no longer comfortable. I was hoping for a more resilient and supportive surface to sit on. Initially the new spring mattress worked well as a sofa and the support was even and comfortable. But after just a few months, the springs began to wear unevenly, so in the most-used areas of the mattress we can feel certain springs poking at our, well, behinds. Makes for a really uneven surface. Six months isn't a long time, so while this might be OK as a back-room guest bed, it's not a good choice for frequent use as a futon couch. Would go back to my old foam mattress if given a choice.", 
    "We have has this for over two years and use it constantly as a couch and occasionally as a guest bed. It has held up well and is still comfortable.", 
    "...if it is 10\" think, I have missed out on a promising career in pornography.", 
    "This by far was a pleasant surprise. I have had this mattress for over a year now, and it has been comfortable and held up to heavy use. I have it out in my screen room and it is used as a couch most of the time, and a bed when I have overnight guests. I have had no complaints from anyone. The inner springs make it thick and cushy.", 
    "We love this futon mattress. My husband works nights and sleeps on this futon so he doesn't wake me up. He loves the new mattress. It did smell \"new\" at first but that goes away. Also, it had a slight hump from being shipped but also went away and he is super happy with it. Great deal from OS!", 
    "I bought this mattress to replace the one that originally came with my cheap futon. After a few nights with my old mattress I could feel the bars of the futon and it was unbearable. I took a gamble and purchased this mattress. I ordered it on a Monday and had it by Wednesday! I have only used it for a weekend, but I slept very well. I cannot feel the bars anymore and find it to be much more comfortable than my old mattress. This was definitely worth the money. I am very happy I decided to try overstock, and very happy I bought this mattress.", 
    "This is a very nice matteress. For $$$bucks delivered, can't be beat. Color was excellent. No factory odor. My only criticism is it barely \"lofted\" to 8 inches. As it is, fine. I think 10 inches whould have been too thick. I weigh 220 pounds and this pad is comfortable. I'm happy!", 
    "The mattress was a great purchase. I've seen some people upset because the futon has lacked the quality of a couch or bed. Honestly, a futon is designed to be neither of those exclusively, but simply to have the capability of both. The futon is excellent for an occasional sleeper- we've used one in our basement during heavy storms- or in cases as how I use it now; as a couch/mattress for a gaming room for myself and friends to use intermittently. The mattress comes vaccuum-sealed, and will definitely have the raw cotton odor that is common with such sealed products (a outdoor/grassy type smell.) We were able to alleviate this smell largely with Fabreze and area room deodorizer. In warmer weather, opening a window would help as well. Probably something most noticeable in smaller rooms especially. This was our first foray into a spring-loaded mattress, and I was a bit dubious as to how well it would fold and stay on the futon. It actually folded rather easily, stayed well and certainly added more support than our previous all-cotton and cotton-foam hybrids.", 
    "I have read other reviews and was expecting an odor when we opened the package but, there was absolutely, no odor. The 10\" size was on point. It's nice and thick and very comfortable. My son who is a 36 has been visiting and has been sleeping on it for the last week and says \"it is probably the most comfortable futon he has ever slept on. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase....I love it. I have never been dissatisfied with any of my overstock purchases but, I do have a problem with Fed-Ex not updating their tracking system.", 
    "i needed a futon matt to replace an old one in bad shape...i shopped around and i preferred to get one with coils inside as opposed to a cheap plain foam and fillers matt that would flatten out in no time ...this mattress had the coils and thick foam that i wanted for long lasting comfort and that is just what it delivers... im a big guy 6'1 260lb and i use this to sleep on mainly because the stairs leading to my apartment are treacherous and narrow so a real bed wont fit through to my apartment but a futon that can be brought in in pieces and assembled inside is just what i need ....Great mattress Lightning fast shipping ..A+++", 
    "The mattress is quite firm and does not fold into my futon as described. I tried sleeping on the mattress once Iputit on the futon, however, it was so uncomfortable because of the firmness, so I bought an inexpensive mattress foam pad at Walmart and put it on top of the mattress which made a huge difference. Now I can sleep on it very comfortably.", 
    "I throughly love this futon mattress. The burgundy color is perfect, just like in the picture. The material is so easy to keep clean and soft to sit on. We keep it in the so called \"office\" which we use for everything; guest room, crafts, office, and just watching TV. The granddaughters and I have totally enjoyed the sturdiness of this futon. One reason I bought it is because it is made in the USA, I've never been disappointed either.", 
    "We bought this for my son's bunk bed, it originally came with a 4 inch mattress that when you sat on it, you felt the bars through it, received the mattress and opened it up, put it on the bed and have loved it. I even slept on it a few times with my son and was surprised how comfortable it was.", 
    "This is misrepresented in that no way can it bend in the middle to be used as a sofa on a futon frame. I would not recommend it, unless you plan to lay it flat - and only flat. This product is only good as a bed mattress, not as a sofa, as pictures. I would have rated this product as \"0\", but was not available. And it's not 10\" thick, maybe 7 or 8 at the most - definitely not 10.", 
    "It smells really bad (from factory, maybe). It won't go after 5 days in patio. It is still in my guest bedroom since", 
    "Fits futon well. Is good quality and very nice looking. Firm but not too firn.", 
    "We replaced our old worn futon mattress with this one and are very pleased. It is on a futon in the family room used upright for playing video games, and laid flat for overnight guests. I've had nothing but good reviews from my teens who use it. We aired it out for a couple of days after reading other reviews, and there was no issue with any odor. Good value.", 
    "I am very pleased with this purchase. I am always wary of buying products online that I can't try out in person, so this was a big risk for me. I am very happy about the mattress, however. I was afraid it would kill my back and not be the right thickness, but I was proven wrong. This mattress is perfect in every way. Super plush, I use it as a bed and as a couch. The inner springs are much better than the non spring futon mattresses I've slept on. Definately a positive purchase, and fast shipping.", 
    "Excellent product. Use daily", 
    "Very comfortable and fine for our use (which is really just when we have overnight guests). You can feel some of the springs, which is not great. However, for the price, still a great deal.", 
    "Really a great product for the money", 
    "Color is perfect and it arrived quickly!", 
    "This order says its a futon then I just receive the mattress only. The price is overprices just for the mattress of this. then I have to pay to return it.", 
    "It is only 8 inches, not 10 but very serviceable. I would purchase again.", 
    "Terrific buy for the price. Comfortable and decent looking. Nice fabric covering. Very happy with purchase.", 
    "If the naps I've taken on it are good enough to judge the quality of this futon mattress, I have to say that it hasn't disappointed me yet. So far so good. Thanks...", 
    "It took a while for the mattress to come to its shape but it is quite comfortable. A little difficult to fold futon up in the beginning. The color is great. Love it.", 
    "It exactly what I could expect for the money. It does the trick for overnight guests.", 
    "We bought this mattress for a full size futon frame we purchased separately and it works perfectly. The mattress takes a little while to fluff out and look more like 10 inches but its very bouncy, full, and comfortable. It did have a slight smell from the packaging but we aired it out for a few hours with febreeze and it worked just fine.", 
    "What a great purchase! We bought this for a futon frame we picked up at a Goodwill. After having 4 sets of guests sleep on this mattress, we've only heard wonderful things. No complaints whatsoever!", 
    "i do like this mattress. However, my legs are constantly falling alsleep when i try to watch a movie on the futon couch. I also do not like that the removable cover is actually just over the \"stuffing\" and springs of the mattress. There is nothing securely around the \"guts\", making me wonder what will happen when I need to remove the cover to wash it.....", 
    "I live in a NYC studio apartment. A futon is my primary bed. This is very comfortable . Love it. Only thing is red color is more of a rust then a red.Other than that would recccomend", 
    "I have been VERY pleased with this Futon Matress. It is comfortable as a bed and couch!!", 
    "This was delivered very quickly, the packaging was just right for product. We didn't notice any weird odors either. This was just as described and we couldn't be more happier with purchase. We haven't owned it for too long so I can't comment on durability at this time.", 
    "Perfect fit, Great packing job, and a Very sturdy mattress", 
    "Great futon, can take a beating from my 3 boys and dog.", 
    "I have been using this futon mattress for a few months now and I'm very happy with it. It did have a strong smell when I took it out of the packaging--more like straw than chemicals. However, the odor disappeared after a couple of weeks. The mattress feels very springy and is comfortable for sitting and sleeping.", 
    "It's very comfortable. Looks great. Worth every penny.", 
    "I orders this for my daughters dorm room.It was delivered in a large box, The color was true to the picture. There was a fabric odor but nothing that was overwhelming and it dissipated with a little time.The cushion is VERY comfortable without sacrificing adequate support for sitting and laying down. It is the most comfortable futon mattress I have experienced. Another great Overstock.com purchase!", 
    "The mattress is nice and thick and very comfortable for a futon mattress. It did have a bit of a chemical smell to it (as the other reviews also state). But after 2 weeks I barely notice it anymore.I left the mattress flat for 2 weeks, and I just turned it into a couch, so I am not sure how it will respond to being in this different position. All and all I am happy with my purchase!", 
    "very happy with my new mattress", 
    "Deserves 5 stars for comfort, both for sitting and sleeping! It is supportive but not hard. Negatives--It is VERY heavy. Hard to lift into the fame, and quite difficult to fold into sofa position.-it is about 6 1/2\" thick. The cover looks as though it was made for a much thicker mattress, so it is very lose and wrinkly- leaving the futon looking fairly unkempt. I keep trying to pull the cover taut to get it a bit neater looking, but to no avail. So overall- I am fairly happy with it.", 
    "good quality for the price", 
    "Love the new look it gave my futon! This piece is nice and strong my pets love it!", 
    "This is the third futon we have gotten from Overstock over the last approximately 15 or more years (they do eventually need to be replaced you know), for our handicapped daughter, who cannot sleep in a regular bed. For the price, you can't beat them, and they are very, very comfortable!", 
    "Terrific futon mattress. I've slept on it myself, found it extremely comfortable and several family members have stayed for extended periods and it's held up well.", 
    "What more can I say? This mattress is fantastic.", 
    "The mattress has a hard surface which is uncomfortable to sit on, but is fine for sleeping. Because we use it for sitting and only occasionally for sleeping I will replace it as soon as I can.", 
    "The color I ordered is what I had expected. Also, the comfort of the mattress itself is well worth the price.", 
    "I've had this mattress for about a month now and am quite happy with it. It serves primarily as a couch, and occasionally as a bed for company. Its is quiet and firm and very comfortable. It did have an oder when I first got it, but nothing intolerable even in my small apartment. Most of the oder is gone now. I was also thrilled that it arrived a day or two earlier than expected!", 
    "This mattress is pretty firm but it gives better support than the last one my son had. Although I'm not sure it will last more than a couple years", 
    "This was just what I was looking for. Very comfortable and a great price!", 
    "Absolutely love the new mattress.", 
    "In the life of my son's futon this is the fourth mattress he has had. One got him through childhood, another college, one grad school, and now he has this one. We paid $$$-$$$ for others and this one is lasting longer and is more comfortable than they were. He's married now and he and his wife have this in their family room.", 
    "Very comfortable and looks great. I have not used it as a bed, but a great nap spot.", 
    "Got this futon mattress for my son to go to college and it sleeps well", 
    "10 inch actual 6. Still waiting on refund.", 
    "Love the color and thickness. Fast shipping...Highly recommend this product.", 
    "The kids loved sleeping on it. Very Comfortable.", 
    "We replaced the futon mattress that came on our futon with this one..Couldn't be happier. .I am sure it will be lasting for many years, it was so well made..If your looking for a comfy mattress for your futon frame.. This is an excellent choice. .Thanks Amber;-)", 
    "Our daughter's mattress was ruined by a flood from the apartment above. This is a replacement and just wonderful especially for the price. Not as thick or firm as the original as we had sprung for a top of the line mattress as it was to be used as a bed mostly. It now is in a spare bedroom. This is firm but has a wonderful cushion feel to it. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "This mattress was an excellent choice as it is extremely comfortable and the quality and color were more than I expected.", 
    "Good value for a spare room mattress", 
    "I bought this four years ago for my daughter's bed and she's been very happy with it. Great value for the money, and well made. She's prone to backaches when she sleeps on regular mattresses and has never had a problem with this one.", 
    "I just received this mattress today so I don't know how long it will last but it is very thick and comfortable. I definitely cannot feel the bars underneath. It fits perfectly on the futon and I did not have any problems with it bending into shape. Hope it lasts!!", 
    "A quality tight mattress. Well made.I've owned it 4 years before doing this review and it is still like new.", 
    "I purchased this \"10-inch Loft Full-size\" futon mattress and a futon slip cover to go along with it but was extremely disappointed in the quality. This mattress is grossly misrepresented as having a 10-inch loft. This mattress is 6 inches thick at best. For the most part, items that I've purchased from Overstock.com have been good quality. This mattress sadly misses the mark!", 
    "A little big for the frame. Hard to fold back up. But more comfortable than any other futon I've been on!", 
    "Mattress is comfortable to sleep on. Not able to feel the frame beneath it at all. It looks tidy and the finish cover is good looking as well. The depth is more like 8 inches which is fine because standard covers will then fit.", 
    "We purchased the blue suede mattress for our metal futon frame. It came quickly rolled up in a shredded box. No matter, it was wrapped in a heavy plastic that protected it from the elements. I took it out of the box and plastic right away and let it rest on the floor for several hours. There was definitely a strong odor, but after a few hours it lessened and I'm confident that over time, it will dissipate completely. My husband really loved everything about it and said it was very comfortable.", 
    "Do not buy it. We purchased it in August, 2014 for vacation home, did not used it yet as it is impossible to sleep on it because of the bed odor, aired it for a month in sunroom, did not help. Stinks up all room with strange odor.", 
    "Arrived in record time and it very comfortable. Husband was pleased with the look", 
    "arrived in good condition", 
    "This futon mattress is thick and very comfortable. Great buy!!!", 
    "This is the most comfortable futon mattress we have ever owned.", 
    "Got this for our wooden futon frame and fits perfect plus very comfortable for sitting and sleeping. Great thickness and loved the fabric", 
    "I sleep on a futon, and the original pad was kind of thin. I looked into buying a \"normal\" mattress, but the cost was prohibitive. Then I found this futon mattress. It's comfortable, firm - and I get a great night's sleep. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "I thoroughly researched futon mattresses before I decided to buy this one. I have not slept on it yet but two of my adult daughters have and there are not complaints. The mattress arrived in a timely fashion and we did not experience a strong odor or any odor at all. I also use it as a couch, of course, and I am satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "The mattress is firm and thick,,exactly what I wanted to fit my oak futon.", 
    "I purchased this in the off white. Good quality and what I was looking for.", 
    "Not 10 inch mattress more like 8 inch but very comfortable. I sleep on it every night and not disappointed !", 
    "This was bought for my son for a smaller bedroom. I had bought a metal frame from a different place.He says it is much more comfortable than the regular futon mattresses. He does not feel the bars like you would other regular ones.", 
    "This replaced an old worn out matress that I had. It is perfect for sleeping on and much more comfortable for sitting on. I would definately recommend this mattress.", 
    "very happy with mattress. much better than mattress i replaced", 
    "We like this mattress. It's comfy to sit on and seems comfy to lie on, although no one, but the dog, has actually slept on it. She definitely gives it a resounding paws up, though! I wouldn't say it was exceptionally hard or soft, it's baby bear, just right.", 
    "Bought mattress for a friend. She is very pleased with it. Replaced mattress on her new futon than was too thin and giving her back pain. She started using a cane to walk with pain was so bad. Since getting this mattress pain has stopped. No longer uses cane. It has plenty of support and it not too firm. Over all she loves it.", 
    "Feels like a bed! Very comfortable. I was surprised. No regrets on this deal!", 
    "The label attached to the futon marked it was manufactured in Madison, WI the day after I ordered. It took additional 5 days for me to receive this futon mattress.The filled materials inside is obviously some sort of recycled cotton/mixed shreds. I guess the strong chemical smell is due to the sterilization treatment on these materials. The futon cover is made of cheap looking mixed cotton and nylon fabric, not micro fiber or thick cotton fabric. The only thing good about this mattress is the springs inside. It makes mattress cushy. Over all, I would say this mattress is acceptable. But it is definitely not a good deal with this price and this quality.", 
    "This is my first futon mattress and I'm using it in a guest room/office. It stays up mostly as a sofa and is very comfortable for sitting but also comfortable enough to sleep on comfortably. I like a soft mattress and it suits me just fine. It did have a smell when I first opened the package but it was gone in a couple of days. The color of the comforter was true to the picture but the fabric isn't my favorite so I'll be ordering another cover for it. For the price, I think I got a great deal and am very pleased.", 
    "has a solid feel to it, but have not slept on it yet. Fit on our existing frame perfectly.", 
    "This is GREAT to sit on, fits our standard wood frame perfectly, and we tried it out flat (for sleeping) also: can't wait to have some company so they can love it too! The difficult part, for us, was getting it to bend at the appropriate place for a seating, to STAY bent, and not want to flatten itself and go sliding off the frame. We've had it bungee'd down for a few weeks, and will take the bungee off eventually (not very decorative) to see if the mattress is \"trained\" enough (my daughter's term) to stay put. We'll be getting a fabric zip cover when we're a little more settled.", 
    "Needed a replacement for the old foam two back and bottom pillows which were out of shape within 5 months of use. This is so comfortable for sitting or lounging. I have difficulty going to sleep and often leave my select comfort air bed and go to sleep on the new our new futon inner-spring mattress. Can't beat the price and comfort any place. Most always satisfied with Overstock.com products.", 
    "This mattress replaced an 8-year-old mattress that we thought had innersprings. It did not and the new mattress cost less (even more so due to a Flash Deal). It is used mainly for seating, though we recently had an overnight guest sleep on it and they thought it was very comfortable. The brown color we picked goes well with the decor. We are very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I was really surprised how comfortable this mattress is it is great", 
    "I ordered the futon mattress to replace the one we had for years. The new mattress is much more comfortable than the one we had originally purchased. The quality appears to be quite durable (time will tell, as it is still very new). Delivery was quick, which was a huge factor for us. The packaging was intact and despite the size of the package it was still manageable to move up the stairs. I did have to replace the mattress cover as the one I had did not fit the new mattress. Over all we are very satisfied with our purchase.", 
    "WOW. THIS WAS REALLY A SURPRISE. THE MATTRESS IS BOUNCY AND IT FOLDED EASILY FOR THE UPRIGHT POSITION. NO ONE HAS SLEPT ON IT YET BUT IT FEELS LIKE IT WILL SLEEP JUST FINE. VERY HAPPY . PRICE IS GREAT.", 
    "On average, I replace my futon mattress every 18 months because it gets a lot of wear and tear from my dog. I have purchased this mattress a number of times and it is the best one that I have found for the money. Plus it is very delivered right to my door so I don't have to haul it home. I will keep buying this mattress!", 
    "Comfortable mattress and good quality for the price. I recommend it for an extra bedroom or small place.", 
    "Was hesitant to buy mattress online, but the reviews were right on target. Smell not overwhelming, but did allow time to air out before use. Great mattress. Not your typical futon garbage. You can actually get a good night's sleep on this mattress.", 
    "We purchased this as a replacement mattress. This one is much better quality and much more comfortable than the original mattress our futon came with. We use it for guests and have good remarks about it.", 
    "This mattress is way better than the one that comes with most frames. We bought it for a spare bedroom that also is used for a hobby/fitness room and the mattress works great when the futon is in the couch position as well. Excellent value for the money!", 
    "When the box arrived it was completely ripped up, two corners of the box were completely ripped open and it was smashed in, so I was a bit concerned about the possible damage to the futon mattress. Luckily, no damage. We ordered the Navy and it's a really deep navy. At first we thought it was black. So if you are thinking of ordering the Navy, know that it's a very dark navy. We really didn't care, because we knew we were covering it up with another futon cover. It's on a futon in our basement where our teenage sons hang out with their friends. It's perfect for that. I'm not too sure it's actually a 10\" thick mattress however. I haven't officially measured it, but it seems more like 8-9\". Nonetheless, it's a nice futon mattress for the price. We've only had it a few weeks, so it's hard to say how well it'll hold up. But even if we have to buy a new one in a couple of years, we'll still be ahead of the game, with some of the prices we saw for futon mattresses out there.", 
    "The mattress fits our futon frame fine. It folds to fit as the futon frame as a sofa just fine. It is slightly larger than the mattress we originally purchased when we bought the frame, so our old decorative cover doesn't fit. I am planning on sending it to college with my son to use as a bed, so I think with a good quality mattress pad and sheets it will be fine for him without a new cover.", 
    "This is a must have for anyone looking for a mattress that is used everyday as a sofa would be. It is also great to sleep on. Very comfortable for both uses. The mattress arrives rolled up and fluffs up with no problem. There is a bit of an odor the first day but it fades quickly. I am very very happy with this mattress. The price is great too.", 
    "My old mattress really needed to be replaced ASAP. I looked high and low and Overstock offered the best price, so I ordered the Splendor on May 10. It was shipped May 15, but when I checked FedEx it read that shipments may be delayed due to the tornado. Then... nothing. When I realized that my mattress flew away, I called Overstock and spoke to Vanessa, who apparently was shocked more than I. She went out of her way to ensure that this incident will be resolved, and it was! Let me tell you: this level of customer care (yes, care) was something that everyone could use. There were follow-up emails assuring that my replacement order was processed and I got my mattress within a week. Regarding FedEx delivery: when tracking info showed that the mattress was already in my area, I called and begged to re-schedule for Saturday (work full-time, cannot sit and wait), gave my phone, etc. Nevertheless, it was delivered two days early to the wrong building, where someone called to report wrong delivery - thank you, honest neighbor! - and I ran into the FedEx guy in my lobby on Friday, purely by chance. He never got any info on re-delivery date. Dear FedEx, can you get some customer service tips from Overstock? Just ask for Vanessa! She is a real pro. I hope her excellence will be recognized and rewarded. Finally: The mattress is springy, firm enough to be bouncy, really really cozy, and the \"grassy\" smell people are complaining about disappeared overnight. My back is relieved, and I am very happy with my choice. The price was the cherry on the cake :) THANK YOU, OVERSTOCK. I was, am, and will be your loyal customer.", 
    "This product came to our door within 5 days of ordering. This is a replacement for the original futon mattress that was worn out, very thin, and ruined by the puppy. Was packaged well and was intact when Fed-Ex delivered. Easy to get out of the package. It had a new smell but not offensive. Since this futon gets a lot of wear and tear and is still subject to the puppy I put a full-sized water proof mattress cover on it and a fitted sheet sheet. This way the mattress stays clean. It is super comfy and has already been slept on. Great for sitting on when the futon is folded up. Comfortably firm for my back. The springs make all the difference. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and think it was a great value-better than I expected!", 
    "My son wanted a futon for his room instead of a regular bed. We purchased one and the matress that came with it was very thin. I saw this one and when it arrived, I was very impressed by how thick and soft it was. Definitely a great purchase for him. After the first night of sleeping, he said he slept great and loved it.", 
    "This futon is much better than what I had before , I use it on my boat and it will hold up well for many years to come.", 
    "A friend gave us a nice wood futon frame for our beach house so we brought the metal frame home for the screen room. I purchased the mattress for home and it has worked out wonderfully! Not only is it comfortable to sleep on, it is very comfortable to sit on. I love to use it for my meditations.", 
    "It took me a while (about a year!) to finally decide on this futon mattress. The original mattress was a very dark blue almost black and was perfect for my lower-level d\u00e9cor, but it was just padding and after several years, was flat as a pancake. I wanted user comfort so I opted for inner springs and I didn't want the color to be a drastic change (and that was the major worry, if the color would be true to the color shown online). Once it arrived, my concerned were put to rest. So happy I bit the bullet finally and order this. The mattress sits much higher than the old one and is very, very comfortable. I've stretched out on it and yes, I've caught a few \"Z's\" just to test it out (wink, wink). My houseguests will no longer fight over who has to sleep on the futon. It feels as comfortable as my pillow top mattress.", 
    "I am so glad I purchased the mattress for my futon. The old one no longer had any thickness to it. This new one is so comfortable and thick. I tis like sleeping in a full size bed. I love it.", 
    "Thanks for the speedy delivery and the great product.", 
    "A great futon mattress which fit the futon perfectly with comfort. The mattress is a quality product and glad that I ordered it. Thanks!", 
    "I am sleeping on this mattress every night and it is comfortable, unlike other futon mattresses I have slept on in the past. Thumbs up!", 
    "I would reccomend this mattress! Make sure you do air it out before using and use a futon cover. It is not quite as thick as described, which is beneficial because it is difficult to close when using as a futon (sofa) vs a bed. Nothing really major to complain about! This purchase was a good investment compared to local stores and their pricing and quality! Thank you!", 
    "I actually bought this to replace my mattress on my bed. I figured , why pay $500 right? I have to say for the price this mattress is so comfy. I actually like better than the mattress I bought at a bedding store. Will buy it again when needed! I HIGHLY recommend this mattress!", 
    "comfy futon, my boyfriend didn't expect it to be comforble. we were both pleasantly suprised. its not like a mattress but it most certainlt is more comfy than those futons without spings.", 
    "Bought this futon to replaceu one in the screened patio. This futon is so comfortable and good value.", 
    "This mattress is far better than the one you would get if you bought one at Walmart. It's much thicker and has more support. My son sleeps on it every night and doesn't complain. I still think a regular mattress would be better and I worry about his back causing him trouble at some point, but he's 15 and as long as he isn't complaining I'm not worrying about it. It looks nice and is comfortable as far as I can tell.", 
    "Use it as a couch and it is breaking-in nicely. Fits frame perfectly. Arrived in stated time.", 
    "Overall happy with the purchase. The mattress is solid and comfortable. Shaped nicely. Very good quality compared to what you would get at a store for the price.", 
    "Looks sturdy, fit on existing futon frame. Did not notice any smell and we started using it right away. Arrived quickly. First time ordering from this company. They were very helpful. Would definitely order again.", 
    "I am a college student who was looking for a full sized mattress/futon to use during the semester. I will be moving across the country after 4 months so I didn't want to spend a bunch on a good mattress, i just needed something to sleep on. I've been sleeping on it every night for a month and its not perfect but it works. Was super comfortable at first but after a couple of week the center began to sink it and the springs were pretty pronounce where my weight was centered the most. Today I flipped it and it feels a lot better. I am hoping that if i flip it once a month it will be ok but this is definitely not a long term bed option!", 
    "It took 10 days for me to receive my order which I think is a long wait, considering it took 7 business days to inform the shipper. The mattress came in a not so secured box. Opening it is pretty easy, but still waiting for it to reach to a 10-inch full size futon coz I keep on measuring it but the mattress is not even over 6-inch. It has a bit funky smell but it doesn't bother us a bit.", 
    "Delivery was within the hours specified. Tracking the shipment online was easy. On line customer assistance was wonderful. Sleeps comfortably. A bit smaller than I anticipated, but not by much. All in all very happy with my purchase.", 
    "This was better than the older mattress we got. It's a little hard to convert into a couch from a bed, but I'm assuming that it will break in over time. I was doing research on the different kinds of mattresses. Very glad that I got this over the foam. It's extremely comfortable.", 
    "We purchased one mattress for our futon for our country get-away. We were using air mattresses when our kids and their spouses came. That was fine but such a pain to get out every night, clear the floor space, and put away every morning. Plus the kids tend to lay in bed all morning making it difficult to walk around our small place! We got a used futon frame and blindly ordered this mattress based on reviews. The kids love it! They say it is like sleeping in a regular bed. We recently invited friends down for the weekend. They said they slept better than in their own bed! Since then we got rid of the second couch and now have two futons, both with this mattress. We are VERY happy with this mattress! As a couch the mattress is fine. Comfortable. We bought a cover for each mattress so I can take them off to wash them. The covers say they are for a full size mattress, but they are huge!", 
    "I ordered this mattress for my son. Shipping was quick. The mattress was just as described. I did not notice any chemical smells. It is very comfortable. A great buy.", 
    "I am very pleased with my purchase! Would buy again if I ever need another mattress.", 
    "Shipping took a few days longer than stated, but not excessively so. Opened it up and it was the right size and color is perfect. It is very springy and comfortable for sitting and napping. The first weekend a couple slept on it and said it was very comfortable as did my mother in law. There is a slight dip showing where I tend to sit right in the middle after a month, but I'm a big guy and it's still very comfortable sitting and laying. Our last one started out okay and quickly settled to an uncomfortable mess so hopefully this one will hold up better.", 
    "I shopped around quite a bit before purchasing this futon mattress. It was important to me for it to be comfortable and supportive because my daughter, who had major neck surgery and still having pain, would be using it. Well, she has slept on it several times, and her exact words are \"I LOVE this new mattress, it is amazingly comfortable and feels like a real mattress because of the inner springs, etc.\" It did have a slight odor, as mentioned in other reviews, but that disappeared after just a couple of days. Also, it is not 10 inches thick, rather, closer to 7.5-8 inches, but the comfort and support makes up for it so that does not detract from my positive review or excellent rating. And, it was NOT difficult to place on the futon frame - we put it on folded first, then pulled the frame out later to use as a bed and it folds back up into a couch with ease. I am so happy that I took my time to shop around and compare reviews etc. You can't go wrong with this product - excellent value, quality, comfort. And, I love Overstock for the cheap shipping & handling!!!", 
    "My fiance and I love this mattress, and so do our guests. It's comfortable and looks nice. It was a great buy.", 
    "We bought this mattress to fit on a pre-existing full-size metal futon frame. We were wary about whether it would fold up right, but needed a guest bed so we risked it. We found that the prices on Overstock for much higher rated products were competitive with other sites prices for inferior quality products, so we took another risk in ordering from a different site for the first time. As soon as this mattress was out of the box I was impressed. It is comfy, super comfy. Not as comfy as my bed, but for the price, holy cow, can't beat it. It so far has been a hit as the \"guest bed\" but it does not get nightly use, so I can't rate how it would hold up to frequent sleepers. I will never skimp on buying a futon mattress again. You seriously get what you pay for, and this time I'm actually satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "This is a slightly above average futon mattress. I was hoping it would be a little better quality, but I feel I received a good product for the money I spent. There are better futon mattresses but expect to pay much more than this. It is fiber filled with large springs through out. Comfortable to sit on, and easy to sleep on. It does have a strong odor. Not a chemical odor, more of a natural, recycled fiber smell. It's very slowly fading in an enclosed room. The thickness is not 10\". Would be a better mattress if it were. I did let it lay in bed form for 2 days before folding into the couch. The cover is the only fabric keeping the innards inside. You will need to purchase a separate cover. I'm not sure on the longevity of this mattress. (had it 1.5 weeks) I don't expect it to last more that 2-3 years with occasional sleeping and periodic sitting. A good price for a guest bed.", 
    "Great replacement mattress for our older futon. This model arrived timely and was exactly as described. The mattress reached the 10\" depth and is very comfortable. We also noticed the 'new' cotton smell noted by other reviews but it was not overpowering and we noted it lessened after a few days. No one is going to be sleeping on the new mattress anytime soon so we figure the smell will completely dissipate with time. Great replacement mattress for the $$.", 
    "it is very comfy and looks just like the picture. as seating or sleeping on it , it is compfortable.", 
    "I researched for this new futon mattress, reading reviews, testing out ones in stores but find this one to be perfect, at an excellent price.", 
    "Love the mattress. has a weird factory or new smell but after i aired it out, it went away. the fabric is great. it sleeps comfortably.", 
    "I've had several futon mattresses in the past and this one is by far the most comfortable. the inner spring makes the difference and it is more like a bed mattress but it folds in the right place to become a sitting sofa. It arrived very quickly and was wrapped in plastic. After removing the plastic I had to keep it in a room to air out for a few days. This will be used as a guest bed in the future and I'm sure my guests will be glad I got rid of the old lumpy one!!", 
    "We received the mattress quickly, which was great and had a no shipping costs so we were very satisfied with that. We like the springs in the futon and find it very comfortable to sit on and sleep on an occasion. There is not one complaint we have about this futon. Great!", 
    "I was very pleased BUT thought the zipper was very cheep and have concern it might split and the padding will come out, but the nice cover willl solve that for now.The zipper is the ONLY ISSUE! Was very impressed how quickly the mattress was delivered and the shipping price BUT found out the reason was I ordered it on a Monday or Tuesday. It would take longer if you place your order Wed - Fri as I did with the cover! The cover took longer to arrive than the mattress and that was why! Other than that I would buy other items BUT would Recommend that you read as many Reviews as Possible!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "This is a great product .........................We love it and it is so comfortable for guests to sleep on.", 
    "Purchased this as a replacement futon mattress for my son's bedroom. Have had this product for about 2 months now, and it is very comfortable - much like a typical bed mattress. Did have a mild odor upon opening, but it faded quickly. Definitely a great price for the quality of item! Highly recommended!", 
    "Overall very pleased with my mattress. Site made it very easy for me to make a choice. I was unsure if I wanted to get a mattress with the springs or one without. The site was very clear on the difference between the two.", 
    "I like the futon. The delivery was faster than expected and Mr. Fed Ex walked it up to my second floor apartment. (kudos to him!) They failed to mention that the cover is removable, which is awesome because I have a large black dog and that's why I got burgundy in the first place. I can't wait for my first nap! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the smell, which I hope/assume will go away after airing out. (it arrived smooshed in plastic)", 
    "This turned out to be a great purchase. I was worried about the quality but we took a chance and it has been well worth the money.", 
    "This mattress is nice and firm, and keeps it's shape so it looks much nicer than my old foam one. It's also very comfy!", 
    "I bought this for my sons room, it was a replacement mattress for his futon. It is very well made and very comfortable. We love it and recommend this mattress.", 
    "The futon is not so great as a couch -- doesn't hold a fold well at all. Is fabulous to sleep on, tho. Very comfortable", 
    "I ordered this futon mattress after having shopped locally and online at IKEA, in a local bedding shop, and online at amazon and a few other online futon stores. This seemed like the best value. We didn't want to spend much (less than $200), and I think this mattress is very good for the price. The reviews told us what to expect. It did ship super fast, there was an odd smell which seemed hempish to me (but the smell dissipated in a week, and wasn't offensive to me), the color was a little purplish, and you can tell that it has springs. Oh, probably b/c of the springs, it does ride up a little high. But we've had one person sleep on it so far - and he said it is very comfortable (and he's picky). It is very comfortable to sit on (it is now our dog's preferred sleeping spot during the day). And it looks nice. We've had it for 3 weeks or so, and i just noticed a slightly discolored spot (kind of bleachy). But many people have sat on it and it has been slept on, so we could be responsible for it - and it's not very noticeable, anyway. I would highly recommend this mattress.", 
    "This mattress is very comfortable. I had read other review I knew it was probably going to be thinner and promised, but it is so comfortable I slept on it instead of my regular bed when my back was bothering me.", 
    "This is described as a 10-inch mattress but it is at most 7-8 inches. It is still very comfortable. We purchased this for a futon frame we bought at a thrift store to use as a 2nd bed in our camper. The first users were my parents who didn't complain about it being uncomfortable. I purchased a separate cover to go on it that could be washed. The cover that comes on it has a zipper, but the filling is loose inside so I'm not sure what the purpose is of it coming with a zippered cover.", 
    "I was pleased with thee quality and comfort of the mattress .I would recommend it to anyone who needs to replace a worn out mattress", 
    "The mattress arrived SO fast & was very well wrapped but it was not difficult to unwrap. There is was NO offensive smell when we unwrapped the futon, in fact it was a nice scent, like another reviewer mentioned, more like a natural scent, like hemp. The mattress fluffed up nicely (& quickly) to the predicted 9-10\". The springs in the futon mattress make it feel like a real bed. It is VERY comfortable!!! Our guests were pleased with it. The cover is a great blue color & is even nice in person. Overall, we are VERY satisfied. We got a great mattress for a great price with next to nothing shipping costs.Who could ask for more???", 
    "I am regretting buying from OS. The mattress is poor quality all around. It smells like chemicals and the foam cover is paper thin. I am very disappointed with this purchase.", 
    "The mattress is not super high quality, you can hear the springs moving when you sit or move around on the mattress, though they don't poke through. It is comfortable enough, but I wouldn't use it as a primary bed. With sheets it is more that sufficient for an overnight guest. It fits the double futon frame nicely and our other cover. We mostly use it as a couch in an auxillary TV room. You can't feel the futon frame through the pad, but again, it's not a high quality mattress. It's a good value for the cost. It shipped quickly and in excellent condition. Airing it out has been a bit of a pain, but it is with most futon mattresses, so it is to be expected.", 
    "I would not reccommend this product. But you get what you pay for. Uncomfortable to sleep on and the threading has already starting to loosen after two weeks of purchase. All you feel are springs no support of cushion. I purchased this for my seven year old so she doesn't notice it. I would not recommend this purchase for an adult or post teen adult.", 
    "Was left with two futons without mattress and decided to get mattresses instead of buying sofa sleepers. Because the mattresses have springs in them they are extremely comfortable and durable. Couldn't be more happier.", 
    "We have used this every night for several weeks now- and have completely abondoned using our couch for naps. We are very fussyabout comfort and have found this to be great. I was nervouse about it being smelly since another review had mentioned that- however it just smelled like pleasantly fresh cotton or hemp, and the smell only lasted about a week. I think the quality of the cover and the mattress itself is excellent and it also looks nice.", 
    "I ordered this mattress for my Grandson's futon, since the mattress that came with it was not very thick and very uncomfortable. He is extremely happy with this one.", 
    "Please don't spend this amount of money on this futon mattress, this is not the accurate size for what I paid for. I paid for a 10inch not a 8in and that's barely an 8inch. I'm unsatisfied but I kept it. It will cost me more if I return it back.", 
    "This futon mattress is much like a bed mattress. We were looking to have a futon that acted as a guest bed and this works perfectly.", 
    "When others first saw the mattress, they asked if there was a cover on it. This is due to the fact I chose the navy blue color to prevent stains from showing. When they sat on it, they were surprised there were springs for a futon mattress! Everyone mentioned how nice it was, which is great as I use the futon as a sofa replacement in the living room. At first, not so comfortable. With continuous flipping for a week, the center spring eventually evened out instead of being a hump/bump. It is very heavy, so in order to fold my futon frame back to seating position, I have to slide the mattress off, then slide it back on folding manually. Overall, don't regret my decision to get this especially for the price. I couldn't find anything of similar quality for less than on o.co.", 
    "This mattress is so comfortable! We haven't had it for very long, so I don't know how it will wear, but so far we love it. It is firm without being hard. It has just enough give to it to be comfortable without feeling like you're sinking in. It is definitely thick enough that you don't feel like you're sitting or sleeping on the futon frame.", 
    "A great mattress for the price -- it's nice and springy but not too firm. It also folds easily in the middle and as a tall guy, I was able to install it on the frame by myself without much difficulty. It does have an interesting grassy smell (?) which, after one week and a few rounds of Febreeze, has faded by about 70-80% and will hopefully be completely gone in a few more weeks. Importantly, though, it isn't really 10 inches thick... it's more like 8. Keep that in mind as you order futon covers. And the \"natural\" color is effectively pure white, which surprised me. I'm covering it so it doesn't matter, but it does show dirt very easily.", 
    "We ordered this for my son who has a futon frame that he plans to take to college with him. The mattress is comfy enough to sleep on and firm enough to act as a nice sofa. We're very pleased and expect it will last him all the way through college and beyond.", 
    "We purchased this for our cabin as a short term solution, but found it so comfortable that we are ordering another for the porch.", 
    "We love our new futon mattress. We got the full size, and it is definitely comfortable enough to sleep on. We have it on a full size futon. It is too thick to fold double for a seat cushion, so we hang 1/3 of it over the back. I expect it to last a very long time.", 
    "Great mattress. Fits perfectly and is very comfortable. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice futon mattress.", 
    "I received this mattress in less than 5 days and anybody that sits on it says its very comfy!!! My older daughter slept on it and said it was great!!", 
    "Very satisfied! Was bought for my son's room..my 14 yr old son, who's 5'10, sleeps on it every night..he says very comfortable! Would recommend it! By the way some said there was a smell, we didn't notice it @ all. Great purchase & price.!", 
    "The futon mattress is very comfortable and arrived in about 2 days. I am using it as an extra bed when the grandchildren spend the night and am very pleased with my purchase!", 
    "This futon arrived quickly, was as described and is comfortable. I would recommend it if your preference is for a medium-firm mattress/futon.", 
    "I bought the futon matress to use for guests to sleep on. I have not tried it as a couch cusion yet. It is comfortable, and the price was cheaper than the matress stores. It shipped in two days!", 
    "Ordered this on Wed got it on Fri. Not 10 inches, but hey for 169.99 what do you exp[ect, works great for me, I use this as my primary bed and if it lasts a year and I have to buy another one it will be well worth it to me", 
    "This futon mattress is what I was looking for. I'm using it as a bed for now until I get my own apartment, and it's comfier than the twin bed i was sleeping on before (and bigger, which is good for little dogs who hog the bed). I liked that it has springs, as opposed to just a foam or cotton stuffed futon, because when i was younger, i had a cotton one that got to be so old, i felt the bars on the frame. So I decided to go with the spring futon, which i do not regret. Being a rare online shopper, i was expecting it to be something I'd end up sending back... but after reading the other reviews, I was aware of what to expect. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's advertised as 10 inches, but after letting it sit for a few days and sleeping on it 2 nights after that, it's only about 6-7 inches. But other than that, if it's what you're looking for, I'd say it's worth it.", 
    "Received our futon mattress in plenty of time .Couldn't beat the $2.95 shipping. There was a faint smell when we first opened but went away with a little Fabreeze and about a week later. My daughter uses the futon all the time. Red reviews before purchasing and with that we feel we got exactly what we paid for a great deal on a great mattress.", 
    "I purchased this mattress to replace existing mattress and had great expectations with the excellent reviews I read sorry I made purchase as it is not as described, has chemical odor and does not expand to 10 inches more like 6 quality is ok but I feel for the money it was a disappointment the return shipping costs are about $** which makes it negative to return it is for my grandson and he is ok with it but I would not recommend it with a good review", 
    "I purchased 2 of the hunter green, they came in 9 days. Very comfortable, to sit and sleep on. Shopped around before I settled on Overstock.com. They had the cheapest price! Good quality!!", 
    "My teenage daughter said, \"I'm so comfy I can't stand it.\" Very high quality...great deal...LOVE it!!", 
    "I ordered this mattress for my son's new futon bunk bed. I was pleasantly surprised upon the arrival of the mattress. It arrived within a week of ordering and the quality was outstanding. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who is in the market for a sharp looking, comfy futon mattress.", 
    "I was very pleased with my first time purchase here at overstock.com. The matress arrived in a timely manner and it fit my futon frame perfectly. I live in a studio apartment, so my futon is my bed and I've had this matress for almost a month now, been sleeping on it every night and is so comfortable! very firm, which is my personal preference. I also loved the color, I bought the burgundy and it gives my studio a very stylish look. Yes there is a smell that comes with the matress which might be a little too strong at first and that is why i didn't give it 5 stars but after almost a month, the smell is almost gone. I do recommend this matress!", 
    "Bought this to replace a 4\" mattress that was all cotton (no spring) that our cats had peed on. (Also bought a waterproof mattress cover!) It's extremely comfortable to sleep on, even for a plus-size gal like me. Our futon doesn't have a \"lip\" on one end to hold the mattress in when it's folded like a couch, though, so it doesn't quite like to stay folded. We've been leaving it flat for now and will eventually invest in a nylon tie-down to run the length of it and get tucked into the crevice of the fold. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars right now is because I've only been sleeping on it for about two weeks. I am curious to see how long the springs hold out under my weight.", 
    "We use a futon as an extra bed when all of our grown children are home and the house is full. This mattress is exactly what we were looking for. It is thick and comfortable (and heavy). You don't feel the futon frame/springs through the mattress when you lie down on it - and the kids report they slept great. We ordered the product just a few days before Christmas and it arrived on time - with no extra shipping fees. We are very pleased with the entire transaction.", 
    "I ordered this on the 11th at 2am and literally got it the next day on the 12th at 8AM with standard shipping, although i think im close to distribution center. Plus, the quality of the futon is worth it. For my first order on overstock.com i am 100% satisfied.", 
    "i ordered this futon and got it in two days!!! i could not be more impressed with the shipping and the mattress itself is extremly comfortable does make a slight sping noise like normal mattress would but very comfortable a little difficult to fold but over all a great product for the price with good shipping cost and time frame", 
    "My son was very pleased with this mattress. Shipped in a smaller box than expected, but to our surprise, it doubled in size very quickly. Very comfortable, great price!", 
    "I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. It is a very good deal for a futon mattress considering a comparable model would cost $300-$400 at a local mattress store. The Splendor mattress is comfortable and has given me a better night's rest when I fall asleep on it! I'd recommend it to anyone interested in a new futon mattress.", 
    "I really wasn't expecting this mattress to be high quality because of the price, but it's more than just a plain futon mattress. It's comfortable enough to sleep on and prefer it to my own bed. The order was a little messed up in terms of delivery time and location of my item was unknown, but Overstock was very helpful in making it right. They cancelled the original order, made a new one, and changed the delivery from standard to 2 day FedEx. When I first unpacked it, it smelled like grass/hay/straw but dissipated after a few days. It's not made with those materials, btw. ;) I recommend opening up your futon and just let the mattress's springs uncoil for a couple days and to air out. I love it. And no tax, free shipping, and assorted colors available. You will like it.", 
    "This was a gift for my son. It is well made and the color is true. Comfortable to sit on. He is enjoying it but hasn't slept on it yet. I will be sleeping on it for the Christmas holidays and he says it is better than the guest bed.", 
    "There are not enough words to express how comfortable it is , I just love it and the price and delivery were great. I would 100 percent recommend it to anybody", 
    "This is the first time I have ordered a futon mattress on line, it came pretty fast, was well wrapped, the comfort level is far superior to what we had before, all in all we are pretty happy", 
    "Mattress was as described, color was as shown. My son says it's very comfortable both as a futon and as a mattress. My only complaint was it had kind of a funky smell when it was opened but after dousing it with fabreze a couple of times that seems to have dissipated. We've only had it for a couple of weeks so I can't say how well it will hold up, but so far, so good. Overall, I'm satisfied.....", 
    "I was very impressed with Overstock.com and how quickly the futon mattress was delivered for an economical flat shipping fee. I am happy with the mattress, it's condition, and the color selection. I haven't had an opportunity to sleep on the mattress yet, but it's quite comfortable to sit on and it looks GREAT! My husband and I would both recommend this mattress and Overstock.com.", 
    "I was very pleased with the futon mattress that I odered. I beat the price I found in a local retail store by more than $100. It came quickly, packaged nicely and is a great mattress.", 
    "very comfortable, and so nice looking it does not need a cover.", 
    "Was skeptical when the rolled up mattress arrived. . .but it works great for what we are using it for in a lightly used guest room application. Looks and feels like a good quality item. Haven't had it for a long time to see how it holds up though.", 
    "My husband and I purchased both a futon mattress and the cover from Overstock and had great luck with both--shipping was very timely and both products were true to specs. Futon cover is very nicely made and fit on our mattress perfectly.", 
    "I ordered this 10\" futon figuring it would end up being 8\". I was right. This is a very comfortable mattress. It folds well and is very durable. The smell is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.", 
    "Arrived promptly and well packaged. It initially had a \"new\" smell but has completely gone away. I use the futon as a day bed and have no trouble taking a nap on it. I can not feel the support bars at all! Do not know how this will perform as a nightly bed, but would've loved to have this in college instead of the mattress on the floor!", 
    "This mattress feels like a standard futon spring mattress, and for the price, is a good value. On the other hand, if I wasn't buying it for an adult rather than a 5 year old, I don't think it wouldn't work for long with regular use. The springs aren't completely obvious. Oh, we've only had it for a few weeks and its only been slept on a few times, so take that into consideration. Overall, it is a good mattress for the price though, but if you weigh more than child, I wouldn't count on it for long.", 
    "I bought this mattress as my regular everynight bed, and have been sleeping on it a bit over a month. So far, it is great! I have a very bad right shoulder, and I don't seem to have to roll as much as on the lesser quality spring mattress I was on just before buying this. Nicely made. nice fabric, and I don't feel the springs really or the bars of the futon. I'm happy!", 
    "if you have never ordered a futon before please read this review...i had never ordered a futon before so i had no idea that if i ordered this one that the frame would not come with it - especially since it is in the photo. i received it and the mattress itself was fine but i had nothing to put it on. i called to say the frame didn't come with it and was told \"well the ad says futon mattress not frame\". they would take it back only if i could put the huge mattress in a box myself and i literally went to every shipping moving company to find one and there were no boxes made that size. i almost wasn't able to send it back and at the last second walked into a UPS store and looked to see that a box was there being delivered to customer for pick up who let me have the empty box. i ended up buying a futon with a mattress from ******** and it was the easiest thing to put together and perfect to sleep on and it only cost a total of $$$. bottom line. it is deceiving to me that an ad for a mattress only has the frame photographed in the ad. don't fall for that like i did because it is a tremendous amount of trouble to ship it back.", 
    "I would not have bought this futon if I had noticed the line int he middle of the description about the springs! I choose futons because of their firmness- if I wanted a mattress-feel I buy a mattress! Not bad otherwise- was delivered very quickly!"
