    "We needed storage in a newly renovated bathroom. This cabinet fits perfectly. We found it to be well made and exactly as described. Also, it arrived within 4 or 5 days.", 
    "This cabinet came quickly, and was everything we expected from the description and the photo. It went together well, using a hand screwdriver, not a power tool. This cabinet looks nice in our master bath. It will not get heavy use, sturdy enough for our needs. It is a nice white color, matching our ceiling and trim.", 
    "Good quality piece for the price. Looks really nice and I like the hardware it came with. The only thing I was disappointed with was the measurements. It said the depth was 14 inches. The top is 14 inches, but the actual cabinet is only about 13 inches. I bought it to use as a shoe cabinet so my husbands shoes did not fit in it like I thought. Overall though good piece of furniture.", 
    "Very easy to assemble, We bought two of them and assembled both in less than 30 minutes. These were used without the feet and installed them in a laundry area re-model. They are slightly deeper (14\") than regular sized stock cabinets which solved a huge issue for storage. Now I have lots of room for everything, The shelves can flex a bit, they can't handle anything too heavy. They cabinets are lightweight which was a concern since these are installed on top of front load washer and dryer. The style gives them a look of real expensive custom cabinets. We have recommended these to friends who have seen our remodel and are impressed with the cabinets which are now the show pieces of the laundry area. These have transformed the space into a show place!", 
    "I have purchased many items that required \"some assembly\". I have to say this is the easiest product I've ever assembled. It went together just as it was supposed to and all of the pieces and hardware were clearly marked. It seems very sturdy. My daughter received it as a Christmas gift to use in her bathroom as storage and she loves it!", 
    "I am a not-handy-at-all woman and was apprehensive I would not be able to assemble this without assistance. That proved not to be the case at all. I was able to construct it in about an hour's time. The written directions are worthless, but the diagrams very clearly show exactly what is to be done in each step. Excellent buy for the money. Looks good and is sturdy enough for intended purpose of storage in the bathroom. Also, I was very surprised how quickly this arrived. This was my first experience with overstock.com, and it was positive both in terms of quality of product and customer service.", 
    "This cabinet works great for what I wanted. It looks pretty and provides some extra storage. Easy to assemble, had a couple of holes that did not line up, but not an issue.", 
    "I like this cabinet a lot. It looks very pretty and it is very well crafted. Overstock delivers this product very quickly, and offers excellent price. I totally recommend this cabinet.", 
    "I love this cabinet, it looks so nice in my bathroom along with the other cabinet I ordered from overstock,shipping was very fast and not a scratch on the cabinet, very nice indeed,,, Carolyn B. from Tennessee", 
    "After having had many miserable experiences buyingfurniture in a box and getting frustrated and irate putting it together,,,,,,THIS WAS A JOY! So it really is possible to make excellent instructionsand do a super job of labeling all parts!!! Who knew!I am very satisfied with this piece of furniture.", 
    "I love the style, design, peg legs. So easy to assemble, even for a women. Well packaged to protect from damage in shipping. The cabinet is the perfect size holds a lot of stuff in the bathroom. Assembly instructions need more description, assembly parts easy to use.", 
    "I was looking for storage cabinets for a newly remodeled bathroom and did not want just the basic cabinets. When I found these on Overstock and read the reviews I knew this was it. I also ordered the Yvette matching wall cabinet to go above this one. Received them both sooner than expected and only took my husband about 30 minutes to put them both together. Love them !", 
    "This was very easy to assemble. I guess I'm considered a senior citizen and still found it easy. It fits perfectly in our new bathroom, and looks great.", 
    "Bought it to enhance a patient's bathroom. They love it and have asked repeatedly where I got it from. Easy to assemble, very spacious and the finish is better than what you would expect of a modular piece of furniture. If it'd go with the d\u00e9cor, I'd buy it the matching wall cabinet!", 
    "Satisfied with chest and easy to assemble. Color & quality are good. Appears to be durable.", 
    "I bought this to go with the wall cabinet we selected for the newly remodeled bathroom. It is perfect!", 
    "I put it together without any help and it looks great!", 
    "I needed two cabinets for either side of my fireplace to store my book out of sight behind the closed doors for the neat appearance I desired in the room. I also wanted a place to display my animated Christmas decor. These fit the bill perfectly! They were shipped very quickly and only too us about a half hour to assemble. It was easy and the result looked like they were much more expensive than what we had paid. The quality appears quite high and they are sturdy pieces that did not use the usual wood glue to reinforce them. There was No smell- something I was concerned about before ordering and was a pleasant surprise! They look great and hold quite a bit for their size. The top also gives me substantial room for my Holiday decor. Could not be happier with the clean, crisp, and elegant appearance :)", 
    "Purchased this for a bathroom and it's great! Heavy enough not to get knocked over or accidentally pushed, and the material is good for a room that can get warm and humid (bathroom).", 
    "I didn't realize how difficult it was to find a nice, basic white floor cabinet. After two failed attempts (poor quality) I found this and LOVE it. It was simple to put together, sturdy, and the finish and molding looks very nice.", 
    "Very pretty cabinet, nice quality and fits good in the bathroom. Also purchased the matching wall cabinet and they look great together.", 
    "I got this cabinet to my daughter 'room to use it as storage for her shoes, It looks very nice, easy took about two hours to put it together with help from my 16 years old son, It came fast and sealed box and NO missing parts, I am very happy to organize most her shoes in.", 
    "Speedy delivery, well packaged, easy to assemble, great size and style, perfect for bathroom storage. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "The cabinet is attractive and would fit well in most decor's. The assembly took longer than I anticipated, but; the hardware was all included, along with instructions. I did use a little Carpenter's Glue during assembly to give additional strength to the overall cabinet (but; it wasn't called for).", 
    "I like this cabinet a lot. I purchased it for my bathroom. It was fairly easy to assemble and looks very nice. It probably wouldn't be the best piece for kids who are very rough on things, but works perfect for me. The color is perfect and it looks very rich. For the price you can't beat it. Very spacious inside. The front doors are pretty solid, some of the back pieces are not the most durable wood, but you don't need it to be. Overall, great item!", 
    "One of my better online purchases. And it was a hit with the recipient as a gift.", 
    "A 84 year old lady was very happy with this addition to her bath room. I did add a 3/4\" strip to the upper back so I could mount it to the wall for stability.", 
    "The cabinet looks very nice. I had only one problem, One of the legs would not screw in properly so I had to made adjustments and glue it on.", 
    "Came well packaged with little damage. Parts were numbered, instructions for assembly were EXCELLENT. Even the dowels, bolts, etc. came in little numbered packages to help you through the steps. Took at most 1 1/2 hrs to finish. Looks good and solid.", 
    "We needed storage for a bathroom and this fit the bill perfectly. Was a bit apprehensive when purchasing but it was easy to assemble - high quality materials and looks great.", 
    "I have this is my bathroom and absolutely love it. Not a heavy piece but seems to be made well. Very easy to put together.", 
    "This cabinet is exactly what I was looking for to use in my bathroom. My 11 year old granddaughter put it together in no time flat. I love it and it provides the little extra storage space is was needing.", 
    "great for stoppage I have a small kitchen with fee cupboard and this fit perfectly under my window. Easy to put together", 
    "Although it looks nice, I feel the quality is not what I expected. It isn't very sturdy.", 
    "Very nice. Not as deep as I wanted, but was as advertised.", 
    "Well made, easy to put together on my own, trim on doors adds beauty, perfect size! Great purchase.", 
    "some damage...but still like the product", 
    "I was concerned because I have put cabinets together before that never lined up well. This cabinet went together very well and looks great. I would recommend this cabinet to anyone wanting a nice, functioning cabinet without the huge price.", 
    "Very nice easy to put together", 
    "This was packed so carefully. It's heavy but really pretty!", 
    "Very nice, exactly as pictured", 
    "I love it. I use it in laundry room. Cute for girl's room or powder room.", 
    "Nice not hard to put together, but a small gap between doors.", 
    "Bought this for my elderly mother's apartment to store towels and other bathroom supplies. Looks great! Very well made and went together in about 15 minutes. Very happy with this item. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "We love this little cabinet and it fits perfectly in our bathroom. It was easily assembled and the design is efficient. Our problem is that the doors do not fit properly. Only until the last door was installed did we know. We decided to not return it as it would have been more of problem to disassemble. It is not in public view and used for storage in the water closet.", 
    "Pictures look nice but cabinet is poorly made. The one I received wasn't packed properly so in shipping the paint is worn off the top right corner of the cabinet top. For the price I paid I could have bought nicer one locally.", 
    "Easy to build but one of the doors came with a chip.", 
    "This is a great little cabinet for the money! Didn't need anything expensive or fancy for our basement bathroom but did want something that looked nice to store our cleaning supplies, etc.. Was very easy to assemble and was very well packaged! Just what we were looking for!", 
    "Overall it is a nice cabinet, however the door mounting hardware is not evenly aligned which makes the doors slightly uneven. I can live with it.", 
    "I'm not happy. Out of the box it had a crack on the front panel. :(", 
    "Very pleased with cabinet, quality is good, easy to assembled and was shipped in a very short period of time from placing order.", 
    "I needed a small cabinet to place my daughters medical supplies but I didn't want something that would look out of place. This little cabinet looks great in her bedroom and matches her white bedroom furniture. Looks like it belongs which we wanted.", 
    "Looks beautiful, easy assembly. Perfect", 
    "I love this bathroom storage piece. It's sturdy, pretty and was easy to assemble!", 
    "While this is not the perfect piece fro your high end or heavy use bathroom space, it is an attractive and appealing piece of furniture. It tok me about 45 minutes to put together and all the pieces fit well (no flaws or cracks). The \"wood\" is thin and probably won't withstand abuse or heavy usage, but for a simple place to store towels or toiletries, it's perfect. It wobbled a little (despite my meticulous approach to constructing it), but I corrected that with a piece of felt under the legs. A good product for the value, but be honest with yourself (you get what you pay for). I wouldn't use it for a main or fancy bathroom).", 
    "Fits perfect in our bathroom.", 
    "Beautiful, well made for the price. Works well in my bathroom.", 
    "Using as bedside tables for our elevated bed. Perfect pieces", 
    "easy to assemble, perfect if you want small cabinet.", 
    "...very messy packaging. Unpack outside or in the garage. Packaging releases tiny styrofoam balls that are now on my carpet, walls, clothing, chairs, etc. Easy to put together but 2 are better than one in installing the doors. The cabinet looks great. I like it even though it is still covered by the little styrofoam balls. The packaging is sheets of styrofoam that release the balls. Take precautions. It does vacuum up but save yourself the trouble.", 
    "This cabinet was built to last. Good construction and love the fact that the doors close tightly.", 
    "I needed extra storage in one of the bathrooms. This has worked perfectly. It fits nicely, holds towels, etc. plus overflow from built-in cabinet. It seems to be well built. We looked and looked for the right cabinet and finally found this.", 
    "I had a space where I wanted a cabinet. I measured it and looked for something that size. This fit the bill. It was easy to put together. I swapped out the silver tone knobs for gold tone. Couldn't be happier.", 
    "I have been searching for a small cabinet for a a small bathroom for quite awhile. When I saw this I took a chance and ordered it. It is just perfect. It is great quality and went together very easy. Looks beautiful and have had several compliments on it.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for my towels in the bathroom. I am an older woman and never really had to put things together by myself but I tackled this and did a good job. I love the cabinet and it works well for what I wanted it for. I have to fold my towels a little different to get them all in but I still really like it.", 
    "This cabinet is well-made and looks great for the price. I rated it 4 stars only because the doors have a small gap between them when they are closed. Assembly was easy. It really is an attractive cabinet, too. I'm using it in my husband's office restroom for extra storage (toilet paper, cleaning supplies, etc.). I was looking specifically for a cabinet without glass panels in the doors, as I didn't want the items inside exposed. Bathroom floor cabinets without glass in them are more difficult to find than you may think! Overall, I'm very pleased with this item.", 
    "This cabinet was the perfect size for the area I needed. and it was easy to put together.", 
    "This was fairly easy to put together. Directions were easy to follow. The construction seems pretty solid. I am very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "Very pretty. Nice finish. Very pleased with purchase..", 
    "I purchased this three years ago, and it still looks great. Use it in a bathroom for towel storage, it has not been affected at all by damp conditions. Very sturdy, I love it.", 
    "After researching a number of sites, I narrowed my search to Overstock. I ended up purchasing two of these Yvette 2 Door Floor Cabinets and the smaller wall mounted version. I am not a handy person but was able to put these three cabinets together very easily. I stacked the two 2 door units (just didn't screw the legs on one unit). All three are in our master bath and look terrific. We have gotten quite a few compliments on them. They are not the most expensive bathroom cabinets available at Overstock, but for us they are the most beautiful and attractive.", 
    "It looks so beautiful. plenty of room for my towels.", 
    "This cabinet is made well and holds a lot! I used it for all my towels & wash cloths with room to spare.", 
    "Looks more expensive than cost and easy to assemble.", 
    "when i tried putting this together i had to give up on it because the directions are not exactly clear as to front and back on the base...had to take an educated guess...now my brother in law is putting it together now and there are small splits in the sides on side is on the back and the other side is on the front...it is not worth the hassle of returning it because the box is long gone and it is too heavy for the hassle of returning it... i just hope it holds up. *fingers crossed* one person can put it together but 2 ppl are better.", 
    "This went together surprisingly quick! It's cute and sturdy. Good value.", 
    "perfect for all cleaning products", 
    "This cabinet was just what I was looking for and needed it was easy to put together and looks fantasticvery happy", 
    "RECEIVED SOONER THAN PROMISED. APPEARANCE/QUALITY. LOOKS GREAT. WOULD BUY AGAIN.", 
    "This cabinet was just what I was looking for. It is a great addition to my bedroom. Love the detail on the doors. It was easy to put together. It's not a high end type of cabinet but for the price it's very very nice.", 
    "It was indeed easy to assemble. The only thing I had even a teensy bit of question about was the directionality of the doors. It went together quickly and seems sturdy. Nice size and adds great, usable shelf space to the bathroom.", 
    "Easy to assemble, looks wonderful. One would think it costs much more.", 
    "Nice cabinet for MDF. Would love to find a match in solid wood but price would be nuts. I bought 2 for side by side to make a pretty french country wall area in a bedroom. They match nicely, Doors set ok. Cabinet is roomy for it's size. Top is nicely finished. Pretty feet that can be removed. I considered stacking them as a larger cabinet (tall vs. wide), but liked the front details enough to just use them to snug a wall with a flat bureau top. Overall, happy with the price/quality knowing that I was not purchasing a carpenter's treasure. It will do the job.We put 2 together in under an hour.", 
    "Well made, perfect size to hold my bathroom towels and necessities and fits perfectly under the window.", 
    "This is just what I wanted. Very attractive and easy to put together. Looks like it is a more expensive piece of furniture. I am very happy with it. Delivery was fast.", 
    "This cabinet is exactly what I need for my bathroom.. It was easy to put together and I am happy with the quality of construction as well as the finish. it has given me much needed storage. The ad gave the measurements which were accurate so the cabinet is a perfect fit for the space.", 
    "I needed a linen cupboard for my bathroom and had limited space. This fit the bill perfectly. It was easy to assemble and it's so pretty. I love it!", 
    "very please with product and time to ship it plan on buying more products", 
    "This product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It was exactly what I wanted for our guest bathroom. The cabinet is easy to assemble and looks great. I especially like the feet on the cabinet and flower detail on doors. It's a wonderful value for the price and is exactly as described.", 
    "I'm very pleased with this cabinet, it is a very useful size for a small room.", 
    "This is a pretty cabinet, looks great in my bathroom. Be advised that the shelves are only about a quarter inch thick so if you're looking for something to hold heavy items be careful. I am using mine for hair products and the shelves bow slightly. It would be great for towels, sheets or other light items though.", 
    "Perfect style and size for my bathroom. Is not bulky and has a classic style. Easy to assemble. I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "This was a gift for daughter. She assembled it and said it was east to do. It is a good fit for her needs. She is satisfied with the cabinet. Would recommend to a friend to buy.", 
    "I bought the matching wall cabinet with this one and set it on top of this cabinet for linen and bath accesability. It is exactly what I thought it would be. I am very pleased.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet to house my very large costume jewelry collection. I purchased about 50 or so rectangular, low lying, clear art bin containers to store my jewelry and needed a cabinet to house it all. This is a very light weight cabinet, I'm not sure what it is really meant to hold, but I don't think it is gong to last very long with what I am using it for. The shelves aren't very thick and they are starting to cave in. Also, the doors don't hang straight and one of the legs was breaking the first day I got it, so it is wobbly. Unfortunately, none of these poor qualities were truly evident until my husband had completely assembled the cabinet for me, otherwise I would have returned it. It's still holding up for now (I've had it for about 4 months) but it will not last as long as I'd planned it to when I purchased it. For the price I expected something much better than this and I'm quite disappointed.", 
    "This looks like a nice piece, but not worth the $ or time it took to build it. Not solid; will be lucky it it makes it through a few guests, as purchased for a guest room."
