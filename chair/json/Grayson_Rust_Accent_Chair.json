    "These chairs are: deep and wide (as in seats), sturdy, made from a good material, and exactly what I wanted. I saw these at a store, so I already knew what I was ordering - I ordered them from Overstock because, even though the price was 10 bucks more per chair, the delivery was free, and it ended up costing me 60-80 bucks less, total. The chair looks orange but woven into the fabric are other colours: red, blue, yellow, etc. The material is textured. Putting the legs onto the bottom was a cinch - about 5 minutes per chair, all tools are provided, though I'd still recommend using a power drill. Four stars because there is some unevenness when it comes up the padding on the back rest - it just looked a little dented in, though definitely not too much, and I am keeping them.", 
    "The chair is perfect for our location. It is small, but taller than most small chairs so comfortable in height. The color works well in our house; it's neutral enough to go with most settings but gives a light orange/coral look. The only negative - the cushion is hard. It works for us, but be aware that it is not the most comfortable cushion. We really like it, but some might find it too hard.", 
    "This was an addition to my living room to add a hint of color. I love this fabric since it seems durable and it has a nice color array..... I have to say I would not call this a \"comfy\" afternoon type chair, but this looks fantastic as an additional chair and a great accent piece.", 
    "Nice 'accent' chair. Nice design. Nice color. Feels sturdy. Definitely not a lounging chair. Brought a nice touch of color to my living room where most of my furniture is brown. For 1/3rd of the price of a C&B or R&B accent chair, this is a great buy.", 
    "Very pleased with this chair. Good chair for the money. Not for comfort, more of for looks which was what i needed it for.", 
    "Vibrant colors. Firm comfortable chair. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Perfect size for a small area. The muted colors blend with almost any solid. They are comfortable as well.", 
    "good color mix, will go with a lot - a rust, a sage green, a brown, or a cream.", 
    "Love it. So bought a second one", 
    "It's my favorite chair. Very comfortable, and I adore the color", 
    "We ordered this chair for bedroom. Fits in corner nicely and feel comfortable. The color of the chair can go along with any kind of furniture.", 
    "Overall I like the chair but the fabric at the back of the seat almost immediately puckered. Will not lay flat."
