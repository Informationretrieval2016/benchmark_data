    "I absolutely love the shape of this headboard. The fabric is a thick weave linen with a few flaws or nubs?. BUT, it is not grey......it is what some would call greige....a combination of grey and beige. All the greys in my room are of the silver grey family and this is not a silver grey. The nail heads are shiny silver....they are not all spaced equal distance from one another. I'm considering if I can pull some of them out and re-align, but not sure if that's a good idea. I'm strongly considering returning it, just because of the color. Otherwise, I could live with the small imperfections. It only took me 5 min. to attach the legs to the headboard.....it's 4 bolts w/large washers and 2 metal legs....very easy. I haven't attached to my bed frame yet, because I discovered that my queen mattress has been sitting on top of a full size bed frame that I had no clue about (hubby set it up yrs ago) so I'm going to have to get a queen bed frame before attaching the headboard. Please consider the height of your shams and pillows, because my euro shams cover up most of the headboard, so I'm hoping (if I keep it) after it's attached to bed frame it will raise the height of the headboard so the beautiful shape can be seen more. It was very quick shipping...I received in 1 week, from Canada to Texas. This is my 1st purchase from Overstock.com and I will probably shop with them again.", 
    "The photos don't do this piece any justice! I bought this for a guest room... Everyone that sees it loves it! And what a bargain! My only frustration was assembly... But it was all worth it once we finally got it together. Just an FYI.. This is just a headboard that attaches to a metal frame. You will need a bed skirt and the mattress may move around a bit.", 
    "Not a super heavy/solid headboard but I'm happy with it because it was a good price.", 
    "took a while to put together with 2 people to attach it.Not as high as I had hoped but adds a nice accent.", 
    "I was in every store and on EVERY website and so glad I got this one! Looks great and priced right! That's a winner all day in my book\u263a\ufe0f Lots of compliments and looks just like pictured", 
    "Very well made, nice true gray, not a light color. I just put it against the wall instead of attaching to the bed frame, and pushed the bed against it. I like it!", 
    "Love this headboard!! I have an extra tall bed ( with the help of risers) and the adjustability on this headboard makes it sit at the perfect height for my bed. Everyone who has seen it asks me where i got it!", 
    "Solid, sturdy, pretty headboard. The shape is gorgeous. The color was a little different and perhaps darker than I had imagined. Texture is very nice. I put it together myself. It took me about 5 minutes to assemble it and around half an hour to figure out what went wrong. The instructions left something to be desired. The headboard did not align initially with my queen bed frame. I had to reverse the legs (legs were not exactly the same) and then switch some of the bolts around. There were long bolts and shorter bolts. I was puzzled and disappointed at first why the attachment was so loose. Then I figured out that the instructions did not explain clearly different lengths of bolts. In the end, I corrected the mistakes. The headboard now fits and is sturdier, but it was a struggle.", 
    "Headboard arrived safely and was easy to install as well. Love it and recommend it highly to everyone.", 
    "Love love love. easy to install and beautiful. great quality", 
    "Everything I expected for that deal. Easy to put together. Looks very nice! Was delivered in time in a handy package. Would always buy it again...", 
    "Good quality, great price. Makes the room come alive. Highly recommend it.", 
    "It arrived quickly and was super easy to put together and install onto metal bed frame. I absolutely love it! It really makes our bedroom set feel complete! Elegant and sophisticated!", 
    "It's very well made - especially for the price! The gray is really pretty- not too masculine nor too feminine. It's in my daughters bedroom and really pops. I was also a bit nervous about re: the nail heads ( f they were going to be well done/ neat and orderly) and they are spot on. Really nice piece- and super easy to put together and attach to a standard bed frame.", 
    "I looked for several weeks for an affordable headboard for our guest bedroom. The grey is a little darker than I wanted, but works well with the other colors in the room."
