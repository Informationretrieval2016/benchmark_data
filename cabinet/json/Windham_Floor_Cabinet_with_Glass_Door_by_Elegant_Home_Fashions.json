    "This cabinet is beautiful, but beware! It is VERY dark. It looks black unless in direct sunlight and then it is a deep beautiful reddish brown. I bought two pieces in this series, and they are both of very high quality. Better than Ikea's quality. Unlike what is frequently the case with Ikea products, the assembly was smooth and easy: all the hardware was included, all the holes lined up perfectly as they should've, none of pieces were missing or damaged or poorly made-- I didn't have to fight with it at all to assemble it flawlessly. Both cabinets look very rich and elegant.", 
    "I was looking for a bathroom cabinet to fit in a small space. The dimensions of this one were perfect. The packing was great, so nothing came damaged. All parts were clearly marked and the instructions very easy to follow. I couldn't be happier and would recommend this product to anyone looking for a small, sturdy, nice looking cabinet.", 
    "so easy to put together and though it is a bathroom cabinet, it is being used as a nightstand. perfect for small spaces and looks expensive.", 
    "easy to assemble but a bit smaller than I expected.Will still work in one of the bathrooms, though.", 
    "I ordered this for that little extra storage close to the toilet for things like toilet paper, etc. It matched my new vanities perfectly, however there were some scratch marks on it. I used some of that wood marker to cover the scratches and it's not as noticeable. It is somewhat shorter than I was expecting but it works ok. I really like the frosted doors so you can't really see what's inside.", 
    "This little guy is a great value. I couldn't find anything locally to store all of my bathroom stuff in in my office. This one stores about 8 rolls of toilet paper plus cleaners and other miscellaneous items. Easy assembly, sturdy, looks good and has adjustable shelves.", 
    "Went together in a snap nice compact unit with a larger than it looks storage. Very pleased!", 
    "The quality is great; It is sturdy, not at all flimsy or cheaply made. I assembled it myself with no problems.", 
    "Functional and very nice looking. Did not install extra shelf for taller storage.", 
    "My husband put the cabinet up pretty quickly with no issues and I have to admit this cabinet is heavy duty and it really brings out the classy look in my bathroom.", 
    "Purchased this to hold towels and such in my bath.... Easy to assemble and looks great!", 
    "Although this item isn't the highest of quality, it's not bad for the price. It was a bit difficult to build in that some of the holes were not big enough so we had to drill the holes to make them larger. It arrives with a few little chips which makes me believe I'll have to be pretty gentle with this piece. However, the finished product looks nice and the color nice a deep. It will work just fine on my bathroom.", 
    "Went together easily and is as described but all pieces don't fit tightly and so there are gaps", 
    "This is a great little cabinet and perfect for what we needed. Easy to put together. It is very dark in color and almost looks black but that is what I wanted!", 
    "looks great price was right", 
    "This piece looks as it is displayed, but the top was scratched during the unpacking process. The front veneer pulled off when we moved it. Yes, we did the damage, but it is not very durable with light handling. We will repair it and use it as it was not very expensive.", 
    "Easy to assemble, Looks good.", 
    "Sturdy and utilitarian. Good quality.", 
    "Not a bad little cabinet. It was easy to assemble. It seems to be pretty solid so far. The fit and finish is lacking some, revealing gaps around the door and joints. But for this kind of money, you can't expect much more.", 
    "This cabinet works perfectly in my newly remodeled bathroom. It was easy to assemble and its a sturdy piece. I'm very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Nice looking cabinet. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Nice easy to put together.", 
    "Excellent design. I was looking for storage in my bathroom and this works perfectly.", 
    "easy to assemble and very sturdy.", 
    "Easy to put together, great item", 
    "this was the right size for the space that i needed. I could have gone for the bigger one but I am still happy with this one.", 
    "Bought this extra small storage cabinet for our bathroom. The glass is very nice and it was easy to put together. Overall, a perfect match & fit!", 
    "Fits nicely in our living room though it was a bit smaller than I envisioned. It went together easily and is sturdy and stylish.", 
    "Nice little cabinet. Although one review disparaged the flimsy back, I have found almost all of the less expensive furniture have these types of backs including also some of the pricey ones. Mostly in the ones that require assembly.It was fairly easy to put together by myself. Instructions were adequate and easy to follow. It only took me time due to my physical disabilities.I ended up with a slightly crooked door, but I can live with that. It still opens and closes fine. It was what I needed, an inexpensive under counter cabinet for the kitchen since I live in a ADA apartment and there is little storage space low enough for me to reach.", 
    "I ordered this piece because of the clean lines and my vision for its use in a guest bath. After assembling it myself, I was pleased in the way it made my bathroom look.", 
    "strong and well built, looks great", 
    "Easy to assemble and good quality. Fits perfectly in my bathroom. Excellent purchase.", 
    "Fits wonderfully, easy to assemble", 
    "I've had this floor cabinet for 6 months now used in my powder restroom. I absolutely love its functionality. I can store 6 rolls of toilet tissue on the top shelf, and my cleaning supplies on the bottom. The wood is a deep brown color and surprisingly good heavy quality for the price. I would recommend this piece to someone looking for extra storage with a touch of decorative style. Im happy with this purchase!", 
    "for a small space. Easy to assemble and sturdy.", 
    "Really beautiful cabinet. Excellent quality and very well made.", 
    "This cabinet is for small spaces. I bought two for bathroom storage and they look great. Good quality.", 
    "Love this little cabinet. I wanted a small cabinet for my small bathroom and this was it. It was super easy to put together.", 
    "This is a much more solid piece that I expected. I'm pleased! Thank you, Overstock!", 
    "Good quality materials.Easy to put it together following the very simple and clear instruction sheet.", 
    "I purchased this for a small storage area for my dogs treats and can food and it works great. No one even knows that this cupboard it used for that. Nice piece of furniture.", 
    "Has a nice finish and looks good. Although there are three windows and two slats between them there is only one shelf inside. Doesn't fit together as tightly as I would have liked either.", 
    "Our small bathroom needed extra storage and yhis fit perfectly in a corner.", 
    "Great cabinet and easy to put together. Just wish it was an inch wider. But works well for what I need it for.", 
    "nice little cabinet for our new bathroom. Holds just enough...Good quality.", 
    "It took a while to get all the parts together, but once it's done, it ended up to be a beautiful addition to my remodeled bathroom, where I only had a small space to fill. 13in by 13 in. This fit perfect. Good quality.", 
    "This little cabinet is easy to assemble, but be aware that the instructions are in pictures. Everything in numbered, though. You will need screw drivers. When it's done, it is sturdy and has good weight. I wouldn't mind getting another one for another room.", 
    "Was perfect for my salon bathroom. Very well made", 
    "This cabinet works great in my small powder room. It was easy to put together and looks more expensive then it is. I am very happy both with overstocks and the cabinet.", 
    "Bought this for my son he has a small bathroom , but this fits great and he puts towels in it. easy to put together good find", 
    "Very easy to assemble, looks great, nice quality for the price.", 
    "I needed a cabinet to put next to my desk to organize/tuck away paper and files, instead of having them in view on my desk or floor. It's a beautiful cabinet! Matches my desk (rich brown), and the glass door makes it look expensive. Really easy to put together. You could use it in any room.. will hold tons of tp.. beautiful night stands.. end tables perfect for a lamp.. you could put books in it.. possibilities are endless!", 
    "Easy and sturdy! Excellent directions !would buy from this company again and again!", 
    "For two years my husband and I searched local stores for an 11 foot BLACK umbrella. Who would think black, the most basic color, would be so hard to find. I struggle to purchase some things on line. I'm a visual person, I need to touch and feel. I gave in and started searching on line by just pulling up black umbrella. I tried many sites before I tried Overstock. I'm so glad I did. The umbrella is perfect. Beautiful. I was ecstatic when I arrived home from work and my husband already had the patio staged with the umbrella. The quality is exceptional. 11 foot is the perfect size to cover a large area; covers an entire table with six chairs. Who would have thought I would have to go to Canada to get a black umbrella. Thank you Overstock; I can't tell you how happy I am with my purchase.", 
    "I was concerned that the quality wouldn't be very good as I wanted to use this as a vase stand in the corner of my dining room. And I was pleasantly surprised at the quality parts, excellent finish, nice glass doors and overall look of this cabinet. I replaced the knob with a more decorative bronze one and it's a beautiful piece of furniture. So much so that I have just ordered the larger size with the drawer for another spot in my home!", 
    "I needed a storage cabinet for the powder bathroom and this is perfect. It is not flimsy at all-very substantial feel and looks more expensive than it is. Easy to assemble. Very attractive accent piece.", 
    "This cabinet is just perfect!! We needed a small cabinet for our bathroom and this one fits so well. It was really easy to assemble and it just looks great!! I am so pleased!!", 
    "I have not even put it together yet because I measured the inside shelf and it is only 9.5\" by 10.5\" so it will not work where I originally planned. I expected to use it for temporary storage of items that are 11\" square and the info regarding interior dimensions I read online said it was 12\" inside. Big sigh. I thought about returning it for that reason, but since it is nice little cabinet, I will find somewhere else to use it. Time to shop for something else.", 
    "This is a small cabinet but you can configure the shelves to suit your needs. Sturdy and good weight. I added a tile top for durability. For the price it's a very nice looking piece in the bath. Doesn't look like it was under****. The glass will be nice to allow for color since you can definitely see everything in the cabinet.", 
    "Easy assembly, and nice looking piece. Was missing pieces that I had to find alternatives to myself. Feels sturdy for a self-assembly piece.", 
    "This item was exactly what I was looking for and well priced. The quality of the floor quality looks great and it was easy to assemble.", 
    "Perfect little cabinet for tiny space between MB sink cabinet & jetted tub. Great assembly instructions; no extra pieces; no missing parts. Clear diagram made assembly ultra easy and quick. Surprisingly nice quality for the price. It was actually fun to assemble without any help & absolutely no whining. Don't hesitate to purchase this one.", 
    "I love the cabinet and it works great for what I got it for. Have had many nice compliments on it.", 
    "The product was smaller than anticipated on the inside. It is for use in my renovated bathroom to put towels, wash cloths, etc. in but the shelves are not large enough for bath towels. It does look nice but wish it were larger.", 
    "I changed the knobs to clear glass to make them look a little less modern. The waffle glass makes is so pretty. Bought the matching cabinet also.", 
    "It is simply nice! Size and looks are super! I just love it!", 
    "This is a very nice piece. We got it as a storage unit for our powder room. Wood was better quality than expected. I was expecting the particle board type stuff from Target, Ikea etc but it's actually a bit better than that. The middle 'window' glass lines are a little crooked, I'm guessing that's why it's on Overstock. But, you really can barely tell. The overall quality is nice enough that it's still a great piece.", 
    "This cabinet is for use in our ladies room at my firm. IT wipes clean with no spotting and gets heavy use. It was VERY easy to assemble and it aligns perfectly on every corner and joint. The door has a nice snug fit. I will be purchasing one for myself to use at home. Thank you Overstock for your great products selction and service.", 
    "Easy instructions. Looks expensive. Door comes pre assembled.", 
    "Beautiful cabinet. I love it! Wish there were more matching pieces. Assembly took less than an hour.", 
    "Great little cabinet. Good construction -- went together perfectly.", 
    "Love the piece so much it is really nice but I am doing my salon in all black furniture and now I have a deep brown red cabinet. So upset :-(", 
    "Beautiful addition to the bathroom. Easy to assemble", 
    "Okay folks, this is a cute little cabinet! Yes, it is small... (did you read the dimensions first? I did.) So if you are looking for a good sturdy little piece to fit in a \"nook\" area of the home, buy it. I thought I was going to use it in my 1/2 bath (which it looked great in) but decided to put it in the guest bedroom as a night-stand table instead. The color is a deep espresso. Took around 40 mins to put together, simple easy to understand directions and no fuss! I might get another one! Great buy for a small contemporary piece!", 
    "I put this together in about 1/2 hour. It fits perfectly in our master bath where we needed a little something in a small space we had. I'm going to put a cute little lamp on it. The glass is actually heavier than I expected which makes it feel like a quality piece. I'm not a big fan of the shiny silver knob, but that is easily changed out.", 
    "This piece fits perfectly in a little nook of my bathroom. Nice height and lots of space inside. Pretty simple to put together, solid piece.", 
    "This matches a previously purchased bathroom vanity and fits in well to provide additional storage. Great value for the product.", 
    "My husband wanted me to make sure I let you know how easy this was to put together. He commented on the efficient way all the parts are labeled and stored in packagin. He thinks the manufacturer might be the same as that of a TV cabinet we ordered a couple years ago. The cabinet is very sturdy, and its function/storage is just what was needed in the small space between a toilet and sink in a spare bathroom. bk", 
    "Much nicer than I thought it would be, looks great in my bathroom. A little deeper than I thought but my fault for not measuring space.", 
    "This product has an awful smell, that does not go away. The removal shelf pegs fall out very easily also, because they just sit in the holes, and not tight in the holes. I'm not sure I would recommend this product...", 
    "I needed a water resistant cabinet for my downstairs half-bath that was narrow enough to fit in the tight space between a pedestal sink and a toilet and also short enough not to be taller than both. This fit the bill perfectly. An added bonus was that it was very easy to assemble: I was able to do so myself in about forty-five minutes. A word of warning to allergy sufferers: the packaging that this cabinet was shipped in REEKED of an eye-watering combination of burnt plastic fumes and stale cigarette smoke. The smell lingered on the cabinet after it was assembled. Fortunately, it came off after I wiped it down with some countertop cleaner.", 
    "This cabinet is much darker than it appears on the web; however, I was aware of this before the purchase from reading other reviews. The construction is solid and the cabinet was very easy to assemble. It is very attractive, and it's exactly what I wanted based on the description and measurements. I would recommend this floor cabinet to anyone.", 
    "I was looking for something to hold my towels in the bathroom. This is on the small side, only fitting 4-5 thick full sized towels, 3 hand towels, and 5-6 face towels. I didn't want to send it back because it is so beautiful.", 
    "Easy to assemble - I paid my 11 year-old nephew to put it together and he had it assembled in a little over a half hour. It looks great in my space - I use it in my bedroom to hold sarongs and scarves. I really like the glass door - it looks great. I am very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "This piece is very heavy. Its sturdy and doesn't wobble on my tile floors. It comes unassembled and the directions are fairly easy to follow and intuitive. It was well worth the price paid and I am looking for a bigger complementry piece for the bathroom. This piece sits nicely in the \"water closet\" area.", 
    "I wanted something unique for my nightstands in my bedroom, Perfect", 
    "Easy to put together. Great looking for the price", 
    "the cabinet looks nicer in the picture. color is too dark and the cabinet is VERY SMALL. I bought this cabinet to put it right outsiide bathroom halllway and I can barely use it to store small itemes. it will not fit a hand towel inside the shelf! I am disappointed at this buy. Also it is too pricey for the size... I do not recommend this piece of furniture", 
    "This cabinet came well packed and was fairly easy for me to assemble. I had my doubts about it when I looked at the parts, but once it was all put together- it looks great. It has a fair amount of that bad odor that normally comes with products made of this material, but I'm confident it will dissipate with time. I'm very pleased with my purchase!", 
    "Arrived in solid packing. It was easy to put together. It's a very solid piece of furniture. I am very glad I for the purchase.", 
    "I didn't open the box because I found the specs not to fit my needs. When I went to return it...unopened...I was appalled by the shipping cost. It may be free shipping one way but they sure gouge you on the return. After many purchases, I've never needed to return an item to Overstock before. Because of it, I'll never purchase anything from them again.", 
    "I was searching for a little cabinet for my new powder room to store toilet paper, tissues and hand towels. This lovely cabinet with it's glass door is perfect with three shelves for lots of things. I erred in my measurements and had to put it in a different spot than I had planned, but it is perfect. I actually enjoyed putting it together even though it took awhile.", 
    "I had been searching for a small cabinet to use as storage for bathroom prodeucts in a small powder room. This table worked out perfect. The qualty and appearance far exceed the price.", 
    "In short, this is a beautiful product with a great purpose. It has freed up some much-needed space in our bathroom and is used frequently every day. It's great, modern style also improves the overall appeal of our bathroom. The price, however was unacceptable. Unfortunately, it looks too good to pass up, so I couldn't. I would pay 60% of what they were asking no problem. The reason I say this is because when I received it, I had to assemble it-completely understandable. But the problem is that while assembling it, one tends to see exactly what it's made of and what holds it all together (particle board, faux finish and tiny nails and wooden pegs). I just think for this price, it should have been made with an actual wood. In summary, it is a great product that will improve the look of any bathroom. Love it.", 
    "Dissappointed and would not recommend could have done better for the $$$. Odd Lot's quality. Could have gone to Ikea.", 
    "It was easy to assemble. It took an hour for me. It looked so beautiful in my bathroom. Even the cardboard peice that goes behind the cabinet looked like wood and was strong.", 
    "Nice cabinet. Easier than most to assemble. Fits the bill for desired use.", 
    "This cabinet was perfect for our powder room. It is small, but holds the essentials (extra rolls of toilet tissue, etc.). It looks as good in person as it does in the picture, if not better. Great quality, well made, easy to assemble. I would definitely recommend this cabinet.", 
    "Great price, very simple assembly and looks great!", 
    "WE BOUGHT THE CABINET ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO. THE COLOR IS DARKER, BUT I KNEW THAT FROM OTHER REVIEWS. IT FITS PERFECTLY IN OUT BATHROOM. IT ONLY TOOK LESS THAN AN HOUR TO GET IT ALL PUT TOGETHER AND FILLED WITH EVERYTHING WE WANTED TO STORE IN IT. I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS CABINET TO ANY ONE OUT THERE. WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH OUR PURCHASE. ALL I CAN SAY NOW IS LOVE LOVE LOVE IT....", 
    "This is a very nice well constructed piece of furniture. I should have checked the dimensions, because it was a bit smaller then I thought. All in all it fits welll and I like it.", 
    "Great quality and beautiful piece for the bathroom. Some others commented on it being small, but it is the exact dimensions it's advertised as. Love it.", 
    "I read all the reviews before deciding on buying this cabinet. I was glad that i did. It is very sturdy and beautiful. It came very well packaged. I recommend looking through the instructions before starting to put things together. It took only about 30 minutes to assemble. The dark wood is very attractive. I was surprised at its sturdiness. Fits perfectly in my small bathroom. I was able to fit all my toiletries nicely. Even my husband likes it!", 
    "This is a very nice piece of furniture, great wood. Only draw back was it a little smaller than I expected.", 
    "This item came in a box packaged very well. Everything in the box was numbered so it made it very easy to follow the directions. I admit when I saw how many pages there were to the directions, I was a little scared. It was however very easy to understand. It took about a little over an hour to put together. The cabinet is very sturdy and looks very nice in my bathroom.", 
    "I bought this product to use as night stands in my bedroom and they are the perfect height with my bed and look great. They didn't take long at all to put together and the wood is sturdy and nice looking. Would definitly recommend to use in a bathroom or as night stands.", 
    "I bought this for a bathroom that didn't have any storage space. All of my husband's toiletries fit into it. It was easy to assemble, and it's very sturdy. It looks great in our bathroom!", 
    "I bought this cabinet for a guest bath with only a pedestal sink and toilet. It needed a small space for cleaning supplies. This cabinet was just the right size and looks really nice. Also, the 2 shelves are adjustable, so you can fit most anything it it. The only assembly glitch was the pull knob. I over tightened it and stripped the threads. The manufacturer probably would replace it, but I had another one on hand from other furniture.", 
    "I bought three of these for each of the restrooms in my new office. I don't like putting together furniture that has those short dowel rods and glue, and this one had quite a bit of both. It is really a cherry finish, and I was expecting more of an espresso based on other reviews. It is small, so pay attention to the listed dimensions--they are correct. The cabinet is fine for the money. It is mainly used to hold extra toilet paper and cleaners. Assembly time is probably about 45 minutes going solo.", 
    "We purchased this to go in a bathroom that has no medicine cabinet and has a pedestal sink. The size and footprint are perfect and compliments the decor. We love the glass door. It was very easy to put together. It took about 20-30 minutes. We looked everywhere for something like this and found it only on Overstock. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "Perfect for bathroom storage. Small enough as not to take up alot of space, but large enough to store bathroom items inside. The color goes well with mahogany or cherrywood. It is a deep redish brown color and not an expresso color. It is not a black-brown color. After reading the reviews, I knoew it would be the color I was looking to get and and very happy.", 
    "The cabinet is very nice and will serve its purpose, though I wish the color was truer to the picture. I thought it would have less of a cherry color and more blackish/brown. Size is perfect for a smaller bathroom. My 19 year old daughter put the cabinet together with no problems. All in all I do like the cabinet.", 
    "yes, color is indeed a darker shade, i would say rich expresso. so the picture doesn't really do its justice. very nice item.", 
    "It sure looked nice in the pic, but when I got it home, and looked how it went together....typical. We use it as a liquor cabinet....and its suits us fine for that, but I dont expect it to survive a move. Throw-away furniture....which I tend not to buy...but tis my fauult. The featured description is accurate, and I bought what I paid for.", 
    "I am extremely pleased with this cabinet, especially for the price I paid. It took me a little bit to put it together but it has been a wonderful asset to my bathroom. It's very spacious.", 
    "The Windham Floor Cabinet is fantastic. I ordered two; husband and I put together in about an hour and we are still married! They are darker in person which is perfect for our kitchen--one on each side of the stove. Hold cookbooks and spices perfectly!", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised by the look of this piece. I bought the espresso finish and with the very pretty glass door--it looks expensive! The cabinet also has two shelves which makes it very functional. The instructions have only pictures to follow so I had to take it apart a couple of times because I installed my shelves backward. Other than that... pretty easy. Great purchase... I'm considering buying a second one.", 
    "This is a very nice looking cabinet. It is small in size, but I needed something for a small bathroom so it worked out well for me. For the quality and the price you can't beat it.", 
    "This took about 1 hour to assemble but looks great once it is done.", 
    "This is a beautiful little cabinet! Very sturdy, easy to assemble, nice magnet-closure on the door. The color is indeed espresso, darker than the photo, but since I knew that from reading the other reviews, I am a happy camper. It was hard to find a nice cabinet in this small size; this fits the bill, looks great in my bathroom, and was a good price to boot.", 
    "I was pleased, but disappointed that is was so dark. In the picture it looks like what I wanted, but in reality It is closer to black. I ordered the towel ladder at the same time, described as \"Expresso\", and was worried it would be too dark to match this cabinet. I figured the towels would cover most of it, if too dark. Just the opposite was true. The ladder is med to dark stain, but the cabinet color is closer to black. It sure is cute, though!", 
    "I was disappointed in the size of the cabinet. It is not able to hold regular size towels, only washcloths. I kept the cabinet for decoration since it took a bit of effort to assemble.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet to add storage space for a small bathroom. I must have been distracted because I didn't focus on the dimensions of the cabinet before I made the purchase. It's looks great, though, and is a nice accent for an even smaller bathroom in my home. Good quality but takes a bit of time to put together. Great color and finish.", 
    "It took awhile to put together but, in my opinion, unless you are putting the same item together overand over day after day....it will take a bit to get it together.It looks very nice together and pretty good quality.All pieces fit together well.", 
    "We recently remodeled and udated a small bathroom and needed a place for towels and other bathroom items. This was the perfect size and fit. The color is a deep espresso brown, which was exactly what we wanted. This has worked out perfectly. We will be getting the matching wall cabinet as well to complete the look. I have shopped Overstock several times and have not been disappointed in the quality of the merchandise. I would recommed this item and overstock.. Keep up the good work Overstock!", 
    "I have recently remodeled my mater bath and needed just a bit more storage to fit in a nook. This piece fit the bill perfectly. The color is very dark (I'd call it expresso) which matches my cabinets almost perfectly. It looks much more expensive that the very reasonable price I paid (I got it on sale with no shipping). There are many pieces which were nicely labelled, but like most put together furniture, the directions where a bit confusing. I love the piece and would recommend for others.", 
    "After 10 years,me and my husband are finally able to remodel our bathroom,and because we ended up spending alot on actual materials,there wasn't much money left for accessories. I came to good ole' overstock who has NEVER LET ME DOWN! Thank you SO much overstock! We bought this Windham floor cabinet,plus the Windham wall cabinet and the wide wall mirror. They're all AMAZING pieces and I'd recommend all of them! This is the *perfect* size and exactly what I was looking for,and I couldn't be more happy with it! Its a smaller size at 13 inches wide and its perfect for a small corner or area that you want something in but nothing too large. It has three shelves in it(I noticed someone mentioned two,but mine has three as I will explain next.There's enough room to keep backup t.p rolls on one shelf,my skincare on another and my makeup brushes/eyeliner/lipliner pencil cups on the last shelf. I had originally planned to put fancily rolled-up bathtowels in it as well,but I just couldn't get those to fit..its too short for that. I absolutely adore it,and again I cannot recommend it enough! It has a super high end appearance,and remember to read the description that it has an espresso finish..I notice people complained that the color was darker than the picture,and the sizing but all you have to do is READ THE DESCIPTION!!!!! I just hate when ratings gets dropped for a product because people failed to read it and then complain about it later :(I couldn't be more happy with my purchase(as I am with ALL my overstock purchases!!)One last thank you to dear overstock and if you guys can afford it,please continue with the $1 shipping,it is such a nice *luxury* to have when its usually an extra hundred or so dollars to ship something of this size.God bless overstock and a million thank yous&I luv you's!", 
    "The cabinet arrived quickly and was relatively easy to assemble. Quality product! Perfect color for my bathroom.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for my mom's bathroom in her new apartment. It was just the perfect size for the space we had. The finish is darker (almost black) than it appears in the photo but that was just fine with us. The assembly was very easy for my husband and me. Would recommend to anyone.", 
    "Overstock came through again when looking to fulfill a tricky deco problem! I went to VA to help my daughter renovate her master bathroom (will not go into detail on problems there)! I had to return to CO before the finishing details (putting vanity and cabinets in place) took place. Knowing there was a floor laundry chute to deal with (beside the dark finished vanity) we searched her area for a solution and found zilch. On returning home I started searching DIY stores, came up with zero again. I then thought Overstock! Sure enough there was a narrow cabinet with almost perfect height and looked to be in same dark color tones. IT WORKED! Delivery was very fast and according to son in law the assembly was very fast also! He only needed to adjust width of top, leave out bottom for cute opening and viola! laundry chute cabinet that looks great and is easily accessible. Thanks again Overstock for great service.", 
    "Very nice small cabinet with 2 shelves.. I took some time to put together but if you read instructions it can be done. Wood is quality..and sturdy.", 
    "Well, first off the wood does not look like what is in the picture. The wood looks almost dark dark brown, making it a nice floor cabinet for any dark decor room. The set up was pretty easy, I can put things together pretty easy (I am a female) and I found it took me about 45 min. to do since their was a part in the directions that was just a little bit confusing. After using logic on putting it together, I did not need the directions. I was a little disappointed though on the quality of the item, but it was sturdy enough to keep it rather than returning it. I think this is a great buy if you are looking for something that is small enough to fit nik-naks in a cabinet or an area that is small. I am going to repaint it though since I want something darker than what it is and it was pretty dark to begin with. I think this was a good buy off of overstock. happy with my purchase too!", 
    "the product i received looks different that the image on the web. you cant see any wood grain its just a dark red finish. looks cheap.", 
    "Alot smaller than I thought it to be and cost way too much.", 
    "This item is smaller than expected....but it looks cute in the bathroom. Used as a deco piece for towels in a corner that was empty. Make sure you look at measurements....tiny."
