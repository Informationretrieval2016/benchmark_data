This table has a unique look to match its unique shape. Designed to fit in the corner of a room, this table offers storage space in the single drawer, and an open shelf at the bottom for display. The Etlan Textured Black and Beige finish is highly textural and features hand painted embellishments. A scroll shaped skirt and turned legs breakup the sharp angle.
