    "We just bought the gorgeous click-clack futon for our home office and love it!", 
    "looks good and easy to use.", 
    "This is the perfect sofa bed for our living room. It looks great and is comfortable. It's perfect when we have an overnight guest. The feet were easy to assemble. Great quality for the price.", 
    "It is a very comfortable futon. Very easy to assemble and the leather feels good. After discount, it is a very good purchase.", 
    "Returned it. Cheap fake leather", 
    "Came in handy for college dorm use.", 
    "Easy to put together and very sturdy. It is slightly lower than expected but is still comfortable to sit, lay, or relax on.", 
    "This product was alright, for the price. The back didn't seem stable when in couch configuration, but I saw a couple of small dogs claim onto it without a collapse. Unfortunately, the couch couldn't hold up to said small dogs. The couch was at the curb in about 3-6 months. (I kept taping it, but the stuffing was too tasty for the dogs to resist.)", 
    "Really comfy. Nice look. Good price..", 
    "We purchased this for our sons man cave. It is absolutely perfect! We are very pleased with the style and quality of this futon.", 
    "The quality is okay, but it is quite a bit smaller that a full when flat.", 
    "Well made and very sturdy. Easy to put together. Nice addition to the study room.", 
    "Just right for a one-BR apartment. I like the firmness, classy leather look/feel, ease of assembly, and utility. Comfortable enough, but not so comfortable that guests wouldn't want to leave - are you kidding??! Had to get used to its low profile, and I would need lumbar pillows as well. I wasn't expecting a coupon on top of the discount: An absolute bang for the buck!", 
    "Very easy to assemble, looks great and comfortable. No complaints!", 
    "Functions, style, great price. Used in an office waiting room", 
    "I purchased this really as an add-on for my son's room. I needed and extra sleeping area. The couch was easy to setup and I like the modern style. It is pretty comfortable when I sit on it although it is a little bit low on the ground. Overall great buy!!!", 
    "A perfect small footprint sofa lounger. Delivered without a scratch and easy installation of legs.", 
    "The two seat backs move independently, and they don't both recline or sit up at the same height -- they are about 1/2 an inch off, so it looks crooked. The faux leather is rather slippery and throw pillows just slide off or around. It's uncomfortable to try and sit on since there are no arms to lean against and it's so low to the ground. It was on sale and very inexpensive, so it's fine given the price, but I'm looking for something better already."
