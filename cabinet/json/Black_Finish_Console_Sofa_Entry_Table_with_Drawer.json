    "It's ok but I need to add acents to make it pop", 
    "Took a little bit to get together. Instructions didn't have words and were not as well drawn out as an IKEA product but we got the idea. Sturdy enough & perfect height. Not too tall and not too short.", 
    "Must be able to assemble , but it worked well on home office wall for tall table lamp and some pictures along with enough room for cup of coffee or cocktail", 
    "The table has a lot of pieces to be put together. It has a good look but the quality stinks.", 
    "Very beautiful! I love the style and it perfect for my living room.", 
    "Very easy to assemble. Looks great in foyer with a black wicker basket at bottom for guest socks and vase on top is how I'm using it. Has latch to secure it to a wall but I didn't use that. Love it!", 
    "Assembled in a decent length of time. Not too difficult.", 
    "Very flimsy, poor design. The drawer doesn't close well and sticks out. It's so wobbly I can't put anything on it besides a set of keys and small items. It looks ok from afar but I wouldn't recommend it at all", 
    "The design is modern and sleek, and matched the rest of my furniture, which is important to me. It also makes for an inviting entryway. The material is sturdy, and the table was relatively easy to put together. I like that it's simple, but still nice looking and functional.", 
    "Tooooo many pieces! I would never have ordered if I had realized that it came unassembled... I will be sure to pay attention if I order again.", 
    "perfect for my space, matches my couch with the curves, very easy to assemble and goes with the mirror I ordered. Very happy with the look and quality", 
    "Exactly what I wanted for my small entry hall. Only downside was the difficulty putting it together.", 
    "I purchased this item for my loft style basement. The quality of the materials was better than expected for the price and it was very easy to assemble. It looks really good in the space.", 
    "I love this piece. Although I am not talented in the assembly area, I was able to recruit my brother-in-law and his brother in that arena. Their only problem once completed was that the drawer was not completely aligned and has to be pushed firmly in order to close completely. Other than that flaw, I feel it was a good purchase.", 
    "The finish is very sensitive, do not bump or scratch, protect while assembling. The drawer did not close properly with provided holes/guides, had to use other holes on the guides, worked fine. It does fill the spot in our entryway rather nicely!", 
    "Great piece of art work. It takes a little too much work to put the pieces together.", 
    "Beautiful entry table & very well priced", 
    "This table is so nice. It makes a nice addition to any hallway or enrty way.", 
    "Picture looked better than the product", 
    "The drawer glides were two different kinds therefore the drawer does not open smoothly. Several spots where the black finish was nicked, we used a black permanent marker to touch up. Would not reccommend", 
    "Not bad, easy to assemble", 
    "This item looks nice from a distance, however it is poorly made. Very cheap parts! I can't even get the drawer to close."
