    "Ifnot for the smell of the finishing product, this cabinet would be perfect. Great quality and VERY pretty.", 
    "The cabinet is great. It looks exactly as pictured and is very high quality. It was well worth the cost. The packaging and shipping was wonderful. All of the parts were well labeled. Putting it together took about 1 hour. If you can use a screwdriver and read, you'll be fine. The only oddity was using wood glue for a few dowels. The wood glue was provided in the packaging. Even though it was odd, the glued dowels make the cabinet very sturdy.", 
    "Love the size and style of the piece, however, the paint/finish has such a strong odor. We've had the piece for several weeks and still notice the smell. Had a problem with the first set of doors being severely scratched. Overstock handled ordering and sending the replacement pieces very well. No problems with the new set of doors.", 
    "I love my new Jezzebel double door cabinet. It was not difficult to put together. I did it myself (2hours) it looks so nice in my bathroom. The bathroom is a lovely green and everything else is white. The cabinet is stunning against the green wall.", 
    "This is the perfect cabinet for my bathroom. It holds a lot, yet doesn't take up a lot of room. It took a little while to assemble, but it was not difficult. I'm impressed with how sturdy it is! I used to have ikea drawers, but they were so shoddy, and I felt like they were going to fall apart every time I opened a drawer. I love this cabinet.", 
    "These cabinets are absolutely awesome and easy to put together!", 
    "Every detail is just right about this cabinet. Perfectly packed and assembled perfectly. Matte finish. Quality piece of furniture.", 
    "I bought this to put in my downstairs bathroom as it only had a pedestal sink and therefore no storage in that room. It is perfect! Just the right size. A bit tricky to put together as I was doing it by myself and an extra pair of hands would have helped. No complaints once it was together and I have gotten a couple of compliments on it!", 
    "love this small cabinet, I used it at my last house in the bathroom and now I have it in the entryway. It works very well - I love the look", 
    "Nicely constructed. Using this cabinet in my office. A very special look.", 
    "I ordered both floor and wall cabinet and am pleased with both. I opened the boxes outside and let them air out due to other review comments and that seemed to help.", 
    "Very good quality and workmanship.", 
    "I got this cabinet awhile ago and I finally put them together. Wow! This cabinet is really gorgeous. I had a hard time which room I should put the cabinet and it's sitting in my master bedroom. Thank you Overstock for putting this up for sale.", 
    "Perfect for what I needed. A little stinky when I took it out of the box, but it eventually went away.", 
    "The cabinet is perfect for my small bathroom. Assembly was painless. I ordered gray. It came white, but it still looks lovely so I kept it.", 
    "What an elegant piece of furniture for my half bath. Fits perfectly and the shattered glass doors look incredible!", 
    "easy to assemble, looks great, good buy, a little bigger would have been better.", 
    "This cabinet was easy to assemble and it looks beautiful! Sturdy, functional, and stylish. Just the right size to hold bathroom supplies, and the top shelf is perfect for decorative finishing touches like candles or flowers. Love it!", 
    "I bought this for my master closet. I wanted a little glam and bling. It's a gorgeous piece. The shipping was fast and packing was perfect! It came in a nice little foam box inside a cardboard box. The foam was about 2 inches thick which was awesome considering when the box showed up there was a huge dent in it but the cabinet was protected and all good to go. Assembly was easy, I did it in about 30 minutes with a 2 year old climbing on me. :-)", 
    "Is a really nice piece of furniture. It is attractive and sturdy.", 
    "Love the design but it is white not gray like I wanted and my husband surprised me buy putting it together while I was at work and threw away all the shipping info!!!", 
    "Thanks for the WHITE cabinet when we definitely ordered grey. What do we do now?", 
    "It's white, it stands up, it holds things. Assembly took an hour and a quarter, stretched over two days. It could have been done in a half hour. Instructions were clear. It's more than solid enough for the price. i'm satisfied.", 
    "Wish it was a little larger and a little sturdier. Overall looks nice and ok for the money. This is in our beach house and we get a lot of guests and kids, will see how it holds up.", 
    "As nice as shown in picture. Using it in a small bathroom and size is perfect", 
    "this is a definite white cabinet. For some reason I thought i was more off-white, but its white. No problem in my bathroom however. Love the bling that this provides, while not being gaudy. Nice size for my second bathroom. Put together on my own, took some time, but was not that hard to do. Hardest part was hanging the doors, but I was able to do it.", 
    "I am a product nut, and this little gem is storing lots of bathroom \"stuff\" that would normally be in a cabinet under the bathroom sink, and doing it nicely. Easy to assemble and I have received compliments on how nice it looks.", 
    "Very nice and chic for extra storage", 
    "nice piece for the money, easy to put together", 
    "This cabinet adds a great look to our bathroom", 
    "I loved this but unfortunately it did not fit in my space. It is about an inch wider then it says....This is a beautiful piece and I would have been very happy with it if it fit.", 
    "Not high end. Bite of a struggle to assemble", 
    "I was impressed with the quality of this cabinet for the price. Don't get me wrong though I don't find it superb=all wood construction--it's not, but I have seen much worse. The cabinet was simple to put together, I did it myself without the hubbie's assistance at all. The glue they give you can be a bit messy as it will ooze out the holes so have paper towels handy. The doors are decorative and hung evenly. Depending on how you fold your towels/how big they are, I fit about 7 full sized towels on the shelves inside and then a stack of hand towels and wash clothes also next to them on the shelves, so serves my purpose well.", 
    "this is a perfect cabinet to store items with a great mirror mosaic detail", 
    "Beautiful cabinet . Mirrored tiles are very pretty", 
    "We wanted a small cupboard for our master bath for toilet tissue, towels and shower supplies. This was the perfect size. I knew I wanted the open shelf to stack face cloths that we could grab. The inside shelves are not very deep, but we didn't want something that stuck out from the wall that we would be bumping into all the time. We had it assembled in under an hour, no problems, flaws or missing parts. I wish it had been available in a light or medium wood, but otherwise it's perfect! We plan to attach a towel ring to the side to mod it a little for our needs.", 
    "Gotta love an easy to assemble piece of furniture. My 9 year old son thinks the unique glass doors are super cool and my hard-to-please husband even likes it a lot! I assembled it by myself. Instructions were clear and it was easy. Not one mistake.", 
    "I just assembled this cabinet and it fits perfectly where I had hoped. It's perfect for table linens, small enough to sit in a hallway and the center glass panels pick up light in a surprisingly pretty way!~", 
    "Beautiful, high quality cabinet. It arrived quickly, was easy to assemble, and looks awesome in my new bathroom. The pebbled and beveled glass doors are very pretty.", 
    "item has a very elegant look, I'm very happy with this purchase", 
    "My 16 year old daughter put it together all by herself in couple hours. I used it to hold extra toilet paper rolls and folded towels in my master bathroom. Looks very nice!", 
    "Received quickly and well packaged. The glass on the front doors have a \"beachy\" look as the glass looks like beach glass.", 
    "Purchased with the matching wall cabinet, I'm really happy with the overall design and quality of both pieces. They were easy to build. I was bummed, after ordering and shipment that I found this item on another website for ** less. I will start looking around for best prices from now on.", 
    "Get lots of compliments. Wish it was not quite so white though its a bit dazzling and would be better in cream.", 
    "This is a sturdy cabinet that will work for placing a few items out if sight while adding some charm with the decor of the doors. It's a good value for the price. It was also easy to put together.", 
    "Got this for my 12 year olds bath room. Looks very cute and matches the d\u00e9cor in her bed/bath. Gives her some extra storage and a place to set her lotions, perfumes, etc. on. Hung a cool mirror over it and it really compliments the sparkly doors on cabinets. just what we were looking for. It is one of the narrower ones, which I needed because of where it is sitting.", 
    "I was SO thrilled with my purchase of these cabinets that we purchased two more! The glass is very unique & beautiful & the finish on the cabinets matched the white cabinets in our bathroom nicely! The cabinet is sturdy & the size is more than adequate for storage of bathroom items! I would highly recommend these cabinets to you. Easy to assemble as well as very unique & beautiful!", 
    "This is a beautiful, well made cabinet. Recently moved, so I have had to assemble multiple items. This was by far the best quality I have come across. The holes were precise and lined up perfectly. Only needed a screwdriver. Cabinet looks more expensive in person. Highly recommend!", 
    "Best deal I could find for such a great cabinet. Tried all kinds of stores for the money and free delivery it was the best deal. You guys have the best stuff ever. Do all my shopping here lately always seem to find the the right items.", 
    "I bought the wall cabinet first, I like the quality so much, that I decided to buy the floor cabinet as well. It is very easy to put it together and the quality is excellent. love both pieces and they look terrific in my newly renovated bathroom", 
    "We recently had our upstairs guest bathroom rebuilt in white and slate grey. We needed a decorative cabinet to store towels and supplies and had only 28 inches of space between the shower and the wall. This 24 inch cabinet fit perfectly and beautifully fills the purpose.", 
    "Overall, this is not worth the money. The matching wall cabinet was more reasonably priced. When the product arrived, one of the glass doors were broken. Ok, that's fine, not the manufacturer's fault. So I sent in for a replacement part. The overstock return/replacement policy was phenomenal, as was the efficiency of the manufacturer's replacement. My disappointment lies with the hazed out glass of the doors. The replacement part was better, but they both had a very dull quality to them. Also, the MDF material was \"cheaper\" than I was hoping. In a bathroom environment (humid) it may hold up better than traditional wood, but it is clumsy and hollow sounding. Would prefer wood for the price. The installation instructions were very well written and the mechanism for fastening the back board was much better than using traditional nails.", 
    "This is a very good cabinet for my purpose. I use it in my bathroom for extra toilet paper and cleaning supplies. I liked the sparkly cabinet front panels to give it a more interesting look. I can also use the top for displaying my daughter's prolific artwork which is taking over the house. The only thing I wish is that it had magnets on the doors to keep them closed. They close fine, but I thought in the future when the cabinet was a bit older, the doors may not want to stay closed. I'd definitely buy it again or recommend it to a friend. I can glue in magnets.", 
    "Bought all 3 pieces - very eyepopping with the door design - easy to put together took me about an hour to do all 3 pieces - I have gotten many compliments of this furniture. I have them in my bathroom which is blue & white so the white furniture is complimentary.", 
    "I like the cabinet overall, It is a perfect size for a bathroom. The broken mirror mosaic on the door is very pretty. One of the original doors had a defect (it looks like it was dropped). The replacement they sent me was also defective. Finally, they sent me 2 more doors, they were both scratched but livable. The manufacturer quality check must be nonexistent, which is too bad because it could be such a great product."
