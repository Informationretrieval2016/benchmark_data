    "Don't hesitate to buy these chairs. I was hesitant, but as soon as I got them, I ordered 2 more! I just wanted comfortable folding chairs never thinking I would find some that are not only comfortable, but actually pretty good looking! I got them in gold, and the frames are brown, but the fabric isn't really gold....it's more of a bronzey brown, and quite attractive. I was hoping they would be more brown than gold as another reviewer mentioned, and they were. They are more comfortable than my real dining chairs! Not only that, they don't look half bad set at the table....and I have a very nice dining room set! I was pleasantly surprised that these were much nicer than I expected them to be.", 
    "We bought a pair for our son who lives in a tiny dorm room. The chairs were comfortable enough for a long night of TV and fold up so they can be neatly stored. A great buy.", 
    "Attractive, comfortable and very high quality. It is a pleasure to bring them out when we have an excessive number of guests.", 
    "Very comfortable for a folding chair .and I would buy more if needed", 
    "Great looking chairs and pretty comfortable. Downside is that they are not as comfortable as advertised. The regular padded NPS chairs actually feel more comfortable then these. Don't get me wrong they aren't bad at all, they are comfy to sit on, just not what I expected. High padding makes you kind of lean forward. I'm assuming after time chairs will adjust. Considering the price its not worth it. If they were like ** dollars each it would be different. Overall they look very nice, and they are pretty comfortable, you won't loose out. Price definitely needs to be lowered by NPS again these and the regular padded NPS chairs go for lower prices. Overstock has great customer service and fast shipping. If I need to pay a few extra bucks on some items to get them from the big O, I will. Always a pleasure with Overstock..", 
    "these chairs arrived in a timely manner and packed well. They fold out easily and are comfortable and sturdy. The padded back is comfortable to my back and the seat is thickly padded and covered in a nice material of good color and is scotch guarded..They will fill the bill for my extra chairs for the table or extra seating anywhere. I will be ordering two more very shortly.", 
    "This is a high quality chair that is shipped in poor quality manufacturer's packaging. Overstock just sticks a tag on it and ships it as is. This was mentioned by another customer in their review. The single-layered box is very weak, and had a huge hole in it when I received it. It had two straps on it, otherwise the chairs would have fallen out. The upholstered seat is foolishly placed towards the outside of the box where it could be easily damaged. Fortunately, there was no damage due to the hole. However, both chairs were scratched from the staples used to make the box. There is a strip of tape that is supposed to cover the staples and protect the chair, but the tape completely missed the staples, which were left unprotected and resulted in a few scratches on the coated metal frame. Not terribly noticeable, but still unacceptable. The chairs themselves are of high quality and good design. They are very comfortable for a folding chair and look much better than I expected. The cloth used for the upholstery looks very good and appears to be very durable (time will tell). The price is very fair for this level of quality. My only reservation keeping me from recommending this product is the poor packaging used to ship them. I rate the chairs 5 stars but the packaging 1 star. It is not suitable for use in re-shipping this product to the customer via or.", 
    "the main problem with this order is that the box it came in arrived with a hole in it that went all the way down to the chairs. I was afraid to open it,, but fortunately the chairs were not damaged. Chairs were well built, comfortable and well upholstered.", 
    "Overall, I'm pretty happy with the chairs. As I mentioned, the fabric is a little rough; but after a few months of pretty regular use, the cushions are still cushy, nothing wobbles, no pilling or signs of wear on the cushions. I would've given them \"five stars\", but at least one of the plastic caps on the legs of each chair was broken when they arrived. Not a big deal, as they're easy enough to replace. For the price of the chairs, this was kind of minor for me.", 
    "Just what I was looking for. Have big & tall friends and they are comfortable in these chairs. No fear of them buckling. Substantial and strong. The black frames look great. Gray cloth nice quality, but would prefer another fabric, but its a nice neutral.", 
    "These chairs are comfortable and pretty. I chose the blue color. I really like the color. The seats have a lot of padding and the fabric has been treated to prevent stains. They are really very nice.", 
    "Chairs are very nice. I bought the what they say is \"gold\" but really they are brown which works better for me anyway! Very happy with these chairs!", 
    "I bought these chairs to use in my sewing/craft room because of the cushioned seats and back. I was not disappointed. These chairs are of excellent quality and as always Overstock has come through again with a great price and a great product.", 
    "We purchased 8 chairs for a dinner party, hoping the upholstered seats and backs would be comfortable enough that dinner conversation would not be cut short because of sore posteriors....mission accomplished! These chairs look very nice, the quality seems excellent, and it's a great way to offer guests a comfortable chair that's small and light enough to be t ucked away easily until the next dinner overflow seating need. The fabric has a diamond pattern woven into it and is quite attractive. We bought the gold fabric, which is more of a bronze effect with the underlying brown diamond thread pattern. The hang tag on the chair says the fabric is treated for spills, which I cannot attest to because we have had no spills so far. We are very pleased with the purchase.", 
    "I received these chairs today and love them. The are comfy and fit just right behind the door in the den. My only complaint is that I ordered gold upholstery with brown frame, but the color is of the fabric is more bronze than gold. Not a big deal since the chairs will only be used occasionally, but I thought I should mention it.", 
    "Arrived in excellent condition, Arrived promptly. Thanks for your continued fantabulous service! Have had a number of guests say that they are very \"comfortable.\" Leon. Charleston, SC", 
    "Very comfortable, good-looking and of light weght", 
    "People with a really wide girth will not fit in these chairs. Tall people will notice the shorter distance seat to knee. The cushion is a little stiff but the depth of the pad is good. These would be just fine for the occassional extra seating.", 
    "Only wish they were cheaper because I need about 50 sets for our clubhouse. Other than that, these are comfortable. The seat is a little \"short\" for tall people.", 
    "Excellent, very sturdy, cushion ads extra appeal to them. They are worth the money.", 
    "I have never seen fold up chairs this nice and soft.", 
    "Purchased these chairs for occasions when guests overflow your seating capacity. They are perfect. Nicely padded and quite comfortable. Very attractive and easy to store.", 
    "We've had these chairs for a couple of years now and they are wonderful - light, comfortable, easy to store, durable and attractive!", 
    "Bought these to use in our office. They're sturdy, padded and quite comfortable. We bought the navy ones and the fabric is beautiful.", 
    "Bought the \"gold\" chairs for a large dinner party. They are more brown than gold, which I like. They are high enough for table seating and blend well with our mahogany d.r. set. The cushions are attractive and comfortable. I wasn't expecting much, so was pleasantly surprised.", 
    "High quality and very comfortable. Not even mentioned on site that they are Scotch guarded!", 
    "Was quite surprised when I received these chairs. They are of excellent quality and the cushioned seats are quite thick. Not cheap looking at all. Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "commercial quality good value", 
    "These folding chairs are very nice and worth the price!", 
    "Love Love Love. The cushions are very soft.", 
    "Nice price. comfortable. Sturdy.", 
    "Very good quality. Looks expensive. Comfortable to sit on, padding just right. May order some for myself! Most folding chairs look cheap....these do not...very sturdy.", 
    "GREAT purchase. Comfortable and easy to stow away when not being used.", 
    "Excellent quality & usefullness", 
    "Very nice product! Are very dependably!", 
    "These are solid folding chairs with firm cushions. I like that they are a little higher than most. I hope the cushions soften a little with use.", 
    "This was an awesome purchase and they came preassembled. Would recommend.", 
    "they are very comfortable and stable", 
    "I needed extra seating for company and these chairs really fit the bill! Not only are they sturdy and functional but they are also very attractive and comfortable...", 
    "These are the most comfortable folding chairs. The padded seat allows you to sit for hours without the usual squirming and twisting to relieve one side of your bottom and then the other. An added plus is the color selections the combination I chose fits in perfectly with my decor. A perfect purchase!", 
    "There's nothing wrong with the chair. It is as it looks, but not real comfy for settling into on my porch and reading, which is what I bought it for. The seat and back are great and the overall quality is good. I should have chosen one with arms and a high back that would let me relax into it.", 
    "These chairs are great. Look great, not rickety like other folding chairs. Padding on bottom and back make them more comfy than our dining room chairs. We bought 6 for family dinners and they are the preferred seats. can't go wrong.", 
    "Great chairs for occasional large group use. However, they arrived late for my party.", 
    "These were super nice, sturdy chairs. Overstock got them to me very quickly as well.", 
    "Very sturdy, thick cushion chairs are better than expected. Very comfortable.", 
    "I bought my husband a table for the kitchen because I was tired of him spending all day at the dining table reading and doing crossword puzzles. The new one in the kitchen is just for him, but the folding chair was a little too short. This gives me 2 chairs and they are quite comfy. He is happy, and I am definitely happy that he isn't grubbing up my tablecloth and carpet under the dining table. Thanks.", 
    "These chairs are great. I ordered them to have additional seating for the holidays.. I didn't expect them to be the quality nor the comfort for the price-very surprised. We are very please with them.", 
    "These chairs are comfortable. I used them at a flea market where sitting may occur all day. I brought them in the blue and the color was spot on. I can see using these chairs as additional seating at dinners or large gatherings.", 
    "I needed some folding chairs for overflow seating. These chairs are comfortable and look great! Love them!", 
    "Great chairs to take our seating for 6 to seating for 12. A rich beautiful color that complimented our deep gold dining room color scheme. Nice quality.", 
    "The chairs are well padded and seem well built. Certainly not exceptional. We just received them, so I don't know how they will hold up, long-term. They will suffice if we have guests over and run out of dining room chairs, but they will be in a closet when not in use.", 
    "These folding chairs have thick foam cushions and quality upholstery. We just ordered another 10 for our library. Good value!", 
    "I didn't have room for regular computer chairs and decided to try these. They are super comfortable which is nice for times when I'm at my computer for an extended amount of time. Planning to order more.", 
    "Very nice chairs!!! Sturdy and beautiful to look at. I will order more of these!", 
    "I received many positive comments about my new chairs and have used them several times. So glad I bought them.", 
    "It is a sturdy and comfortable chair. We originally ordered four a year ago and they have been so good that we ordered two more.", 
    "These chairs are sturdy and reasonably comfortable. They are OK but I wish I had bought something better for my home. They don't look like anything special, just folding chars with padded seats.", 
    "This is my second purchase for a pair of these very nice folding chairs. These are the most comfortable I've sat in, and my guests have also said the same. I chose the burgundy color and the feel and finish of the fabric and metal is outstanding. Also, not mentioned in the description is that the fabric is already Scotchguarded. I got rid of all my inferior folding chairs and now I'm confident that my guests will sit in comfort.", 
    "We go to classes where the seats are so uncomfortable they are distracting. These seats help for long days of sitting as they keep your posture in alignment because of the firm foam in the seat. The grey black combo is understated and well made and not slippery like plastic.", 
    "These are the best folding chairs I have ever purchased. The seats are soft, cushioned and firm. The frame structure is sturdy and very strong. The gold colored upholstery is bronze (not gold) but I love it! Beautiful chairs!", 
    "These chairs are sturdy, very comfortable and well made. I ordered the brown frame and gold fabric and the colors blend in perfectly. The fabric is more of a gold/brown with a little black in the print. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I am happy with this purchase. The chairs are comfortable, seems of good quality.", 
    "I bought these chairs to add to my kitchen table when guests come. These chairs are lightweight and sturdy. Good padding makes it comfortable as well.", 
    "These chairs are just what we needed. We are cleaning out the garage and didn't have a place to sit and rest our backs when we needed a little rest. So when we're done they can also be used for extra seating on the back patio during the hoot nanny singalongs!", 
    "The item is exactly as described and is good quality. I had questions regarding the packaging, especially given one of the reviews. I purchased 4 sets (8 total) and the boxes were in very good condition with no tears or punctures. The chairs are exactly what I ordered and what I wanted.", 
    "These chairs are way more comfortable than normal folding chairs! I have a really small apartment and these are a great way to add extra seating when needed.", 
    "If you are looking for \"up-scale\" folding chairs these are the ones. You can sit in this chair all day and be comfortable! Most folding chairs are very uncomfortable. I accutally used them for extra dining chairs for a large family dinner and everyone was real impressed with the quality and comfort of the chairs and they are very good looking, the fabric is \"scotch-guarded\" the chair is nicely padded . I purchased the brown color and it is two-toned looking. I am very pleased with them!", 
    "I ordered these for the boys room so they may sit on something comfortable while playing video games. They are perfect. Comfortable seating and then can be tucked away when needed. Plus affords extra seating at dinner table for company. Not your typical folding chair, the padding provides comfort all the while being stylish.", 
    "Great chairs, color is beautiful and very comfortable padding, especially on back.", 
    "These chairs are really nice. Really nice looking, sturdy and strong. I am really glad I purchased them", 
    "We needed extra seating with all the guests around our Christmas table. These chairs fit the bill perfectly. Not only are they a nice quality, but the extra padding was really comfy. I actually sat on one for the dinner and was surprised at how nice and cushy they weret . The fabric is bronze in color and very attractive. Excellent buy", 
    "After read all the good reviews about this chair, I decided to try. They didn't disappoint me at all. The shipping was supper fast. The chair is even better than I thought. Very good buy from Overstock.", 
    "I purchased these fully-assembled chairs in Sep 2012 and they arrived securely packaged and without being damaged. I must confess there is absolutely nothing negative I can say about my purchase of this 2-pack deal. The sturdy framing, paint coating, and the comfortable seating rate an A+ from me. Among the many chairs I have tested and viewed either at our local stores or online, I am pleased with my choice purchase of these chairs from Overstock. My final decision to purchase this 2-pack deal was not only based on the product details Overstock described but especially for the 2 inches high density seat cushion as well as the cushioned backing of the chairs. This 2-pack deal has become my \u0093back-up of chairs for quests who have expressed how comfortable they when we have used them during the holidays and especially for the upcoming football playoffs and Super Bowl. Thanks O for the 4 choice colors,", 
    "These chairs come in handy. I use them in the diningroom if I need a couple more chairs, or I use them in my sewingroom. They are sturdy and very comfortable..", 
    "My family gave these chairs to my sister for Christmas. She really likes them. She said they are soft to sit on, and don't make noise when opening up the chairs the way some chairs do. She likes the color and fabric. She likes everything about the chairs.", 
    "This is short & to the point...love them! Sturdy, beautiful burgundy, and very comfy for a fold-up chair. Will be buying more in the hear future. Love Overstock.com's products, service, and I tell all of my friends and family to shop with them if they have not already.", 
    "Well made and very comfortable chairs. Well worth the money!", 
    "The cushions are thick and my students like them. The color is rich and the fabric looks good. Time will tell if it holds up. Well made - they are so much nicer than most chairs I looked at.", 
    "Ordered these to use while waiting for my furniture to arrive. They are comfortable and well made. Good choice.", 
    "The chair is a sturdy construction with ample padding. Comfortably seats a 300+ lb person.", 
    "We wanted comfortable, good quality chairs to use with a solid-top game table we made by converting a heavy foosball table ... couldn't have made a better choice, especially for the price ... thanks Overstock!", 
    "Comfortable, well-padded. and very attractive style. I plan to order more.",

    "very happy with the chairs. When used them they looked very good.", 
    "I ordered these right before Thanksgiving as I was having company. They came quickly and were made very well ,as my old ones were falling apart. They are very comfortable and easy to store. The only negative was that I ordered the gray chairs and they looked more like very dark blue. I have ordered several items from overstock and have always been satisfied with the quality and how quickly things arrived.", 
    "I would highly recommend these chairs. They are incredibly sturdy with thick cushioning and are beaufully designed. They also did not break the bank. I highly recommend these chairs!",
