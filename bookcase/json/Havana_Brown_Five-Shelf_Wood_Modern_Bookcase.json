    "I had no idea how amazingly gorgeous and sturdy MDF and particleboard could actually be until I placed all my big and heavy books in this bookcase. I am, in a word, stunned. The craftsmanship of this piece is obviously world-class. The offset shelf dividers creates an interesting spatial energy within the bookcase itself that then permeates throughout my entire living space, even into the kitchen, because before I cook dinner, I usually grab one of my cookbooks from this shelf, and that\u0092s when I remember how amazing this shelf is.", 
    "I was completely pleased with the bookshelf. It arrived on time, in one (heavy) box. Everything was well organized and relatively easy to put together. One note, screwing in the bolts is tricky in some cases due to odd angles. The piece looks great in my house. The color and quality are consistent with the product description. I am considering ordering the smaller shelf of this style as well to add. I would highly recommend.", 
    "My brother works in the furniture industry and when I bought a condo, he warned me about the perils of engineered wood. Certainly the items I saw at IKEA were a testament to the poor quality of these manmade woods, but I loved this book shelf so much I bought it anyway. My brother is coming to visit next week and I can't wait to see what he has to say, hehe :)", 
    "I purchased the president writing desk along with the bookcase, they match perfectly. It seems that the manufacturer is the same for both. Together they make a nice set for any home office. You will definitely need a rubber mallet to put together. My only complaint is that the bookcase does not come with hardware to mount to the wall. The construction is sturdy, however if the bookcase were to fall over it could do some serious damage as it is made out of solid wood.", 
    "When I ordered this bookcase I did not expect it to be as beautiful as it is. Even on picture the look is natural, but in reality you can really notice all the natural combinations of material and color, just as the stable construction. My room looks really great with this case, with all the books, photos and candles on it. I could never imagine one piece can pump up the look of a room this much.", 
    "This is a really nice bookcase. I was hesitant to spend what I consider alot for a bookcase, online. BUT it is really really nice. It took about an hour to put it together. Could have been faster, I just took my time. The piece looks expensive, nice color and is sturdy. I am not sure if the wood is solid or veneer, either way, it feels and looks solid.", 
    "Love this bookcase. It was just what I wanted. I located it in a big room to separate two areas and it looks great. This is s really nice piece of furniture!", 
    "This product looks amazing on the website, but I was a little disappointed when we got it. It is very deceiving, looks much larger than actually is. Partially my fault, I should have measured the dimensions, I tried to approximate. Very easy to put together (we did it in less than 2 hours). Some scratches on the surfaces but since the wood is so dark, we decided to let go. I have had many other purchases from overstock.com which have left me speechless, this does not make the list. Not bad, dont think it is worth the money though. Overall solid piece.. not bad for a kids book case.", 
    "These are great shelves that fit perfectly in the space where we needed them! I wish they were about six inches taller, but the measurements are listed on the description and they are accurate. I got 2 of these shelves to finish off our living/dining/play/all-purpose room!!!", 
    "We bought two shelves. The first one we put together took over one hour. There was a hole not drilled and we needed better tools to work with other than the Allen wrench provided. The 2nd shelve too about 20 minutes with better tools and all the holes were drilled correctly. Love the shelves overall", 
    "I didn't get the full effect, as to how great this bookcase was until I placed my books and pictures in it. The shelf dividers is what makes this bookcase unique, modern and stylish. I had a few friends over for Christmas and they all couldn't stop admiring it. Really great purchase!", 
    "I needed a decent size bookcase and this Havana item was perfect! There is so much shelf room and I love how I can mix and match what kind of books I put on each shelf. It is very modern looking and will fit in with just about any wood finish. Assembly took a little time, but it was not hard to do.", 
    "This is a unique and purposeful bookshelf. There is a lot of space, and a lot of opportunity to fill sections with different decor and books. It is a great piece!", 
    "I just purchased an amazing leather sofa with two matching club chairs and a beautiful oak coffee table. I needed something more and that is when I bumped into this bookcase. It was the perfect addition to the design. It is simple, really massive and great quality. The natural and fresh wood color has a unique feeling and finally I have enough shelves for my books and display option.", 
    "I always choose simple products, mostly furniture as they are the base of the look in my home. This is why I chose this simple bookcase as my living has a Mediterranean and minimalist design, fitting in perfectly in the decor. When I placed all the books, candles and small decorative pieces the shelves got a unique personality and became alive. For such an amazing price I received the best piece I could choose. Thank you.", 
    "The shelf openings are only 9 inches tall, you can't put anything in there really. I wish it would have been adjustable, not much is less than nine inches tall!", 
    "Nice piece of furniture. The box arrived a bit beat up so the styroform was smashed into a zillion pieces on the furniture. The furniture wasn't damaged at all, but it took forever to vacuum up every tiny piece of styroform.", 
    "Got this piece last month, just looks great in the living room, beautiful color and very good quality, does not look like something cheap at all, love it", 
    "The item arrived broken but I was given a full refund. Somebody needs to either pack these a little better or handle them more carefully when shipped. I am happy with the way customer service handled this though so I give them 3 stars.", 
    "Bought one for my son. After easy assembly and quality I ordered a second unit for my office.", 
    "The shelf was relatively easy to assemble and looks very nice. The only problem with it is that it's not terribly stable. The shelves are also not quite tall enough to fit a standard sized hardcover book vertically (except for the top shelf that has a bit more head room).", 
    "Very attractive piece of furniture. I ordered 2, one for each side of my fireplace and they look great. I had to have someone put it together for me so I really don't know how hard that was. But it is very sturdy and makes a nice display for pictures and knickknacks.", 
    "I was looking for something a little different than a standard bookcase. This is it! We ordered two, and one of the shelves was broken. However, Overstock shipped one out very quickly and we are back in business.", 
    "I was well pleased with the quality of the merchandise. It fit in well in my home.", 
    "The only draw back to this shelf is some of it is made out of mdf...but 8I bought the andeman large shelf and they go well in the same room. I am using it as a space separator...it works well and holds alot...I still have plenty of books in storage to place on all shelving.", 
    "Height of shelves would be better if adjustable, but once assembled, the bookcase looks really nice- much more than what I paid for it!", 
    "Very modern looking and fits lots of books. Quality is good.", 
    "The shelf looks nice now that it is assembled but getting there was an experience. The first shelf arrived with damage so I filled out the online replacement request and the new one arrived before the first one was returned which was fortunate because it also arrived damaged. I was able to piece together one good unit between the two sets of parts. There are still some small defects but I tried to put them all on the same side and put that side towards the wall. I may be too demanding but when I purchase something new I expect it to be defect and damage free, it seems to me that more than 50% of the items I purchase from Overstock are either defective or damaged when they arrive. They are, however, very cooperative in replacing the items.", 
    "This is a nice sized bookcase for a bedroom or other smaller space; it is very sturdy and has a classy, understated look. It was fairly easy to assemble, with illustration based instructions, like most furniture of the type these days.", 
    "I just love it! It's so beautiful and the quality is amazing. I want to say this is real solid wood, it's so heavy. Assemble was pretty quick with 2 people. If I need another bookcase, I would definitely buy this again", 
    "I ordered the 5 shelf Havana bookcase, and they accidentally delivered the 3 shelf bookcase instead. I didn't see it was the wrong bookcase until I unpacked it...and as I was unpacking it I saw that 1 middle shelf and the top shelf were badly damaged during shipping.I called Customer Service and organized to get the correct bookcase. They did not ask me to ship the damaged, incorrect bookcase back, so it was still in my garage when the correct bookcase was shipped 5 days later. And a good thing, too! The second delivery was also damaged in shipping! However, I was able to use 2 shelves from the original shipment to replace damaged shelves in the new shipment.Other than the damage (which is caused by the woefully inadequate packaging around the heavy wood elements), I was extremely pleased with the bookcase. Although it is made of MDF (as almost all mass-produced furniture is) it is excellent quality for an MDF product. The holes all line up for easy assembly, the edges are finished well, there are no unsightly gaps, and the veneer is attractive. It is a heavy piece when assembled. I am extremely pleased with it overall.I would recommend that you purchase this bookcase, and assume that it will arrive damaged. Then call Customer Service and get a new shipment sent. That one will probably be damaged too, but you can piece a full bookcase together from the remnants. The packaging is the fault of the overseas manufacturer (I think it is a Malaysian company). Overstock is probably taking a hit on this product because of the customer complaints about damage!", 
    "I meant to order the Andaman bookcase, not this one, and somehow made a mistake when ordering because they look the same. Unfortunately, I had to keep it once it arrived. First of all, be careful because it is not tall. It is less than five feet. Second, there's a lot of particleboard. The piece is heavy and looks nice, but it does wobble from side to side when you move it and there is nothing in it. Be prepared to spend awhile assembling it.", 
    "This bookcase is just what I was looking for. the dividers give this shelf an extra special something. I've had bookshelves in the past where the books would lean and tilt, but these dividers keep everything neat and upright. Assembly was simple, which is great because I am not good with building things. The wood and materials used to make this shelf are durable and good as well.", 
    "These bookcases are not only useful for display and book storage but are the greatest looking decor additions in the room. I ordered two to place them in the room and the look is light and elegant, simple and warm. Short after ordering the pieces arrived and assembly was way easier than I expected.", 
    "Love this bookshelf. It is strong and sturdy. Lots of room. Can hanlde strong heavy books.", 
    "We are very happy with the bookcase. It fits perfectly in the space. The color is great.", 
    "This modern bookcase is the perfect decorative piece for my living. Less is more, and this is really true in case of this piece. It is not overly designed and too sophisticated, it is just simple, useful and really massive. I received a great space where to store my books and a useful display option also. Assembly was way easier than I expected and the result also better than imagined. Beautiful and natural. Top deal.", 
    "This bookcase fit very well into the space that we had planned for it. The case was easy to put together and the directions were clear and simple.", 
    "I needed help putting this shelf together mainly because of the weight of the pieces. It is beautiful and was perfect for the space I ordered it for. I did have one shelf corner a bit broken but once it is loaded with books and my stuff you cannot tell. I love this shelf and would think about ordering another.", 
    "I'm using this as a bookcase, display case for some decor pieces, and a room divider in my studio apartment. It's much more my style than the open bookcases I've seen at Ikea and the shelves that don't line up? Brilliant. It's beautiful!", 
    "I purchased one of these last week and it was just delivered today! Talk about quick service. Anyway, I'm here to buy a second one (the free shipping is great). This shelf is like a piece of art with the offset shelf dividers!", 
    "The description of the item and and the price were very good, as I had been shopping for this item for quite some time. The shipping time was very quick. Unfortunately, the carrier had issues with the delivery (I am not sure why) and ended up delivering a day after it was scheduled. The shipping box was barely intact and there were scratches and chips in the finish of the bookshelf and one piece was broken, which I was able to repair. I would have returned it, but it was such a large item, I did not feel it would not be worth the trouble.", 
    "I ordered this beautiful and exotic Havana bookcase for my husband into his office. He loves simple and elegant pieces and this small and beautiful colored bookcase was the perfect addition. It is large enough for his most important books and even decorative elements. The case arrived in the most perfect time and great quality. Adorable piece.", 
    "I finally finished developing my study room and needed something for my book collection, but not too big. This Havana bookcase was the perfect option. I really like the color and the simplicity of it. The books are fitting greatly on the shelves and I can place some decorative elements too. Great deal.", 
    "It looks beautiful in our arts and crafts house. It's a great value for its beauty and utility. Its only drawback is that the shelf height is not adjustable.", 
    "I love Havana furniture and Overstock. I love this type of design as it is really simple, classic and great looking. After assembling the pieces I received a massive and highly functional bookshelf for my novels and science books and a beautiful addition to the room decor. Thanks.", 
    "We purchased this product to house large medical textbooks. Based on the photo, which shows the bookshelf housing big books, we thought it would be suitable. However, we cannot place our books standing vertically. The shelf heights are not adjustable. No instructions were included, which made assembly difficult because of the different sizes of panels and screws. We tried to return it, but the cost of return was very high so we are making do with this product.", 
    "The picture on Overstock made the bookshelves look way larger than they actually are. For the price, this has left us feeling like we were taken advantage of."
