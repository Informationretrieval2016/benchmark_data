    "I paid a LOT of money for this sideboard but it was well worth it. Such a beautiful piece! And it was packaged with total care so nothing was damaged. The color is a little deceiving...it turned out to be a little more greyish blue than blue but it still worked well.", 
    "great color with a hint of blue. rich, heavy and an eye catcher. looks very expensive! lots of compliments on this piece."
