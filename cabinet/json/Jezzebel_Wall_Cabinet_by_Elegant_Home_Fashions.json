    "When I opened up the box, the toxic fumes filled my house. My dog had an asthma attack...I had to close the bathroom door overnight to keep the air breathable. I don't know what it is, the glass or the paint. I hope it will go away over time. Also, do NOT use the convenient little 'template' they provide. After putting the entire cabinet together, I used it without questioning that it could be off, and drilled anchors in the wall. It was off by about an inch! Had to make 4 holes instead of two.", 
    "All of this will seem obvious, but here are some things I didn't think about before ordering and assembling this cabinet: 1) Note the measurements and see if it'll work for your space. It was actually smaller than I thought it was going to be (but I never even looked at how big it was in the description). 2) The glass in the cabinet is see-through. Again, super obvious, but I got caught up in \"ooh, unique pretty cabinet\" without thinking about what I was going to use it for. It's going in the bathroom to hold toilet paper and other bathroom-related supplies. Things you generally don't want to put on display. 3) The middle panes are really, really \"blingy,\" almost like they're made of rhinestones. Looks a little cheap, not so classy, unfortunately.", 
    "This is great little cabinet. It was very good quality and went together very easily. i especially liked the crackle mirror and the chrome hardware. It really sets off the bright gloss white finish. It has one adjustable shelf inside. It came with a mounting template and hardware which is very handy. I would highly recommend this cabinet.", 
    "IT looks very nice in my bathroom. However, the quality seems cheap if you look closely and when you open it. if you look far away, it looks very pretty. but for this price, i think it is ok.", 
    "This wall cabinet was perfect for our bathroom. It is deeper than a regular medicine cabinet, so we were able to fit more in it. The style of is nicer than a medicine cabinet as well - very stylish looking! The quality of it is very good; it is very sturdy. The only thing that I didn't expect was for it to require full assembly, but my husband said it wasn't hard to put together. We were very happy with both the price and quality of this cabinet, and we will use it for many years to come!", 
    "Cabinet arrived earlier than expected! Several pieces to put together but not hard at all. Was pleasantly surprised with how well it looked after putting together...sturdy. Easy to assemble and hang. Good value for price!", 
    "Nice addition to my bathroom, looks good and gives needed storage.", 
    "This is a great wall cabinet for my bath and I have already recommended it to my friends. You cannot beat it for the price and it looks much more attractive in person! Gorgeous. I have shopped around and this is the best cabinet this size for the price! Great deal!", 
    "The cabinet arrived in a timely manner. It was easy to assemble. The broken mirror in the doors reflect the paint color in the room making the doors match the paint color. It is a very neat cabinet to use for extra storage for small items. You can even use the bottom shelf for extra decorations in the room.", 
    "love this cabinet! very easy to assemble and looks great in my bathroom! has lots of storage inside and the extra shelf is nice to display decorative pieces. cabinet is exactly as pictured and reasonably priced!", 
    "First of all, there is a very strong chemical smell once you open the box. If you can stand it, it is very easy to assemble, although I didn't use the glue included in the package. The doors didn't quite line up with each other and the glass was scored on one of the doors, most likely from the mosaic process. The final thing would be the adjustable shelf - it was a bit too narrow and it tends to move around a bit. I placed it on my insanely long bathroom counter top instead of mounting it so I didn't use the mounting template. With all that being said, it's a good-looking cabinet. The scored glass doesn't bother me all that much and it makes a nice addition to my bathroom. I am thinking about getting another one to actually mount on the wall.", 
    "Strong odor upon opening. Let it air out for a couple of weeks and then it is gorgeous!", 
    "It's like jewelry for the bathroom. I love it.", 
    "Cabinet is easy to put together. Fit perfectly in master bathroom where we needed extra space to store bathroom soaps and lotions.", 
    "Looks great and functional", 
    "Looks great and is very spacious.", 
    "Again a little stinky but overall a great cabinet.", 
    "worked well for small items in bathroom", 
    "I got this for my mom for gift and it is beautiful. She loves it", 
    "So stylish, love it in our small powder room.", 
    "This cabinet is attractive and fits perfectly in a smaller bathroom to store amenities and look good.", 
    "This is a situation where I imagined it looking differently. The broken glass looks a little too crazy in person. I had solid mirrors cut to size to glue over it. Made fine, though.", 
    "Easy to assemble, looks great. Was a perfect solution for the spot.", 
    "These cabinets are absolutely awesome!", 
    "Cabinet was received quickly. Looks great on the wall. Glass doors give it some pizazz!!", 
    "I really liked this, but I put it together and my tiles were to high for it. I can't drill thru my tile. Had no problems putting it together everything went together smoothly. The holes to attach it to the wall are on the Lower open shelf. It they were on the top I would have been able to use this.", 
    "It's a good looking cabinet, but it's not deep enough to hold folded bath towels! I failed to check the depth. I'll just have to use it for other items.", 
    "It was hard to put together because the pre drill holes didn't line up but i drilled the holes and now the hinges fit ! The price was fair !", 
    "This cabinet fits in very well with my bathroom. The cabinet is made with quality and looks more expensive then it is. Did not have a problem putting it together, although the number of pieces did look scary.", 
    "Had alignment issues with the doors but finally got them to line up pretty well. Am not very confident in the mounting system but we aren't putting anything very heavy in it so I will probably be fine.", 
    "Easy to follow instructions; glue and assembly products were well marked; easy to install on wall. Packaging in container was outstanding with lots of foam and cardboard.", 
    "Very distinctive and charming.", 
    "Love this item. Bought 3. They look so nice and a great update if you are on a budget.", 
    "It is a bit flimsy, but this is a very stylish cabinet. It looks nice and serves its purpose. It is a wonderful space saver in my small bathroom.", 
    "I really love this cabinet and when my daughter saw it, she loved it and plans to order one for herself. It is very pretty with the cracked glass doors...;and of course, adds some storage for small items...love it and thinking of getting another for my other bathroom.", 
    "Was just what I expected. Fit just right in my small bathroom. Instructions were easy. Good Quality cabinet. The silver part of windows looks kind of cheesy, but overall looks good.", 
    "Just right, big enough but not to far out from wall!", 
    "Unique-looking cabinet with bling but not too showy. Easy to install dresses up the room. Great buy!", 
    "Cabinet was a perfect selection for my downstairs bathroom", 
    "Great item easy to assemble", 
    "We remodeled our Bathroom and needed something on the wall for extra storage. This matched our cabinets and is very pretty in the BR. Relatively easy to put together, although the 1st order, we were sent the wrong cabinet, but Overstock is easy to deal with and they rectified everything in short order!", 
    "Works great in a small bathroom. Gives extra storage and the mosaic glass nicely hides what's inside.", 
    "This cabinet was perfect in our master bathroom. Excellent quality.", 
    "I may attach some white tissue paper behind the glass to make it appear to be opaque. People, this is a bathroom cabinet...women's items tend to have a lot of different colors...sandblast the glass! Other than that, love it. I have a very \"glam\" bathroom and this fits right in. Aside from the clear glass doors, the only other drawback is that it is a little shallow for many things. Yes, a toilet paper roll will fit on the bottom shelf, but it won't fit inside the cabinet. I'm very happy with this and I may even buy one for my daughter's bathroom.", 
    "Love this cabinet for a guest bath", 
    "Mostly good quality. Only draw back is flimsy stickers must be used to cover exposed hardware. You think the manufacture could have done a little better on this. Knowing good and well \"stickers\" are not going to last on a bathroom cabinet after exposure to steam and weekly cleaning.", 
    "Holes were incorrectly drilled. My husband is a General Contractor and had to redo the holes and fix this cabinet. Per phone conversation, I received a defected cabinet. I was going to return but thanks to my husband he had to fix it and took sometime to do this.", 
    "Not very deep, but looks nice on the wall.", 
    "I love this cabinet in my bathroom", 
    "Fits the space well and looks good. Wish the mosaic design on the doors wasn't so shiny. Looks a little cheap. In the pictures the mosaic looked more muted and even a little gray in color. Would have preferred that. On the good side I paid about half of what it would have cost online at Home Depot", 
    "This is such a cute cabinet, however the already drill marks for the doors were not lined correctly so doors are a little crooked.", 
    "shiny stuff on doors looks cheesy", 
    "This is perfect for our bathroom and construction is good.", 
    "Great deal! Good quality and sturdy", 
    "My husband put it together without difficulty. Looks a little fancier than other over the toilet cabinets with the multi panes and crackled glass inset. Would rate this 5 stars but it came scratched on the top and I HATE to receive damaged goods. We kept it because the top is not going to show at the height we're installing it.", 
    "I loved the windows! It added a nice sparkle to the bathroom but wasnt overwhelming", 
    "This cabinet is much nicer than it looks in the photos! It was very easy to put together, with simple directions. It is very solid. I would recommend it.", 
    "easy to put together, looks good", 
    "This cabinet adds a great look to our bathroom", 
    "I love this cabinet. The smell of the paint was a little strong fresh out of the package, but it cleared up after a bit. Installation was easy and I've had it up for 2 years now. It gets a lot of use, the doors are still sturdy and the paint doesn't chip. Overall it's a great buy", 
    "Great addition to add a little sparkle to a bathroom. Provides nice storage while adding a tasteful flare.", 
    "Installed this cabinet over a toilet. Deep enough for shampoo bottles without hanging to far over the toilet so no one bumps their head. Glass door are nice, and bottom shelf handy. Nice looking. Solid build. Just what I needed.", 
    "Love it looks great in the room, lots of room inside and especially like the decor on the doors very satisfied with the product.", 
    "Not your typical storage piece for the bathroom. The mosaic inserts glimmer and make it a real \"standout\". Very well constructed and easy to assemble and hang.", 
    "Great item and well build. Perfect for over the toilet cabinet or a medicine cabinet. I love mine.", 
    "I loved this! Unfortunately the matching bottom did not fit in my space so had to return them. FYI it is only as deep as a medicine cabinet.", 
    "This wall cabinet is nicer than I thought it would be due to the price. I figured it would be flimsy, but it isn't. Went together easily and looks great! I would recommend it.", 
    "This cabinet made the bathroom look more finished and added storage for many items that were on the sink. We had no problems assembling this, all the parts were clearly marked . It was easy to mount on the wall. The size was perfect for our needs and the price was very reasonable.", 
    "I bought this for the Master Bath. My husband put it together. Went together quickly and also had a template for placement on the wall. It's been a big help with storage. Very attractive and would definitely recommend.", 
    "Easy to put together and good quality/nice piece", 
    "Assembly was straight forward. Mounting requires 2 people or a jack stand. Not \"top shelf\" but very good.", 
    "This cabinet is perfect size for the bathroom.", 
    "This fits right in, is just what was needed in the space. Great price.", 
    "This is the second unit that we have purchased recently, the first one was in the espresso finish and we were so pleased we ordered it in white for our other bathroom. Can't really say enough good about it, at this price point it can't be beat. Comes well packaged and the assembly is easy, just be careful when you screw the connecting studs into the side walls, it's easy to screw them in too far. Finish is excellent, everything fits really nice and the door with the glass mosaic is very attractive. Template is included which makes it very easy to mount.", 
    "cabinet works well, especially considered the price I paid. hanging requires exact following of diagram which I think was ever so slightly off, directions could have been a bit more clear in a spot, but nothing was a big deal. once it was up and level it's been great.", 
    "Beautiful, high quality wall cabinet. It arrived quickly, was easy to assemble, and looks awesome in my new bathroom. The pebbled and beveled glass doors are very pretty. I also bought the matching floor cabinet and placed it under this one. Great set!", 
    "Cabinet was prettier than it looked on the web site and we are now only wishing that there were a narrow floor model of the same design for another space that we have. It was fairly easy to assemble and all parts were labeled and included. It did help to have a second pair of hands when putting on the door and when hanging the unit on the wall", 
    "The house we just bought didn't have enough storage in the basement suite bathroom so this was perfect. I bought Crystal handles from Home Depot to finish the look! Good Buy", 
    "About the cutest little cabinet you ever did see. However, be careful with the glue and dowels. The holes are very tight, and with too much glue in the hole, the dowels can hydrolock when tapping them in and blow out large areas of material on the opposite side.", 
    "Cabinet was easy to assemble, easy to follow. directions Just enough sparkle without being gaudy. Nicer than similar items found in home improvement stores and at a more reasonable price.", 
    "Cabinet is perfect size as we were working with only 7\" of clearance. Cabinet was easy to assemble & is very attractive.Good value for the price.", 
    "For the price I felt the quality was exceptional and first rate; solid wood not fabricated in some way or other. The assembly instructions were extremely easy to understand; and since my stroke; that is important for things to be simple and easily understood. The shipment time; even by regular shipment was considerably quick compared to others I've dealt with. Everything was truly outstanding compared to almost any other company; I highly recommend overstock. com and their products; at least this particular cabinet. If this is representative of their other products; you can't go wrong.", 
    "Product assembles in aproximately 30 minutes. Description is accurate and beats anything you can buy at ****** or *** without paying quadruple the price. Shipping was quick and the product was packed well to prevent damage. The item looks very expensive when assembed and can decieve most and appear as a higher end product.", 
    "We bought this at the last minute for our final piece for bathroom remodel. This is a solid wood cabinet and well worth the value. The only complaint is there were some scratches on the inside of doors and very top corner, very unnoticeable. This was very easy to put together and hang. It's a gorgeous addition to our bath.", 
    "The bathroom cabinet is just what I wanted but I did not reallize that I would have to put it together.", 
    "Definitely a product that I was overwhelmingly happy with. The building process was simple and easy, probably got it done within half an hour, tops - I kept putting the doors on upside down (double check where the magnet is on the piece and the doors). Very very happy. My only concern is that this piece is solid and it comes with two basic screws and anchors to screw to the wall, I hope it holds!", 
    "I ended up loving this cabinet for added storage space in my master bathroom. The quality is good, it looks beautiful and feels sturdy. I ordered two different bathroom cabinets and based on online pictures and reviews I had thought I would like the other cabinet more, but this is actually my favorite. I would order it again and it looks great.", 
    "Read reviews and made this purchase. It's been almost 2yrs and this cabinet still looking new, it's in upstairs bedroom so ventilation comes from bathroom door being open and small window. Chose because crackle/stain glass doesn't make all my things inside so obvious, items don't have to look so organized or like accent pieces. Love this cabinet very nice d\u00e9cor piece.", 
    "This is a beautful asset to my bathroom. I am please with the purchase. It is stylish and elegant.", 
    "This is a very sturdy, spacious, and elegant cabinet. It is a bit on the heavy side because it is made from good material, which is why it is so sturdy. It is extremely easy to put together. All parts came labeled and separately packaged for easy assembly. Since it is a bit heavy, my husband had to help me attach it onto the wall. I absolutely love this purchase.", 
    "This is a beautiful wall cabinet! More than impressed!", 
    "This is a great lil medicine cabinet for a small bathroom. Very well made and the cracked glass gives it a nice touch..Plenty of space to store necessities.", 
    "We probably have the world's smallest master bathroom and this attractive, nicely made cabinet added some much needed storage space . We mounted it above the towel rack beside the shower and it looks great without being in the way.", 
    "The cabinet was just as described and pictured. Very easy to assemble. We love it!", 
    "It went together very well and looks great. Paid more money for another on but this one looks much better and cost less.", 
    "Nice cabinet. Went together easily and quick too! Much nicer than what I had and looks great in my bathroom.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for a bath remodel because the matching wall cabinet for my chosen vanity was out of stock. After looking at many, many options, I found this one on overstock for far less than any others I was considering, and decided to take a chance on it based on reviews. We received it quickly; it was packaged well and all parts were in the box. My husband easily put it together in a half hour or so, and it fit together nicely. It does not look like one you put together yourself. We purchased some different pulls for it and our vanity and they complement each other well. We have not yet mounted it but don't anticipate problems. There are two pre-drilled holes that will probably not line up with studs, but we can also drill another one through the back of the cabinet wherever we find a stud if needed. This cabinet was less than 1/3 the cost of the matching cabinet, so I consider myself very lucky to have found it!", 
    "Received in a timely matter, everything lined up perfectly for an easy installation. Was afraid the bling of the mozaic tile would be too much but it is what makes the cabinet so attractive. Wish mozaic could of been done on back (when you open doors) but still extremely happy with the purchase price, quality and its look. I have a small bathroom with a pedestal sink and a small medicine cabinet so this cabinet is spacious enough for my girly things at arms reach to avoid getting a base cabinet. So glad I purchased.", 
    "Love it! It was easy to put together (although my husband can do anything) and looks great. Some said it is small, but it's plenty big enough for me and would be too big over the commode if any bigger. Susie", 
    "Really like this little wall cabinet it is made very well, and was packaged very carefully. All of the pieces were there and the holes drilled in the right places. My husband didn't even say a swear word Installed in my bathroom for perfume bottles, bubble bath, etc. ! I love the little mirrored panel, just a little bling but not gaudy.", 
    "Really cute cabinet . Good value for the look and price.", 
    "Love this cabinet! Goes great in our newly renovated tiny master bathroom. I love the mirror mosaic. The wood material is sturdy and of good quality. The doors are sturdy as well. I was very pleased that the backing was not super thin like cabinets I have purchased in the past. There were a few dirty smudges on the white finish, but they cleaned off easily. The assembly was super easy and there is plenty of storage inside the cabinet. Very pleased!!!", 
    "I have nothing negative to report about this cabinet. Everything went together perfectly without any snags. (Not like the other cabinet I bought for my 1/2 bath-what a nightmare!). It fits securely on the wall and looks great! Price was right too!", 
    "Nice looking storage unit for half bath. Crinkle glass in doors was a plus.", 
    "It was pretty ease to put together. the wall mount were not that good. But over all very nice I love it.", 
    "This shabby chic looking cabinet is a great value. The cabinet was easy to install and looks fabulous. I have gotten many compliments on the cabinet. It was perfect for my bathroom. Highly recommended.", 
    "Upon arrival I found the cabinet to be packaged properly, easy to assemble, and I am very pleased... it exceeded my expectations for such a low price.", 
    "Its very pretty will look good where ever I put it.", 
    "I'm sure it is very pretty if you can figure out how to put it together! Impossible! No written instructions. just a bag of screws/nails and parts labeled A, B, C, D??? A shame, but sent it back.", 
    "Solid piecework; very attractive and rich looking. The windows are unique and a talking point for sure. I love everything about this purchase. My husband did have to put it together, but he said it was very simple . . . and all the parts were there!", 
    "I have been looking for a bathroom wall cabinet for some time now.. I just happened to look on overstock and found exactly what I was looking for. The item looks perfect in my bathroom.", 
    "Don't get put off by the smell comments, this is no better or worse than anything else of its kind. The style is beautiful, it is a bit petite so if you are looking for a huge space to stash your stuff it wont work but it is precious and unique", 
    "I ordered this for updating my bathroom. It arrived in 4 days and was all I expected. Thi instrutions were excellent and it was constructed in less than a half hour. I was very pleased. It looks grest.", 
    "I hung this in our bathroom over the tank. It looks beautiful and complements the decor nicely. I found it easy to put together and the included template made it easy to hang, however hanging is a 2 person job. I predrilled an extra hole to secure into a stud, since it is a bit heavy with it filled. The mosaic mirror insert adds a bit of bling and compliments the polished chrome fixtures in the bath. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a classy looking cabinet!", 
    "I bought this cabinet for my bathroom, assembly was easy and fun:) I opened the box and left it seat over night in the garage to let the paint smell go away and next day just follow instruction and put it together in 30 min. Good quality and nice design.", 
    "The cabinet is very pretty and holds a lot of items that we needed to store in the bathroom. Thank you for making a great cabinet!", 
    "PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THE GOOD LOOKS AND QUALITY OF THIS BATHROOM CABINET. IT BRINGS A BIT OF \"BLING\" TO THE BATHROOM AND HAS PLENTY OF STORAGE SPACE.", 
    "We also bought the floor cabinet of this and like it also. Was easy to put together, probably because we'd done the other one, but seems pretty sturdy. The only problem was the magnets that hold the doors close, as the screws stripped out so had to put longer ones in. We put this above the floor cabinet, probably 18\" to 20\" above it and looks very nice.", 
    "This item comes in handy with my recent move. It provides with just that much more cabinet space for a lot of my small items. It was easy to put together and hang. I get compliments on the door design.", 
    "Very nice. Only has 2 mounting holes. needed to drill 2 more on the bottom to attach it properly to the wall. unfortunately there isn't a solid piece of wood along the bottom so I had to improvise. luckily two of the holes hit a stud in the wall because there's no way this cabinet will hang for any period of time with the two sheetrock anchors provided. other than this design error a good quality cabinet.", 
    "My fault did not measure it before buying it. More like a medicine cabinet in size - bottom shelf is more for decorative small items - wanted to keep my hairdryer there, but the shelf is too small, the hairdrier does not fit. but otherwise looks great - came in a good condition, easy to assemble - may be 30-40 min. The glass looks gorgeous - makes this cabinet look great in a modern bathroom. Would not recommend it just because it's too small.", 
    "I had been look for a free standing cabinet for a while. The quality:price ratio was spot on. It's been in my bathroom for several months and I am pleased as punch. Similar items that I found in Home Goods or Ross cost more and some idiot damaged it. This had the exact dimensions I wanted.", 
    "This wall cabinet added just the right amount of pizazz above the toilet; I wasn't sure I'd like the sparkle of the broken-up glass panel, but it looks great, especially against a colored wall. The depth was perfect: deeper than a standard medicine cabinet & yet not be in the way of anyone using the commode below it. One of the joints on the door panel was poorly done, but thanks to Overstock's awesome customer service, they found a replacement & quickly shipped it to me.", 
    "Nice small cabinet. Fit my space well. Not a ton of storage, decorative with some storage. Assembly was easy and it was easy to hang. Don't use the small screws they provide to hang it on the wall. Use more support.", 
    "I jsut love this cabinet, good qualtiy and it looks beautiful in my newly remodeled bathroom. I bought the white cabinet, just did not know if the dark one would match my espresso colored vanity, glad I did, the white stands out more.", 
    "This cabinet was a perfect match for our small bathroom and it fit nicely over the toilet tank. It was also very easy to assemble.", 
    "Remodeled our son's bathroom. This cabinet was the perfect match. Storage is everything, and this cabinet fits the bill. The sleek silver inlay is beautiful, and will match all the brushed nickel items in the room. Great price too!", 
    "This cabinet is even more gorgeous in person than it shows on the computer. The glass doors are absolutely beautiful and there is more than enough storage inside the cabinet than you will believe. Don't hesitate to buy this cabinet. You will not be disappointed in the look, the durability or the performance.", 
    "Easy to put together and very nice for the price. Would recommend this unit. I bought 2", 
    "When the cabinet arrived, the glass in one of the doors was broken. I called, it was replaced in just a few days. Don't know how it happened because it was packaged extremely well.", 
    "I love my cabinet it was exactly what i was looking for.", 
    "Doors do not align and are not adjustable. Concerned over the long term. Fortunately this is used in a guest room with minimal use so it should hold up ok. The cabinet is not valued at close to the list price showing on the website. It does look nice as it's small size was the selling point for me.", 
    "Nothing wrong with the product, dimensions, usability, color, etc...only con was that the glass portion of one cabinet door arrived cracked. I decided not to return the cabinet despite the cosmetic imperfection.", 
    "I was concerned about the odor other customers reported, but there was only minimal scent in the box. Cabinet itself did not have an odor. Good quality for a good the price. Was more expensive o other sites. Very easy to put together for a woman. Easy to follow directions. Just needed assistance to hang on wall because of the weight. Looks great!.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet because it matched the craftsman style cabinets already in my 107 year old home that I was remolding and I wanted to keep the old charm in it. I added a glaze over the white to make it look like the other woodwork and even glazed over the cut mirrored door to make it look old and not so silver; added a bronze knob and it looks like it was always in the home.", 
    "I was looking for a small white cabinet for the bathroom to use exclusively for my colognes and perfumes. I selected this one because I liked the \"glamour girl\" look of the doors and also because the cabinet was not as deep as some of the others. This works out perfectly and looks classy.", 
    "Love it, so glad i bought it! Husband put it up in less than an hour. It fits a lot, and looks fab in my bathroom:-)", 
    "the cabinet came in many pieces with complete and easy instructions to assemble. completed it looks like a quality piece of furniture. I like it.", 
    "I purchased this item for a medical office. It was easy to install and seems sturdy enough to hold many supplies. I enjoy having the open lower shelf available for items that are used often or that need to be accessed quickly. My only negative is that the shelves aren't very deep, so it limits the items I can store there. My fault, though, since I overlooked that detail when ordering. Otherwise, it is a lovely addition to the room and would work very well in a home setting.", 
    "Love this for my Bathroom to put all my products in it is heavy duty well constructed. And pretty at the same time", 
    "I bought this cabinet for the space above my toilet. I need extra storage and have a grey theme through out the whole house and thought the silver in the doors would match perfectly, and it does! I love it, I love the sparkle with the crisp white. Found this exact cabinet at Target and Wal-Mart for $40+ more! Great deal on overstock!!", 
    "This cabinet ended up being nicer than expected. I was planning on spending around $300 for a good wall cabinet, but decided that this one would be worth a shot. I am very happy with the purchase. The mosaic in the middle of the glass is an elegant touch. The shelves easily hold toilet paper and extra hand towels. Assembly was easy- put it together in about 30min.", 
    "DH just installed this last night, and overall we like it very much. The cons: DH says the template is not accurate. It was off by about 3 mm. He measured and 'corrected' the template bf hanging. The doors don't line up perfectly. He was able to adjust it and I wouldn't have noticed it if he hadn't pointed it out. The pros: It's well made, and DH says quick and fairly straightforward assembly. Looks v nice. The \"crackled mirror\" effect is lovely. Nicer than a solid door, and a glass door would be a bit too revealing of the assortment inside. For the price, it was a great find! Holds quite a lot! Fits very well over the toilet. The packaging: The box came with a corner ripped off, but since the cabinet itself was encased in styrofoam, no damage.", 
    "This is a nice, sturdy, well finished cabinet. We are very pleased.", 
    "I was totally pleased with the cabinet, but as I was remodeling my back bathroom, I thought to personalize it some. I had tiles that I had used throughout the room cut to fit the silver panels. I glued them into the rectangles and grouted. Beautiful and so unique!!!! Love it.", 
    "This is a nice little cabinet and looks good in the bathroom while giving me someplace to stick extra toilet paper, tissues, etc. We just hung it from the drywall, but have light stuff in it and it seems fine. The \"broken mirror\" panels are a little hard to picture, but they look nice. The little shelf at the bottom is good for displaying a few knick-knacks. The shelves inside are adjustable to different heights. A nice little cabinet for the price.", 
    "We saw this same cabinet on many sites but no one had a better price. Take that with a 10% coupon I had and the cheap shipping this deal was hard to beat.", 
    "Needed an over the toilet cabinet, this one is great. Was a little disappointed when I realized it had to be assembled, but had great directions and was extrememly easy to put together.", 
    "This was a bit of a challenge to assemble but very attractive when hung.", 
    "It looked pretty on the site and at a reasonable price, so I bought one figuring I could return it if it didnt work out. It looked great, was good quality at an affordable price. It's hanging over the toilet in my bathroom and it looks really nice.", 
    "I decided to match the Jezzebel floor cabinet I had recently purchased from Overstock.com and the Jezzebel wall cabinet was a perfect match. The instructions were clear & easy to follow. All the parts were there & clearly marked. It is a lovely addition to my bathroom decor.", 
    "When I opened the box I immediately notice the infamous odor of some items made in China. Must be something in their factories or something in the paint. I thought maybe the odor will go away after airing out. NOT A CHANCE! I tried spraying cleaners on it, baking it in the sun etc. I finally gave up and it's sitting in the garage. I bought one from Home Depot to replace it.", 
    "Very please with my bathroom cabinet. It is designed for the wall but I set it between the 2 sinks in our master bath because I needed the storage space there instead of the wall. Worked perfectly for me. Counter looks neater and less cluttered.", 
    "product was easy to assemble took only 15 minutes,. All parts in box, nothing broken or damaged. That is always a win to me when receiving assemble your own type furniture.", 
    "This is a very nice looking cabinet...the only reason I didn't rate it excellent is because of the odor...it must be something they spray on it when it comes from China...I'm not sure but the odor is very strong and lasted about a month. So if you can deal with the smell it's a great looking cabinet...just make sure you leave the cabinet doors open when airing it out.", 
    "Cabinet is prettier in person than in the pictures. Assembly was pretty easy although the directions were a bit vague. The depth is perfect for over a toilet so it doesn't stick out. If you intend to put a towel rack underneath but over a toilet, you'll have to mount this very high on the wall. Anticipate that a towel rack would be elsewhere in the room. The shelf is adjustable but if you put in the middle and have a tall can of hairspray, it won't fit but is perfect for all other toiletries while providing privacy to the contents. Mounting was a bit tricky but if you have the right tools (level) and a little patience, it mounts very nicely."
