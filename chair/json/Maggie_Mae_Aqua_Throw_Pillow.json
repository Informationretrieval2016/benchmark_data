    "I ordered two pillows for my couch. I have a rust colored couch with smokey blue curtains. These pillows match PERFECTLY! I love them. And love that they are made in the USA!", 
    "Love this pillow! The colors & pattern are beautiful and go w/a wide variety of styles & d\u00e9cor colors. What I really love is that the pattern & colors are woven in, not just printed on - makes the pillows richer looking & better quality. They are well made & very comfortable, great price & quick delivery. I ordered two for my couch & they look awesome!", 
    "Beautiful pillows that use quality fabric, very happy.", 
    "The colors in this pillow are true to the picture. A beautiful combination of colors, and the pattern is fun. They are perfect to brighten up a room. Very happy with my purchase!", 
    "While these weren't quite what I was looking for, they are exactly as promised. The colors of the pillow were a bit off from the pictures, which I know isn't uncommon with online purchases. Overall a good product.", 
    "as pictured, good quality fabric", 
    "Can't find anything wrong with this, tightly sewn together and looks exactly as the photo on the site. Good quality accent pillow.", 
    "Colorful & fun- just what I wanted!", 
    "Decent quality and colors", 
    "Love it! Matches perfectly!", 
    "These pillows are absolutely gorgeous! Terrific quality and detail.", 
    "These pillows in 16.5 really added even more life to my aqua/teal sofa that I also recently purchased on Overstock. It really brought my whole living room rustic theme together. I bought two and used my own rectangular pillow for the middle of couch. Ultimately, the colors and pattern are so nice. Not too bold but bold enough to make a perfect difference. Highly recommend!", 
    "Full and colorful. A great pillow for the price!", 
    "soft and great colors- perfect couch pillows", 
    "It's nice - actually a bit overstuffed but works fine for a decorative pillow on a bed. The orange is more of a burnt orange (vs. bright orange or coral). I was hoping for more of a coral color but it works.", 
    "Cute and good quality. Matches my teal chair.", 
    "This Maggie May pillow is well made and I love the colors for decorating. The colors are just as you see them on the computer I wanted to pop the Aqua color in my living room and the this pillow did the job!Thanks overstock. I even bought another one but smaller size\ud83d\ude0a", 
    "Too bad, can't use, my mistake but very nice pillows", 
    "Beautiful fabric, color, and great stuffing!", 
    "Cute pattern but smaller than expected.", 
    "We redid our entire bedroom with this little pillow as the focal point in the hue of colors that we used to make our bedroom pop and is sure did the trick. The quality is outstanding."
