  "reviews": [
    "I am happy with purchase especially with the price. It wasn't too complicated to put together (but putting the doors does take time and patience). I am 30 years old and I love it in my room. It's truly a beautiful piece. Once it is put together, it's definitely nice and sturdy. I recommend it and would purchase more from this set.", 
    "Once I completed assembling this cabinet, I really like it, but it took about 4 hours to put together, and I was quite frustrated after having to break it down and re-assembling. Would have really appreciated more than just pictoral directions.", 
    "I was able to put this together for the most part myself in a couple of hours. It's a sturdy attractive cabinet.", 
    "I love this piece! It is so unique and provides great storage for small spaces! It was very difficult to put together and one of my doors have come off and no way to reattach! Take time to put it together correctly. It is a fun piece!", 
    "Absolutely love the cabinets. We are using them as night stands. While not traditional and a little oversized, they will store a ton and are in a big master so they look great! Took a while to out together but well worth it. Just love them!", 
    "Heavy and a little difficult to assemble. One of the handles doesn't have the correct screws so we have to but new ones.", 
    "I love the look of this cabinet and receive many compliments. However, putting it together was a pain and one of the doors refuse to go on completely and I can't adjust it unless I take down the whole cabinet. So, just be cautious when putting it together!", 
    "It took some effort and time to assemble but worth it cause I love the colors of the doors. Only issue is it's not made of high quality: the doors do not fit in perfectly with the opening, some may need a lot of effort to squeeze in.", 
    "Be aware the doors are not interchangeable like you might think. Once they're hinged into the cabinet they are NOT removable. This piece came in perfect condition except for one of the doors. But Overstock took care of the situation promptly and completely.If you're looking for a unique solution to storage needs, this is a winner!", 
    "This was a Great product!! Fast shipping!! Will use them again", 
    "Had a glitch with a crack in one of the wood pieces and called about it to see if it could be replaced. It was not in stock and I was told I could order and wait for it to come from overseas........something like 6 weeks. As I didn't want to wait that long, we went ahead and put it together with the cracked piece. It hasn't been a big deal; not really noticed and not in a spot to affect the stability of the piece.", 
    "Great looking, perfect size and unique doors that swing open. This is a really nice piece with a very reasonable cost! My daughter loves it and has it in her bedroom."
