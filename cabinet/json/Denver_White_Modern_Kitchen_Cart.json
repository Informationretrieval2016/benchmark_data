    "This kitchen cart looks just as depicted when assembled, and by all appearances is a quality piece of furniture. However, there were three major flaws in fabrication that are unforgivable for a piece that costs this much. First, the back panel is not sized correctly; when assembled, there is about a half-inch gap between the top of the panel and the top of the cart. This is not terrible since the gap is in the back of the cart and is only visible when the door is opened. Second, the magnetic bar is not actually attracted to the magnetic catch, but this can be addressed by replacing the bar with a 2\" zinc mending brace that can be purchased at a hardware store. The third and most serious flaw is that the drawer runners were pre-installed incorrectly so that they were not aligned with each other and therefore the drawer did not close properly. I was able to detach the drawer runner, drill new holes for screws at a distance of 7/8\" from the original holes, and re-install it so that the drawer closed, but since the cart was already mostly assembled by the time I noticed this problem, it was quite a hassle. Now that the cart is assembled, it looks good, but I don't think the price is justified for a product that is this poorly fabricated.", 
    "First, I have to admit I was shocked at the high prices of kitchen storage units in general. I shopped around quite a bit before finding this unit on Overstock, and although $$$ still seems high to me, it was by far the best price I found. I am very happy with this piece of furniture - it has clean lines, a nice solid butcher block top, and is just big enough to provide good storage and work space without taking up too much room. I put it together by myself and the directions were easy to follow. It took me about 2 hours.", 
    "The unit was relatively easy to assemble by one person but has two drawbacks. The drawer went in fairly easy but none of us can ascertain how to remove the drawer and there is no one to contact to obtain advice. Secondly,the rubber door pivots easily break and there is no one to contact to obtain replacements.", 
    "I purchased this for my parent's kitchen, and it really is a lovely piece. It is a great size as it does not take up much space, but has enough surface area for prep work. The top wood surface is nice, however, I was expecting it to be butcher block as mentioned in the description. It is butcher block in the sense that it is wood strips glued together with a polyurethane coat overtop. I was thinking it may be more of a butcher block surface that my parents could use as a chopping block if they wanted. It is still nice, just not what I expected. The other thing is the interior of the cabinet has a strong glue smell, but we're hoping that goes away eventually.", 
    "This piece of furniture compares easily to anything I've gotten from \"PB\" and \"C&B\". Certainly not heirloom quality but comparable to anything available. Very good quality wood top, composite body, excellent paint quality. Took my very handy husband about an hour to put together, and all parts were there, pieces matched up well. An excellent buy at a very good price! LOVE Overstock!", 
    "I put it together in about 2hrs, while watching SNL on Netflix. Was very easy. All parts and instructions made sense. The quality of the top piece was better than expected. The white pieces were a mix of solid wood and MDF. I wish the back of the cabinet was a thicker piece of wood, as it seems flimsy, but this is not something anyone would notice unless they knocked on it. Also, I wish they'd included 4 locking wheels instead of 2 locking and 2 not locking.For the price, this is a great value!", 
    "Assembly of this cart with two persons is recommended, especially to decipher the text-free instructions. As long as you note the details and symbols in each drawing, putting this together should take only an hour or so.The overall quality is good, with a heavy wood top and casters that roll easily. The door stays closed when rolling, and the drawer works smoothly. My only \"complaint\" is that the open shelf is not adjustable. I would suggest that the maker add additional drill holes for the tabs so that the shelf can be set to accommodate cookbooks or mid-size items. The handle/towel bar looks good, and projects only a couple of inches past the top edge.A note on out-gassing: The smell of chemicals/solvents was VERY strong when we opened the box, and persisted for about a day. I would advise assembling only in a room with open windows, or in an open garage, and leaving the cart in fresh air for a day or so. We have bought several items of furniture in the last 5 years to assemble at home; this one was the smelliest by far. The smell dissipated in about a day.", 
    "This kitchen island was absolutely perfect for our home. The functionality of the wheels makes it really nice to reposition or move out of the way. It includes a wine rack, towel rack, two shelves, as well as a cabinet and drawer. The drawer and cabinet are not extremely durable, so I wouldn't recommend using them for something you access daily like silverware. We really love the island and we've gotten lots of compliments on how well it looks in our home.", 
    "The kitchen cart is perfect for our kitchen. Seems durable. Looks nice. We put all of our cooking pots and pans in it and plan to just wheel it over to the stove and cut and cook. Looks great. Good quality. Nice looking. Good height and size. Overall, it was a score. Especially for other, similar chop block tops--others were hundreds of dollars more that we looked at. Glad we went to Overstock.", 
    "This product overall is a great product, but it arrived with a huge scratch right across the top of the wood :(Also the drawer is really tight and doesn't work too well (it came put together like that, not much I can do about it)...so we'll just live with it I suppose!", 
    "It has quite a bit of storage and I like that it has wheels, so it can be moved easily. I would of like it to have a way to extend the top counter so you can sit by it and sip your morning cup of coffee.", 
    "Perfect addition to our kitchen. Follow directions...you will put together in timely manner.", 
    "We have had this cart for a while and gets light use from us. I like the clean lines and functional storage. I think the quality is only OK, and that is why I deducted a star. When it arrived in the package, it was already a bit dinged up. The wood is very soft and easily dented. That being said, I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "I have been shopping around for the perfect kitchen cart for months. When I found this one, I was excited to snatch it up. Unfortunately, after it was delivered, I noticed the top piece (which is nice solid wood) had a corner that was smashed. I assume from it being dropped. That's when I started to notice all the flaws. There is a spot on the door where the paint is not even and makes it look cheap. There are also numerous places where the \"white wood\" is chipped or flawed. For a cart that retails at over $300, that is crazy to me. I am going to keep the cart because my husband took 2 hours to put it together and it looks nice (from afar) but I am disappointed.", 
    "The drawer is not as smooth as I hoped. The bottom piece also came out of the box broken. I was able to screw/super glue it back together, but I was a little disappointed.", 
    "I have a very small kitchen and this cart fit the bill perfectly. It was super easy to put together and looks great. The top is obviously not real butcher block, but it is nice none the less. An excellent deal for the money.", 
    "Had another kitchen island that was too big for the area. Decided to turn that one into a against the wall counter and bought this one to fit the space. Was a good size, putting together was relatively easy. Says the top is butcher block, but it isn't a true butchers block, but that's ok. Was worth the price for sure and is convenient with wheels Even went to target and bought bowls and plates like the ones in the picture which my wife and I love as well.", 
    "Searched for a year to find the right island for my tiny kitchen and tiny budget. I am thrilled with this one. The wheels make the cart versatile - I can roll it out for a baking project that requires a large work surface or store it against the wall for more floor space. However, prepare yourself for the assembly instructions. They're diagrams with no words. You may be doing four steps in one diagram, but there is no suggestion as to which is first. Get a friend to help too, because you'll appreciate having someone to laugh with as you assemble. The free shipping was a huge bonus, the cart arrived here in good shape, very quickly, and we found that all the necessary parts were included.", 
    "It definitely takes two people to put together. The only problem I had was that the drawer hardware installed on the drawer was on backwards, once I figured out how to fix it, all was good. It works great in my small kitchen.", 
    "It took me less than 1 1/2 hours to put this thing together by myself. The instructions are similar to those of IKEA, meaning, no words just pictures. I feel like I would have completed faster had there been actual words because the photos sometimes take double and triple takes to understand what they are trying to convey. I live in the city and needed some extra counter space and storage and this did the trick. I feel for $*** this was a huge bargain in comparison to most other ones I saw online. The butcher block looks very sharp and feels that of quality.", 
    "Very pleased with this purchase. The kitchen cart looks great! Only thing that could've been better is more detailed directions. But overall it wasn't too hard to figure out. For the price you can't go wrong in my opinion. A+ purchase.", 
    "Extra storage and work space was needed in our kitchen and this fit the bill. The parts are well made. Assembly was fairly easy...the directions could be clarified in a couple of places but we put it together relatively quickly. The door to the storage cabinet was damaged. We contacted Overstok and a replacement was delivered within a few days.", 
    "I was worried that it could be fragile and that the wheels could be not stable. Instead I'm very happy about it. It is sturdy, and very stable when I use it. And it looks great in my kitchen!!", 
    "Love this cart. I use it as a coffee/wine bar. Two parts arrived damaged. Called customer service and they sent two replacement parts immediately. Excellent customer service department!", 
    "This is just what we were looking for. Reviews swayed me to this product and they were accurate, went together easily, looks nice, top does appear to be more of a laminate than butcher block but for my need its perfect love it!", 
    "This island cart is just the right size for our kitchen. It has great storage space for utensils and the butcher block top provides me with the space I need to prepare meals.", 
    "This cart was easy to put together by one person and it looks great in my small kitchen. It is just what I was looking for.", 
    "This is a great kitchen Island or cart for against a wall. The only thing I have to say negatively about it is that the directions are a pain!! had to take it apart and put it back together again so that the cabinet door would go on.", 
    "It's not bad, stable but I don't like the top. It doesn't feel like a real butcher block top", 
    "Nice quality. Wish the butcher block was actual wood. But overall it's a good cart with sufficient storage.", 
    "I absolutely love this cart. It is beautiful and goes great in our kitchen.", 
    "The kitchen cart was perfect for our kitchen, however it did have some damage when we received it but with a little glue and screws I was able to make the necessary repairs.", 
    "I enjoy my cart I was very glad I ordered it very pleased", 
    "put together well and holding up well!", 
    "Not too hard to assemble. Looks beautiful in my kitchen and awesome price. However, a lot of parts came with little cracks but you get what you pay for right? Overall, I'm really happy with the price and how it looks.", 
    "Wanted this as an addition to our white shaker kitchen. It blends in perfectly. Swapped out the silver handles for black ones and it instantly felt more \" country.\" Have had it for over a year now and it has held up great!", 
    "We had to put this together, but what a treasure! It fits perfectly in the small efficiency in our guest house. Love the little wine shelf in it, too!", 
    "Thankfully we had an Engineer to help with assembly, we had to fix pieces that came out of the box broken before we could complete assembly. Also found a nick in one of the front legs.", 
    "I love this Kitchen Cart, it was easy to install and it looks just like the picture. Very sturdy and plenty of space inside the cabinet. Very glad I bought it!!", 
    "Happy to have this great kitchen cart for my small condo kitchen. It's the perfect size counter work space with added storage. Can easily roll out of the way when not needed.", 
    "Some of the wood split on the backside and there looks to be a glue stain on the wood block, but overall I can get over the little issues as it is relatively sturdy and looks nice. Pretty easy to put together.", 
    "After reading reviews indicating that this cart often arrives damaged, I still decided to purchase since I planned to use it in a rental space where my husband and I are only temporarily living while we renovate our home. So I wasn't overly concerned about little bumps or flaws. I had mediocre expectations, but dealing with this piece has been ridiculous. First, the styrofoam packing was completely disintegrated and the box looked like it had been run over by a truck. It did arrive damaged in several places--a big chunk out of the butcher block and a large crack down each of the side panels. Second, the instructions are quite confusing, and the hardware included (some of which was missing) does not always line up with the predrilled holes and all of the wiggling and maneuvering that it takes to get it to fit scrapes up the pieces (I feel like I should add that my husband and I have LOTS of experience assembling furniture.) The drawer slides were attached backwards (which we figured out after an hour of trying to slide the drawer in). So we had to remove them and reattach them the correct way. When completely assembled, I'd say it looks like a $**-$** piece. Do yourself a favor and have a big glass of alcohol ready to celebrate finishing this piece, because you will need it. That is, if you don't slit your wrists during the process.", 
    "Great piece, but I still can't figure out how to get the drawer in.", 
    "I got this on sale, so I am not as upset about the problems as I would be had I paid full price. First, the top had a small ding in it. Second, the instructions are terrible. Third, the drawer rails came pre-installed on the drawer and were upside down. Fourth, the latch in the door was preinstalled and does not match up with the magnetic door lock well, so the door comes open all the time. Fifth, some pieces were dirty, which is odd if it was in a box the whole time. Also, I thought the top was thick solid wood, but that is actually just an illusion. It is fairly thin (not true butcher block) and about three squares joined together. On the positive side, it looks nice and seems sturdy. I think it will serve my purposes okay. I am just a little disappointed in the quality.", 
    "I had read all the previous reviews. The back panel is sized properly. It took my husband about 11/2 hours to assemble. The magnet works perfectly. I use it as an extra counter when cooking and roll it into the dining room to use as a buffet during dinner parties. I live in a condo with a small kitchen. This is just what I needed when we downsized. I highly recommend this cart. Just make sure you read the directions before attempting to assemble.", 
    "I love the newest addition to my kitchen! I bought this as part of the Cyber Monday sale and the kitchen cart arrived at my house within 2 days of my order, which was fantastic. I let my boyfriend put it together (how generous of me!), and he spent about 2 hours assembling the cart. He is a pretty handy guy, but he did have issues with the alignment of some of the pieces' holes, but he made it work. Overall, it looks great and like I paid much more than I did! Pros: Good quality, sturdy, very fast shipping. Cons: A little difficult to put together.", 
    "My daughter loves it ! It was a gift for her new home", 
    "Very durable and great storage.", 
    "Nice cart, only not a lot room on the tap. Still consider as a good purchase.", 
    "Very hard to put together, though I was told otherwise when I ordered. Now that it's done, it really comes in handy.", 
    "It's quite sturdy. Survived 400 mile move. And looks good in a more modern kitchen as well as the beach house it was originally purchased for. It's just deep enough to store my large (oval) crockpot in. And my rice cooker. Great buy!", 
    "sturdy,attractive ,and useful item", 
    "In theory this is a great cart. First, I am an engineer and quite adept in putting together this type of furniture. However, this was by far the most difficult piece of furniture I've ever had the displeasure of assembling. The pieces were labeled incorrectly, so I got half way through and had to un-assemble and reassemble. The front door and top drawer are not aligned correctly, leaving them noticeably uneven, the pre-assembled drawer runners didn't slide and left about a half inch gap between the top of the drawer and the door hangs crooked. This makes the entire thing look so so cheap. One of the back panel pieces came in the box broken off, which I didn't realize until the last step of putting this together, and wasn't about to un-assemble and repackage at that juncture.. Finally, the magnetic bar for the door does not fully attract to the magnetic catch, so the door swings open if you don't reinforce it with a DIY magnetic strip attachment. Not worth the money. Ikea is less expensive, easier, and looks much better as a finished product.", 
    "This piece fit perfectly and looks as nice in person as it does online. Rolls smoothly if you want to move it but doesn't move around so easily that it doesn't stay put in the corner we put it. Would purchase again.", 
    "I had a limited amount of space to put a kitchen cart but needed something that would actually hold a mixer, etc. this cart fits the bill. It was easy to put together, rolls out beautifully when I need it and is a very efficient use of space.", 
    "Besides the parts being scratched here and there, I really like it. It holds everything I needed it to hold and is pretty sturdy. Warning though, it took quite a while to put together.", 
    "\"This cart is a perfect addition to my kitchen. The block top is thick and beautiful. Putting it together was a challenge. First, the top didn't appear to have a front or a back... and we put the whole thing together backward before realizing this important fact! There is a very thin slit carved into the BACK of the block top. FYI.Also - the drawer was impossible to put on the track! The interior track was one of the only things that was done upon arrival, and it was assembled BACKWARDS. The drawer track needed to be dismantled and turned around before we could fit the drawer in. I'm just glad we didn't break it trying to force the drawer in! This was the most frustrating part... And the last step. \"", 
    "This kitchen cart looks even better in person. Very high quality and a much better value than competitor stores with much cheaper looking products. This is a beautiful addition to our kitchen. And built to last. Can't say enough.", 
    "Easy to put together. The thick bench top is much nicer than the other carts available. looks great, solid quality as long as you put it together properly. Instructions were easy to understand", 
    "It took several hours to put together, but I took my time and it went well. The back piece came with a crack in it, but Overstock did a great job of communicating with me and replacing the cracked piece. The top is nice and heavy. My only complaint would be that the wheels don't really attach, making it hard to move. Not a problem for me since I bought it to use as an island, but still not quite right.", 
    "Fits our needs very well.We use it as a coffee station. Have had a number of compliments about it.", 
    "We left the casters off of ours to make it look more like furniture, less like a cart. It is a perfect fit in our kitchen. We are using it as an island. (The back is finished so it doesn't have to be against a wall.) The height is still great, even without the casters. Though it did take a little time to put together, it was well worth it. Highly recommended.", 
    "Loved it for my apartment, easy to put together, sturdy and super functional.", 
    "This is more than a cart, it is a piece of kitchen furniture. It took about 45 minutes to assemble, and fits quite nicely in our kitchen. The top is real wood and really makes the unit appear to be worth more than the money we spent.", 
    "This is a great low cost kitchen island for a small space. My only issues with it are:- The fragile particle board for the back came damaged (box had clearly been thrown around in the mail!)- The drawer doesn't shut fully- The cabinet door doesn't shut fully b/c the magnet is only on the top (no bottom magnet)I would still recommend this product, knowing it has its small quality drawbacks.", 
    "perfect size of what we were looking for. took some time/effort to assemble, but easy enough.", 
    "I was kind scared when the box was delivered, the box was rip open and mangled. But when I got into it no damage, UPS show be up on notice!!!!! Great product.", 
    "It's a bit longer than I had wanted, wish it was a bit wider, but these are MINOR complaints. It's a great addition to my outdated kitchen.", 
    "This bar cart was the perfect accessory for the empty space in our kitchen! The countertop is sturdy with ample space to hold your knife set and utensils. We put our wine and liquor a on the open side and Tupperware in the portion closed of by the cabinet, each has ample space!! My boyfriend said he had some trouble putting it together (not completely user friendly) however I have been very pleased with the product overall!!", 
    "Sturdy cart . Offers good storage space. I like the extra counter space. I recommend this product.", 
    "Easy to assemble and well made!!", 
    "This was a housewarming gift & the recipient loved it. Well made & description was very accurate.", 
    "Just enough space to hold everything that we needed to store in it. The pull out drawer is a bit small but, we've used it well with a tray to hold all our utensils in. Surprising how much room this kitchen cart provides!", 
    "I wanted to wait to get some use out of this before reviewing it right away. All in all, it's a handy little car and counter. It has added some direly needed storage in our kitchen. Now, the product itself is pretty good quality. Everything lined up nicely for assembly, which sometimes isn't always the case. There were a few splits in the \"butcher block\" top. But they were in the underside so I wasn't too concerned. After a cold and dry winter, those splits have proliferated to the topside of the block as well. There were also a few dings and dents out of the box, but nothing to make me go through the hassle of returning it. Again, all in all a decent little storage cart that can add valuable counter space to your kitchen.", 
    "I am very pleased with this Kitchen Cart that I purchased from Overstock.Com. The top is very attractive and allows much more storage in my kitchen. It is a bit hard to put together as the directions leave a bit to be desired but all in all I am very pleased.", 
    "Was delivered quickly and in good shape. My boyfriend put it together in about an hour. Have been using it for four months now with no issues. Solid, nice looking piece of furniture that provides us with extra storage and counter space for our small kitchen.", 
    "Shipped unit to my son's apartment, he was able to assemble it without much fanfare, and loves the way it fits against the wall. Also gave him extra counter space and storage.", 
    "very happy with the purchase. Provides extra space when preparing food.", 
    "My son was very pleased with the quality of the cart. A few mix-ups with parts but Overstocks with their wonderful customer service response rectified the problem immediately and to our satisfaction- thank you very much.", 
    "We left the wheels off and it is still perfect for our kitchen being used as an island.", 
    "For the price, this does what it is supposed to do. Fairly easy to assemble and it looks great. Not totally wood as mentioned in the description.", 
    "I was looking for a cart/island to serve as a coffee station in my home and found this to be of acceptable dimensions. I ordered it and when it arrived I found it to have significant damage to a structural support. Overstock swiftly dealt with it and another was shipped. When that one was delivered my wife watched the package break open as ups lifted it, spilling contents. Somehow it was mostly undamaged. I consider myself an **** zen master but this was a bit of a bear to assemble. Once assembled, it is a reasonably good product", 
    "Didnt come with directions to put it together, but I found them on line....would not have been able to assemble without them.....but did it, and it's a fabulous piece", 
    "After much researching I purchased this cart. It was fairly easy to put together....took about an hour. My only negative is the top is not 'real' butcher block, but plywood pieces with a butcher block veneer. I thought it was too good of a price for a real butcher block top. If you are looking for something that you can actually chop on...this is probably not the one you want. I use a cutting board, so it's not a problem. So far it's been really handy for that extra bit of counter space I was looking for.", 
    "I purchased this cart for my kitchen to provide extra storage. I opened the box and counted the parts. They were all there but the instructions only had drawings and it was difficult to put together. I had to hire someone for assembly and there is a crack in the door. I like the cart but will refrain from purchasing anything that needs assembly", 
    "I got this to add some extra storage and counter space in my kitchen, and very happy with the purchase. East to put together, and offers a nice amount of extra storage. I don't cut things directly in the top because I don't want to mess it up, but you definitely could if you wanted to. Looks great in my kitchen and have gotten several compliments.", 
    "This product was shipped without a few pieces of wood (the towel hanger) and the pre drilled holes were not big enough for the screws provided. Cannot put together without drilling my own holes. The assembly was frustrating and difficult as the screws and pieces the provided to screw the screws into had to be aligned by the gods in order for the wood to be flush and not wobbly. Despite working for an hour on one screw, the wood pieces will not be flush, they will be unstable, and I will probably need to drill new holes to install my own corner brackets so the side doesn't fall off. Not worth the money when this piece was shoddily made to begin with. Very disappointed I spent close to $*** on a pile of fake wood I can't even burn in my fireplace.", 
    "Only problem was with the directions - they were practically non-existent. If you're good at following directions by nebulous pictures then you'll have no problem putting this together. But the end result was worth the effort.", 
    "The only negative is that it arrived with no instructions. I had to contact Overstock 3 times before they finally emailed them. Fits perfectly and is well made for the price.", 
    "The cart itself is beautiful, but a small packet of parts was missing and a key assembly point was not drilled. The simple part was in metric, so not so easily replaced, but we finally found it online. We spent over $$ to get about 20 cents worth of missing pieces due to order minimums and delivery fees. To finish the assembly we had to drill a hole in the metal frame or the cupboard door would not have fit. Glad we have the cart -- the finished version is just what we need -- but we won't be ordering assembly-required furniture from this store ever again.", 
    "This was a gift for my sister. My husband and I put the cabinet together while she cooked dinner, and when it was finished, she immediately started moving pots and pans into the storage areas. The storage is big enough to fit small appliances like slow cookers. The top is beautiful, but is finished, so doesn't really seem meant for chopping. The cabinet is sturdy, the parts were in good condition, paint-wise, with no chips or dents. All of the hardware was included (except for the towel rack), with no parts missing or left over.The towel rack was completely missing. None of the pieces for the towel rack were in the box, neither hardware nor wood. That's why I took back one star.", 
    "It was somewhat complicated to set up but I had a friend who's a carpenter do it. It's just what I needed to have a work surface next to my stove. (Before, I had to run across my ill-designed kitchen.) It looks great with my canisters and wine in the racks and small cutting board and other knick knacks. With a wall mounted hanging pot rack above it, this kitchen island turned my kitchen from a tacky minimalist rental to looking like a real kitchen.I only give 4 instead 5 stars because the directions could have been a lot better, and some of the pre-drilled holes were a bit askew. It caused the drawer to stick, but that doesn't subtract much from the overall use.", 
    "Only have had it one day. It is a job putting it together. Took me at least three hours, and I am pretty handy with such things. It looks great in the kitchen of our vintage log cabin. It gives our small kitchen much more space for two of us to prepare meals. My only complaints are: particle board drawer sides, one side which crumbled when putting together with screws provided. This was remedied by using longer screws, but may be the one weak spot. It was at the back of the drawer, so damage is not visible. The box could have been taped better. It is heavy in the box, which is good, but the tape on the bottom broke and allowed whatever was on the end of the red string to come out of the box. When delivered, the two sheet instructions fell out of the box, which again is good considering it came from Malaysia, and fell out when delivered here. One end of the red string was hanging outside the bottom of the box, the other tied to a bag of fasteners, etc, inside the box. I am guessing the empty end of the string was attached to an instruction book, but just a guess. I only received a two sheet picture instruction, no written instructions, no warranty, manufacture description, etc. If the box had been taped better this would not have happened. I was able to put it together. It is sturdy, and seems well made. I reversed the towel rack, as the left side in our kitchen butted up against another cabinet, when not in use. This was easy to do, just measure and drill a few holes. At times it seemed holes didn't align, but when put together in order as instructed, everything fit. I don't agree with other reviews saying it is too expensive, considering free shipping, and good quality. Overall we love it, and are very pleased with our purchase.", 
    "Loving this product! Fits beautifully in my new kitchen and is the perfect addition since we are limited in counter space! The white is bright and clean, and the butcher block top is of great quality. My father helped me put it together with no problem. A wonderful purchase from Overstock--you won't be disappointed!", 
    "Almost everyone has commented on the fact that the instructions contain no words and only pictures, so I will not comment on it, just to say it makes the assembly more challenging. But once you get this together, it is very nice. We bought it for my son's small San Francisco apartment where his kitchen has no counter space. This fits nicely underneath an upper cabinet and gives him some much needed storage space. He has only had it a week, but it seems durable. Unlike others, we found all holes were properly aligned and everything fit perfect. Plan about an hour for 2 people to assemble: one to interpret the instructions and one to actually assemble.", 
    "After I had the base set up I noticed a crack on the side where the drawer hardware was screwed into. Not a small crack either, should have never passed quality check. Then had to box up and send back a 80 pound box from a condo, enough said.", 
    "We ordered this cart and it arrived broken. Overstock immediately replaced it and it is great!", 
    "I knew this was not going to be fine furniture, but for my needs - basically, to have a little extra surface in my tiny kitchen - it is perfect. This is a decent size, not one of the tiny carts you see so often, and in a stationary position feels quite sturdy. Putting it together was not too bad, although I messed up the drawer somehow and it rolls out rather roughly. But other than that, it is a great bit of flat-pack furniture.", 
    "Difficult to assemble. Much worse than *** furniture because of low quality pre-drilled holes. The cam holes were drilled too deep, so lining those up was very frustrating. Also the base board was completely ripped off on arrival. As I built it, I help the detached base board in place to secure it. Now that is it together, I love it.", 
    "It takes a while to assemble, and you really need 2 pairs of hands to do it, the finished product is much sturdier and solid than I thought it would be. I love that the counter is a little higher than kitchen counters, making the work space very comfortable to use. The cabinet holds large pots and pans and the drawer is perfect for silverware. My only complaint is that my particular item came damaged - a small serrated chunk out of the top and pealing paint at some of the seams. By the time we noticed, the cart was already put together. Overall, though, I'll get a lot of use out of this handy space-saver.", 
    "Well built, looks great. I did not use the butcher block since I had a left over piece of granite. I was worried it would be too heavy but the cart is just as sturdy. Only down side would be the treated butcher block since you can't do food prep on it.", 
    "This is probably my most favorite item I've purchased off of Overstock. We needed something that had multiple uses and this fit it to a T! Sturdy, beautiful and not too difficult to build (it took two of us, the top is VERY heavy). Drawers and cabinet are easy to open and close, wine rack is solid and it rolls around nicely. Very happy.", 
    "Overall easy enough for me and the man to assemble, but we couldn't get the drawer to fit no matter what we did. So it's drawer-less, but it looks fine that way. Very sleek, sturdy little island, moves around well.", 
    "This is a wonderful cart for the kitchen. Fairly easy to put together once I listened to my husband. He's a definite tool man, but I'm NOT. Assembles upside down on table and then you have to turn it over to finish drawer and door. Son came over to help turn it over and we have really enjoyed using it. Lots more storage space and the butcher block top is very attractive.", 
    "Fool proof constuction. Great for small kischens that lack adequate storage space.", 
    "I had read other reviews about this cart and was a little worried about ordering it (others had said some holes didn't line up and they had to re-drill them. But my cart was excellently built ! Everything was included down to the last nut and bolt I was extremely happy with this cart, directions were clear and I was able to assemble all by myself !! This was my second furniture purchase and will most definitely purchase more as I need them THX", 
    "screws fell out after a year & material is cheap. better products at C & B.", 
    "Nice looking piece, easy to build, very functional. I put it together by myself in about an hour. Only downside is that the drawer does not slide very easily. I originally thought I'd put flatware in there, but it's not sturdy enough for everyday use - save it for those utensils you use once every 6 months. Otherwise the nice work surface and shelving/cabinet is a great addition to my tiny kitchen.", 
    "This kitchen cart is exactly as it is described on the website. The assembly was easy and the cart seems very solid and sturdy. I had an issue with one of the bolts during assembly and had to contact Overstock support. They shipped out what I needed ASAP and were very easy to deal with. Loving Overstock!", 
    "This cart is perfect for small spaces. It's functional and adds a cute cottage feel design.", 
    "I bought this kitchen cart for my son and his girlfriend for their condo. Their kitchen is quite small and this gave them added workspace and storage. They really love it and it's wonderful that is on wheels for cleaning . They hung a shelf over it for classes and mugs and it just completes a very nice look.", 
    "Style is excellent, really wish we had been able to put it together! I am quite handy, especially at building this type of furniture. Occasionally you run into pilot holes that are misaligned or in the wrong place, but usually I can get past these issues with my trusty power drill. However, on step 2 (!) of building this cart, it became obvious that the quality of manufacturing is very poor. In this step, to attach one end of the cart legs, you need to insert a piece of hardware in a hole that's perpendicular to where the screw comes in, to hold the screw in place in the assembled piece. The two hardware holes were so misaligned that this step is impossible to do without drilling out the 1/2 inch diameter hole correctly (something that should have been done in manufacturing for the price of the piece). We had to give up. Overstock customer support was awesome as usual and gave us a refund, but buyer beware! We may have just gotten a dud, but it was a very frustrating experience.", 
    "We needed something to fill a spot in our new kitchen and I saw this in your store and just knew it would be perfect. It wasn't difficult to put together and only took my husband about an hour to finish the job. Surprisingly, the cart has a very large cabinet area with two shelves, a lovely section to hang your wine glasses, with a drawer above it, which is great for keeping coasters, corkscrews, and cocktail napkins. It also has a small towel bar at the end to hang a nice dish towel, and the top looks like it's a great cutting board. The quality of the cart is very good, the overall look of it is sleek and the product is very well made. I'm glad I saw it, I'm glad I got it and it looks great in my new kitchen.", 
    "I like the cart for looks and it functions ok. I thought it went together easily, just pay attention, close attention to all elements of the pictures in the directions (doesn't come with words). One of the legs came cracked and the bottom peice between the cracked leg and another leg was suppose to have a peice that went into the cracked leg but that was broke. We needed the cart for staging to sell our house. So we just dealt with it. Judging from other reviews, I'm guessing all things from Overstock.com are damaged goods in one way or another. Probably the reason prices are cheaper. So if you want a good quality peice, spend the money elsewhere. Also the paint on it seemed cheap, smelled like spray paint, so all in all not the best quyality. But for the price and use, it has worked just fine. The barstools do not come with. I ordered those seperatly from ***", 
    "This cart is great. I bought it for my kitchen that has very little counter space, and it's excellent. The wheels help move it out of the way if needed and the wheels lock in place for when I need it to be stable. Wine rack is sturdy, I have 4 bottles on it with no problem. It was very easy to put together, had it done in under an hour. Very good piece for the money.", 
    "We were immediately impressed with the solid wood counter top when we were unpacking this island. It was somewhat later in the evening when we got it, so my husband and I decided to unpack and organize, but not assemble it due to time. An hour later, we were almost done putting it together- very easy! It looks great in our kitchen, is very solid (now we don't like another smaller island we already owned because it seems so cheap and rickety next to this one) and has great storage. This was an excellent value!! I was surprised at how nice it was for the price.", 
    "received your product. Very nice, only problem is black marks on drawers that wont come out. A little dissappointed.", 
    "Pros: Just the right size for our kitchen, this cart seems sturdy, and has a solid wood top and sturdy, locking casters. It has a surprising amount of well-compartmentalized space for such a small cart. Cons: This cart seemed more difficult to assemble than it should have been. Note that at the start of the non-verbal instructions, where it had pictures of the needed tools, one picture showed two (2) people! I did the job myself, but frequently found myself wishing for an extra pair of hands. Also, it did not come well packed; a very heavy box, there was minimal padding between the collection of parts and the outside, and the box arrived severely dented. The door and one of the towel rod supports were broken upon receipt; fortunately, Overstock.com was able to send replacements for free even though they may not be carrying the cart anymore. I would recommend a higher end kitchen cart from Overstock.", 
    "Great buy for a nice cart. Although instructions are not clear but fairly easy to assemble.", 
    "The island arrived in great condition. I began to put it together and shortly realized that I had installed the center \"side wall\" wrong as the rabbet was facing the wrong direction. Easily corrected. I had it together within 2 hours. And I am a 71 year old lady. I love it being on wheels. I have used it as a moveable bar during the holidays and it is great addition to my limited work space in the kitchen. I recommend this item highly", 
    "My husband I were impressed . Strong materials complements our kitchen very well. As to others large stores with higher prices . Overstock was the right choice we made . Assembling to us was easy as to many other products we have purchase . Good Stuff", 
    "Among friends, I call the assembling of these things, \"the IQ test.\" Some people must whiz through this but it took me over 3 hours. (Okay.. almost four!) I do it very carefully... lay out all the parts and hardware and try to proceed with deliberation, knowing from experience that trying to hurry is a plan for disaster. Once assembled, the overall feel of the cart is sturdy and matches the photo quite exactly. As fa as I know, the top is NOT for cutting board use; too bad, and I don't know how the cart will wear yet. With one side open and one side with a door, it has a nice look. The shelves are good sized.", 
    "The cart has a lot of potential, but quality control is too inconsistent for me to recommend this item. It arrived severely damaged, luckily Overstock took care of me and sent replacement parts. It seems that shipping such a heavy item in this packaging is asking for trouble. I found that the slots for the back panel didn't line up perfectly due to misaligned holes drilled for the pegs. I also had to re-drill one of the holes for the nut, as it was not deep enough to meet the screw. I'm very handy with a basement full of tools, I'd imagine my apartment dweller friends would have just given up. I needed a replacement back panel, as the original had multiple crease lines (it's an 1/8\" engineered panel). I didn't realize until the replacement came in that not only was the original creased, but it was an inch too short to fit. There are minor imperfections on several parts, and you'll find that the many of the joints have shifted, creating seams in the painted surface. That said, the finished appearance is quite nice, and these aren't imperfections that your guests are likely to notice. I think the door and drawer are about what you'd expect, but they feel very cheap compared to my new kitchen cabinets. The drawer is on decent glides, however the glides are very stiff, and 'lock' (by design) in the closed position, so if the wheels aren't locked, you're pulling the whole cart. not opening the drawer. At the end of the day, I'd say the cart is about right for what you pay, and if you really like the look, and you're willing to take a risk, go for it. Worst case Overstock will take care of you. If you don't want a hassle, I'd have to recommend that you look at other options.", 
    "This cart went together well with no problems or any modifications needed. It is very sturdy with good finishes all over. It sits in the middle of my long, narrow kitchen and gives me the additional counter space and storage that I need, and still have room to walk all around it easily. It also matches my cabinets. It's amazing what this can hold! Stuff I could never find a place for fits easily into it. I couldn't ask for a better cart for my needs. I love it in every way, and was so lucky to find it on Overstock! THANKS!", 
    "We gave this to our son for his apartment. His kitchen is small with limited counter space and cabinets. My husband assembled it in less than two hours with minimal swearing. He said the assembly was \"easy\" compared to other items he has put together. Pros: on wheels butcher block top cutting board wine rack storage space within cabinet door and also on two lower shelves towel rack on side Overall, my son is extremely happy with this kitchen cart. It added much-needed counter space when not in use as a cutting board and also storage for spices, dishes, etc. I highly recommend this product!", 
    "We bought this for a spec house and it is well made and top is thicker than any others--it actually almost matches the kitchen cabinets exactly--easy to put together and no problems at all.", 
    "I am very pleased with this product! It looks great in my kitchen and is just the right size for a smallish kitchen!", 
    "After looking at multiple kitchen carts (most of which cost more than a kitchen) we came across this one and are SO PLEASED with our purchase. We have a small kitchen and needed both additional storage space and counter space. This cart supplies both in a high quality, good looking, sturdy piece of furniture. I had my doubts about the wheels locking and it not wobbling when I was chopping/cooking. The cart is like a solid table, and when you put the wheel locks on, it goes no where. It LOOKS and FEELS high quality. We are extremely happy we purchased this cart, use it daily, and had no problems putting it together. Highly recommend.", 
    "My husband and I love this island! It is the perfect size, and we love how it can either lock in place, or move. My husband and I were a bit skeptical on ordering at first, because the entire thing needed to be put together, but we were very pleasantly surprised to see that almost the entire cabinet is real wood. It looks fantastic in my kitchen and I couldnt be happier with this purchase! We got such a great deal using Overstock's promo codes too. Definitely would recommend!", 
    "I love this product! My husband put it together without any difficulty but it did take a little while. The cart looks great in my kitchen and is very functional.", 
    "Once assembled kitchen cart and butcher block top looks fine, for my need/use can't complain but it is not a \"high end\" presentation, do like the thick butcher block top", 
    "I do not have enough work space in my kitchen and so I was considering purchasing an extra work top but after surfing the Internet I found out about butcher trollies. This one was perfect and I was concerned about buying such a thing over the internet as I was afraid it might not be as good as it looked especially as I paid a hefty some to deliver to London. It is even better thank it looks - the quality is exceptional!!! It looks wonderful and I couldn't be happier - the previous recommendations helped me to commit so I thought I would do the same :)", 
    "This cart reeked of formaldehyde (which is potentially carcinogenic (causes cancer)) so much we had to air it out in the garage for three weeks. There was so much formaldehyde the garage also reeked. I have newborn twins so the prospect of exposing them to carcinogens was even more disturbing. I have also had to wash it off numerous times in hopes of getting rid of the smell. After several weeks and washes, the smell has dissipated but I would never get this product of any product that smells like this ever again.", 
    "I have recommended it to others. I use it as an island in a new smaller kitchen.", 
    "Pain in the butt putting it together but it was worth it! It looks great in my kitchen.", 
    "I think for \u00e0 temporary item it is ok but I don't thinking it is an item That Will last years.", 
    "When I ordered this, I had no idea I would have to assemble this completely. It was a large heavy box and I didn't even open it because I knew I wouldn't be able to assemble it. For the cost, it should have come assembled. Not worth the bother", 
    "Just as described. I would recommend this island for any kitchen."
