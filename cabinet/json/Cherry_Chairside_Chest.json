    "While well made, this side table/chest is a very red color and does not look at all like the picture. I was very disappointed but didn't want tosend it back. Be careful with Butler Furniture items.", 
    "I needed a small table to fit between two recliners. Everything I viewed on-line looked cheap or wasn't the style I wanted. Then I came across this table. It is perfect! It is a little darker than pictured, but that was perfect for me. It fit in with the other furniture in the room. It is a sturdy piece of furniture that I will enjoy for many years to come. Another good value for the price."
