    "This buffet does the job and looks like the picture, but the quality is really substandard. I put it together pretty quickly (I mean, at least 1.5hrs...but that's how long these things take) The doors really make it cheap . They are really thin and don't close well. They are also hard to get 100% straight. If you don't touch the buffet, it looks fine, but if you open a door, you know it is cheap. I think *** is a pretty steep price tag for this item, but it does look nice from a few feet away.", 
    "It looks OK from a distance but when you touch it (especially the side panels) it's just thin and cheap. Even for the price I think it's not worth it. Not to mention the holes didn't line up and I had to pay someone to put it together and get it right.", 
    "This buffet is the worst I have ever seen. One of the doors has a crack in it, lock nuts cheaply made and had two break and they wouldn't hold the piece together. Other imperfections in the wood had been covered with a black marker or some other substance. I definitely won't buy anything from this manufcturer again and I do not recommend anybody else buy it either. Being on a fixed income this was not worth the price I paid.", 
    "This is a great piece for a great price. It looks perect in our dining area and matches our dining set. I did a lot of searching prior to actually buying a buffet and was happy to find this. The ONLY downfall to this buffet is the assembly. My husband (super handy person) took almost 2 hours to put this thing together partly because he kept on having to take the entire thing apart and put it back together again because the directions were so terrible. If you are an individual who has trouble with furniture assembly (myself included) save yourself....don't try to put this thing together. If you're handy and want a great piece of furniture--buy it :)", 
    "The box was dripping off the product after Hurricane Irene, however and thankfully the wood was not damaged! The instructions were not good and need to be re-written. I have assembled a multitude of furniture/cabinets/bookshelves, etc. and have never had so many problems. There are pre-drilled holes missing, and the alignment of parts was not accurate. After assembling the unit I am happy with how it looks, but the instructions, and some elements could have been made easier. Some parts could have arrive already assembled, with less aligning for the customer. It would have made the process easier. Way too many steps and not incredibly clear.", 
    "Have to assemble. Too many pieces! Pieces did not fit together well. Cam locks busted. Poor quality.", 
    "My husband assembled this piece and he stated you get what you pay for. It's an inexpensive cabinet however it\u0092s what I needed and it looks really nice in my dining room.", 
    "I'm satisfied with the quality and the price overall, but one thing that I didn't like was that even though I tried my best to assemble it correctly, there was a slight mismatch between the two front doors. I think it is really hard to make it right. The color perfectly matches to my furniture. One downside is that the smell (probably from the glaze) seems to last too long. It's been a month, but I can still smell it, although I'm not sure whether this is a generic problem with these kind of assembly furniture.", 
    "Very poor quality. Item came with defects . It seems like the finish had been touch up from damage and scratches . Never recommend to anyone . No instruction came with product also . Very bad .", 
    "You get what you pay for at this price!! A lot of work to put together. Scratches and marks on wood. Screws missing and not the right length. Not stable and very flimsy!!! Stay away!", 
    "This cabinet seemed to be exactly what I needed at a great price! But I had to reinforce the doors with wood glue and I don't feel like it ill make it through our next move.", 
    "As the title said.... If you get pass page three of these so-called instructions (probally originally written in Chinese) count yourself as blessed... as I felt. Keep in mind I put furniture together all the time...this was a challenge. When finally completed...it met my basic needs...", 
    "This cabinet is very flimsy! I would not order it again.", 
    "Really hard to put together! After 4 hrs oft husband ANC I working on it it is still on the box. Instructions are poor and I worry about how long it will last", 
    "You get what you pay for. It's not the best piece of furniture ever, but it serves its purpose and looks nice. It is hard to build, but once built it's fine.", 
    "This took forever to put together and even then, it is a bit \"cheap.\" For the price, it is fine, but if you're looking for quality, this is not the product. It serves a purpose for me, which was additional storage in a nice style. However, I don't think this is a piece that will last.", 
    "All in all for the price this is good value (other than) if you include your time to put it together.", 
    "Medium quality does look nice but the door hinges are so so.", 
    "Difficult to assemble. Instructions not clear. Doors don't hang correctly.", 
    "Came dusty with cracks, but Overstock refunded in full and the customer service was excellent.", 
    "Perfect for a little extra storage at a good price", 
    "The pieces that were put together were falling apart when I got it. The camel locks kept breaking on me. And they barely locked at all. I ended up just mostly gluing the pieces together. And it still wobbles so badly I'm afraid to use it.", 
    "It was exactly as described", 
    "Perfect size. Exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "kind of flimsy but expected for the price. still holding up great after over a few years", 
    "Had a space in the kitchen, visible from other parts of the house. This piece gave me storage and looks great.", 
    "I needed something smaller. This was a good purchase for the size, color and $$ I wanted to spend. Proven to be sturdy enough. Excellent piece considering the price. Very happy with purchase", 
    "The paint finish is faded in some areas. Read the directions carefully because they have some of the steps putting the cabinet together labeled wrong. The camlocks did not lock together that good and when assembled the cabinet moved from side to side. Cheap and not worth the money.", 
    "This is incredibly cheap. Every single piece of this showed up with a scratch on it, and judging by the material, it's easy to scratch. Materials are thin and flimsy. I bought this for a small apartment, and will likely throw it away when I move. It most definitely will not survive a moving truck or anything heavy on it.", 
    "Looks nice but not sturdy at all. I tried for a long time to tighten it up but the fasteners do not work well.", 
    "Hard to put together. Looks good when finished.", 
    "Upon opening the package, we were overwhelmed with the smell, which was like epoxy. In fact, it still smells like that inside the cupboard. Whatever it was, didn't smell healthy, like VOCs. The cupboard was easy to construct, but many of the pieces we received looked like they'd had touch-up paint and some of the pieces weren't painted correctly. Additionally, some of the fasteners didn't \"take\" because they didn't grip the wood. Because it was a piece bought for our office, we decided to keep it; but if it was for my home, I'd have returned it.", 
    "Sizing was perfect, looks great in my kitchen but was timely to put together. Not as sturdy as I thought but does not look cheap or fragilel", 
    "For the price, this was absolutely perfect. It assembled without too much difficulty and fits where I need it. It had a few tiny dings, but again, for the price, it is absolutely great.", 
    "Product was for daughter-in-law and came with missing pieces and took 2 weeks to have new item sent that she has to take items from then ship the rest of the new items back. Very inconvenient", 
    "I assembled the buffet by myself and am very pleased how well it fits into the d\u00e9cor of my dining room. It would have been a little easier to assemble, especially in the early stages, if there had been a second person to hold and steady the pieces. Still, I managed to get it done! I'm very happy with the results!", 
    ".This buffet size shape has been perfect for my dining room.", 
    "It was easy to put together. It looks good and is what i needed. I would reccommend it.", 
    "perfect for my use, quality, price and color,size all good~", 
    "The product looked great online. And it looks okay in person. The assembly directions were poor.", 
    "This is good quality for the price. It was perfect for my small space. It provides an extra work surface & some storage.", 
    "Overall worth the money. Does its job well. The directions are a little hard to understand and the small parts are in bags instead of individually labeled. The magnets aren't that good. I use mine in the bathroom for towels and it does it job and I would purchase again.", 
    "I will never by another product that has to be put together again, It takes to long.", 
    "This is a good piece for the price. It is not the highest quality but is definitely a nice piece of furniture. It is somewhat cumbersome to put together. Directions are so-so. I had to take it apart a couple times and redo. I was struggling trying to find a buffet/side table that had storage and was not to deep. This fits perfectly for what I needed. It looks nice and I am satisfied and would recommend it.", 
    "The only problem I have with this product is this. The instructions were not done right. They missed to tell you some steps which I then had to take it apart to do the steps they messed up on. Also board #7 they drilled the wholes wrong. Now I have to try to find away to fix it.", 
    "It was extremely hard to assemble and took very long time. So many parts and horrible instruction.", 
    "Thankfully, my son was available to assemble the piece. Once assembled, it is very attractive, practical, and get lots of compliments", 
    "The company can do better with the instructions to assemble the piece. It took me over 4 hours to put it together and part of it was trying to figure out the pieces because the pictures are a bit misleading. Overall I'm happy with the product.", 
    "My buffet has chips, that is OK I can fix that. I'm the most frustrated about the 4 extra long cam lock bolts that would not lock, they just spin. The bolts are either too short or the holes are drilled too far apart. I did not expect a real quality item for this price. I did expect it to fit together. I think we will need to drill pilot holes and screw the front of the cabinet onto the body. The doors are very thin, so don't plan on using this much. It is a cute piece but just for looks, not for any real use. We got a few pieces upside down or backwards, because the directions are not the best. We have put a lot of this type of furniture together and this was not easy. It is a job for two people.", 
    "Buffet was exactly what we were looking for - a place to put our espresso machine and mini bar. Very simple, stylish design. PERFECT for a very reasonable price! Easy to assemble, too.", 
    "The buffet has a very strong chemical/paint smell that lasts for quite sometime. It was overall pretty easy to Put together. One piece did not fit exactly with the others but you're not able to tell, so it doesn't bother me. It looks nice for what you pay and does the job.", 
    "It looks great and color is perfect. When assembling the buffet, I would recommend using wood glue on all of the joints. Overall I am happy with the purchase. The directions could be a little more clear but if you take your time and pay attention you should be able to figure it out.", 
    "I needed an expensive buffet table for the holidays, I had read previous reviews and got exactly what I was warned about...I took my chances for the price value. The Buffet is not very sturdy and would not recommend for heavy storage of items; I use it for linens and table clothes and small glass items. We had to touch up the paint on the panels and fill in some gabs; after giving it our extra touch here and there- it looks nice in my kitchen.", 
    "Looks great in our dinining area. I feel that it will last the 5+ years until we decide to do a major remodel. Doors are straight and close easily. Hardware okay but can change out if need to. Only had one small mark but was easy to touch up versus going through hassel of return. I would purchase again, I feel I didn't waste my money.", 
    "Very dissapointed, cheap does not begin to describe it. This is not even made from MDF or particle board it appears to be made of particle card board. How do I know what the inerds look like? It was damaged in shipping and a corner was totally crushed. Don even bother with this.", 
    "product was delivered quickly and undamaged. for a starter piece it will do.", 
    "This was a great buy, good price but you get what you pay for. It put together easily and was not missing parts. Looks great", 
    "The buffet is great for use in the kitchen or dining area.Provides storage and extra counter space.It gave my kitchen a lift.It was reasonably priced.The only flaw: one of the doors is a bit uneven.Still a good product.Highly recommended!!", 
    "This was very well constructed, I was surprised at the excellent quality, especially at this price. I've gotten a lot of compliments on this already.", 
    "The item has poor parts alignment and inferior hardware. Spend more money and buy something well constructed. I wouldn't consider it furniture", 
    "I really enjoy my buffet. I use it to store drinks and appetizer dishes, so it's the perfect size. Assembly was lengthy but you just have to expect that when you purchase something of this size. The shelves are very sturdy and thick. I especially like that the top shelf is removable. I keep it removed as my items I store are very tall and need the extra space. I feel like I got a bargain on this buffet. It's not the same quality as a furniture store, but for the price it's completely worth it. I'm very pleased.", 
    "this was a huge pain to put together, even have to go buy some screws to make secure. but looks good (still kinda cheapish) but good for my first apartment, works as needed, much better & classier then getting a kitchen kart.", 
    "I bought a similar cabinet to this one several months ago. This one is not as stable as the other was for some reason. Perhaps a difference in fasteners, although they looked the same. It looks nice but is a little wobbly so I'm adding some angle supports inside to make it more stable. I was looking for an inexpensive cabinet for our office and this is not a bad cabinet for the price.", 
    "This product is by far the worst quality piece of furniture that I have ever seen and put together! Trying to assemble it made putting together Ikea furniture look like a piece of cake. The sides were not square at all and there were so many gaps between the wood that, even three fairly intelligent adults, working for over 3 hours, could not get the buffet assembled. It's being returned just as soon as I finish this sentence.", 
    "The final product was great for the amount of money spent. To get anything else remotely similar would cost at least twice as much. I have been looking for a buffet table for some time now and this one is a very good value. The down side of this is- it was quite a chore to set up. You have to really think about how the pieces are going to fit together because the directions are terrible. I found myself having to take it apart and put it back together a few times because I didn't put it together in the right order.", 
    "Took over 4 hours to put together (made the mistake of doing it alone). Had to take it apart 3 times before it was over. Directions were useless. Unit arrived with chipped paint, and rubbed corners, dusty, and missing holes. And i agree with the other reviews, if you look at it from a distance it will appear to be okay... but once you get near you see the issues it has and when you touch it it will wobble. I don't trust it to hold my television. Very dissapointed in this item from O. I would have returned it but i didn't unpack it until i was ready to put it together which was when i moved back into my remodeled home. I kinda trusted O.com because i love everything else i've gotten from them, but in this case.....YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!", 
    "I use this to hold the tv, and it stores my kids toys. They are in and out constantly and everything is holding up very well", 
    "For the money, this is a great addition to my office - I would not want to use this in my dining room - but I suppose you could, depends how picky you are. The directions were quite confusing, but I eventually got it together in about 2.5 hours. It would be easier with two people - one to hold pieces and one to put the pieces together. The price on overstock.com was much better than other websites, that's for sure. I would buy it again if I had need for more storage.", 
    "Looks great. Exactly what we were looking for! The description and photo was right on target.", 
    "Good buffet. Easy enough to put together. Fits perfect in the space I wanted it for. I have a lot of weight stored in it and it is sturdy enough to hold everything. Love the black. Would definitely recommend for the price.", 
    "this is almost entirely assembled by cam locks. it shifts from side to side a bit. i have had it holding my tv and x box for a couple of weeks really not that much weight. it has already started to come apart in one corner. i really haven't moved it that much either. perhaps when i assembled it some of the cam locks weren't entirely secure even though they held. i have no idea but i kind of want to send the pieces back because i don't think it would withstand a move to another house.", 
    "Just what I needed for a great price. There was an issue with a malformed leg that was quickly replaced. It is solid and the doors fit perfectly. I like the black finish that isn't glossy.", 
    "Had some difficulty with the instructions - however, once it was put together, it was a excellent choice to add to the dining area.", 
    "The packaging was adequate. After having to break it down 3 times and 3 futile attempts at reassembly, I gave up and packed it back up and sent it back. I have put a few of these types of furniture together but this one was just impossible to mate the pieces together. Too bad. This would have filled the bill nicely.", 
    "I was extremely thrilled with this buffet. I had been looking everywhere for the right size, color, and storage space with doors on it and this was great - especially for the price. It was quite heavy and putting it together was detailed, but that just made it a better quality. I couldn't be happier.", 
    "I love the buffett but it was a little bit difficult to put together as some of the instructions were not completely clear. Overall, I love the buffett.", 
    "Be warned, this thing was a GIANT pain *** to put together. So many different pieces of hardware, and some steps made no sense, but once we finished (you will DEFINITELY need a person to help you, do not attempt to assemble it on your own) I was very pleased with it. However there was a chip on the front corner of the top of it, but I touched it up with a black sharpie and it looks good enough I guess. For the price I'd say it's a good value, just don't expect to be able to throw it together in less than an hour.", 
    "I needed another piece for my dining room and purchased this item. It is decently made, was failry easy to assemble. Not the highest quality but very good for the price. Have seen similar pieces of furniture in stores and they run about ***. Good for the monty and so far is serving its purpose.", 
    "Looks great, although not easy to put together. Fits perfectly where we had in mind.", 
    "This item was perfect for what I needed it for but I wouldn't use it as an actual buffet - it is small. I use this as a hall table next to my front door - the shelves are perfect for hiding all the stuff that accumulates on top such as keys, mail and things. It takes a while to assemble but looks nice once it's put together.", 
    "Very happy with this product. Would purchase furniture again", 
    "one complaint is there is a strong chemical/petroleum order from the inside cabinet when the front doors are opened. It is taking very long for it to disappear", 
    "The left door had two sets of pre-drilled holes for the door hinge. This created two unnecessary and visible holes on the front of the left door, which needed to be filled and painted. Also, there were some blemishes in the paint job. A good price, and cute desing, but I was not impressed with the amount of defects in the overall appearance.", 
    "I needed a black to store sheets and blankets that was attractive. this cabinet fit the bill. Would be easier to put together with two people, but one was ok. The magnet holder on the top has two short of screws, so if it gets knocked loose as mine did , you have damaged holes and it won't work. It needs to be aired out, as it has a very chemical smell. Looks very nice when put together.", 
    "This buffet was perfect for the location I needed it in. It's sturdy, functional, and esthetically appealing.", 
    "Pretty easy to assemble by one person. Perfect little accent piece to a dining room - I love it.", 
    "So far it is great for holding extras for the dining area. Was a perfect fit for the vacant wall where only a picture hung. I am satisfied with the purchase.", 
    "I love this buffet that I purchased not too long ago for my kitchen. We have downsized from a good size house to an apartment temporarily and this work for me. It looks like nice and have gotten many compliments. If you purchase this buffet, I don't believe you will be disappointed at all. I wasn't!", 
    "Excellent product, We're using it for under the tv and we are able to fit all of our dvds and cookbooks inside, while cable box dvd player, and video game unit fit perfectly in lower shelf. Lots of storage and looks really elegant. There was some damage when it arrived but we filled in chips with black marker. Looks great, very satisfied.", 
    "I needed a small scale buffet to use as a liquor cabinet/buffet for our cottage and this was exactly what I hoped it would be. A friend helped put it together and didn't seem to have any trouble. The doors didn't match up perfectly, but that doesn't bother me. I added my own rustic knobs and sanded the edges of the cabinet a bit with fine sandpaper to give it a distressed look - more cottage style. It's perfect! Love it.", 
    "Excellent design, looks good in room, looks more expensive if viewed from across the room, very useful storage space, durable for its purpose (light items only). Cheap material construction (noticeable upclose and when you open the storage unit), but fair for the price. Not recommended for medium to heavy duty storage. Avoid rough handling as it scratches very easily. Be careful in moving the item as construction reinforcement is poor. Overall good value for what you are paying.", 
    "After two hours trying to assemble this piece, I am still stuck with parts that simply won't go together. An absolutely frustrating experience. Don't waste your money on this one.", 
    "Product was in good shape when it arrived and was protected well. Several parts were missing but I was still able to assemble it. One of the stickers which indicated \"front\" was on the wrong side and I didn't notice it until I had already put it together. Now I have a bolt showing on the front of the lower shelf instead of the back of the shelf. Also, no holes were drilled to attach the doors to the unit. I'll have to do that myself. Unit is somewhat wobbly even though I made sure to tighten everything as I assembled it. I am very disappointed in this purchase.", 
    "I am pleased that I took a leap of faith and purschased this piece! I was nervous based on the one and only review. Luckily I considered the damaged box was more of a shipping than a product issue. My package came delivered unharmed and had no problems put it together. It offers ample storage with out being a bulky piece of furniture. What can I say, I love it and it looks great in my living room!", 
    "The buffet serves the purpose that I needed, more dish storage in my kitchen. I had to get someone to put it together. The doors do not line up perfectly. I am not unhappy with it, considering the price.", 
    "I love, love, love this cabinet (as I call it) but it is titled buffet. I am using it in my laundry room to help organize my \"stuff\". It could be a buffet for dishes, etc. and would like nice, although my dining room is more formal so if you have a casual look it fits the bill perfectly. I just love it and got it quickly and it was packed very securely...so everything was flawless.", 
    "Very nice looking product, I am very pleased, needs some assembling, a couple of hours of work you will be all set, is even better if a man do it for you, a man will probably assemble it even faster, all i had was a screew driver I was still able to assemble it. The design is not great if you are a person who change locations very often, other than that, it is working 100% for me.", 
    "The piece arrived damaged with one of the corners smashed in. My husband didn't notice it right away and assembled it anyway. Then we noticed that the doors would not line up. One of the knobs is about a third of an inch higher than the other. The hinges were not the kind that allow your to adjust them, so we were not able to line them up."
