    "Received the cabinet, and took about fifteen minutes to put together and hang. \"Wood\" is painted pressboard, held together with wooden dowels and cheap screws. Paint finish on door looks like someone dragged it on the factory floor before packaging it. Expected a bit better quality all around for the price, looks cheap to make.", 
    "I followed the directions completely and had to use crazy glue in order to make the cabinet feel like it was not going to fall apart. I had the same problem with the magnet as the last person - you would need to use other screws in order for it to work and even though I tried placing it in different places,it never connected with the other piece on the door. The door itself was not even with the rest of the cabinet so there was a big gap at the top of the cabinet. I didn't even put it up, I left it in the recycling room of my apt building in case anyone else wanted a shoddy wall cabinet.", 
    "Very attractive. The cabinet looks just like the photo in person. Assembly and installation was simple, and I'm pretty hopeless with assembling these types of things. Quality was a bit nicer than I expected for the price, but not great. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.", 
    "For price will work, but would not order again. I was envisioning something a little more sturdy.", 
    "I've mostly assembled the cabinet but the screws that are supposed to attach the magnet that keeps the door closed seem to be too small, and the magnet mechanism keeps coming off. I have not hung the cabinet yet because of this issue. I will add that it was a challenge to get the door hinges in place. I also bought the floor cabinet version of this cabinet. I was able to assemble it. The drawers are smaller than I expected.", 
    "It is a perfect fit in the small space over the toilet in a very small guest bathroom. Just the right size to store toilet paper, etc.", 
    "Perfect for a small bathroom, (which we have). The frosted glass gives it a great, clean & modern look.", 
    "missing shelves, directions don't work-had to remove and remeasure several times, craftmanship is awful. do not buy this. you will be sorry", 
    "I believe this item would have been great as manufactured. However I didn't receive it that way! Arrived with broken dowels in the hardware packet, and even dowels that were partially snapped off that were not removed from the deconstructed cabinet sides.So I drilled out the broken dowels, and bought new wood for replacement dowels at the hardware store. Then cut and trimmed the new dowels, repaired the cabinet sides and built per the directions. Simple? Could of given it a higher rating if it was new. Or if as a return someone had taken the chance to look it over and replace the broken parts. Poor reverse supply chain quality control, perhaps. They didn't bother to look over the returned box before shipping to customers - definitely!", 
    "I ordered two- one for each bathroom. The cabinet is spacious enough and does not take up too much wall space.", 
    "Cabinets were nice had the glass in front got two of them,but did not close well ,with the magnets by doors", 
    "Very nice cabinet for bathroom easy to install", 
    "This is what I was looking for. I did not want to put a \"normal\" mirrored vanity in my new modern bathroom. This is the perfect answer. Love it.", 
    "This helped offer additional space in our small bathroom. Got the 2 Drawer Linen Cabinet to match. Very modern and easy to put together and hang!", 
    "I have this in my small bathroom for extra storage. I taped a picture from my \"bird\" calendar inside the glass to give it pizzaze and hide the personal products from view. I was easy to put together and to hang.", 
    "I completed a beautiful 4- piece bath (separate shower, Jacuzzi tub, vessel sink and commode) and realized I hadn't provided storage in this rental house main bathroom. Added this wall cabinet and a matching free-standing tall storage cabinet as a great solution!", 
    "It's not like I expect showroom quality furniture from Overstock, but this piece really should cost about $**. It's made with low quality materials and it fell apart while installing it. I was able to put it back together but the biggest problem is the two tiny holes you are expected to use to hang it. You make the marks on your wall once it's positioned, drill holes and put in the wall anchors, then you cant see where you've put your anchors because they are hidden from view once the cabinet is against the wall. The back is the same cheap material found in drugstore, \"put it together yourself\" kinds of things, which would be fine if it were more affordable. On the upside, it does look nice and once we added about three more screws to secure it to the wall it finally seemed like it wouldn't fall once loaded up. All in all, it would be a fine product if we were just charged what it is really worth.", 
    "I also purchased the floor model of this cabinet. It is well made and easy to put together. Works well in my 1/2 bath for necessities. It saves a trip back to the linen closet...and looks nice as well.", 
    "i purchased 2 of this cabinets for one of my bathrooms. But one of them, the door is easily loose open from the magnet thing. The magnet is too weak to hold the door on close. I have to close the door and hold my hand on the door to let it stay for a couple more seconds before I can let go of my hand if not it will loose and open."
