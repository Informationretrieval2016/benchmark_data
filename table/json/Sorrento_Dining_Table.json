    "On the strength of the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this table, I purchased it recently hoping that it wouldnt' be one of the few (per the reviewers) to arrive with a small scratch or ding. First, it arrived in only one week even though it shipped from Utah and I'm in Maryland. Second, it arrived extremely well-packed and without as much as a blemish. Third, it looks and feels solid and as if I paid four times as much as I really did pay. Fourth, it was easy to assemble. Final conclusion: do not hesitate to get this table at all if you like the dark brown finish! You'll get many times your money's worth. Also, I got 6 dark brown leather dining chairs to go with this table and they arrived together and matched PERFECTLY! Now my dining room looks luxurious, modern, and comfortable at the same time. NOTE: The table very comfortably seats 4 but will accommodate 6 if need be. I ordered 2 extra chairs for other uses around the house because the chairs were such a bargain. For those who might be interested, the chairs I ordered were \"Leather Dining Chairs (Set of 2),\" sku number 421558. You can search for these leather dining chairs on Overstock.com by typing in 421558. Enjoy!", 
    "I ordered this table for our breakfast area and then I bought leather parsons chairs from somewhere else. Since the chairs I bought are larger, only four will fit around the table (this is fine for us). The table is great for casual use - it has a streamlined look and it is extremely easy to clean. One thing to note is that the top of the table is the same finish as the legs. In the photo of the table from the Overstock website, it looks as though the top of the table is white (at least on my screen), but this is not the case. The whole table is a really nice dark espresso color.", 
    "Took a chance and ordered this table and the Venice Espresso Side Dining Chairs while my husband was out of town. It was a great deal. The look is modern and beautiful! My husband loves it as much as I do. The chairs and table match and the table is perfect size for our smaller dining room area. The quality is great for the price and the set does not look cheap. I only give the workmanship a 4 because it is not a high end table, but it is well worth every penny I spent on it. I would be willing to pay a bit more.", 
    "I am so happy with the Sorrento Dining Table, it is even more beautiful then the picture, the measurements are just a little off, the lengh is about 58 inches, and the width is about 34 inches, the color is wonderful, almost a chocalate brown. I love it!!!", 
    "I purchased this table about three years ago, and I really like it. It is a deep colored wood, and a solid piece of furniture. It does scratch a bit with wear and tear, but it is so dark that you can't really tell. I use a waxy polish to clean it and that works better - it does not absorb the oily furniture polishes, so there is no point in using them.The table is a bit small - it does fit the six chairs that go with it, but they can't all be pushed all the way in (I leave the end ones sticking out a bit and it looks intentional). When I have 6 people sitting at once, I just hope they all like each other! I know it will not fit 6 traditional, rectangular place mats, but I think round chargers would work.I like the dark color and the clean, simple lines of the table. If you have a more modern taste in decor, and a budget, this table might just be a great choice for you like it was for me.", 
    "Great table, solid construction, easy to put together. Very nice that the table is solid wood and not veneers.", 
    "I absolutely love this table for my family of 5 (3 young children). I don't put anyone on one end, but the baby sits in her chair on the other end and there is still room for us to move around and she can't reach our plates. In other words, plenty of room. But here is one mistake you should watch out for - this table is really easy to take care of, so don't mess it all up by using something like Pledge on it. I sprayed it the other day, thinking it would give it a nice shine (which is already has, so I have no idea what I was thinking) and it made all these water-mark type marks on it, totally freaking me out and thinking I ruined it. Luckily, I decided to just spritz some water on it and wash all that Pledge junk off, and thankfully we are all good now - no marks. So just wash it with water and maybe some light soap, no need to scrub. I love this table - the rich color, the simplicity, and I put it together on my own in 15 minutes. You will need 2 people to lift it up, though, then put furniture pads on the bottom and slide into place. No chairs matched it perfectly, but the Leather Bi-Cast in Espresso is what we have and we think they look awesome. Easy clean up for kids too. Just don't let them \"file\" their nails on them. Came very well packaged, I was impressed. A beautiful finish to the table, and fast shipping make me love this table.", 
    "I've purchased a few items from Overstock and have been extremely pleased! This table is the first item that I had to assemble. It was a breeze for a 5'0 woman. It is now sitting in my dining room - which is casual and small, but I think this piece is better suited as a desk or game table. The color is exactly what I hoped it would be, however, it's very simple looking. If you are shopping for quality wood, I would recommend looking elsewhere for the same priced item. I will spend more money on expensive chairs to give this a more elegant feel. Also, there is a small ding on the edge of the table, for the price it's not worth sending it back.", 
    "Sturdy, beautiful table. I have compared other contemporary styled tables, and this was the best value by far. Most others were veneer, not solid wood, and more expensive. This one is solid wood, with clean lines. This table is small (please note the dimensions), it shows 6 chairs, but my 6 chairs barely fit. Please measure your chairs before ordering.", 
    "This was my first furniture purchase from Overstock.com and I'm not disappointed. I looked for months at tables on the site and kept coming back to this one. Mainly because it was real wood, and it's 30\" high. All of the positive reviews were helpful to me as well, hence the reason I'm leaving one myself. The shipping was super fast. I ordered the table Monday night at 6:45pm and the two boxes were on my door step Thursday by 6pm. Both boxes arrived together (table top arrives in one box and the four legs in another). Everything was in great shape when it arrived (thank you UPS). This table was the perfect size for my dining room (approx. 5' x 3'), although I'm still getting used to have a larger table in the area. I can't express HOW EASY this was to assemble. I actually opened and removed one side of the box with the table top, so that the underside of the table was facing up. I left it in the box, upsidedown, while I attached the four legs. Then I flipped the table over and stood it upright. That was it!! I climbed under the table after it was upright to tighten the bolts and I was done. It was a little difficult to lift the table up alone (I think it weighs about 90 lbs assembled), so having someone to help with that might be advisible. I noticed only two minor flaws in the piece, on two different legs, I could see what looked like a staple or a small hole in the wood near where a staple was inserted (?), but it was down low on the leg and I put those legs to the back. The table top is very smooth and the table is very sturdy. I didn't even need to \"level\" the legs. When I flipped it over and upright, it didn't wiggle once. I hope this review helps someone. I know I read reviews over and over before making such a purchase.", 
    "used this table in our game room to play board games on. it is VERY sturdy, very heavy. great look and the perfect size. cant' believe shipping was so cheap on such a heavy item! thanks overstock!", 
    "I bought this table 4 years ago and after regular use in our dinning room it is still in great condition! We have taken it apart and put it back together several times and it is still a solid table! the only complaint I have is that it does seem to scratch easily.", 
    "A very sturdy and simple table. The color is true to the picture- a deep mahogany/espresso color. We love it! Definitely a good buy if you are looking for a simple table at a good price!", 
    "I read the reviews good and bad and was concerned about receiving damaged goods. Also, I was really looking for a table with an extention however I took a chance and ordered this beautiful table. The table arrived in a timely manor and was perfect when it arrived not a nick or bump in sight. I unpacked the material and table and the color was perfect sort of a dark java color which should match the buffet I plan to purchase and the size was satisfactory. Assembly was very simple however, LADIES!! this table it is very heavy, I had to manage by myself. So, I put together two legs on one end and turned the table over and assembled the other two legs PERFECT!!. Great Buy and best puchase from Overstock thus far.", 
    "We are on a tight budget and wanted a solid wood dinning table and this one fits perfectly in our small area. After reading other reviews, I made sure to open the box with the table top facing down so that its ready to have the legs attached. The box comes with 3 heavy plastic straps holding it together and I was able to move the box around myself using those straps. It took only a few minutes to attach the legs and tip it up into place. Each leg has 2 heavy duty bolts that hold the legs securely & allows this heavy table to be very stable. It arrived in perfect condition with no scratches nor any blemishes in the finish and my wife loves how it looks with the dark brown stain. The table top itself is nearly 7/8\" thick and has two vertical center supports under the table top. We already had chairs that have height adjustment with arm rests. Usually sold as student desk chairs. Six of them fit perfectly around the table. For those familiar with wood working techniques, the table top is made up using pieces of wood jointed and glued together which in some cases uses finger joints. The wood work is very high quality and the finger joints are almost invisible. The only minor issue is at one corner there is very small crack of the glue joint which is difficult to see. So we are very pleased with this purchase. My wife loves it :-)", 
    "Nice looking table and super easy to put together. I bought the matching chairs and very pleased with them as well. Great buy!", 
    "I am in the middle about this table. While it is very sturdy the picture shows a table with six chairs (which is what we ordered) but the table is only large enough for four chairs.The tabke top also came with a slight ding on the top. The chairs that go with the table are beautiful and quite sturdy though.", 
    "I've used this for a year now and no issues at all. My kids use it daily for eating, homework, etc. It has stood the test of time and great quality.", 
    "I didn't realize that there was a dent at one corner of the very dark table top until after I assembled it. I examined the packaging after discovering the damage and, sure enough, there was a small hole in one corner of the cardboard box and inner Styrofoam that corresponded to the location of the dent in the table top. The package was so heavy and difficult to maneuver that I dreaded the thought of exchanging it and having to start all over again. The problem is that you can't repair damage to the synthetic laminate top like you can with real wood. I filled in the hole with a dark wood repair product, but it doesn't look good. Keep this in mind if you buy this table. Any damage to the top will result in a permanent and obvious scar.", 
    "Great table. It is beautiful and looks great at my house. It looks bigger in the picture or the chairs I got are too big, but it is the perfect size for a new family. We love it! Our only concern was the bolt not going in. It was like the insert for the bolt was stripped before the bolt even went in.", 
    "The table looks perfect in my kitchen, I like the size of it and the color. I can't think of anything negative to say. Well, it was heavy for me alone to get it inside the house and put it together, but a friend helped a little. It was easy for 2 people to do this job.", 
    "I love this table. Fits perfectly in our space. Elegant, but not overkill.", 
    "This is my 2nd sorrento table. The first got damaged in a move 4 years after I bought it. I like this table, which I why I purchased another one.", 
    "We just had it delivered today. Piece of cake to assemble. Beautiful dark stain. Has appearance of high end furniture. Very satisfied with purchase. Can easily fit six chairs. We matched it with the Keitaro Dark Brown Modern Dining Chairs from Overstock. Excellent match. Highly recommend both.", 
    "Love this table. It is wonderfully priced and long enough to seat 6 chairs. I love it.", 
    "All of the customer reviews on this table were right on. This is a GREAT table for the price and for what it's supposed to be-- an affordable, smallish table that isn't meant to last for generations to come. If you purchase the table knowing that, you will be pleased with your purchase. I received the table in about 3-4 days after ordering. I am the least handy person in probably the entire world, and I was able to put it together all by myself in about 15 minutes. It looks great-- looks higher quality and more substantial than what it probably is, but I will be mindful of the fact that it probably scratches easily. Although it says it can seat 6 people...the people better be tiny. I think 4 people at the table is more realistic, especially on a daily basis. You could seat 6, but no one will be comfy for long, and there will be no room for any extra dishes on the table. However, I do think it could work for 6 people in a pinch and if you didn't plan to have serving dishes on the table as well as individual plates, cups, silverware. The style of the table is clean, simple, contemporary, and very attractive. For my use, it's perfect. When we buy a larger house and have a formal dining room, I will buy a more permanent, longer lasting table. For now, this is exactly what I needed for my large eat-in kitchen and it was worth every penny.", 
    "I purchased this 4 years AGO, and it takes a real beating. excellent for the price. and value. this is not cheap at all. so keep in mind when you purchase .... 5 pc dining sets, they are usually the lowest quality. this i have the table and 4 of the matching chairs. very heavy, and easy to assemble. great for buffet entertaining, since it's got plenty of width. seats 4 easily. 6 with a little cramping. an excellent buy, for us.", 
    "If your looking for something modern and contemporay..i suggest getting this table. It look awesome with the Wenges chairs. I wont recommend this if your looking for a big dining table because it will only sit 6 ppl max.", 
    "This is a great little table with a nice dark chocolate finish (more brown than black), very similar to most wenge finishes you'll find out there. Very easy to assemble and surprisingly sturdier than some other more expensive tables I found at huge home furniture stores. So it's a great value especially if you are going for a more modern look (aka Calligaris) for much, much less! Goes great with the black dining chairs that I also ordered from Overstock. The only problem is that while 6 chairs fit, when pushed all the way under the table there's about a 4-6 inch gap at the ends and about 2 inches on the sides between the table and the back of the chairs (and we have small chairs). If only it was just a few inches wider and half a foot longer it'd be perfect. But it fits our smallish kitchen nook so it works well for us and has stood up to our two little kids so far!", 
    "We love this table - its very elegant in appearance. The only complaint we have is the lack of description of the color/stain of the table. On the picture it looked more cherry and once we got it, it looked more chestnut/chocolate. Good, sturdy and high quality table.", 
    "I also hesitated to buy furniture online but after finally finding this one which is solid rubberwood and reading all these wonderful reviews I bought it...Then afterwards thought of cancelling! I'm so glad I got it! It looks much better in person than the picture. I think it looks very dark almost that dark brown black in the picture--but it is actually more of a dark walnut color --which is beautiful..also I thought it looked a bit too boxy in the picture but it really does look extremely beautiful. Mine does not really have any blemishes--I really looked closely and noticed a minor scratch on the side and on the top but nothing that you can even notice unless you are really staring at the table 3 inches away from it. I also got the dark brown cosmopolitian chairs and they really look beautiful with the table. It looks so elegant and seems heavy and solid and worth so much more....Also I only bought 4 chairs but might get two more...I'm not sure why some people say it is smaller than they thought ....it's actually larger than I thought ....and would fit 6 comfortably. You won't be disappointed! It is really very nice....The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 for apperance was because it did have a slight blemish...but as I said not noticable.", 
    "I have owned this table for about three weeks and I am very happy with it. It came quickly and was very well packaged. Assembly is easy - you just need to screw the legs in ( the table is heavy so I needed some help turning it over once the legs were in). I have no complaints about the size - it is exactly what I expected, the measurements were accurate. The table seats four comfortably. You can also seat six, but it may be a little tight. Overall it is a great sturdy table.", 
    "The table went together very quickly and very solid. I've had it around 3 children and 3 adults (it really gets used) not a wiggle in it yet, inspite of catching my 9 year old granddaughter trying to make it wiggle and the 5yr old and 13 yr old wrestling with the dog under it. As the title indicates, I'm very pleased.", 
    "For the price, it's a good deal, with pros and cons:Pros: Inexpensive; easy to assemble; sturdy; solid wood; realtively hip; will be easy to take apart and reassemble when moving.Cons: Looks *significanlty* bigger on the website - 6 chairs will be super tight with not much room for serving trays, tho great for 4; had ding in top, but I can live with it for the price; dark chocolate color is making it somewhat tough to find chairs with same wood color (don't like the ones that come with it, just personal taste). Overall I'd recommend, especially for smaller dining rooms (like apartments).", 
    "I simply love this dining table. Believe it or not I put it together in 5 minutes. It is sturdy and it fits pefectly in my family room with a comfortable sofa. No one recognizes that it is a dining table, paired with a chic look of those rich leather chairs purchsed also from overstock. Thanks again overstock!!!", 
    "This is a simple yet beautiful solid wood table. It's a little on the small side to fit 6 chairs, but it can be done as long as you aren't afraid to be close to the person next to you. The finish is very nice and it's a good solid piece of furniture. It was super easy to put together. I bought 6 of the matching Sorrento chairs to go with it and it looks great.", 
    "I bought 2 of these. I can arrange a large square for 8+ or place them end to end and seat even more people. They are sturdy and have held up to many large family dinners.", 
    "Very good and well built. Easy to assemble.", 
    "I like the table, it's beautiful. The downside, not real wood, it's pressboard or MDF.", 
    "I use it as a desk. I did not see any noticeable scratches after several months' uses. It is strong and beautiful.", 
    "Nice table assembled in a snap Looks nice in my kitchen", 
    "This table fits perfectly in my medium size room. A great buy from Overstock!", 
    "My table is awesome and it looks really good with my wall tiles.", 
    "Came with a little scratch on the top, but i used one of those markers that cover up scratches on wood/laminate floors and after that i can't even tell where the scratch used to be. The table is just the size i needed for a rather small to medium size dinning room. It's stable, seems to be durable. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the color wasn't the rich espresso i expected, but I paired it with the Christopher Brown Leather chairs which looks terrific together. Excellent product for the price.", 
    "Arrived in 2 days, boxes in perfect shape except for 1 corner no damage to table Super simple to put together. Looks great.", 
    "Table arrived quickly, was easy to assemble and looks great!", 
    "Value for money, quality and look seems really good. We love the dark brown color and assembly is super easy! Would definitely recommend!", 
    "arrived on time and is the perfect size for 6 chairs", 
    "Simply georgous. Highly recommended", 
    "Table was easy to put together and very nice quality", 
    "Very sturdy and easy to maintain, just love it!", 
    "I returned other tables before because I was looking for good quality on a budget. This table made me so happy. I paired it with mid-century modern chairs in white and it looks perfect. Love that the height is on the lower end, it's perfect for lower dining chairs. Beautiful color, rich brown. Everyone loves it.", 
    "Fits four comfortably, good quality for the price", 
    "I'm in love with my table it's what i expected!!", 
    "Like many other reviews here, I found this table to be tremendous for the price. Solid wood top (important to me), nice finish, very sturdy. I wish there was a slightly larger version, but this one seats 6 well enough. Also shipping took only 3 days total, very impressed with Overstock on this one.", 
    "al tough a lote deceiving, it's presented with chairs, and it doesn't come with them. But we are very pleased with its quality..", 
    "I ordered new dining room chairs and they did not fit properly with my current dining table so I decided to just buy a new one. This is a great table and the price can't be beat! It arrived in 2 separate packages (table top in one, table legs in the other) without a single scrape or dent and took me only about 8 minutes to assemble. It is solid wood and is very, very sturdy. I have 4 parson upholstered dining chairs around the table and they fit quite comfortably. I could maybe fit 2 chairs on the ends if I had to entertain 6 but it would be a very crowded table. This table is very nice looking and it both looks and feels like an expensive table. I'm extremely happy with my purchase!", 
    "Easy assembly. One natural looking imperfection on the table top. Otherwise a nice addition to the town house.", 
    "This classic table suits many decors. The quality and style is topnotch.", 
    "Love this table! I received it today and already put it together. Did not order the chairs but another reviewer gave a number which I need to look up. I will need to review them before order. Again I could not be more pleased, the quality and color just beautiful. Tks Overstock another great choice.", 
    "We love this table. It was delivered without a scratch. It is solid wood and a nice deep brown finish. Perfect for our small dining room.", 
    "Very nice table way better than expected! Sturdy nice walnut color thought it would be a darker tone though, not sure if it scratches easily. Have it with a plastic transparent table cover over it. Good size, not too heavy as mentioned.", 
    "I bought this table because the style and size were exactly what I wanted but the quality of this table far exceeded my expectations. You would think it's worth 3x as much as its cost. It's everything I wanted.", 
    "The table was a little smaller than expected. Looks more expensive than the price. Very simple clean lines.Great buy.", 
    "The table came very well packed. Assembly is very easy. I like the contemporary look, color, size and finish. The reason I took off one star is that the table top is veneered instead of solid wood which is stated in the product spec.", 
    "When we first received the table, the table top was damaged. A corner of the table looked like someone took a bite out of it. I contacted Overstock and they immediately sent a new table top. The customer service was outstanding. The table itself is the perfect shape and size for the space I purchased it for. It does scratch easily and you can tell that it isn't a solid piece of quality wood, but for the price I cannot complain.", 
    "I agree with other reviewers- this definitely looks more expensive than it is. We routinely have 6 or so people at our table, and this fits us nicely, even with putting food dishes in the middle. Not huge, not super small either. Great buy.", 
    "Love the table. Very solid and well made, Easy to assemble. Looks like it came from a showroom. Top is not as portrayed in the photo...same color as legs....a little reddish brown, moreso than I expected, but it works anyway. Am using with 4 large parsons chairs, but could add two if needed. Only issue is that it doesn't expand, but I didn't really need it to.", 
    "The table top seems thin maybe 3/4\" thick. Also the legs are thinner than they appear in pictures.", 
    "Great find!! I'm glad we bought it. We got a great deal and it looks like we spent a fortune on it. My father-in-law has a wood shop and was impressed with the quality of the wood. I thought it was going to be an espresso color and its more of a medium brown but I still like it. Very easy to assemble as well. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "Strong, beautiful finish, very easy to put together and looks like a table that would have cost hundreds of dollars more. Another great find from overstock!", 
    "For the price, this table is an amazing buy. Here are a few reasons why. . . 1. easy to put together, 2. sturdy, 3. great looking, 4. looks much more expensive than it is, 5. super easy to clean. . . perfect! I would definitely recommend this product. Thanks, Overstock!", 
    "Very good quality. Nice finish and easy to assemble!", 
    "Solid wood,looks good in my small DR and came well-packed and undamaged.One caveat,the main box weighs about 75 lbs. and may require 2 to move.", 
    "The table is smaller than the description and it is not an expresso color. The color is more of a walnut brown. It is a nice table but I would not consider it for a formal area. I was able to make it work but was disappointed with the color and size. If you are looking for something casual than this table is for you.", 
    "This is a great table. The only thing that would make it a 5 star is if it were about 2 inches taller. My husband is 6'5\" and can just barely get his legs under the table. If I'm wearing tall heels, I can barely get my legs under the table.Otherwise, this is a superb table. It is very solid and there's no chance of our 2 year old pushing it over as we were concerned about with the counter height table that we just eliminated from our home.", 
    "Excellent contemporary look at a very reasonable price. Fast delivery with an easy setup. I totally Love it!", 
    "Bought this table for my house full of bachelors, wanted a table that looked good, could take a beating, and was cheap. This table fit the bill, and was easy to put together. Had a few dings from shipping, but nothing to write home about.", 
    "We love this table!! Sturdy legs, perfect height, great color and finish. We even love that there is not a very big ledge or overhang running around the outside. Exactly what we were looking for. Fits 6 comfortably.", 
    "Beautiful table and just the simple, clean and blocky style I wanted. I never assembled it because the color was not as expected. Description lists brown as the color, which it is, but I think \"espresso\" is a more accurate choice. Other items are listed as espresso so I assumed this table wouldn't be espresso. I was looking for something more on the yellow/brown versus lavender/brown side of the scale... if that makes sense. Return was processed quickly and to my satisfaction.", 
    "This is a great little table. I can comfortably fit one chair on each side, so it's not huge--but it's perfect for our eat-in kitchen. It's solid, the finish is a beautiful brown, and it goes nicely with our upholstered red velvet chairs. It's a basic so you could put just about any kind of chair you want with it. And assembly was a snap, just screw on the legs.", 
    "While I really like the table, I was a little upset to find out that the chairs were not included. I understand that it was my mistake because I did not read the description as closely as I should have, but the picture is very deceitful. But the table is beautiful and just what I wanted. Now I have to look for chairs that match.", 
    "Very inpressed with this table and would buy another one if ever needing. Fast shipping, very easy to assemble and great quality.", 
    "Easy to assemble and very sturdy! Nice, quality wood and great color!!", 
    "This table is sturdy and beautiful. Exceptional item at a great price.", 
    "Overall a great table, and the price you can't beat. Very sturdy and easy to assemble, just need to put the legs on top all one piece. The style is simple and exactly what i was looking for. The color matches my kitchen almost perfectly like it was part of my cabinetry.", 
    "This table is the best wood I've seen in most higher in dept. stores! Very heavy, sturdy and built very well. It's more on the simple clean line style but it works for me right now and was very affordable. I love my table.", 
    "The quality and ease of assembly of this product was great. However, the color varied pretty significantly from the picture. In the picture, it is a dark wood finish. In reality, it is a medium brown wood. Unfortunately, my chairs are dark wood, so it doesn't match very well. Other than that, the table was a good value for the price-- It is sturdy, and heavy, making it a good investment.", 
    "It's a great table and very substantially constructed. I can't believe it was that cheap.", 
    "This table is really worth the money! Well finished, good size.", 
    "I bought this for our lunch table at the office. It is fairly heavy and extremely sturdy. It has a nice classic look, neither too contemporary or too traditional. Has held up very well. Good purchase.", 
    "I spent a lot of time to find out a good dining table. And, the review comments were so helpful. Finally I choose this one, and my husband and I were surprised at its quality and study body and legs! You can't imagine how pretty this is, and the color is awesome! I am very glad that I choose this table! Love it so much!", 
    "Barely got it and already getting compliments. Solid table. Wish they made a larger size.", 
    "This had great reviews hence my order. For the price its a great table. The colour is described as Wenge ( what the hell is that ! ) but from the pic it looks like a dark brown/red/black. I received the table and the colour is really a walnut tone. lovely colour actually. It has modern lines and simple which is what i was looking for. Great value for money i think", 
    "Very beautiful, , heavy, well made table. It does look a bit smaller than I hoped, but goes great in the space I have for it. Beautiful, deep colors and it's really, really heavy, so you know it's of good quality.", 
    "The table is sturdy. We were looking for a sturdy table to place on our porch, and this table fit the bill.", 
    "My husband put this table together in no time and he is not mechanically inclined.I like it ,not too big and its sturdy.6 chairs can work,I have four. And it's enough room.", 
    "Some how I missed reading the length of the table so I was disappointed when it arrived. The table is solid and sturdy but seats 4 comfortably not 6 which was what I needed.", 
    "The table is a wonderful value. It was easy to assemble and very sturdy and attractive. Would highly recommend", 
    "I love this table. It is beautiful in person. It was also packaged VERY well compared to other items I have purchased on Overstock. Highly recommend.", 
    "Purchase with confidence. This table is the right size for our smaller dining area and comfortably fits 6 smaller sized leather parsons chairs around it. The quality is much higher than we would have expected it to be at this price. Easy to assemble.", 
    "The table is solid and came together 1, 2, 3 very easy. The color is rich, but with a dull shade to it.", 
    "I did not realize that the table was going to be so sturdy. I was very pleasantly surprised by the weight and look. I would absolutely buy this again!", 
    "The table is of solid construction and is a great deal for a 5 x 3 table of this quality. Everyone who's seen it is impressed.", 
    "A very simple brown table. We ordered a custom glass top to protect from scratches bc it scratches easily. ($***) Makes the table look a lot nicer. A little smaller than I would have liked. Make sure you measure the chairs you buy with table to make sure it fits. We purchased Ethan Allen overstock white chairs with square backs and fits perfectly. Seats four comfortably. We also purchase white overstock leather/chrome bench to use as extra seating for six. Would like a more modern look but chandelier, chairs, art and paint help it out.", 
    "Perfect size for NY size rooms which are somewhat small. This table is sleek, modern and sturdy! Nice contemporary style that would fit in to many decors as it is simple but classically shaped.", 
    "This table was an excellent choice. Very solid construction and stable legs. Easy to assemble. Good value for the price.", 
    "The table is very sturdy, it comes in about five boxes (three for chairs, one for table top, & one for legs). It was relatively easy to assemble. My wife actually put it together while I was on my way home. The only thing missing from this table is expandability, there's no leaf or extension for this table. Other than that, we love it.", 
    "This is a very heavy table, which is a good thing. Beautiful color, overall great quality table. Didn't take my husband long to put the legs on it. It was packaged very well. Wish it was just a little longer it really only holds 4 large chairs. There is no way to make this a six person table.", 
    "This table is a lovely color and was really easy to put together. It didn't take more than 10 minutes to assemble, just screw in the four legs and I was done. We've really been enjoying it.", 
    "This table is heavy and sturdy. Couldn't ask for a better value! Definitely exceeded my expectations. Easily seats 6 for dinner.", 
    "Great purchase. I love this table it adds a lot to our dining room. The color is really pretty. The size works amazing and fit so nicely. Go get it great deal.", 
    "This table seems great and half the price of comparable tables in retail stores.", 
    "This table looks like the Very High End Tables that cost much much more than what I originally paid at Overstock. My Dinining & Kitchen Area look as if it came from a Custom Made store. I am truly very happy with it all, color, size and delivery, not a mark on it, Just Beautiful!", 
    "This dining table was exactly what we were looking for. Nice dark brown, heavy, well made product. Perfect size for my kitchen breakfast nook. Not over sized, but big enough for 4 large chairs. We love the modern design.", 
    "Great quality, great look for a great price!! Love our new table. It fits 4 chairs around it nicely. Overstock is so fast at shipping for $2.95.", 
    "I love this table. It is very solid and sturdy with a beautiful finish. It was very easy to assemble. It required only screwing the legs on. This took less than 10 minutes. It is a good medium size. I have six parson chairs that fit around the table (they just fit) It is cramped for all six so six people for dinner maybe be pushing it.", 
    "I don't typically give 5 stars on a product, but this table gets them. It's sturdy, beautifully made and looks so nice in my dining room. I have purchased tons of furniture from Overstock in the past year, and I have to say this table ranks in the top 2. You can't go wrong with this table with this price.", 
    "Excellent quality for the price! My family and Iove this table!", 
    "I absolutly love the look of the table, look amazing with the tiffany brown chairs", 
    "Excellent packaging. No dings, scratches or cracks. Measures almost 60 inches in length and almost 36 inches in width. Perfect for a small dining area. Can fit 6 narrow to medium width size chairs nicely. Otherwise, 4 chairs would be the most roomy. Great price for a wooden table. I definitely recommend purchasing this table. Thanks again O.", 
    "I am in love with my new table! i paired this table w/ beautiful chairs that i ordered from overstock.com and i've never been happier with a set in my life!!!", 
    "I love this table. Its very sturdy and looks much more expensive than it is. I would recommend this table to anyone.", 
    "I was looking for a simple, solid, and practical dining room table without spending a fortune. This is exactly what I was looking for! The construction is solid and sturdy. The design is simple and elegant. The finish is beautiful and easy to clean. I don't need to worry about scratching it easily or leaving water marks. The simple design and neutral color goes with just about any decor. I ordered the Warehouse of Tiffany Shino Orange Dining Chairs (Set of 4) to go with it and it's a perfect match! I absolutely LOVE my new dining set and, not only did I not spend a fortune, but it doesn't look that way either. Very easy assembly, no particle board, no cheap veneers! I would definitely recommend this product from Overstock. My only word of caution...this table is very heavy and I would not recommend putting it together or carrying the boxes on your own if you're a wimp like me!", 
    "My husband and I have always been concerned about ordering furniture on line since you can't touch and feel it. I have to say we were more than pleased with the color, quality and beauty of this table. It was the perfect fit for my smaller dinning area and does not overwhelm the room. I ordered the table on a Sunday and it was delivered to my door on Friday in perfect condition. I put it together by myself (without the husbands help) and was done in 10 minutes. I will not hestitate to order from Overstock in the future.", 
    "The table is very heavy and sturdy but the top of the table scratches easily if you slide a glass on the table. The top is wood just like the rest of it, even though the photo looks like it might have a white top because of the glare in the photo. It was very easy to put together, but its very heavy. Its a great table to have for a short time with a little investment so that works for us. It fits very well in our tiny nyc apartment. The challenge is to find chairs for it that match. I ended up going with the white leather keyhole chairs. I love the way it looks!", 
    "I love this table. I live in a small apartment in the city and I needed something that could double as a work desk. This is perfect! Seats four comfortably and is solid. I love the lines; it's elegant. Very easy to put together and a great price for a quality piece. Highly recommended.", 
    "Good size,sturdy,beautiful table, delivery fast. It wasn't hard to assemble at all. I assembled it on my own. I love it. love it !!!!!!!!", 
    "I wanted just a plain good size, modern looking dining room table for my condo. I was close to getting one at West Elm but didn't like the price. They had it at Ikea but the quality isn't good. So I was so happy to find this, and with very cheap shipping. The table arrived quickly and it wasn't hard to assemble at all. I assembled it on my own. The hardest part was flipping the table back up but I got all MacGyver on it, and was able to flip it myself. The color is a nice rich dark brown, it's heavy and the quality of the wood is really good. It's also a perfect size!", 
    "This table looks great and matches well with other dark wood items. After six months of use there are some scratches in the surface, but none deep enough yet to show any color difference. This table should be babied on the top if you want it to look expensive for longer, but for the price, I think it looks great. Sits four very comfortably with serving dishes, but with six you would probably need to leave serving plates elsewhere.", 
    "I am an avid online shopper, and I must say that this product is absolutely my best purchase...ever. I went on a whim buying a dining table without seeing it in person...but I am so glad I did! I get SO MANY compliments on this table. It's so simple, yet so elegant. The color is absolutely beautiful, the design is so sleek yet makes such a statement in my dining room. I only purchased four chairs to go along with the table, but I think I may purchase two more. It may be a tight squeeze...but I think it will work out. The price was excellent, and the quality was beyond expectation. This will be a table I can keep in my home for many years to come, as it is extremely durable and the design is timeless!", 
    "I love this table. It does have a large scratch across the top and I need to report it. However I am not sending it back, too much trouble to disassemble. The table is sturdy and doesn't wobble.", 
    "I purchased this table last year and it is still as sturdy as it was when i first got it.. its very heavy and great for a small dining room.. looks more expensive than the price. i would recommend this to anyone that has limited space...", 
    "Matches the Alexander Wenge cabinet. Went together easily and looks great in my open kitchen. Sturdy contemporary design.I got the 6 Springdale wenge chairs also. They were just a bit darker than this table and the cabinet. It does seat 4 most comfortably but 6 can be done. Overall very pleased so I just ordered another piece of furniture form O.com.", 
    "Table arrived with a badly damaged corner, not sure if the leg would even stay on, table is very nice, and just what I was looking for. Contacted customer service and was advised they could not replace the table top, offered me a price decrease to keep it or send it back. Since I had already sold my other table I decided to keep it. It's still a nice table even with the damage. Hope it will hold up with the 4 grandchildren that live with me!!", 
    "This table is a great find. the price was a steal. It's the perfect size for my apartment and its a great color.", 
    "I needed a cheap dining room table for the new house. Since I don't actually eat there, I wasn't looking for anything expensive. I have to say, this table pulls off being a solid-looking table for a fraction of the price. It arrived quickly without any blemishes that I noticed. Obviously if you spend more, you can find a 300-lb solid oak dining table that will last forever, but this is a great go-between until then. Easy to assemble, and it's not made out of balsa wood. It's very sturdy and the color and finish is excellent. I paired it with 6 chairs similar to those in the photo and it looks like it was made as a set. I couldn't be happier with it. It was exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "I love the look and size of this table. The color was amazing and it goes great in my kitchen. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because I'm not crazy about the materials. Although they are light weight, which makes the table super easy to move around, this also means it's easy to get dings and scratches. I'd recommend putting a piece of glass on top the table as soon as you get it to keep this from happening. If you don't have children and aren't rough on your things, probably won't be a big deal for you.", 
    "Six people can easily sit with this table. The product arrived quickly in 2 packages, but of course with a small dent on one edge of the flat board. Its so easy to fix the table and all the legs fit evenly. Hard part is to buy the matching chairs. I bought the chairs in amazon.com (Coaster Contemporary Style Dining Chairs with free shipping) and waiting to see whether they would match the table or not. I am totally satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "This table is perfect in our small dining room. It is on the small side though so if you are looking for something to seat more than 6 ever this is not the table for you. it looks high end and we really like it.", 
    "Just the right, small sized rectangular table for my small dining area and the red burnt leather chairs go with this table beautifully. Easy assembly-Solid table, nice finish and very well packed! Perfect on arrival.", 
    "I ordered this table a few weeks ago. Very easy to assemble, and is high quality. The table is heavy and looks great. I bought this for the staff room at work. I received a lot of compliments on it and I think it will withstand the wear and tear. It really makes the staff room look great.", 
    "Table is just what I wanted. I love the color and style.", 
    "Great table! Great buy. Solid purchase. I recommend it for a smaller dining area. Works perfect in my loft! The wife loves it! So you know it's a good buy!!", 
    "The table is just what we wanted. It took maybe 10 minutes to put it together. It seems very solid.", 
    "First of all, Overstock has a ridiculously stupid picture for this table. The table doesn't have a white or metallic top - it is a very, very nice dark brown all over. It's a very simple table but it looks nice and it's quite sturdy and surprisingly heavy. One thing to warn you about, if you need a big table this isn't for you. This is a small table and you can get six chairs around it, but it's a pretty tight fit. I've got six chairs and it works but my guests won't have much elbow room. Four chairs and you'll have plenty of space, six chairs is doable but a wee bit tight. Assembly is super easy, eight bolts (13mm) and you're done - my twelve year old daughter could have assembled this for me. Great table, great value and if you have a small space, this will work for you!", 
    "Very quick and efficient delivery. Went together easily, but is quite heavy.", 
    "Received table today in two boxes, top and legs. The color is a rich expresso and looks better than the description. It took several minutes to unbox and bolt legs on, no problem with assembly. The size looks like a large secretary table, we are using as break room/conference table at the office and it is perfect sized. Best online purchase I've made this year!", 
    "Table is solid, nice finish. Very simple to put together. Couple of dings and dents in the table from shipping. Couldnt be bothered to get a replacement. Table would have got 5 stars if not for the dents!", 
    "Sturdy table with a nice finish. Easy to clean and is holding up well to my two toddlers. Super-easy to assemble.", 
    "It was easy to install. It seems to stay sturdy for a long time. I'm not sure if the top surface stays as good. It's simple and beautiful. I like it so far (1 week of use).", 
    "The table arrived in perfect condition. Very easy to assemble! The only thing was maybe my measurements were off but the table was too small for me once I put it together. The picture of the table appears much larger and looks like 6 chairs would easily fit. This was not the case and I only ordered the table and was going to buy 6 chairs later. I also found the legs aren't as 'chunky' as they appear in the picture. BUT overall the table is very nice and sturdy it just did not work for me.", 
    "This table is well worth the money. Am very pleased", 
    "Very happy with this purchase, looks great in our dining room and the chairs we bought are an almost perfect match. Easy to put together. Only drawback was that I wanted a table with leaves, but for this price, could not find one I liked. Overall very happy.", 
    "I had been searching for a 60\" table for my breakfast nook. This table truly fit the bill. It is very solidly built, easily assembled and looks very elegant in the nook. No dings were seen, no scratches and the holes lined up extremely easily. I matched the table with some metal \"navy\" chairs and it is a really nice combo. Overstock impressed me again.", 
    "This is great dining room table. It took me all of 20 minutes to assemble it. For the free shipping and low price you can't beat the quality. I would've paid more than double for this table. Bravo Overstock for offering quality and affordable furniture. My only issue now is selecting the perfect chairs - which is an awesome problem to have.", 
    "Received the table quickly. Easy to put together. Using in my eat-in kitchen and it looks very nice. Would definitely purchase again.", 
    "Sturdy, easy to assemble, heavy. I really like the chunkier legs, makes it look well made. The top surface is veneer-like almost soft but still nice. Great deal!", 
    "This table is beautiful. It looks better than the picture. It was in excellent condition upon arrival.", 
    "The table is absolutely beautiful and fits well in my dining room.", 
    "Very nice, sturdy table, easy assembly, beautiful finish.", 
    "I had been looking for a dining table that met my strict criteria and price range for a while and this table fit both perfectly. The table arrived quickly and was well packed so it arrived in perfect conditions. The dark brown color is rich yet not too dark, the design is contemporary, and the construction is solid. I have to agree with other reviews that the table looks like a much more expensive piece of furniture. Putting it together was literally just screwing in the legs. If the dimensions and color fit your needs, this is a perfect buy.", 
    "I had been looking for just such a table following a complete kitchen remodel in my home. I ordered the Sorento table and was very pleased when it arrived less than a week later. It was well packed and went together super easy. No damage! It has a hefty appearance and feel and the color is terrific.", 
    "After reading the good reviews and looking over the specifications, I ordered this table and I got exactly what I expected - a great looking table. Solid wood, very sturdy and looks a lot more expensive that it really is. I think it is great value for money. Arrived within three days, absolutely not a scratch or dent. Took all of 30 mins to assemble the legs to the table. A little Pledge to bring out the shine and I am 100% happy with the quality of the table and speed of arrival.", 
    "This table is absolutely beautiful! It is solid, contemporary and very well made. I love it!", 
    "This table is perfect! I shopped around for a while before I purchased this table. I amglade I got it. It is the perfect size and yes it seats 6 with no problem. It was easy to put together and was shipped really fast. I would recommend this table to all of my friends!!", 
    "I can't say enough about this table. The delivery was quick and the assembly easy and painless. Some of the other reviewers mentioned scratches and dents but I couldn't find a single one. I'm very happy with this table. It makes my dinningroom look as if I spent A LOT more than I did!!! What a deal!", 
    "Table was easy to assemble straight out of the box. It is sturdy and looks great. It has a simple modern look to it. I paired it with the thin framed Amsterdam chairs found here on Overstock and couldn't be happier. I'm really happy with my purchase and have received many compliments. I highly recommend this table!", 
    "This table is a beautiful color just as depicted in the picture. It is a very solid table and fits perfectly in our room. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because with my padded chairs it is just a little low to slide under comfortably without knocking your knees. But I really do LOVE it.", 
    "Table is just as it appears in the ad. SOLID construction, no wobbles, very simple installation of the legs, and a quality product for the money. Finding chair to match exactly was a chore, but before you put the table together, bring one of the legs with you when you shop at your local store to match up the color. You might look silly carrying a leg with you, but hey, it works ! lol Don't hesitate to order this product. The other 1000 reviews arent wrong ! Perhaps Overstock will match the table with some other chairs as a set, as thos epictured I was not able to find anywhere on their site.", 
    "This is a great looking table, I use it for a desk, but the edge is loosing the stain, it will have to be restained one of these days, it's very sturdy and well made otherwise.", 
    "Nice table for the price. It feels like heavy, quality wood and was easy to assemble and a good size (doesn't overwhelm my little apartment) but I hoped it would have a little more texture or interest. Overall, wasn't as blown away as the other reviewers as it's just a basic table but I would have paid a lot more elsewhere for a table of this quality plus shipping costs. One major complaint however - I live in a walkup (3 short flights) and it was torture getting UPS to bring the item up. Took them 5 days of supposed \"attempts\" and a lot of inconvenience on my part until I finally waited downstairs and cornered the guy into bringing it up. Overstock, if UPS is not willing to deliver this table to a walkup, please use another delivery service.", 
    "Great table for the price. Just as described and identical to the online photos on overstock.com. Simple assembly. Packed appropriately to avoid damage. Overall excellent buy. Very economical.", 
    "We purchased two of these 5 foot long tables to form a conference table in our office. We were amazed when they arrived because they are very high quality pieces. They come disassembled, but were a breeze to put together. We purchased 12 chairs to go with them and those are also very high quality. I would buy them again. On thing to be aware of is that these are fine wooden tables and the finish can be scratched.", 
    "Just received this table for our kitchen remodel. Our carpenter recommended purchasing a table we liked that would closely match our cabinets...came to Overstock and found this table which perfectly matches our Cherry, Kaffe kitchen cabinets by Kraftmaid. Although we only needed the tabletop and one of the legs as we are installing it in a breakfast booth, the quality and color/finish is beautiful! No problems with damage as others have had, no scratches whatsoever. Much better quality than tables we saw at our local furniture store and less expensive for sure! If you are looking for a darker, not quite espresso color, this table is the one to buy. Well worth the money!", 
    "Great value, attractive table, durable, sturdy, lovely color, no regrets.", 
    "I am 100% pleased with this table - I was looking for a simple contemporary table that didn't appear cheap and I found it at Overstock. This table is sturdy and contemporay and doesn't take long to put it together (less then 30 minutes). I received so many compliments on this table during my Thanksgiving dinner - I was toggling back and forth whether I should put a table cloth because I was afraid it would get scratched up during dinner - well it got so busy that I didn't put a table cloth on it and it was absolutely fine - no scratches and no wear and tear! I love the finish, - so easy to maintain! I love overstock.com - they never disappoint me!", 
    "The Sorrento Dining Table is a great table for the price. We have 3 young boys, so the size is great for the 5 of us and still works in our small dining area. The table looks good, is quite sturdy and was very easy to assemble, all of which are things we were looking for, so it met our expectations. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is due to the fact that it does seem to scratch fairly easily, which with 3 young boys is a bit of an issue and it is lighter than I expected it to be. It is more brown than espresso, but other than that we are very happy with our purchase.", 
    "This is a great table for an amazing price. Looks perfect in our apt. I purchased it through the ***** website and got a lot more in return!", 
    "just received table today. put it together in half hour all by myself (and I'm not handy at all). nice clean lines. very sturdy. nice finish. great table for this price. i spent months looking but everything in this price range usually looks cheap and flimsy. this is def worth the money. love this table.", 
    "Nice table, good wood tone. On the small side but definitely seats 4-6 ppl", 
    "This is an amazing value. I love that the wood is sustainable and the simple, clean lines of the design go with our zen environment. We have a small home, so the table is the perfect size and still able to seat 6 people although we have svelte family and friends. Big people would be limited to 4 at the table. The original table arrived damaged and Overstock.com promptly replaced it without a hassle. We've been using this table for about 3 years and it still looks great. All in all, this is a wonderful table, especially for the money.", 
    "Since I could not see it in person, I debated purchasing this table for quite some time. Well, I finally got it and love it! I have a very small dining room and this table couldn't be more perfect for the space. It's very heavy duty (no wobbles) and fits my 4 kids and hubby perfectly. I paired it with a bench on one side, and 4 chairs. Has a very modern look and the color is a nice rich brown (sometimes espresso is too dark) if you are considering buying this table, do it!..... it does not disappoint, I promise!", 
    "It is a nice, modern table and very easy to assemble(need to screw the 4 legs only).After reading other reviews, bought 6 Venice Espresso side dining chairs which matched well although chairs are a little bit darker than the table. Because of the lighting In the picture, table top looks like having different color than the legs, but in reality they have the same color. I am happy with my overall purchase.", 
    "This table far exceeded my expectations. It is a very heavy & sturdy table. No wobbles for this table. It was easy to put together and looks great . It can stand up to my small grandchildren and their crayons which easily wipes clean. No water marks from glasses also. I bought two benches which match perfectly.", 
    "This table is very solid- not at all wobbly or flimsy. It's easy to clean and looks well made. The only con is that it seems to scratch fairly easily but we do have a soon-to-be-3 yr old little girl who is very animated when she draws and likes to play with her utensils (drawing on the table) when we're not looking. We are very pleased with this purchase and I would not hesitate to recommend it to someone else.", 
    "I spend a lot of time searching for the perfect table,and ,finally i decide to get the Srrento table,even was a bit trouble to find the chairs to match. I am very pleased,it arrived in about a week,no scratch and perfect condition,to assemble was very easy,10-15 min.Looks great and the 6 parson leather dinning chairs are a close match,not perfect,but just fine. The reviews help me a lot to decide ,and the customer service as well,they are great!", 
    "I wanted a rich espresso color to go with a modern look. this is not that look. it's lighter. it's just dark brown... so I'll be sending it back!", 
    "This table is the perfect size to seat 6, yet fit comfortably in my small dining nook. It is really solid and just beautiful. Warning - it is MUCH lighter in color than it looks on the pictures on the web site. I bought the leather curved back chairs in espresso to match and they don't - they are just about black whereas the table is a medium brown. Order chairs accordingly!", 
    "This was our first purchase and we are happy we found this table! We had been looking for a simple but sturdy table for awhile. Really easy to put together, 10 minutes maybe. Looks great!", 
    "I am a frequent shopper and am always happy w/ overstock. They shipped this item quickly.My husband had an easy time putting it together. We are pleased with everything about the table.It looks a lot richer than in the picture and makes the buy even better.", 
    "I bought this table for an informal dining area off my kitchen. I couldn't be more pleased with it. It looks great, contemporary, and stylish, and really adds something to the area. Having read that it could scratch somewhat easily, we bought a glass cover for it. For the price of the table, this was definitely worth it. It is on the small side, especially for the width, but perfect for my purposes. I love the clean lines, dark chocolate color. It does not look cheap or spindly. A great value for the money. It arrived quickly, and was in perfect condition.", 
    "the table is very nice although I would not say it's extremely high end. Then again for that price I don't think you'll find anything beter. we used it for a kitchen table and it works well but for a dining room I would say it's not the most expensive looking. the quality is very good especially for the price and it took less than 5 minutes to put together. the finish does scratch sort of easily but I think that's just the nature of this type of wood/finish. We have seen very similar tables locally for double the cost . it's not huge so double check that the size works within your space", 
    "I ordered this table and received unbelievably fast shipping service from Overstock. When I opened the box, it was in perfect condition and took less than 10 minutes to assemble (just attach the legs). The table is gorgeous, and high quality - I love it!", 
    "It is a beautiful table for the price. Smaller than I hoped but still fits 6 chairs.", 
    "We received the table and have been using it now for 2 weeks or so. It arrived perfect and was what we expected. However, as with all nice things in the presence of young children, we have had to put a tablecloth on top to preserve the finish a bit. It is already scratched from their miscellaneous rough actions. Overall, it's a great buy and looks very nice in our dining room. Would recommend to purchase.", 
    "I was skeptical at first about buying this table (color, size) but I've been VERY pleased with this product. The color is a very rich, dark brown (almost black) and perfectly matches the 6 Wenge Dining chairs that I also purchased from Overstock. Together the table and chairs give the contemporary look I was looking for at a fraction of the price it would cost elsewhere. Assembly was also very easy.", 
    "Like pretty much everyone else, I'm really happy with this table. It's the right size for our small dining room, the price is right and looks more expensive than it is. I can't get over the fact that I can get furniture delivered to my door so cheaply! I love Overstock. :-)", 
    "I looked at many, many furniture stores over a period of 2 months hoping to find the right table & chairs but could not find what I was looking for. Before purchasing from Overstock, I read all the reviews and I decided to take a chance and bought the Sorrento table along with 4 leather chairs (#421558 which were highly recommended in one of the reviews). Upon arrival, the table had a crack in the top--I immediately went online and contacted Overstock and they said they would ship me a new top. The dining room chairs were perfect. The new top was shipped when we were out of town. We just arrived home and the table top is perfect. We love eveything: the color, the size and definitely the contemporary look--thank you Overstock!!", 
    "I bought this table based on the reviews and am very pleased with it. It is made of eco-friendly wood (rubberwood) and it is sturdy and attractive. It is also very versatile and can be placed with either fun or formal chairs. My only complaint is that there is not a leaf extension, but I knew that before I ordered it. It is also very easy to assemble--if I can do it, anyone can!!", 
    "great table, simple classic refined lookonly problem, had crush mark on one corner, but overall looks great", 
    "Table looks great and was extremely easy to assemble. The finish goes well with home d\u00e9cor. The only problem I have is that the table arrived with two dings about the size of a dime that were quite noticeable. I called overstock to have the table top exchanged but they didn\u00bft have any more in stock. I asked if they could send me a repair kit but they didn\u00bft have one. I wasn\u00bft discouraged though. I went to a hardware store bought matching paint sandpaper and wood filler. I did an ok job and it doesn\u00bft look to bad. Over stock did refund me a few dollars so that helped a bit.", 
    "This table is perfect! It's super easy to assemble and looks expensive. So glad we bought it!!!", 
    "This table arrived fast and without damage. It was easy to assemble and with the help of another person easy to put upright. It is a very pretty mahogany color. The legs looked very chunky in the picture, but they are not that way at all. Since the wood is from the maple family, the top is very hard, so writing on it, etc. is not a problem.I couldn't be happier with this table, which compliments the brown leather chairs that I purchased on Overstock as well.", 
    "This table was so easy to put together, I did it by myself as I did the chairs that I purchased to go with it. It is a heavy , sturdy table and I Love the rich color of the wood. Not as long as I thought it was going to be, which is great. It is the perfect fit for my family and I. I actually took pictures to show it off.", 
    "I received the table today, and it came in perfect condition, is darker than the picture (espresso shade) which was better for me, it looks more expensive than it is, made of solid wood, so... don't think it twice... buy it...you will be very happy with this purchase.", 
    "This table is a perfect size for my kitchen/dining room combo space at my cabin. The table is of very good quality, very heavy and sturdy. Assembly was a breeze since all that was needed was to attach the legs with the bolts and nuts provided. It's not quite dark enough to totally match my wenge color chairs, but it compliments it beautifully.", 
    "I have nothing bad to say about this table except like all dining tables, I've never eaten at it. Table looks great, I paired it with white suede highbacks and created a very glamorous look. Fabulous!", 
    "This table is great. We received it in perfect condition and it is beautiful! My husband said it was incredibly easy to put together. Just quit reading reviews and buy it already!", 
    "This table was delivered quickly, extremely easy to assemble it took maybe ten minutes, and it looks a lot more expensive than it is. Definately worth it every dollar.", 
    "I was very surprise to find that this table was very sturdy classy and nice for the price. I am truly enjoying this table and with the kids it should last for many many years to come. I was also thankful to see that the chocolate color was so rich and expensie looking. I brought a chocolate sofa bed from oerstock that matches ery well and is also a great piece. thanks overstock.", 
    "My roomate and i bought this table for our new apartment and were extremely pleastantly surprised when it came. Nice dark wood color, solid craftsmanship, and half the price of retail! delivered quickly and in perfect condition!", 
    "The table is beautiful and very easy to assemble. Just 8 bolts and washers.", 
    "We love the dining table! It\u00bfs very nice I got the matching chairs. It\u00bfs an excellent dining set\u00bfI would recommend to anyone\u00bfmy husband put it together right way\u00bfgood quality\u00bfit\u00bfs worth it!", 
    "I love the table. It is not as big as I would have liked but other than that i really like it. Very easy to put together and real sturdy. Definately worth the price.", 
    "this table is really solid, and beautiful, but definately have helpers to assemble, and lift upright. It's quite heavy!", 
    "I have looked at this table for months before I finally decided to buy it based on other reviews. The only drawbacks I had was, what kind of table would you really get for that price! I am happy to say you get a great table for the money - very solid and stylish. I did think the legs looked too chunky in the picture but they are not that big in person. The table was packaged well and so easy to put together - I had it all assembled and set up before my husband got home. I also bought the brown Cosmopolitan Leather Chairs to go with it and they look great together. The table and chairs were the final piece to tie in my 30's deco/streamline/modern look I have going on in my house. Another great product from Overstock!", 
    "I was a little hesitant to order furniture online, but am so glad I did. The table was shipped in 4 days. It was very easy to assemble. It is free of any flaws. The dark chocolate color is beautiful. Overal, I am very happy with my overstock purchase!", 
    "The table had a couple small nicks but nothing real noticeable. It is very sturdy and stylish looking. Love it!!! Thanks Overstock.", 
    "This table is so beautiful. The wood looks so expensive. The only problem is you will need two people to set the table upright after putting the legs on--and that is really a very minor problem. I got the brown leather chairs also available at Overstock for a beautiful and very expensive looking dining room set. I love everything I have ever bought from Overstock.", 
    "Arrived without a scratch. My only complaint is that the stain on the legs did not evenly hide the different shades of 'fingered' wood (the wood is joined in multiple pieces). Customer service took care of that by sending me an additional set of legs. Color is very much like the picture. This table is very sturdy and looks more expensive than I paid. It is solid wood throughout, albeit 'finger-jointed' in spots, but the stain does a great job of hiding that.", 
    "I purchased three of these tables to use in adult classroom situations (more homely, less institutional). they were VERY easy to assemble. One of the three came with a scratch on the top which is disappointing, but dismantling it and sending it back were too much of a hassle so we kept it. The other two look nice and we are happy with this purchase.", 
    "I'm using it as a desk. Easy to put together, looks great and is very sturdy. I was worried (given the price) about whether it would be flimsy or uneven; it's neither. I couldn't be happier with it.", 
    "I would like to say that this is a very nice table. very sturdy and large enough to fit six chairs comfortably. Would recommed to a friend.", 
    "I use the table as a desk and it works beautifully. It's large enough to hold a computer and still has room to layout architectural plans. Though the finish isn't flawless, (I'm very picky) I believe the table's quality exceeds its price.", 
    "The table quality is excellent and was easy to assemble due to great instructions. The quality of wood used was nicer than I had even hoped. However, during shipping a corner was marred. I used a furniture marker to cover it satisfactorally, but will always know that my beautiful table has been flawed from the beginning.", 
    "This table is solid and sturdy. The color is good to us. It's a good deal!", 
    "I did some research on rubberwood and found that (contrary to its name) it is a high quality hardwood. It's also eco friendly! Other tables at a similar price were made from particle board with veneers, whereas this table is solid wood. The size is perfect for my small dining area and the finish is beautiful. My only complaint is that my table had a small imperfection in one corner of the surface (I plan to get a touch-up marker to fix it). Overall, I think this is a great value.", 
    "This table is AWESOME!!! It's perfect for a smaller kitchen or dinning room. It does look just like the picture in terms of size, however it functions much better with 4 chairs. Assembly was a breeze!!! A child could put it together. I looked at many tables online and at furniture stores from $300-$1000 and this table is a STEAL!!! Buy It!!!", 
    "I've had this table for over 2 years and I absolutely love it. It is gorgeous, sturdy, heavy, very rich looking and a great value. The color is a deep brown - espresso is actually a great way to describe it (the trend seems to be to call very black furniture espresso - this is actually brownish like the pictures). I had issues with the matching chairs (the seat colors were hideous and I had a hard time putting them together), but the table is perfect.", 
    "I liked tyhe look of this table, and it is well built. It did have two small marks on the top, maybe it was dropped or rubbed against something. I believe it had to have happened before it was put in box. The box it was shipped in is protected not to get damaged. All in all this is a beauitful table, and I would recommed anybody interested to buy it.", 
    "and regardless of price, its a great piece. solid. sturdy. good finish. We have only unpacked one, so far, of 4 and are going to use them in a real estate office as desks, but first impressions are all thumbs up.", 
    "i love the table. i like color and it is very well built. nice and strong for kids who like to climb on things. i cant wait to afford the chais to go with it.", 
    "This is a great quality table for the price. It is solid, sturdy, and easy to assemble.", 
    "I love this table. The color and quality of the wood is great. It took my fiance and I less than fifteen minutes to assemble the table together. I would definitely recommend this purchase.", 
    "The table is gorgeous. It's nice and sturdy. However, the dimensions are way off on this table. It's alot smaller than what is reported on this site.", 
    "This table was really inexpensive for a beautifully finished solid wood piece. It assembled in minutes. The table is small but still comfortable fits 6 chairs.", 
    "My girlfriend an I bought this table from overstock and we found it to be very well made. It looks very modern and expensive and matches the general look of our apartment", 
    "Excellent quality. Easy to assemble. Great looking table.", 
    "This is a great table, my UPS man actually brought it up to the 2nd fl to my apt with was also great. This table actually turned out a little bigger than I thought but is still a great size. The wood and finish is beautiful (wish it was a little darker like espresso but otherwise it is great). Very easy to put together, took all but a few minutes. I bought 4 of the matching chairs and the whole set looks more expensive than it is. I love getting stuff from Overstock, no taxes and shipping is unbeatable.", 
    "I had some difficulties getting a table top that wasn't damaged during shipping, but the third time they got it right. Overstock was very easy to work with (as far as getting another one shipped to me), and communicated every step of the way!I love this table!!! Perfect espresso color. But, if you are wanting a large table, I wouldn't recommend this one. The dimensions make it sound large enough for six people, but when you get people's legs under it...they tend to bump into one another. It seats four great, but six is stretching it. None the less, I am very pleased!!!", 
    "This table is great! It is a beautiful color; it's perfectly stable; it's simple: everything I wanted it to be. It was even packaged REALLY carefully...yet, there was still a huge gouge in the underside of table (from an obvious \"puncture wound\" to the packaging) and a crack/scratch on the table surface. Fortunately, I'm not worried about the underside of the table, and the scratch on the top is small enough that a placemat covers it nicely. It was really easy to put together, and it looks great in the dining room. There are several other comments posted about the table's size - I agree, it's probably pretty tight to seat six people comfortably for dinner, but four fit nicely, and I think six could squeeze in. And, it would still be better than some restaurants I've been too! :)", 
    "I just received the table and the matching chairs today. The table came in great condition, no scratches or dings anywhere. It was really easy to assemble as it took me at most 10 minutes to do so. The color of it is very nice. Trying to fit 6 people will definitely be a bit tight, but I still would recommend the table.", 
    "love it! love it! love it!my boyfriend and i have spent much time looking for an affordable dining table to fit in our apartment and we were excited to find this one on overstock.com. it is the perfect size for a small space and looks GREAT with it's clean lines and dark chocolate color. the price of the table can't be beat and it was super easy to put together. the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars across the board is a minor imperfection on one of the top corners of the table. aside from that i couldn't be happier with this table and would highly recommend it!", 
    "Sorrento Dining Table is an excellent value. The size is pretty much as described. Mine came with one of the corners blemished. The shipping box had some damage which may be why the table was blemished. I think it is the perfect size for a small dining area. Yet it is very sturdy.", 
    "\"I had been looking high and low in my search for a dining room table to use as a desk/study space for my Pharmacy school years. I found the perfect table, or at least it appeared so, in the Sorrento table offered here on Overstock; I ordered in a hurry as there were less than 10 tables left. My decision in haste proved to have been guided correctly through the reviews of others who had purchased this table!Easy, easy, easy to put together -- attach the 4 legs and you are ready for dinner or studying -- your choice!It looks great, feels substantial and was a great deal! No desk that I had found in my search offered what I was seeking, but this table sure did! I agree with some comments made by others -- this would be a fine dining table for 4 people, but to seat 6 is a big, BIG stretch.For my needs it is a perfect fit all the way around, and it looks fine in my living room!\"", 
    "When I first bought the table I was kind of leary about whether or not it would be big enough to my desire. The cost of the table is a great deal in my opinion, so I went through with it.When the table arrived (4 days later) I assembled it immediately. The table sits nice in our dining room, granted if it was just a little bigger it would have been nice.I think you could sit 6 people at this table, comfortably is another story. I don't see a huge issue with that though.I am very satisfied with the product. Now it's time to buy the chairs!", 
    "Pretty nice and sturdy table. Wood is workable with a smooth dark wenge color. Very easy to assemble. Legs and table top came separately for some reason but entire order was complete within 5 days.", 
    "This table is a good deal. It's solidly built, simple, and doesn't seem to scratch easily. On the other hand, the wood is a little cheap looking and it's extremely heavy.", 
    "Great quality, nice hard, heavy wood. Beautiful color.", 
    "This table is beautiful. I bought this to match the lattice back walnut chairs that are also available on Overstock. The color is beautiful and so stylish. It looks great in our dining room. A great buy for the price! Thanks again for another awesome purchase from Overstock. I will return.", 
    "The table was smaller than expected and it scratches easily. The top itself is not solid wood, which is what I wanted. It's a cute table. It will do for now, but not what I expected based on the description and reviews. I was looking for something sturdy and durable for little kids which is why I didn't want a \"veneer\" top table. Also the color is not expresso its lighter.", 
    "To me its not as long as it long as it looks in the picture, so now I decided to use it in another room than its original purpose. I felt I totally overpaid for just a table but decided to keep it and make good use anyway.", 
    "We bought this table when we first moved into our house as hold over piece until we hired a decorator. After having it for a few months and shooping for new furniture we cannot find one that we like better no matter the price tag. The wood is beautiful, and I would strongly recomend purchasing.", 
    "This table is absolutely elegant and was extremely easy to put together. All I had to do was screw on the legs. The table with the matching chairs looks so awesome in my dinning room. The size is perfect and the quality is very nice.", 
    "I love this table. But be warned IT DOESNT COME WITH THE CHAIRS!! Maybe I was being naive but I thought that the chairs might have come with the table. It never stated that it didnt.", 
    "The color table on the pictures is deceiving, the stain appears much darker the actual color of the table I received is a dull walnut stain. I received the table with one small but noticeable dent. This is a first time online purchase and it confirmed \"you get what you pay for\" The table is plain and looks inexpensive.Shown with six chairs but my four previous purchased chairs (Not purchased on Overstock) didn't comfortable pull up to the table without your legs touching the person across from you. Six chairs would be to close for comfort.Unfortunately the value of the table did not fit in with my existing d\u00e9cor. However I would purchase this table for a college student or an appartment dweller since the table appears to be sturdy.", 
    "The table is beautiful BUT is SO MUCH SMALLER than it actually looks on website. It is extremely small.", 
    "The table is beautiful but I was extremely disappointed when it was delivered and I realized that the chairs pictured don't come with the table. Not only do the chairs not come with the table, but you cannot currently find those chairs to buy on this website! When I tried to return the table to buy a different set I was told that the $2.95 that I paid to ship it to my house is not how much it would cost to return it. Instead, I would have to take out over $$$ from my refund. I thought I was getting an amazing set for an awesome price and now I have a table with no chairs.", 
    "I love the table but it shows that it comes with chairs and I was highly disappointed that it showed up with out them. Every set I was looking at came with chairs and I guess I just assumed. BE AWARE before you purchase."
