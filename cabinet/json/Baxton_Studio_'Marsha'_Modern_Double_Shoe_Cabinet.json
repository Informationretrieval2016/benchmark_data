    "Each cabinet does hold 16-18 pairs of shoes, if you double up on each of the drawers. Each drawer can hold a row of shoes placed inward. You can flip your heels upside down to store an additional row. The cabinet was a bit tedious to put together due to the poor instructions. The final cabinet looks great and is inconspicuous as a shoe cabinet.", 
    "The package arrived very quickly. I spent two hours to install it by myself. I'm a petite girl btw. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow. The last two step were a bit more complicated because the details in the figures were not very clear. However you shouldn't have problem figuring it out if you have successfully gone that far. The figures and steps are very good guide. I haven't found any mistake in them. Therefore strictly following the steps is the key to a successful installation. It helps greatly if you can use your common sense to help understand the figures. Step 11 needs a bit more instruction though. It doesn't tell you how to palce Piece #I. The long side edge with black paint should face upward. Otherwise the other side of the edge without black paint will be exposed when you open the door. Just take a note for now if you can't understand. You'll know what I mean when you get there. Last, I want to comment on the sizes and number pairs of shoes it can take. A lot of people including myself have the question when looking at this product. I use this cabinet to store running shoes. My husband wears size 13 and I wear 6 and half. I was able to store 4 pairs of his and 4 pairs of mine in the cabinet. I also sneak in a folded umbrella by placing it on top of the shoes. Running shoes can be very bulky. You'll have to place them side ways. I put 2 pairs of his and 2 pairs of mine in each drawer (each drawer has two compartments). His are in the bigger compartment and mine in the smaller one of each drawer. I wasn't able to close the door completely when I placed all of them side ways in the same direction. Later I found out that if I place his in one direction and mine in the opposite direction, I could close the door very easily!", 
    "Broke within a year! Did not hold as much as I thought it would. Some of my heels did not fit.", 
    "I'm really happy with this shoe cabinet. I debated for a long time over getting one, since many reviews for it were mediocre, saying it was cheaply made or didn't hold shoes or whatever. But I don't like most other shoe storage options. I didn't want open shelves because everything looks messy, and storage ottomans are nice but to get ones with shoe dividers is actually quite expensive.So I decided to go ahead and get this, and I have found that it meets my expectations and more. As far as \"cheaply made\" I guess if you consider everything from IKEA cheaply made then yes--it's MDF instead of real wood. But to me the construction is rather solid and it looks like it can hold up to some use. I also used some washi tape to customize it a bit so it doesn't look so \"out of the box\".It was really easy to put together--I did it myself inside an hour (while battling the cat who wanted to climb inside everything).The drawers are particularly great. They have dividers that you can choose to install at 2 different intervals to make the slots smaller/larger. I was a little worried about our shoes fitting because my husband and I both have large feet (I wear US size 9-10, he wears men's 10-12). With the slot installed at the highest, the bottom rack is big enough for our larger shoes like sneakers and work shoes, and the top is small but still fits things like my flats and sandals. We probably have about 8 pairs of shoes in it and it's only about half full. It could definitely fit a lot more if you have smaller shoes like kids shoes and sandals.Now it could be a little wobbly if you have kids who aren't gentle with it, so then it might help if you bolted it to the wall. I don't find that necessary since we are both careful with the drawers not to slam them open or closed. Overall very happy I finally got one of these. It's great for storing shoes out of sight.", 
    "I wish I'd read some of the negative reviews and Q&As a little more closely on this one. People aren't kidding when they say that Step 13 doesn't make any sense. I've put together a lot of furniture, and this one was impossible. It was in pieces by my front door for weeks and I had everyone try to figure it out, but I finally gave up and returned it for a refund. Which meant I had to take apart all that had gone together in the previous 12 steps..... Anyway. Don't buy it.", 
    "It was a royal pain to put together! Be careful with all the exterior parts because the white cabinet scuffs easily. Once assembled it's good, not as sleek as the photo but it's nice. I don't regret purchasing it.", 
    "Fell apart as I was building it !!!", 
    "This item has more capacity with a thinner profile than other options I saw (esp. at IKEA). The instructions weren't the clearest, but I was still able to put this item together in about an hour. The \"hardware\" for the doors is made of a flexible plastic material which seems a bit flimsy, but I haven't had a problem with it yet. I replaced the feet that were included with a set of CAPITA legs from IKEA, which were sturdier and gave it more clearance from the floor for more shoe storage! This did not come with any hardware for securing to the wall, which is a must esp. due to how thin the cabinet is. I'm happy with this purchase.", 
    "We needed something near the door to keep shoes out of the reach of the new puppy--this shoe cabinet is perfect. It was easy to assemble and it looks great--very slim profile, very unobtrusive. It holds a lot of shoes and we stash a rain jacket, dog leash, etc. in there as well. Very glad we found this affordable but attractive way to tidy the entryway.", 
    "Not the greatest quality. It does exactly what I wanted it to do - get a lot of shoes off the floor and take up very little room doing it.", 
    "Great solution for a small space. Excellent shoe storage option. Quality of construction not that great. Could use better hardware. It is all plastic and I am sure will break with use.", 
    "The cabinet is pretty once it is built. The instructions are vague and one has to be careful to follow every step with extreme concentration. I was disappointed that the holes for screws didn't match up- I ended up having to drill new holes to complete the project. The hardware is plastic and the cabinet seems flimsy. It has held up for the past two weeks. I am being careful since it seems to be able to tip over easily.", 
    "File under - you get what you pay for. The bottom piece was a bit crushed and there were some dings in some pieces. But it is an inexpensive product, and not real wood, so I was not surprised. Other than that it is good. Nice compact cabinet for a small space. I was able to put it together fairly easily, though I used wood glue in addition to the supplied hardware. You can't see the crushed bottom piece now that it is put together. The top piece is a bit warped, but not too noticeable. All in all, it is a decent cabinet for a (relatively) inexpensive item. (I also used a coupon so that ameliorates things as well). So far it is working out well -- It's only been a few weeks and I worry the kids may be too rough opening the doors as time goes by. I would recommend as long as you keep your expectations manageable.", 
    "Great for storage and organization.", 
    "perfect size to fit into our closet and holds lot of shoes", 
    "I really love my shoe cabinet. It saves space and stores shoes. I wish that it stored a few more. Depending on the shoe I have been able to fit up to 30-35 shoes. I am considering ordering another one.", 
    "Nice looking shoe storage, I get a lot of compliments, the only downside is can't fit shoe size >10\"", 
    "Holes for screws did not line up.", 
    "Took my husband 45 min to put together. Warned him about the instructions not being too clear but he did not find it too hard. We decided not to use the legs because it would put it too high in my closet.", 
    "The instructions are Poor at best and the drawings are not detailed. I am very mechanically incline and it still took me over 45 minutes to assemble this item. IKEA offers something similar already assembled but found that afterwards. Good Luck!", 
    "Great product but too tall for my entry way area. I want to trade in for single shoe cabinet. Other than that it's awesome! I love it!", 
    "Really great--I got the espresso and it woks in my entry hallway very well.", 
    "It's great looking, perfect size, but the drawers that hold your shoes fell apart within a month of daily use.", 
    "Garbage materials. Not detailed Instructions", 
    "I am very happy with my purchase. It was priced right and the quality is outstanding. Highly recommend.", 
    "I am used to assembling things, even somewhat good at it. However, when the manufacturer doesn't provide the necessary holes to guide you, then fails to provide any customer support, things get frustrating. I was fine for 12/14 steps, but that unlucky 13 bit me hard. I had the cabinet together, the drawers were assembled. Now it was just a matter of making the two meet. Alas, it was not to be. I tried Overstock support. While they gave a valiant effort, they left me no wiser as far as were to screw the drawer into the cabinet. I actually had to consult a carpenter to finish assembly, and he had to do some \"fudging\" to get everything together and aligned properly. Do not waste your money. The lack of clear directions and support makes this product worthless.", 
    "I'm really happy with this shoe cabinetFit all my shoes perfectlylove it", 
    "This shoe cabinet doesn't feel as sturdy as some other self-assembled furniture. There is a feeling some parts could be of better quality, but overall, it has worked as described. Won't hold a ton of men's shoes, but good for a a mix of men's (10.5 dress shoes) women's and children's shoes.", 
    "Looks great. Clean and sleek lines. Poor assembly instructions..", 
    "Fit all my shoes perfectly and even served as a table top for my candles & Christmas decorations", 
    "I would have given 5 stars if one of the piece wasn't broken during shipment. Material: oKDesign: sleek and clean Fit: most shoes except booties or 3+inches high heels", 
    "It was a pain to put it together and 6 months in - it fell apart :( Also felt very risky to use.", 
    "Narrow fit In my closet love it", 
    "Not easy to put together. great design. Looks good. The lower drawer hinges wore out in two years. Had to be creative to put it back. Served it's purpose.", 
    "Wonderful cabinet! Didn't take long to put together. Highly recommend.", 
    "Easy to put together and very sturdy for particle board. It does fit a lot of shoes and keeps the entry way clutter-free. Just note that it works best with slim profile shoes like flats, flip flops, or casual tennis shoes. Does not work well with high heels and if you have larger sneakers they'll have to be squished in the outer rows only.", 
    "Doesn't go together properly, doesn't open well. Don't waste your money", 
    "Makes our make-shift entry way look like an entry way. Isn't the greatest quality, but gets the job done. Would purchase again.", 
    "We love this storage unit. It keeps our running shoes and rain boots out of site but still close at hand by the front door. Good quality. Shoes have to be placed just so for it to close completely, but this is easy to do.", 
    "The overall look of the show cabinet and the idea behind it would get 5 stars, but the durability of the unit gets 1. I've had this product for 4 months and the bottom drawer has completed fallen apart and is broken. The maximum amount of shoes that were in that compartment at a given time were 4 pairs of Mens shoes. I'm very disappointed in the quality of this product for the price.", 
    "The quality is terrible. It was breaking and chipping as I put it together. Would NOT recommend. Lower quality than IKEA. Just terrible. Really disappointed.", 
    "Clean lines - does fit 16-18 pairs of women's shoes! Feet are included which gives it a nice finished look. They are optional to use. Great!", 
    "Very happy with this purchase, especially for how expensive similar products were. Of course, it is not made of the thickest and most expensive wood and hardware (thin wood and thick plastic legs and hinges) but if you are looking for am inexpensive way to organize your entry space, I recommend this. Only complaint is, the product DID NOT come with directions or paper work of that sort, I was prepared for that from reading other reviews but still it was a little confusing to assemble, but with a man's help, he was able to figure it out.", 
    "I fell so happy now not seeing any shoe on my living room.Great price and very good material.I love it.", 
    "This fit perfectly in the small space we had, however, the drawers only lasted 4-5 months and broke very easily. The fold-out drawers are pretty worthless now and we don't know if we can fix it. Whoever thought using cheap plastic pieces would hold a heavy drawer in place was an idiot. Don't buy this unless you want it to only last a couple months, if that!", 
    "This shoe cabinet is exactly what we needed. We used to have our shoes in a basket and they were all mixed up and hard to find. This cabinet keeps them organized, easy to access and our of sight when not needed. Great idea. The cabinet itself is not the highest quality, but it serves it's purpose well and we've been using it for over a year now.", 
    "Looks great, keep my shoes in there, and keys and mail on top.", 
    "I've assembled many furnitures in the past but this one is soooo tricky. I don't know what to do now that it's half assembled....", 
    "Great price! Saves lots space.", 
    "Surface very good, just build up little complicated", 
    "not great- and husband's shoes don't fit- consider that", 
    "Here is my experience with this item:- Very cheap quality wood and other materials.- Poor assembly instructions. The parts were not labeled properly - so good luck finding which is the part \"I\" and which is part \"H\" from very similar looking things.- Holes were not drilled properly and some of the screws were faulty. - Poor workmanship and the finish. Save your money and buy something else.", 
    "This product has cheap parts and some were flawed..the directions were simply pictures, non arrive and all parts were not labeled...the cabinet is also not very sturdy...", 
    "this is wonderful.and saves alot of space!!!", 
    "Not much to say. Seems to be durable. Simple design and easy to use.", 
    "this item is a space savior & best to have at home great quality and best price", 
    "I purchased the shoe cabinet for my entryway. The shoes can be tucked and the cabinet isn't bulky.", 
    "Very sleek and fits nicely in my living area. Assembly was a little tricky but I managed and the end result was really worth it.", 
    "It was fairly easy to assemble, and looked exactly as it appeared in the photos. It fit shoes of all shapes and sizes. The only annoying thing is that the little black bracket that keeps the door in place broke off in the hole, so now the door does not sit flush with the face of the cabinet.", 
    "fits the look and our needs perfectly. Gave it only 2 stars because the last two steps of putting it together...putting on the doors were impossible to figure out. took my carpenter to put it together", 
    "My husband tried to help put this thing together leaving one piece precariously balancing to stand up while semi-attached to another. Of course, it fell but it also tore out chunks of MDF. Super cheap. The mechanisms that swing open the doors are also plastic, not metal. Looks decent and functions but I can't say it's worth the cost.", 
    "Easy to put together. Looks great and takes less space than most shoe cabinets out there. Love the design. Fit about 8-9 pairs of shoes in each drawer. The delivery was kind of slow though.", 
    "Easy to put it to together, just need to follow the instructions. Wish there was a little more room inside, some of my husbands size 12 shoes get stuck and it doesnt close right.", 
    "The plastic parts are flimsy. Audi the screws cannot be anchored in position. I still cannot assemble it after wasting 4 hours on it. Worst furniture I have ever seen.", 
    "Plastic was rotten and broke during assembly. It later broke in several places and the doors fell off after a couple times of use. Very poor quality.", 
    "It does the job and it looks nice. It was tough to assemble and it's difficult to move. I have seen these units double for childrens school work. All in all, I would buy it again unless I could find a better alternative.", 
    "This product is plain bad. The quality, the assembly instructions and everything is THE WORST. Upon that, it came with missing critical parts. It started coming apart during assembly. Now this piece of junk is lying in the corner. Rubbish", 
    "It was a bit complicated to put together and not very clear instructions... But we managed and it ended up working out fine! Just be aware. I like it, it fits about 16-18 sandals/heels.", 
    "I was so impressed with the dark brown version of this. It looks very expensive. Although it's a pain to put together (takes a looong time), it's totally worth it!", 
    "This is a very handy item to have in the closet. Just wish I had more room or less shoes!", 
    "Hard to put together but it works out just great!", 
    "The unit is very compact and sleek. My husband wears a size 12 and I wear a size 5. It does not fit any of his basketball shoes nor any big shoes in general. YES for flats and NO on heels as it will not close correctly. I ended up using it for just women and kids shoes.", 
    "this is a great cabinet for reducing the shoe clutter at the door - it is thin and fit perfectly to a spot I had on my stair way - I gave it a 4 for 3 reasons - one is assembly which was not easy, next was soe concern I have about longevity with the plastic mechanism for opening the door and third the fact that my husbands size 12 shoes are a tight ift", 
    "I bought 2 of these and put them both together by myself. It wasn't super easy, but I did it...and the finished products looked great! They looked so great that 2 friends ordered them after seeing mine! I could fit 16+ size 6 1/2 heels / sandals / flats / booties in each cabinet (booties and some platform heels had to be put in sideways).Fast forward a few months...I'm in a rush, grab a pair of shoes and don't carefully close the drawer. When I came home, I found that one of the little plastic pieces that holds the drawer in place had broken. Since these are shoved into a pre-drilled hole, the other half is stuck and I can't fix it. Without that piece, the drawer tilts in too far...so my once great looking cabinet doesn't look so good anymore.If there was a way for me to remove the broken piece and replace it, I would be happy to do it. The only real complaint I have about the shoe cabinet is that the plastic pieces are flimsy and easily breakable.", 
    "This is the best thing to use for shoes", 
    "This cabinet is of good quality. The problem is the size of the shelves. I bought it for 9 1/2 men's shoes. Three pair at the most fit on one shelf and some pairs not very well. If you are buying it for women's shoes size 8 or smaller or kid's shoes it is great. But a waste for men's shoes.", 
    "Absolutely love this shoe cabinet!! Very clean and organized makes our entryway look elegant.", 
    "Love it !! Space saving and you would never know its a shoe cabinet ,looks great !!!", 
    "product came in exactly as I expected, Great.", 
    "Easy to put together. fits lots of shoes and really cleans up the entry.", 
    "The assembly was confusing because of the unclear instructions. I am not sure if the shoe cabinet will last.", 
    "I keep my shoes in the garage and got a large dog that lives in the garage or outside. Unfortunately he developed an appetite for my shoes. This solves the problem.", 
    "Very attractive shoe cabinet, at a great price point!", 
    "looks great good for the price plastic dividers not great but otherwise we like it", 
    "this product arrived timely. Was easy to assemble and is great storage solution for tight spaces. It isn't very deep so doesn't take up much space and looks great.", 
    "I love the double shoe cabinet! My space is limited and I wanted to free up space in my closet. The cabinet is narrow that it doesn't stick out far in the room and it looks fantastic. It wasn't bad putting together. I was missing the four gray screws but Overstock came through and I received them in a timely fashion. They gave me daily updates as to the progress of finding them in the warehouse. Excellent customer service department!!", 
    "This is a great shoe cabinet. I find it works best for smaller shoes. It is not super sturdy, but for the price does a great job. My kids love it, they are 3 and 5.", 
    "My living room looks amazing with this shoe rack!! What a great design!!", 
    "Bought this making sure i was able to return in case i didnt like it, i love it! I can fit 12 to 16 pair of shoes depending on zises! If u wear shoes size 10+ it is not made for you. U still can fit them but probably you will have space for only 4 pair of shoes. Put it together is really hard but if u have a man next to u it wont take that long. It is very good quality for the price. I know i paid $**for this and for that price it was worth it! Love also that it takes almost no room! Messuares were accurate!", 
    "Assembly is difficult, took me about 2.5 hours to put it together but once together it looks exactly as pictured.", 
    "looks nice and holds approximately 15 pairs of shoes. Directions are a bit confusing, but once I figured it out it went together quickly.", 
    "The shoe cabinet is pretty good for the price. I like it a lot.", 
    "What a stunning piece there, just what I wanted. Only the instruction is not practical, got to use some guess and imagining while read it. the shoe rack is a bit too small for men's shoes, but you can always remove the middle board to get more space I guess....love it!", 
    "For an inexpensive shoe holder, this is perfect. It is made of particle board and you have to assemble EVERYTHING. Plan on at least an our to set up as it literally ships as boards, screws, plastic hinges and instructions. Again, this is why it is inexpensive.Once assembled, it works as promised. It cleaned up my entry way a lot. My only gripe is that the inexpensive materials will not last - I would guess this is a 5 or 10 year life product max.", 
    "I've been looking for a compact, truly functional shoe rack for years. This one is exactly what I needed. It fits nicely in my limited space, neatly stores my shoes and allows me to easily access up to 16 pairs! I'm thrilled.", 
    "Easy assembly except that half the screws were missing, so I could only assemble one drawer initially. I will have to go buy additional screws. The directions are not very good, so if you don't have experience assembling things and don't take your time, it could be challenging (they are all pictures and not great pictures at that.But the cabinet will serve my needs well as it's not too deep and it looks nice.", 
    "This is a nice looking she cabinet which helps keep my door way look neat and organized. If you don't know that its a shoe cabinet, you will think it is just a regular cabinet.The instructions to fix it were very clear. I am not a handy person but it took me over 2 hours to fix it with two kids running around.It felt like a bit expensive, but the cheaper similar looking cabinets were only in white and I won't get white to store shoes. So this was perfect", 
    "I love the slim styling. Easy to assemble. The only correction would be to make the drawer mechanism more sturdy. I haven't had any issues and very happy for my purchase.", 
    "the instruction are awful - I had to hire someone to put it together - it took him 2 days because instructions were worthless (his words) & mine, that's why I hired him. He said he had to study the picture of the piece against the finished product picture. the product is good I like it. if someone buys it, I would recommend the company get better instruction or If a customer buys it be prepared to have a backup person to help", 
    "Be ready to put in some work to assemble this, and strengthen it. It's low quality and hard to put together. We should've bought the similar version they sold at Ikea, which would've been higher quality and would certainly have been easier to install. That said, it looks nice and hides all of our shoe mess!", 
    "This cabinet looks just like the picture and is very stylish and modern. It is a bit of a pain to put together. I usually put furniture together by myself, but I needed another pair of hands to assemble this. Some of the edges and corners were not finished cleanly and you can clearly see that the wood finish is a sticker! So when you assemble it, be very careful to face the ugly parts inside and just don't look too closely. Once it's complete, it's great. The drawers open and close easily and silently, and your shoes look very nicely lined up inside. For the price, this cabinet is worth it, but I'm playing it safe and only putting in lightweight shoes.", 
    "I searched far and wide for a shoe cabinet that had a shallow depth and basically came down to either this shoe cabinet or one from Ikea that required mounting to wall. As I didn't want to mount anything to my walls, I decided to give this one a try (in the dark brown finish). The materials are nothing fancy, nor high quality, but it came well packaged and with only a small dent on one of the boards which did not require an exchange. The dark brown finish is a faux wood veneer which is not bad--nothing to write home about, but it doesn't look cheesy since it's very dark. I can see why some may have trouble with the instructions, but all in all, they are adequate. My biggest gripe was when I discovered that certain mounting holes were not fully drilled--it seemed like the drill press touched the wood and then stopped after marking them. However, if you're somewhat handy and have a drill, you could easily drill the mounting holes and move on with little issue, which I did. All in all, the product seems sturdy and functions well at a price point that can't be beat (even by Ikea). Highly recommended.", 
    "This was pretty easy to put together. You do need a second person to help when putting the drawers in. Other than that, my 7 year old helped and it took less than an hour. This is perfect for what we need. Now there's no more shoes in the entry way.", 
    "I'm so pleased with my purchase of this shoe cabinet, it holds more shoes than I thought it would. It's also very attractive!", 
    "This is a great looking piece of furniture and it gets the job done. Could easily pass for an Ikea product and that goes for the quality as well. I was disappointed with the scuff marks that came with the product. They're clearly visible on the front doors. Otherwise, I'm satisfied with it's functionality. So happy to have a clutter free hall way!", 
    "Assembly directions were a little hard to follow. Once assembled this product works perfect and hides those ugly shoes that were on our laundry room floor.", 
    "We ordered two of these and when we opened the first carton we found there were no assembly directions. We found assembly directions in the second carton and started the assembly process. We found that the material was very flimsy and putting it together properly was all but impossible. We ended up returning both cartons.", 
    "Great product. I bought another a week after. I bought chrome legs from elsewhere to match the chrome accents in my apt. A true space saver for a small apt. Overall very happy with this product. :)", 
    "This took a lot of assembly work with only pictures in the directions, but we are super happy with it. It's great for an entry way.", 
    "This product is overpriced. Its worse than ikea! The paint was chipped off on all planks. There seems to be one coat of paint on the planks (barely)! The quality of wood is horribly bad. Do not recommend to anyone.", 
    "Although it looks fine out together, it broke in two different places during assembly. Luckily I was able to fix the broken parts. It holds a good many shoes but not if they are men's size."
