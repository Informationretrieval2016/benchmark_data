    "I purchased this ottoman for my dressing room. The shipping was on time, when it arrived it was packaged fine. The color and size matched the color scheme in the room so I was happy. I gave 4 stars because when you sit further back from the edge (in the middle), there is a dip and not the firm support you feel when sitting on the edge.", 
    "The picture shows grey, but its base color is more creamish.The Ottoman came with stains", 
    "Looks Great! in my living room", 
    "As ****** stated earlier, the \"blue\" floral is closer to green than blue. It's not really an attractive green either. If you are attempting to accent a true blue stay away from this. Sent it back the next day.", 
    "I ordered the blue floral print. It was delivered today, and the color is way off! The invoice says \"Grey Floral\" so I'm not sure if they sent the wrong item or if it's just a printing error. That being said, the color does not look blue or grey. It's some sort of greenish. Very unattractive. Didn't even bother removing it from the box. Opened it, took one look and knew it was going back. Returning immediately!", 
    "One of my favorite new pieces of furniture! We had a hard time finding something that fit the scale of the gray sectional couch we have, and this worked wonderfully!", 
    "The only thing that let us a little down is the quality of the foam , in the middle is not so stead as we expected . But it is a beautiful piece of furniture. The price for the look/ size it is right , for the quality of the foam should be a little cheaper. I would recommend to a friend .", 
    "I like the ottoman just don't know how to care for it and can't seem to get any information....Nothing came with the ottoman or with the pillows that being said I do like the products - the pillows are very cheaply stuffed so got new inserts and they look 100% better and I am happier...."
