    "I love this storage unit! It really is so classy and functional, I am so impressed with it and have gotten tons of compliments!", 
    "These are awesome shelves, nice and tall, but assembly was abut tough. Love them overall!", 
    "Great shelving unit, looks high end and holds a ton of items. Slightly tippy on a carpeted surface, but can adjust the footing to lessen it. Great purchase, very happy.", 
    "i was nervous opening the boxes which arrived looking like they'd been fished out by a grappling hook. Rips, gouges and the like. Nothing in the well protected by styrofoam and plastic packing was scratched or harmed in any way. This Orleans vintage storage unit set is well made and come with all the Nuts, bolts and screws your honey's gonna need to build it. Instructions could be a bit more clear but if you're brave enough to buy build it at home stuff you probably are smart enough to have some basic tools and know how.Hubby got it up in 2 evenings while watching movies.Finish on the metal is a bright pewter with a warm glow. It complements the honey cherry wood shelves perfectly. This set up in a 10 x 12' room on the long wall with about a foot of clearance on either side. Shelves are roomy and sturdy. These are in the den for all of books/movies. Gotta tell you though it's pretty and upscale looking enough to be anywhere in our home. We love it and are extremely happy with this unit. Lots of storage and beauty for a manageable price. Highly recommend.", 
    "These are very heavy and attractive! Assembly was easy with 2 people and a power hand drill. IMPORTANT***** Make sure to assemble the top and bottom shelves first otherwise it will be very difficult to get the shelves to line up correctly. Very happy with my purchase and it arrived earlier than expected.", 
    "Im very pleased with this purchase, because it looks spectacular in my livingroom. The quality is excellent.", 
    "This is one of the finest knock-down furniture pieces that I have purchased. Well made and easy to assemble. All of the five boxes arrived with no internal product damage, although the outside of the boxes were somewhat damaged.Very good design and well finished shelf units. Great that they had adjustable feet for leveling.", 
    "the shelves look beautiful once assembled but they were difficult to assemble and all of the shelves did not line up with the holes for the screws.", 
    "Love this piece! Using it in my very small/narrow dining room to display dishes and hold serving pieces. Fits perfectly in the room, was fairly easy to assemble! Just like with any do-it-yourself furniture, don't tighten the screws all the way until it is completely assembled otherwise shelves are hard to install. Have gotten so many compliments on these shelves! GREAT BUY FOR THE MONEY!", 
    "Heavy and a a little difficult to put together alone. But sturdy and well built, love, love, love", 
    "very heavy duty, very pleased with this purchace. put it together close to where you are going to place it... it's heavy once assembled!", 
    "I am so pleased with this unit. It was simple to assemble and once the first unit was finished, the rest was smooth sailing. Nothing was damaged and it is a beautiful addition to my dining room. Thanks Overstock.", 
    "It looks much better than in the picture. Very sturdy, nice wood and metal contrast, just beautiful. Takes a while to put together but definitely worth it. I have 2 of the set, and will get more to go around the room completely. Best online purchase quality I've ever had. Took a little while to figure out how to set it level on my slightly wavy floor (there is a screw at the bottom of ONE of the 4 feet to help level), but to have that option is unusual for a shelf too. Very happy with it.", 
    "The ordered arrived quickly and all pieces were intact. The actual unit is exactly like the photo. Was easy to put together and looks terrific. The unit is very sturdy and perfect for the large room it's in.", 
    "These shelves replace four bookcases, and have lots of space. They are very easy to put together. I spent only part of one evening putting them together. They are very stylish and complement my industrial modern d\u00e9cor very well."
