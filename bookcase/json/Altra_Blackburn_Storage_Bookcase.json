    "A little time consuming to put together, but good directions, so patience is a must.....as well as a power drill. Very pleased with the final results, considering the price I paid.", 
    "This is not for the novice builder! The directions are not easy to understand, way too many pieces and not enough screws. That's right, have extra screws around because the manufacturer did not include enough! For the price, it is okay.. however, do not expect high quality materials..not to be used for heavy books or decorative items. Will serve our purpose as a place for 'just stuff' that is laying around and needed a drawer or shelf.. Drawers are a bit small (not too deep) Overall, it is okay.. however, do not expect a great piece of furniture.. and be prepared to put some HOURS into putting it all together. Good Luck!", 
    "Cheaply made, but it does the trick to store books and other items. There were no holes for the particle board in the back either, which made putting it together quite difficult.", 
    "Good furniture for the price", 
    "I love this piece of furniture and it matches nicely. I would HIGHLY suggest checking the manufacturer's website for updated installation instructions. A couple of the main illustrations were incorrect. But, this is one of my favorite pieces in my house!", 
    "Altra Blackburn Storage Bookcase is the worst piece of furniture I have ever purchase. First of all, it has more than 23 components, which would be fun to assemble if the item has a reasonable design and quality, however, it DOES NOT. I followed the instruction, but the screws used to join two components aren't long enough(or the wood is too soft) to hold, one can easily detach assemble components with hand. This has made the whole thing completely useless. What's more, Overstock.com charges >$$ for you to return the item, which is more than 1/3 of the price. The item also comes with a shabby packing, which made the return even harder. It's a huge waste of time and money. I'd give 0 star if possible.", 
    "Loved it and perfect for my space", 
    "It is exactly what I needed and expecting. It is sturdy and sleek. Perfect for her hide-a-way loft bedroom. I recommend this item"
