    "I am writing a review because I feel the description on this site doesnt do this product justice. First, I thought the finish was decent, however, the finish on my table is amazing. It is fully seal and still looks vintage. Second, the wood is clearly old which I couldnt tell by the pictures. The base is completely solid wood and makes the table very stable. This table is cheaper than the one in restoration hardware and if you compare the two tables, my table is ten times the quality and the looks! Well done overstock!", 
    "This table was everything my husband and I needed in our new dinning room. The color is prefect...we have dark floors and were afraid to get a table that was completely dark wood as it would make the room too dark. This table is prefect because it has a dark finish underneath a white wash type of top finish. We have linen slipcovered chairs that complimented it perfectly. the top of the table had a few marks where a brush or roller stopped while they were painting it in the middle...hard to explain but they should have stopped a brush or roller at the edges to make it a little more uniform looking across the top... after I put placemats and a flower arraignment on it I don't even notice....it is very faint to begin with but just a suggestion to the manufacturer. I am happy it did not have a glossy finish..the clear coat on top is a matte finish which is prefect for this type of table. all in all we are very happy and it was the perfect size. The shipping took a long time...I was called one day and told they would deliver the next day..then they called back to say that they could not deliver it because they did not do white glove delivery...I then had to call overstock a couple of times to locate the table and it took another week....but worth the wait!", 
    "I just got the table. Superb quality, incredible finish. It was very hard to tell by the picture how the table was going to turn out but it is just perfect for the vintage chic look I was trying to recreate in our mountain home. I got the 54 size and I can easily fit 6 people around it. I've been searching here in Overstock for some matching pieces but I can't find much darn it.", 
    "I really wanted a large round table and I thought this table would be perfect. I love the legs and the rustic look, but not so much the white wash. The white finish (can't speak for the grey wash)-is a very strong white color. so if you want a shabby chic look-this is a high quality table for a good price. it is a specific look but if you want a white distressed table. I called Overstock-they immediately set up a pick up. they were excellent to deal with on the return and I will not be afraid of buying a large piece of furniture from here again.", 
    "Gorgeous heavy round and rustic! I thought I could fit 6 chairs but 4 worked better with the size of my chairs. The table is a statement piece, very rustic, heavily whitewashed and has a worn in look. Very thick top and the base is very interesting. I was worried ordering a large piece of furniture but trusted the other reviews. I am so glad I did!", 
    "I was very hesitant to purchase a table online. Without all of the other extremely positive reviews I probably would not have made the purchase. I ordered it on 9/8 and received it on 9/24. It was well protected and wrapped by the shipper and there was absolutely no damage. The table came completely assembled. It has a distressed almost whitewashed look, I matched it with 6 plush gray chairs and it looks like a million bucks in my dining room. Don't hesitate this table is absolutely beautiful and as round tables are hard to find, especially those made of reclaimed wood which is all the rage right now, it probably won't last long. It is heavy and well constructed and I am sure my kids will be fighting over it in 50 years. Thanks overstock!", 
    "I really loved this table and have had it for less than 1 year. I'm now seeing a couple of long cracks on the top!!!", 
    "I ordered this in the 72\" vintage grey color. The table is a tan color with grey brushings - and very heavy and sturdy. By itself it is an impressive piece of furniture. The original picture showed it as much more grey than what it is. The picture has since been updated. I can tell you that when it came even though the color wasn't as pictured, this table is absolutely gorgeous! I decided to keep it and Overstock was EXTREMELY helpful during that time. I was concerned about finding chairs to go with it but thanks to Overstock I believe I've found some. I ordered 8 of the Pacifica Side chair hoping to compliment the table. This quality of this table cannot be beat. If you're a fan of the rustic \"RH\" look this table has it at an unbelievable price. I did a lot of research prior to ordering, and tables of this size and quality were double the cost. I will continue to shop with Overstock as the quality and prices of their products can't be beat!", 
    "I was so hesitant to buy a table online, but based on the reviews I decided to go ahead an order it. So glad I did because I don't regret it for a second. I'm soooo happy with my table. It does look exactly like the pictures and it is a great quality table. Professional delivery service. First time I ordered from overstock but definitely not the last. Great job guys!!", 
    "My daughter was looking for a dining table for her new home and when she found this quality table she knew she had found the table she was looking for..so we bought it for her as a house warming gift..she is beyond happy w/ this lovely table. OS were prompt and informative about the delivery day and time. Must compliment the shipping company for its expertise upon delivery.The table sold out quickly w/ good reason since its exceptional in everyway.", 
    "I was concerned to pull the trigger due to no reviews. I am so glad I did as the table is gorgeous and fits my decor perfectly. The finish is exactly what I wanted and the quality is there. All in all, this is an amazing find that is half the price of similar products you can find in restoration hardware or crate and barrel. I actually think the quality is much better. Now I need to save money for the chairs!", 
    "We have had this table covered while our home has been worked on. Tonight we had our first dinner on it and it is cracked!!! Past the time to return it. I am really disappointed. Do not purchase.", 
    "This table was really beautiful when it arrived. After a couple of months, the edges of the table turned up (permanently) and the table resembled a \"U\". I called overstock as well as the manufacturer and neither party would take a return since it was after 30 days. I spend $**** on this table and now it is basically garbage.", 
    "I purchased the 72\" table in White. The color is very white washed, more white than wood, but I love it. The quality of the table is fantastic and I'm sure I could sand and refinish really easily if I wanted to change the color. The table came fully assembled so you need a lot of room to get it thru your door and into your dining room. I have six chairs and it fits perfectly. I could probably squeeze in 8 chairs if I needed too. I'm very happy with this table. My only compliant was the shipping. The receiving hub in my city rejected the first delivery because the table came unpackaged and they thought it was damaged. The delivery company didn't understand that the table came distressed. It took a month to get the first table and another month for the 2nd shipment. I looked and looked for a table this size that is real wood and I'm so happy I took the chance ordering online sight unseen.", 
    "Have never ordered from overstock but read all the positive reviews and decieded to order the table...we absolutely love our table and everyone who has seen it has complimented us on how nice it is. It is so well put together..the color was perfect and has that rustic feel we were looking for! If you are considering this table...You won't be dissapointed &#128521;", 
    "I watched this table for a long time. I read every single review and wondered if I could really bring myself to spend this much on a huge item like a dining room table without having seen or touched it in person.I shopped around at brick and mortar stores around town and everything was at least twice as expensive. Finally, I decided to take the plunge. After waiting a couple weeks for the shipping the happy day arrived. It met and exceeded all expectations!I highly recommend this table. It's sturdy, durable, and wipeable (we have 5 kids).", 
    "This is my husband and my first formal dining room table so we wanted something solid that would last a lifetime and I think we have it. The solid wood is wonderful. My only complaint is that is that the color is a little off from the picture. The color is more of an oak with a white antiqued finish. I thought it was more of a gray with a antiqued finish. But it is still beautiful and it works with our room. I bought the 60 inch antiqued white and it fits 6 chairs (almost). They chairs I bought are a little oversized so keep that in mind. They all fit, but you cannot scoot chairs all the way under table when you are not sitting, but it still looks fine. There is still plenty of leg room with all 6 chairs at the table. It did take a full 5 weeks for it to be delivered, but that process went smoothly. After about 3 weeks, the moving company called and set up a time to deliver. They arrived at the house right on time and brought it into the home and placed it right where we asked. No complaints there. I cannot wait to host my first family dinner!", 
    "This table far exceeded my expectations. The quality and design are a great value.", 
    "I ordered this table and loved the look of it but it started to crack down the center within a week of owning it. Overstock replaced the table; but, on arrival, the replacement had pieces cracked off of the bottom. I am very disappointed.", 
    "I love love love my table but the delivery process took forever! but it when it did arrive i couldnt be happier", 
    "I love this table! It is extremely sturdy. I put a couple coats of poly on it so I could use it as a kitchen table. I get lots of compliments on this table.", 
    "Took some time to get here, but it's beautiful and very high quality. Well worth the price. Is going to make a great centerpiece in our new dining room.", 
    "I would not buy this table again. It looks like paint was chipped off and not in a distressed way. It said it would ship in 1-4 weeks, we got it in 8. For the cost,hassle,and quality I wish we went somewhere else.", 
    "I purchased this table for a large formal dining room. The table is beautiful and really compliments our d\u00e9cor.Be aware that this table is made from reclaimed wood, so there may be some knots and imperfections on the table itself. Ours was actually delivered with a crack along a seam where the wood had dried out a bit. We contemplated sending the table back, but decided to keep it, primarily because of the amount of time it took to receive. The function and beauty is not affected by the crack, however, it would have been nice to receive it in \"perfect\" condition.The delivery time on large items from Overstock is substantial! If you order a table, be prepared to wait several months for delivery. From the time we placed the order to the time we received the table was just shy of 3 months. To be fair, some of the issues were with the local delivery service and the weather, which probably delayed things by a week or so.Overall this is a very nice table and looks great. If you're expecting a \"perfect\" finish with no imperfections, this is not the table for you. The surface is smooth and the finish is beautiful, but you will see seams and knots in the wood. If, however, you like the look and beauty of reclaimed wood, I would highly suggest this table.", 
    "Just got my new table and I love it. The finish is amazing with some white and a lot of wood that you can see through. I disagree with some of the reviewers that claim there is mostly white. It is not the case with my table. The surface is very even but shows like a brush or something like that, hard to describe. It is great for us because our kids will destroy any kind of glossy pretty finish. We ordered the 72 size and let me tell you it is huge, make sure it fits in your home because it barely fit in mine!!! The table is super stable. You can lean on the edge and it will not be an issue. All in all, I absolutely love the product. Well done!", 
    "I have been looking for this size table for a long time ! with that rustic look , and was so glad when I found it on overstock , because I knew they would have a great price on it compered to other sites. Let me tell you I love this table its a statement piece in my kitchen Excellent quality great color , I have it in the whitewash finish and it looks great with the darker antique chairs that I've found at the antique store .", 
    "You can look and look and look and then look some more for a table like this and, just like me, you will not find a better deal for the quality. This table is amazing. Whoever made this table knows what they are doing. THANK YOU SIR!", 
    "This is a great deal. The quality is amazing. Love this table!", 
    "Works nicely in our large eat in kitchen area. Finish is as advertised.", 
    "I want to love this table, especially since I'm stuck with it now. We got the chestnut color.The good: The able is very solid, and 60\" is a good size for at least 8 people.The bad: The top is cracking, and the color of the top doesn't match the base.I contacted overstock about a replacement, but they were a nightmare to deal with. I eventually had to cancel the replacement, so I'll have to live with this cracking one.If the top matched and didn't crack (in 2 weeks), I'd give the table 5 stars because it's very solid and comfortable to sit at. To future buyers, perhaps try a different color than the chestnut.", 
    "The finish on top wasn't what we expected and did not look like reclaimed wood. Additionally, there were 3 long cracks in the top as well as a strange chemical odor to the table. I returned it as soon as I got it.", 
    "I had to return the table because it began cracking along what appeared to be the seams in the tabletop after my family had it for about 2 weeks. We were very disappointed in the quality. Overstock, however was quick to respond to help. We chose to have a refund issued as we felt that the quality of any other table from this manufacturer would be poor.", 
    "We just found out we were having our fifth child. We needed a 70 incher. Overstock, Restoration hardware or doing a custom piece were our only option at all around the same price. We loved the look of this one. It was shipped thru a third party delivery service that called ahead, was on time and very careful not to damage the table or our hardwood floors when delivering. It's a little darker than I anticipated BUT still beautiful. Would recommend buying. :-)", 
    "Love it! Mine arrived and it is a little lighter then the photo...which i didn't mind. Very solid table...good quality. Happy with my purchase", 
    "Outstanding quality of product. The table is well-built, substantial in weight and construction, free of blemishes. The color is very close to the site photo - grey. We put six large chairs around this table and they fit perfectly. Table could easily accommodate 8 narrower chairs. This is a great price for a great product.", 
    "Very good quality - looks even better in person, is solid, have been using it for several months and it is holding up nicely so far", 
    "We got the 54\" round table in the whitewashed color and it is beautiful! It can seat 6 people comfortably. We use metal dining chairs, which give it a rustic look. The table has a great finish on it that wipes down easily and does not stain!", 
    "Very pleased with this table! It is beautiful and very high quality. The finish is a bit darker than I expected, but it goes perfectly with my home decor. This was a great purchase!", 
    "I love this table. I get compilments on it all the time", 
    "Very sturdy and looks exactly like picture. Somewhat expensive tho", 
    "This was my first big purchase that I've made online and I was nervous to order something sight unseen. But it is absolute perfection! We get so many compliments and questions about where to buy from people. The table is very solid and sturdy. It came in two pieces and the delivery guys had it together in minutes. There are a few Knicks on the table top where a small piece of wood splintered off but it's only something I notice. The gray finish is gorgeous. Seriously the pictures on here do not do it justice. I have a white kitchen with gray counters and this just completes it! I got white cross back chairs from Ikea that look perfect with the table!", 
    "i've had this table for about a year and love it! everyone that comes comment on what a nice sturdy table it looks to be. i put clear acrylic chairs with it for a modern touch and it looks fantastic! i gets lots of compliments on it!", 
    "I looked at this table for weeks before taking a chance on it and I'm so glad I did. The quality is great. We've used it daily since June. Delivery was a bit of a pain because Overstock couldn't give me any information or updates even after repeated calls and emails. I eventually asked for the shipping company's direct contact info. I called thme and it turned out they table was there and they delivered it the next day.", 
    "I expect to have this table forever, not only because it took overstock 3 months to deliver but because it's super sturdy & durable (my kids draw and scribble on it and it wipes off pretty easily).", 
    "I was nervous about ordering this table and the delivery was a lot longer then expected but worth it! I have gone to Pottery Barn, Restortation and Ballad Designs looking at this same table but the pricing was to high! The table has that weathered white finish to it. It is absolutely gorgeous and the price is great too! The only thing I recommend is buying a glass top for it because I'm not sure if food is spilled if it will stain the table.", 
    "We bought this table 4 months ago & have been so pleased wth it. The quality is exceptional, especially at this price. The table is very sturdy, and the finish has held up nicely. It did take a good 3 weeks to ship and, because it comes fully assembled, requires a lot of clearance to bring it in. But we couldn't be more pleased with it.", 
    "This is exactly what I hoped it would be. Sturdy, and the finish is beautiful -", 
    "This is perfect in my breakfast area and brings in the coastal feel looking for", 
    "Great table. Exactly what we expected. Beautiful white wash finish. Very sturdy. You can tell it is well built.", 
    "I love this table! It's extremely well-made, sturdy and looks like it came from Restoration Hardware. I originally ordered the Vintage White and it's EXTREMELY light! Too light for me. So, Overstock swapped it out for Vintage Grey, which is the perfect color - it's definitely not nearly as dark as the picture depicts. I would highly recommend this table!", 
    "I love this table. I bought the 60\" gray and I absolutely love it. I matched it with my existing black chairs and it matches perfectly.", 
    "Great round table perfect for my breakfast nook. Casual and has lots of wood grain look. I ordered white wash and it was true to white wash coloring. It is sturdy and attractive. Yeah! I love it when you get what you ask for!", 
    "We have looked at numerous tables in order to find just the right combination of casual and eclectic to enhance our small breakfast area. The balance of the base makes this table sturdy, allowing plenty of leg room. We ordered the 48\" and it seats 6 with no problem. We particularly like the whitewash finish to accent other darker furnishings. I arrived in good order with no problems.", 
    "The table was beautiful, but not the color I ordered. There was a mixup with the delivery company and they didn't show up to deliver when they were supposed to. When the item finally came (8 weeks later) it was the wrong color. I ended up returning it as I have company coming in town and couldn't wait for the correct table to be shipped. The table that I saw was beautiful though! If I had the time I would have waited for the grey table that I originally ordered to ship out to me.", 
    "I love my table! I purchased the white finish and it's gorgeous! A little issue with uneven legs, but not enough to make me wish I hadn't purchased. I just put a small piece of cardboard under one leg to make it stable.", 
    "I ordered this table in distressed white. It arrived over a month after it was ordered. The table is nothing like the photo. Not even close. It looks so cheap (which it isn't!) and the color is horrible. The wood is not \"distressed\" or \"reclaimed\" and for sure not \"vintage\". It feels hollow and of poor quality. The wood looks like a basic light pine. The white \"finish\" is a messy thin paint job of white paint. Pink glue is all over the base of the table. Cracks, scratches, chunks missing. And no, not in a distressed cutesy way. It looks like a high schooler made this in wood shop. SO AWFUL. Will load pictures when I can. Do not recommend. Buyer beware!!!", 
    "This table is beautiful; very sturdy and even prettier than in the photos", 
    "The table is a very solid table. I was a bit disappointed with the color, but we will see how it wears with time.", 
    "I purchased this item to add a warm french country feel to my kitchen. I bought the 48 inch round table which comfortably fit four chairs. The white reclaimed wood allows the wood to come through and show its character while brightening up a very dim area of the room.", 
    "This table is solid wood. Can't say enough good things about this quality, gorgeous piece of art!", 
    "Rustic but classy table. The only negative is that if you need to return it, it costs half the price as the table. Read fine print.", 
    "I was so frightened to buy something this big and expensive online, sight unseen. It was worth the risk. The table is absolutely perfect. I got the off-white and it is just barely white. Definitely not over the top. It's exactly what I was looking for. The 60 inch works great for our family of five. Our kids love it too. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "I searched everywhere to find a 72 inch round table and could not find one anywhere. A friend that knew of my search saw this and called me. I ordered it the same day. I was a little nervous before it arrived, but was so pleased with the quality and the condition in which it arrived. The delivery guys brought it in and set it up and made sure it was in good condition. My only regret is that I did not get the vintage grey instead of the vintage white. I thought the white would be more like a white wash but is is very light almost like raw pine. I was afraid he grey would be too dark so I did not want to risk it. I am enjoying this table. It is a great way for family and friends to all gather together for a meal.", 
    "I just received the La Phillippe table in Vintage White. Sadly I'm not happy with it. The color is a weird white color. It looks cheap . Definitely not worth $$$$ . I wish I could return it but then I'll be out $$$-$$$ return shipping fees from what Overstocks policy states. I'm really disappointed in this table . It doesn't look like the color in the picture and doesn't look like real wood let alone reclaimed . Hope this review helps someone out .", 
    "well made, very pretty, love this table", 
    "Amazing! This table looks exactly...or actually better than one at ********** ********* for $$$$. Love it!", 
    "if i could give this a higher rating i would. the best purchase we have made from overstock. the quality of construction, the look of the table and the way it compliments our decor. AWESOME", 
    "I love this table. It's extremely convenient, comfortably fits 8 people (and can easily squeeze in 10). It's a very sturdy design and construction (no wobbling), and the finish is easy to clean.", 
    "Read all the reviews and was impressed. Got the 54\" in chestnut. It is beautiful. Fits 6 chairs. All wood, sturdy, beautiful finish that can easily be wiped down. Checked some other well known online retailers and this size, quality not even available. Prices for the 60\" are almost $$$ more with lesser quality materials. Freight company was professional and the over all experience positive. I am so pleased!", 
    "I purchased this table in vintage white. When it arrived it was more of a natural wood color. With some paint and antique wax, I was able to make it what I wanted. With that being said, I would have preferred to not have to put any work into something with such a large price tag. It also took almost 6 weeks to arrive, so I didn't want to go another 6 weeks without a dining room table. It's a good quality table but if you are looking for a whitewashed worn look, do not expect vintage white to be it.", 
    "We love this table. Heavy, durable and beautiful. It was a steal at the price we paid.Great!", 
    "Excellent service, was delivered, and unpacked and set up for me. I love the color, went perfect with my new kitchen remodel. I've had many comments, all good, everyone loves it. It's well made table, and if you like reclaimed wood you will love this table.", 
    "I ordered this table in Vintage Gray, and it came damaged the first time, with a crack on the table top. Overstock was great to work with but I had to wait 2 weeks for the replacement table, which was sent by manufacturer/moving company in Vintage white instead which is also a nice color but more shabby chic looking in color. Third time was a charm, and the third table was delivered with virtually no damage ( small chip on the foot that isn't obvious) so I kept it. And wood looks better quality than that Hardware stores similar table. I found Louis chairs to go with at a local chain import store...Love!", 
    "The La Phillipe table is very well made. Unfortunately the first one arrived damaged and I had to return it, but Overstock was great to work with and another arrived promptly. The color is a bit grayer than I expected but it is a solid well constructed piece of furniture", 
    "Beautiful, sturdy, and practical.", 
    "This dining table is a great piece for our \"coastal modern\" home. I got the grey and love the reclaimed feel and look of the table.", 
    "The color on the table is amazing (the darkest option), it offsets our wood floors beautifully and is completely unique. It has a TON of room (72\" option) to where we can probably fit 8 people easily and still have room for food in the middle. Also very sturdy, as our toddler pulls on it and there's not even a slight give. Just LOVE it - worth every penny!", 
    "Warning, the white wash color is a LOT lighter than what is pictured. It still looks great in our space but if you were hoping for more of a driftwood like color that the picture displays you will be disappointed. However, the construction and quality seem good. There is a slight wobble to the table but we fixed it with some furniture felt pads on the bottom of the table legs.", 
    "Excellent quality, definitely a bit more whitewash than expected, but still a very nice quality piece", 
    "This is a great table. It looks like real barn wood but thankfully, doesn't soak up any water from drinks. Overall, it's nice and worth the price.", 
    "Had to wait a little longer for delivery on this piece. But let me tell you it was well worth the wait. I searched high and low for a 72\" round dining table and found only 1 in the stores and it was twice the price, plus it wasn't nearly as beautiful as this piece. This table is amazing . Worth every penny !", 
    "This table is beautiful! Very original. Worth the money.", 
    "This table is a very we'll made piece of furniture. We bought the 60\" which is perfect for our space. Will allow for 6 chairs comfortably. Now the bad part. American West freight was horrible. My table sat on a broken down truck for two weeks before being transferred to another truck. The whole time I was lied to by American West. They never call you back and good luck getting someone who cares. Once it arrived at my local terminal the home delivery service held it for 5 days before they delivered it. I had to get very aggressive with them to get my table delivered in a reasonable amount of time. Overstock was great but they are very limited on what they can do once it leaves their warehouse. It shouldn't take over six weeks to go from California to Georgia. Again, great product! Horrible shipping service.", 
    "I love our new table. It's big enough for family and company!! Bought the warranty just in case but so far it's held up to all expectations!!!", 
    "We purchased the 72\" in the gray wash and it is truly a stunner! It is solid, does not rock and the surface is absolutely beautiful.", 
    "Color is a little odd, doesn't look like the finish is complete", 
    "Table is beautiful and was delivered in one piece. The top appears to be water proof as we do not use placemats and set glasses directly on the table with no stains or issues. The only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is the table is very light and if you lean on it, the table will lift (tip). Surprising as it appears to be heavy. It fits 6 upholstered chairs around it.", 
    "I get compliments all the time on this table! It's gorgeous!", 
    "Nicely built, SOLID. One note, the vintage white color shown in the picture is not what I received. It's more of a natural blonde wood with a bit of white wash blended into it. Overstock should update the picture. Very attractive and nice table for the $$.", 
    "At first I was reluctant to buy online sight unseen. However, I liked the look of this one after combing over dozens of tables online and being reclaimed wood made this one more enticing. I wanted more of a modern design than traditional. Also wanted a well built sturdy table. The delivery was faster than expected but perfect timing as we had just moved in our new place the night before. I ordered, table came in one piece wrapped in furniture covering. So happy no assembly. The delivery men took care bringing the piece in. Almost thought we couldn't fit it through the door but made it no problems. I so delighted and excited that the table was exactly what I wanted. Goes very well with my mid-century mixed modern chairs. This thing is solid and built well. I ordered this in the beautiful grey finish I am so glad I didn't go with the white wash. I was also afraid I didn't order large enough but the 54\" is huge and fits perfectly. Very happy with my purchase. Kudos to Overstock for offering such a prize. Well worth the price I paid.", 
    "When the table finally arrived my wife fell in love with the craftsmanship and the white washed finish. This table comes fully assembled, so make sure it fits through your door. When its turned on its side accommodate for 30.5 inches. 4 meaty chairs work best (tried 6 but too crowned) and the construction is sturdy. I think we could of gone for the 60 inch to accommodate 6 chairs. The only negative was one of the bolts connecting the bottom of the table was filled in the putty(rating a 5 otherwise). I contacted overstock and they are addressing this issue.", 
    "Ordering this table was a horrible experience. The logistics with American West and Eldred Delivery was a nightmare (almost 8 weeks long). American West was extremely unfriendly and just down right rude. Overstock reps took over and pushed it along and tried their very best to make sure the table was delivered (I am thankful for them). Now, as for the table...I am giving this a 3 star not because of the major delivery issues but for the simple fact the table is 3-5 shades lighter than is shown online (I checked 3 different computers against chairs that I also purchased at Overstock and all 3 monitors show the same (or practically the same) color. This table looks like it is natural and has very grainy top (which greatly cheapens the look). The table is made well and is sturdy. I will not pay to have it restocked especially with the nightmare with the delivery companies. I have been in contact with Overstock and have suggested they require vendors to show at least 2 or more pictures of the actual product (not just color swatches or a very small piece of the item). Also, it came to me wrapped in moving blankets alone (just two one for the top and one for the bottom feet). So, buyers beware...", 
    "Beautifully made, very sturdy. Got the grey.", 
    "Ordered the 48\" in Chestnut and it is absolutely beautiful! The color is less red then pictured which was perfect for me. The tabletop is beautifully finished with distresses areas which really give character to the table. I have seen similar tables elsewhere for twice the price. Don't hesitate, you will be very pleased. I have paired 4 hyacinth chairs with an 8' jute rug for a really tropical look. Very pleased with this purchased which arrived in perfect shape in just 3 1/2 weeks.", 
    "We received this table after it shipped from west coast to east coast. It is absolutely beautiful - gorgeous, heavy wood with authentic age gives this piece real beauty. It fits in perfectly with ******* **** pieces with a similar look. But after we had this table for 6 weeks, it cracked in 3 separate places down the center. It sounded like a shotgun went off when it happened, I think the adhesive between the boards popped loose somehow. Overstock was WONDERFUL about sending out a replacement and picking up the cracked table. Their customer service is truly unmatched. I'm waiting on the new table now and hope it is as beautiful as the first (without the cracking)!", 
    "I relied heavily on the previous reviews when I decided to purchase this table. We ordered the 72\" round table in Vintage White. Like other reviewers said, it is more of a natural finish than white but it is still a beautiful table. It arrived fully assembled and ready to eat on! It looks to have a matte poly with wax finish although I can't be sure. I would love to contact the manufacturer and ask about care for this table. It's sturdy, well made and a great addition to our new home! Great price for what you get!", 
    "I got the 48 inch In chestnut. They delivered 72 inch by mistake. Overstock picked up and delivered the correct table the next weekend. Table is amazing. Love the irregularities of the wood which is lacquered from top to bottom in a satin finish. it's solid wood and very heavy. Quality is outstanding. Amazing response from overstock In getting the correct size. Well worth the 6 week wait.", 
    "I bought the 72 inch grey. I'm so glad I read the reviews because the pictures really do not do it justice. I can't stop looking at this table when I'm home! The vintage look is perfect and the colors are just beautiful.", 
    "This table is very substantive. I got the 54\" white and I was little surprised that it looked more like unfinished wood than a whitewashed piece. But it took me about 15 minutes to completely fall for it. I paired it with four Signature Design by Ashley Mestler Dining Antique White Upholstered Chairs. They're not a perfect match, but they complement the table very well. The table easily fits 4 or 6 chairs. I'm looking forward to using this piece to anchor my entire first floor. It's just the table for the job.", 
    "Great table. Well constructed. Well worth the money", 
    "I am extremely pleased with this table. I read the excellent reviews of it and they are true. It is quality construction, substantial and very good looking! I was shopping for a round table at some of the high end decorator-only showrooms and I feel this table compares to many I saw at one fifth the price.", 
    "Great design. Solid. I wish it was a little darker, but still like it.", 
    "Excellent table and craftsmanship. We are very pleased. Highly recommend!", 
    "This is a really nice quality table. It is very heavy. The finish is exactly like the photo. I ordered the \"white\" but it is actually very natural in color. The zoomed photo on the leg of the table from this site is NOT what it looks like. You won't be disappointed with this table.", 
    "It took awhile to arrive, but was worth the wait! I couldn't find anything like this in the stores, so took a chance ordering online.The table is gorgeous! Very sturdy and well made. The finish is a beautiful grey with a bit of steel blue in some lights. I am very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "It took 3 times to get a table that wasn't defective (1st one was cracked, 2nd one was lopsided) and each time it took 4 weeks for delivery. I ended up waiting 3 months to receive the final product but with that said, it was worth the wait. The table is gorgeous and it's the ONLY reason I crossed my fingers and hoped for one to arrive in good condition. It's thick, heavy wood and the color (i got it in gray) is so pretty. It's just the rustic look I was going for. I ordered it in the 72\" and was hoping to get 9 chairs around it but it looks like I will only get 8 - bummer! I do wish it were a tad bigger but all in all, I'm happy with it.", 
    "All the glowing reviews on this table are embellished. Did they pay these people? It's not amazing. It's not better than you expect. I find the table is just ok. Very gray. Cracks throughout. Feels like it's been half finished. Sturdy but light. It may not last a long. Definitely overpriced. If I had the chance, I wouldn't buy it again for what I paid. Maybe half the price or less. Overall, this table was more like \"eh\" when seeing it in person. And I often regret spending so much money on it. Delivery took a very long time. \"White glove\" is a joke. Expect two greasy guys to shove this thing wherever and expect a tip. Next time I won't be shopping at Overstock. Feels like they warp the reviews to appear amazing when they are selling *** junk.",
