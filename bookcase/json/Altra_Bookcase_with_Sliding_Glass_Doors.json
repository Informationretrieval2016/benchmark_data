    "It was not as tall as I expected and shelf heights and depth don't allow for much storage. It would be better utilized for the showcase some curios. I needed something for storage and much more functional.The material is not that sturdy but it does look cute.", 
    "I bought this for my husband to show some of his collectibles, the size is perfect and the easy slide doors are great. The main pieces had a lot of gaps that had to be filled in with caulk.", 
    "Just started putting this together and #1 Bag of major components is missing. Had to call customer service. Very disappointed. I'll rate it later when I'm able to put it together.", 
    "The bookcase is solid and looks quite nice, the doors slide well. Good value", 
    "On time arrival.. Boxed properly, all parts and Instructions. Looks perfect!", 
    "I love this beautiful bookshelf, which was purchased for my son's nursery. My only complaint is that some of our books are too deep to fit on the shelves. Otherwise, it is exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "Product was received damaged and seemed as if it was a return. Received good customer service with refund, but probably will not order that type of bookshelf again."
