    "This is a very nice sofa for the price. It was delivered on time and was easy to assemble. Looks very neat and clean and it very comfortable.", 
    "Please beware if you're looking for a couch that is a medium greyish beige color, this is not it. It is more of VERY light beige, bordering on ivory. I am so disappointed, as I already have an off-white couch and now, I have TWO! Was really hoping it was darker. Not sure what I'm going to do....", 
    "Overstock needs to have sellers properly represent color. I wanted beige as promised! This was green/ gray UGLY! It couldn't match a thing.", 
    "The color of the couch is very close to the picture. Easy to put together with clear understandable directions. Disappointing that the cushion covers are not reversible. All and all I'm very happy with the product.", 
    "The sofa's quality isn't the best. From the pictures it looks a lot more sturdy and polished. Also, within 48 hrs putting it together one of the throw pillows seams came undone. Overstock was able to locate 2 more and send them too me, but just shows the quality isn't that great. It will do for now, but wish I wouldn't have paid over $*** for it..", 
    "I was looking for comfortable, soft feel, perfect size for my 1 bedroom apartment, and attractive. And I got it. This is a well-made sofa, there is a nice amount of cushion. Assembly was surprisingly easy. No problems. The pillows are not my taste, buy they are quality. I always cover mine with new covers anyway. And it's comfortable! Yay.", 
    "This is not a sofa at all. It is a tiny, lightweight, flimsy, poorly made loveseat! Definitely not for everyday use. 5 months in and I am already thinking of throwing it in the trash. So disappointed...", 
    "The packaging is a marvel. When I saw the box I thought I had ordered an ottoman instead of a sofa. The color was true to the picture and I find the cushions firm and comfortable. I would have preferred a high back cushion but for the price I paid (on sale) you can't beat it. Assembly was easy and took only 10 minutes with another person's help.", 
    "This item arrived in one 100 lb box, which was a bit difficult to maneuver. So I opened it outside and brought it in piece by piece. Easily assembled, and very comfortable. The cushion covers are removable, so they can be easily cleaned. I am very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "At first I was very pleased to find such an affordable, comfortable couch for my small space. However, after only 2 1/2 months of regular use, the center support piece has broken and the middle of the couch is now directly on the floor. I would implore prospective buyers to spend the extra cash for a couch that will last more than a couple of months.", 
    "This couch was horrible. It didn't fit together correctly, it was uncomfortable and the arm of it cracked when I leaned on it. Terrible workmanship, especially for the amount of money I paid.", 
    "This sofa was very easy to assemble (considering it is a major piece of furniture) and has turned out good looking and of apparently excellent quality and durability. For the price, I am delighted.With a five star rating, I can't reflect minor areas for improvement, but to list them I would say that I would make the pieces, or the bags they come in, easier to move since it was awkward and somewhat difficult to get it all inside and to the required room. If you have a partner to help this problem should be pretty minimal. A bit more labeling to ease the insertion of the cushion into the fabric cover might make it easier to get it all together. Be very sure to tighten the bolts a couple of times (I did after 24 hours) to ensure that the middle is as sturdy as possible since maximum strength in this area is so critical to the couch. None of these issues caused me any serious difficulty.I will try to revisit the review after a year or so to report if it has held up well over time. So far- great.", 
    "The packaging on this piece is very impressive. You would never know there was a sofa in the box. The color is on the green side- khaki tan. The seat cushions are firm and the piece puts together quickly. I use it as a home staging piece, so no one is really going to be sitting on it, but it is a great small sofa for an apartment or den.", 
    "this is a great couch. i would not recommend it for very large people because it would not be that sturdy. i use it as additional seating in a very large living room. mostly for guests and not every day use. the quality is good and pretty comfortable. i will be ordering another one soon.", 
    "Delivery on time, packing of item very impressive, easy assembly, quality of item very good.", 
    "This was my first purchase ever on this site, i kinda got my expectations up to high. I ordered in 3/1 it came on 3/7. I havent even had this couch a full 24 hrs and im ready to get rid of it. So the delivery process was fast, I like that..thanks overstock. The couch itself came in a large box & took about 30 mins to put together. Immediately I noticed it was a soft green color which I wasn't expecting. Going off of the description I was under the assumption that it was a light beige. Secondly it has a strange odor to it that over powers my living room. I smells like a mixture of nail polish and car oil. I don't even like sitting on it bc it gives me a slight head ache. Third the couch itself is tiny, it should be listed under kids furniture. This is not suitable for your adverage sized adult. The arm rest come down so low unless your under 5ft it feels like your going to fall over the side when you sit down. The cushions hang over the edge making it very uncomfortable to sit on bc you have to constantly adjust the cushions. Calling customer service soon as I submit this review for my money back. Very disappointed.", 
    "decent for the price. back cushions are falling apart after 8 months though.", 
    "Love it. Looks very nice in my living room.", 
    "I should've read the reviews. It looked like what I wanted. But as they say, cushions have a strong chemical smell, close inspection shows it is cheaply made, and I made the mistake of thinking Serta was a \"good name\". The way it came in a small box reminded me of those advertisements that say, \"... and just add water...\".", 
    "The sofa color is accurate and the legs are black instead of brown (whew, I don't have to paint them. Wasn't too hard to put together.HOWEVER, the seat cushions hang over the edge of the sofa about 3 inches--can foresee them bending downwards. Also, the interior of the seat is not flat on the front edge and it pushes out instead of being flat.", 
    "I ended up sending this back. It's much smaller than it appears in the picture. I took measures but when it got it put together, which was very easy to do, it was just too small and low to the ground. It's like a mini love seat. Might work great in a studio apartment for a petite person with all petite friends and relatives....", 
    "couch was so small not at all what expected", 
    "Just for looks, not for comfort. Hard to keep cushions in place.", 
    "not sure how long it will last though. easy to put together.", 
    "Super cool engineering to design a couch that comes in a square box that looks like it's half the size of the couch. Required to put the couch together but it's super easy and quick 10 mins max. The couch is small on the width side. I'm average height 5'10 and the couch is not comfortable for me as it's not deep enough. For a small apartment and for people who are shorter I think the couch would work well but overall it's too small for normal sized avg and above height people.", 
    "Poor quality sofa condition is poor.", 
    "Awesome and comfy! Sooooo comfy! And super soft too. Absolutely love the couch.", 
    "I saw the previous reviews regarding the color issues but decided to purchase anyway--as mentioned by others, this is not really a beige couch but is a green/grey/beige--returning was easy enough but cost me around $*** in shipping. :(", 
    "Great sofa for small place. Easy to assemble and not uncomfortable.", 
    "I bought this sofa for my mom, who just moved into an apartment had had to downsize her furniture. The sofa arrived in a approx. 100 pound box, but everything was neatly packed and there were absolutely no dirt or scratches on any of the pieces. It does come in multiple pieces for assembly, but the instructions were easy to follow and I was able to put it together quite simply by myself in about an hour (I am also female ). It is designed that you can out with together with no additional tools needed, which was nice.One other item to note as other reviewers have stated - this sofa is not a light tan color. It is more of a medium beige with a gold/yellow undertone. Not a beige/tan/grey undertone, as the picture more presents. I can also see why some people say that the beige color has a slight greenish tone to it. It is definitely more on an \"earthy\" beige and not a more modern sand beige color. The brown accent pillows look like the photo and also have the same fabric as the sofa on the backs of them, so you can flip the accent pillow around if you don't care for the design of them.For the price when on sale on overstock, I thought the sofa was a very good deal! It is comfortable and firm enough in the seat for my 82 year old mom with leg arthritis to get in and out of it. This is not the quality of a higher end retail store-type sofa, but for the low price, it works great for her smaller apartment being only 73\" wide.", 
    "Great for one person. Easy to assemble. Very sturdy.", 
    "Was questioning a sofa that ordered online that we had to assemble but it is great! SUPER easy to put together and the fabric is so soft! No issues with the cushions - they come air vacuumed but when I opened they expanded to size!", 
    "I love it, it matches everything in my living room, I have a lot of compliment from family and friends. And easy to put together and shipping was fast . It was worth buying this.", 
    "I was shocked to see the size of the box and that there was only one when it was delivered. To my surprise everything was there tucked away within the open spaces of the back panels of the couch. It was easy to assemble by myself and once completed it is beautiful. The only thing negative I can say is, I wished it was larger other than that it is a great buy.", 
    "We bought two of these sofas. I am amazed that you can get an American made sofa packed ik n a box and offer free shipping at such a low cost. These are great sofas. They are not perfect. I am very pleased with what I got though. The cushions are on the firm side. Still comfortable enough to take a nap. As the other reviews stated, it has a green hue. My house is earth tone, so it's no big deal. If you want a great look for little money, this may be the sofa for you!", 
    "This couch has firm cushions with just the right amount of give. The color is a very light tan but its nice. Very easy to assemble. I put it together myself in about 20 minutes. The only negative thing I have to say about this couch is that its not very wide but that's it. Still very happy with my purchase", 
    "Don't let the box it comes in fool you. Really easy to put together..It looks great and nice to seat on.", 
    "it was a cinch to put together and very comfy. great couch for the money", 
    "good piece. Reasonably comfortable and easy to construct. Fit and finish could be better, but compromise with tight package for shipping.", 
    "I love this sofa. So easy to assemble and a great price!", 
    "This is a nice piece of furniture, easy to put together...a little smaller than I expected but I like it anyway.", 
    "easy assembly, firm but that is good for what I am using them for. Size is small so check your measurements to make sure they fit your space.", 
    "Very pleased with my purchasef. I have a small place so it fits perfectly and is very comfortable. Easy to put together. The only real negative is a funny smell that is gradually going away. I think it is from being packed so tightly and the materials used in the cushions and backing."
