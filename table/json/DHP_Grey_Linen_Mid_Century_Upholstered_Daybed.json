    "I have been looking for a day bed or piece of furniture that would be good for an extra bed or a place to comfortably watch TV. This looks great and suits what I need it for. The assembly instructions were easy to follow, however, it is kind of time consuming to assemble it. It squeaked at first, but the noise went away after sitting on a couple of times.", 
    "The bed itself is beautiful, the back was a little lower than expected...be sure to check measurements. Putting it together was quite a task, it took us over three hours. In any case, very happy with the purchase. Great value for the money.", 
    "This day bed was true to the picture and size dimensions perfect. I fit this into a window nook in my living room and added a $*** firm twin mattress with reinforced sides do that this could function as both a bed and a couch, without being too springy. I added a bunch of Various sized decorative pillows. It's perfect and I've already taken many naps on it! I do wonder if this item could have been less expensive since not much material to it, but it's nice and easy to assemble. It looks modern and not bulky like some modern couches can be. I love that it's a bed and a couch!", 
    "This daybed is beautiful and the linen looks to be of very good quality. I saw this on another website at a much higher price. I am very pleased with this product.", 
    "I think is just perfect!!!!", 
    "Putting it together was not bad or to long because I had help. When I started the 2nd out it was quick. ( bought 2 )", 
    "Bed itself is very nice and well made, however, packaging was not good. We put high beautyrest mattress on it and it works great together. Please note that sides are not reversible. About the packaging -It came on two boxes that were wide open barely holding stuff inside. I had to call customer service to complain.", 
    "I really love the look and feel of this bed."
