    "not real leather, bonded leather, I wouldn't have bought if i knew it was bonded leather", 
    "Love it. It is much more than I expected", 
    "if you are Big [and or Tall] this futon / sofa might feel a little bit restrictive or unsatisfying, otherwise it's really nice and deserves every bit of 4 stars...", 
    "We purchased a used futon identical to this one and loved it so much I started searching for another for the living room to replace our couch. Overstock notified me when they had it in stock and the price was excellent. Oddly, these Abbyson futons are exceptionally comfortable as either a couch or flat as a bed. I love the adjustable ends and back. It is a bit on the 'hard' side but the leather is soft and thick and I can tell it is made to last. Sturdy construction and amazing attention to detail in this price range. Very happy customer. ***on a side note, the freight shipping was a nightmare. It was of no fault of Overstock and entirely the shipper. We live rural and its a day trip to haul to our location. After 6 weeks of bugging the shipper it was finally delivered.", 
    "Gave this one to our daughter when she got her first apartment. While she had a more traditional sofa, she wanted something former college friends could sit on when visiting. The quick convertibility is great for when one of her friends stays overnight in her one bedroom apartment. She loves it!"
