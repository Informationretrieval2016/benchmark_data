    "I like it. It is small enough to fit in my bedroom. I'm 5'6\", and 130lbs and it just fits me fine. Might not work for a large or tall person. It's easy to recline and return. It shipped fast, I was amazed. It does come it 2 pieces (shipped in same box). And assembly was just slipping the back in to brackets, no tools required. If your looking for a recliner that is not over stuffed, this is it!", 
    "NEVER buy a recliner that doesn't have a lever to bring down the foot rest. Thsi one just has a thing you pull to release it and I never put the chair back because in order to make the foot rest stay back down, I have to tilt the chair on it's back and push it down with my hands. I suippose I'm weak from recent surgery, but my strong friend had a hard time with it too. It's a pretty chair and comfortable anyway, but a little low for me. I'm keeping it as a non recliner because it's too difficult to return it,.", 
    "We really like this chair. It is a tiny bit smaller than most recliners, but it was also the cheapest we found and Im good at shopping around for the best deal. Its not bulky though, which we like and we have, not a tiny house, but a smaller 3 bedroom ranch with an oddly shaped living room with limited space, so the recliner is the perfect size. It's firm not squishy, which we also like. The bolts and screws are nice and tight, the chair bottom extends or pops up smoothly, its not jerky. The fabric is really easy to clean and seems pretty durable. Our 3 yr old spilled OJ on it the second day we had and I was worried the rubbing or cleaning would ruin the fabric but it didnt. It came out good as new. Overall we are very happy with this chair. If we ever decide to get another recliner for the living room we will be getting the lighter tan colored one.", 
    "My husband and I just relocated to IL from TX and left everything behind! We really wanted recliners, and in looking for two, we found these to be the most desireable. They arrived in a little less than a week and I was able to assemble them easily. If you are looking for comfort and ease, would definitely recommend these chairs!", 
    "I purchased this chair to replace a cat torn rocker recliener. With a knee replacement surgery approaching, I wanted a sturdy,non-moving chair. I also needed a slightly shorter chair so that my feet fit comfortably on the floor. This chair has all of these features. I thought that the arm rest were slightly too short but by using it, found it may be better for me to rise from the chair after surgery. I do wish the back was at a slightly more of an angle. The material feels great, its easy to clean, and hides pet hair (a must in our house). With all of the above in consideration, I feel that the quality of the chair at such a low price is worth the amount and then some. This is a great piece of furniture for someone begining to set up house.", 
    "a recliner should stay IN THE RECLINING POSITION until one decides to sit up. this chair is more like a CATAPULT. if small children or animals sit on it they do it at the risk of great bodily harm. i weigh over 125 and am only 5'2 and did not care about the the reviews that said it wasnt good for big people but this chair does NOT stay reclined...i called customer service 2 days ago about returning it but before i could do so the chair got a burn-hole in it because tonight i had to choose between putting out the ashes or stopping the cat on my lap from CATAPULTING INTO THE WALL. DON'T BUY THIS CHAIR FOR ANYTHING BUT TO SIT UP (UNCOMFORTABLY) STRAIGHT WITH YOUR LEGS UP---i'll suffer with it unless os contacts me and takes it back with the hole it got after i had already called about it's defectiveness", 
    "Size was not anywhere near what was indicated...Description said 38\" and it was actually 26\".", 
    "The most uncomfortable thing is the fact that the leg rest did not come up high enough. It only elevated to a 45 degree angle in the recline position. All of the recliners I have ever had/sat in would elevate to 90 degrees. This 45 degree position was very uncomfortable and actually made my back hurt. I have since purchased a recliner at a \"walk in\" store because something as important as comfort should be experienced before you buy. I have not figured what to do with this item. It is in the bedroom used as a side chair right now but I think it will go to a resale shop soon.", 
    "I am very pleased with this chair. I liked the sturdiness as a piece of furniture for my den & it is easy ro recline and I like the way the side recline handle fits flat into the chair.", 
    "chair was esay to put together, have to pull the back forward yourself when resetting the chair to upright position, but it but it is very easy to do. Easy to clean fabric. Chair is on the smaller size but is excactly what I wanted", 
    "For the money this is a great deal. The chair is comfortable, nice looking, easy to operate and looks good in my family room.", 
    "Well, I only spent around $170, so what can you expect from a recliner? If you want Lazy Boy quality, spend Lazy Boy money! I only use it as a seat in a room, not as a main piece of furniture in a common area, so for me, it works fine!", 
    "Color and fabric are nice and comfortable to sit on. The construction its self is poor. The plastic coasters broke after 1 month of use. My husband is 180lbs. and would sit on it every evening to watch tv. After the coasters broke the metal base scratched my hardwood floors - noticebly so. If you need a piece of furniture to fill a space it's very attractive and a space saver. If you need a piece of furniture to actually sit on daily don't buy this chair.", 
    "The worst quality for $$$ that I've ever spent! You get what you pay for! Seams ripped almost immediately. Board stood out across the backrest! Rickety! Can't close the recliner now. The whole thing sways like a ship on rough waters. Don't buy one of these in any color!!", 
    "I was looking for some lightweight recliners for my 5th wheel R V . these are perfect. size fit available space and they are lighter yet built to work well in there intended use. Would recommend them to anyone for this use.", 
    "bought 2 of these for my sons room, gaming, tv viewing etc with a buddy - perfect price for such a purpose they are well proportioned and comfy - he loves them! wouldn't necessarily want them as our main living area furniture, but for a bedroom or den/tv area they are great wanted something that was budget friendly and that would last - maybe he'll get to take them to college or something! sprayed them with scotchguard for added durability", 
    "I sent this chair back due to the poor quality. This process was fairly easy thanks to excellent customer service.", 
    "We bought this for our vacation cabin, which we also rent out. I look for nice affordable furniture in case it is ruined by renters. For the price this is a very good chair. It was a little smaller than I expected, however still very comfortable, and the fabric is very nice on it.", 
    "I bought this to add to couch my girlfriend had received from her grandmother and it matched perfectly. Chair quickly snaps in the upright position and is comfortable for someone the height of 5'9 and shorter.", 
    "This is a great product and I love the rich dark chocolate color. I did my research before purchasing this recliner. The size it great and comfortable for me and I'm a plus size gal. It's so comfortable you can fall asleep in it after a hard day at work. Its not heavy at all and to set it up took less than 5 minutes. Only problem, the area that lifts your legs up is very hard to come down when your ready to be up right. You will need to get off the recliner then push it in by hand. For the price your paying, under 200. This is a great bargain and product.", 
    "Great chair I bought it for my husband for Fathers day but I might have to get me one too!", 
    "Thought it would be a bit larger but works well and is very comfortable", 
    "Economical, but not as sturdy as I expected. The reclining mechanism is stiff for a full recline. Fabric is good and chair is comfortable.", 
    "it is light, easy to assemble, and comfortable, good recliner for the price, and small for my small apartment.", 
    "The chair is very well made and comfortable. I like the dark brown color. Good value for the money.", 
    "Well I figured right out of the box the chair would be at it\"s best. Easy assembly, one piece that\"s all.Looks real nice. Comfortable enough, the foot rest is plenty big enough and extending it is easy. Thelumbar pillow is fine and the head rest is very nicely padded and comfy. The padded arm rest top off the chairs look and feel, soft. Now we just have to wait and see how well this unit holds up. For the pricetag I would recommend it..", 
    "The chair is firmer then expected. Overall comfortable it depends on your size, very snug to a normal size indivitual", 
    "I find the chair was not great quality, ok for the price. Not very comfortable, to sit in with out reclining back, very stiff. I would not buy another recliner with out being able to try it out first.", 
    "the chair is cheaply made, hard and very uncomfortable. a bust", 
    "Chairs seem okay - but much smaller than I thought they would be. Also they do not rock or move unless the feet are up- chair un-comfortable to sit in. The seats are really too small for a regular size person. I felt too tight when I sat in one. I was really disappointed - I will have to replace these chairs. They were not what I wanted.", 
    "This is a great chair for the price paid. It is really cozy. Not overly big at all and the mechanism to recline works well.", 
    "not exactly what I thought smaller than I needed and not very comfortable to sit in", 
    "I am 5'7\" 130 lbs and it's perfect for my needs. I just have to be careful not to rip the back of it when I move it around.", 
    "Small, Not well built. The color is nice. The chair looks good setting in my living room, but I would not recommend a very large person to set in it, I don't believe this chair will have more than a couple of good years in it.", 
    "This is a cheap chair which is why it is so cheap. Inside must be made of cardboard. Had it for one both and already in the garbage pile. Was sat in and the arm busted out. Do not recommend this. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!", 
    "not very sturdy or roomy. Should have paid the extra 60 to 90 bucks and got one that wraps around you and you can sink into. This one was barely big enough to fit in. Quite disappointed.", 
    "I bought the chair for my Aunt who is 91 yrs. old. The color looks good in her living room, it also is a perfect fit. It replaced a Queen Anne chair that she used to sit in. She states that it's comfortable. I wish the lever on the side of the chair was a little easier for her to use. She has an ottoman that she uses while sitting to keep her feet up.", 
    "Was exactly what I expected.", 
    "Hate the material,not comfortable at all", 
    "Love the recliner, now just need one that rocks too.lol", 
    "My son was incredibly happy with this recliner throughout his college years; gave him his own comfy space in an apartment with 3 other guys. I highly recommend this item.", 
    "This chair is pretty comfy. For whatever the reason tho., maybe just the 1 I received, it's a bit lopsided!!!", 
    "the part broke that lets the foot stool up and down.. I can't believe I paid this much and got so bad merchaize.....Some thine needs to be be................", 
    "it is very comfie and it is a little on the slim side not very wide but over all great chair.", 
    "Gift for husband, nice chair but too short, husband 6'2. So the children and I enjoyed it!", 
    "Nice size but very hard to close with your legs. The material is a nice color but every tiny bit of lint or fleece lint shows big time! I think I could have looked further and done better on Overstock chairs.", 
    "Hard to shut. Soft, comfortable.", 
    "good value and comfortable for the price", 
    "I love this recliner, especially for the price. Its not the best quality, but is holding up very well and I use it every day. And the size is perfect! I needed a smaller recliner and this one is it.", 
    "I could not be happier with this recliner. It was easy to assemble, about 5 minutes. The fabric is excellent, the operation is smooth, and the chair generally is very comfortable.Thank You!", 
    "Nice brown color and very comfortable", 
    "Great chair for the price. Not too bulky. Strong. I like it and I recommend it.", 
    "The only complaint I have is that the foot rest is hard to fold down and click so that stays. It small for a big guy but just right for this, \"tired Woman\".", 
    "Love this chair. Very comfortable, and the price is unbeatable!", 
    "since I have a small living room area, this chair is just the right size. matc hes perfectly with my living room set.", 
    "Works for teenagers not adults", 
    "Very uncomfortable recliner, I will very buy another", 
    "So happy with this recliner. Was happy with the price.", 
    "you lied ! it's not comfortable at all, I used it one day and that was it I JUNKED IT", 
    "quick delivery, easy assembly, very comfortable and perfect size for a small space.", 
    "well, I was looking for a low cost chair for my daughter... no wonder the cost was right.... it wasn't worth a penny more... very uncomfortable... very small .. and when you go to recline, it feels like it will come apart ... you get what you pay for ..", 
    "Enjoying my chair as I type. Comfortable and only wish I'd purchased it sooner!!", 
    "chairs are worth the price", 
    "Very nice for the price. I wouldn't say it is exceptional quality, but I definitely feel like we will get more than our money's worth out of it.", 
    "Packaging-box showed wear but contents were protected. No bent parts or damaged fabric. Assembly-simple and easy to do. Back rails slid into place and positively locked in. Chair-comfortable micro-fiber fabric that is reasonably thick and well padded with well-tailored stitching. Leg rest release (not a lever) deploys the rest easily. The chair back leans back but will not hold a position. All the way back is not flat, but that is OK for me. This is not a wall hugger chair. Retracting the leg rest does need a good amount of force to lock into place. Chair color matches the photo well. This is medium sized, so a good fit for me (5 ft 6in) since I can sit with my feet on the floor. It is not very heavy, so I can re-position it without floor sliders. The price is reasonable and seems to be a very good value. I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Good chair for the price but on the small side", 
    "it was a fathers day gift and he loved it", 
    "One star is one to many.This is apiece of junk. It is uncomfortable, bad cheap fabric, small seat size unless your a small person. Really hard to lower the foot rest also. don't waste your money !!!!", 
    "I just love this chair it is the right fit for me and my living room, so comfortable that I want to fall asleep in it.", 
    "I love my recliner. It was super easy to put together since it came in two pieces. Reclines far enough back for a good sleep! Chair is very comfortable and holding up very well. I have to chase my husband and son out of the \"mommy\" seat every day!", 
    "Very comfortable for knitting in", 
    "Very stiff and uncomfortable. No at all what was expected", 
    "Looks nice, apartment sized, comfortable, opens easily with lever but hard to close when you get up. Bought it for 88 year old Father-in-law & he has to get up & push it closed", 
    "perfect size for smaller space. Very comfortable", 
    "Very happy with my purchase!", 
    "little smaller than it looked", 
    "Works great for my apartment.", 
    "This recliner is very nice good price.", 
    "Seat cushion flattened down very quickly within 2 weeks", 
    "It cost less so we get less, as it is a bit smaller than other styles, but it works and it looks nice.", 
    "its a little smaller then it looks pluse the fabric gets so dirty fast and can't clean it won't buy anything with fabric without seeing it first.", 
    "Easy assembly, just two pieces clip together, fabric is lush, and my 88 year old dad loves it!", 
    "It was okay, just a little too small for my 6' 2\" son in law.", 
    "The price was right. But this chair is not built to last more than 6 months. The seat material is already \"shining\" where I usually sit - so I expect it to wear through shortly. It is positioned too low for a man over 6 feet tall, and as a result it is a task to get up out of it. But if you need something for a brief rental in a temporary apt, then throw away it is ideal. I just regret I didn't buy something more substantial.", 
    "This chair is smaller than a regular recliner but is well built. Would have preferred the arms were higher. The foot recline requires the person in the chair push very hard to snap it closed. Shipping and assembly were simple and easily done by one person. The color was perfect and the material is durable yet soft as a microweave.", 
    "Support wood in the back of this rocker broke after just 8 months. Nice to look at but not very sturdy. Only used by a 150 lb guy and it broke.", 
    "It is pretty much what I expected, you get what you see", 
    "catch broke - stayed in open position, came up with my own fix!", 
    "Nice looking. Hard to recline and release for older person,otherwise comfortable.", 
    "good value for the money. comfortable and not cheaply made.", 
    "my daughters housewarming gift and she loves it", 
    "Can't really complain as it was so cheap, but it didn't hold up to daily use very well. One arm has broken.", 
    "The other reviews said it's a smaller recliner and that is what I, as a very short person, needed. It is very comfortable and I am happy I ordered it. It came when it was supposed to.", 
    "I expected it to be larger.", 
    "Bought this chair as a gift and it was a bit smaller than expected, but still is an overall great little chair. Beautiful, rich color and very comfortable. Nice buy for the price", 
    "This is a good recliner but the description ssys it rocks. When we put it together it does not rock. That was the big seller for me to buy it. It was a Christmas present and that was the one thing she wanted. Other then that it wad good for what was needed.", 
    "The chair is a bit narrow but I like the firmness of it, provided good back support", 
    "We ordered this chair (4 of them actually) to go into our small lake cabin. We are happy with them because they are small and comfortable for the amount of use they will get. I agree with other reviewers that this item probably wouldn't hold up to constant daily use, but for our purposes, we couldn't be more thrilled with the product for the price. Better yet, *** shipping! They were delivered exactly as stated in their timeline.", 
    "This is the biggest waste of money I've ever spent. The chair is falling apart after one and a half years of use. In fact, the arm fell off completely when using it to get up a couple days ago. The fabric is all worn off the arms and ripping apart by the cushions. I'm SO sorry I spent my money on this product and will never purchase anything from Overstock again.", 
    "I really like the color brown. It goes well with the rest of my furniture. The leg rest pop ups right away, put it is hard to put back inside the chair. I think if I just add WD40 it will work better.Thank You", 
    "Broke a foot, needed a chair, it came quick, have to put a blanket on it because the fabric feels like those stuffed toys you win at a carnival. I am not a small person, and too much weight makes it difficult to fold back up.", 
    "Recliner is very comfortable. How ever if you have weak legs it is very hard to bring chair fully up right locked in position.", 
    "This recliner is a lot smaller than advertised ,more than 5 inches in seat width and depth.For very small people and children it is fine ,for average and large adults it is not.To my satisfaction when I notified Overstock I got fast service on the return and credit for this product when I notified them of the false advertisement on dimensions.", 
    "This product is not comfortable if the user weighs more than 140 lbs. Its design is for very thin people. Advertising should state, \"Ideal for people weighing less than or equal to 140 lbs.", 
    "You get what you pay for with this recliner. If the reclining system had a handle it would have been easier to open and close recliner.", 
    "It looks great on the web site, but not as comfortable as I would have liked. Also, when you move the handle to open the foot rest it pops to the position with a huge jerk. This kind of item needs to be tested personally, in a store perhaps.", 
    "I ordered two of these chairs and they are exactly what I wanted. They are sturdy and comfortable. Would order more merchandise from Overstock.com again.", 
    "Very pleased with my purchase. I purchase two for my bonus room. Love them.", 
    "very good for the price it looks good and it is firm but not to firm", 
    "Great product, does not hit the wall. Grand kids should be supervised, larger ones can tip over when heavily bouncing. Looks good, cleans up well. Made for smaller individuals in stature which my husband and I are, bought 2.", 
    "recliner arrived and the only thing my husband had to do was snap the back into place....no tools. recliner is very compact, not bulky like some of the recliners you see. very comfortable. excellent value for the price!!!", 
    "I am completely satisfied with my recliner. I wanted one for my bedroom that I could relax in and also sit in to watch TV. I find it very comfortable. I have no problem leaning back in it for a nap. Even though I am a senior citizen I have no problem adjusting the chair when I want to change positions. For me, I couldn't be more satisfied.", 
    "I chose this based on a review by someone that had foot surgery and said it sat low to ground. I have M.S. and needed a chair I could transfer to easily and get out of mt power chair to relax.. It is VERY narrow. My cat fits perfect lol ! After buying a foot wedge cushion so I sit more upright I'm able to at least use it. For the low cost I guess it's filling my needs some what.", 
    "One year later, this chair is filthy, in tatters, and the footrest just snapped. Worst purchase I ever made. I have no pets and am a habitual neat freak...this chair is, simply, GARBAGE. Do not buy at any cost!", 
    "The left side, arm rest, broke completely off after only 5 weeks of use. Threw it out side. A complete waste of money", 
    "Be very careful with this chair it will flip over on you when the foot part is pull out. The size of the chair is smaller than it looks and the material looks cheap.", 
    "just not what I thought it would be for the money. Very disappointing.", 
    "Bought this sight unseen an I'm enjoying the comfort of my new chair. Now I can go sit, relax and enjoy something other than football/sports in my room sitting in my new comfortable recliner. I love it!", 
    "I actually had visited the Overstock warehouse and saw this recliner. I sat in it and felt instant comfort. The Overstock warehouse could not shipped to my home. So I waited until I saw it online. I purchased it had it shipped. I am truly enjoying it in front of my television. I have almost slept in it a couple of times. It is very comfortable and cozy. I am satisfied.", 
    "Received the chair very fast. It was in 2 pieces so easy to move. Not as comfortable as I had before, but still worth the price.", 
    "I ordered two of these chairs for Christmas and they are wonderful. The dark brown color is quite rich and pleasant. As others have said they are rather firm in the seat area initially but have \"settled in\" nicely in the last two weeks. They arrived on-time and were assembled within 5 minutes. Only two pieces. My husband is rather \"chunky\" and 5'8\" and fits nicely. There is only one minor consideration..... if you have issues with leg strength, they are hard to move from the reclining position to the upright position as you must push back with your heel and lower leg. A minor issue that has led to some good laughter here!", 
    "I needed an extra chair and did not have much to spend. This chair fit the bill and I am happy with my choice.", 
    "Very nice chair. It is for my husband. He likes it a lot. Very easy for him to get in and out of. Just what he needs after surgery.", 
    "My son, 5'11\" - 185 lbs, was having a shoulder surgery out of state and needed a recliner to sleep in during recuperation. The width of the seat states 38\" but they do not take into account that the puffy sides take up a large portion of the chair so it reality, the width is more like 28\". Sitting on it equates to sitting on a brick. It is hard with absolutely no give or cushiness. When you extend it, he would hang off the end. It was necessary to put a pillow behind his head so it wasn't hanging off the top end. His feet hung off the bottom end. It is difficult to get the chair to fold and stay folded. Rather than offer a low priced recliner that was worthless, I wish Overstock would not even offer this product. Save your money!", 
    "fairly comfortable chair. I don't sink into it as much as I would like, but a good buy at a good price.", 
    "I ordered my recliner on a Sunday, received it on Wednesday. It is just what I wanted, does not take up too much room and very comfortable. I am now a fan of Overstock.Com", 
    "I find that the product was easy to assemble and light in weight. Everything that I read about the chair so far were a little negative. I love the chair and may purchase another one my living room.", 
    "Was fairly comfortable initially but the comfort level dropped the more i used it. The recliner is not plush enough.", 
    "Just a basic recliner, not ment for anyone over 5'6\". Lays back fine, although lever is a bit cheesy, but does the job. The arm rests are low but padding is great. Arrived in a box at the front porch and two of us put it together in 5 minutes! Perfect for a short term medical recuperation that I purchased it for. Does the job!", 
    "My sister and my brother-in-law fight over this chair. They have another recliner that they paid more for but this one is much more comfortable.", 
    "We are very pleased with our new chair good price comfortable attractive easy to assemble easy to use Luv It", 
    "This recliner is exactly what I was looking for. I have a small room and wanted a recliner. It is very comfortable for a small person such as myself. It is a good quality for the price. Glad that I ordered it.", 
    "I bought this for my husband and he love it. He expend all he free time in the recliner watching TV", 
    "BOUGHT TWO CHAIRS--DIFFERANT COLORS--VERY HAPPY :>)", 
    "This recliner was by far the best deal around. After one month everything still works perfectly and the chair is firm but comfortable. The chair is on the small side, but more than large enough for me (5'4\"). It is a perfectly comfortable chair for taller people, but would not be as good for reclining and/or sleeping for anyone 5'8\" and over.", 
    "Very comfortable. I wanted something a little smaller for a bedroom. This was the perfect size.", 
    "This was a gift for my mom and she loves it! Won't Allow anyone else to sit in it.", 
    "good packing, easy assembly, perfect for my grandma", 
    "i can't say enough about it. it's a perfect fit for my home.", 
    "Arrived very quickly and was extremely easy to assemble.", 
    "This recliner is what I've searched many stores for, and could not find anywhere. I'm very satisfied with the price I paid. The delivery made this even a better bargin. The assembly was to easy, I was very surprised, no tools required. Very happy I found overstock.com", 
    "After reading some of the descriptions given that described the recliner as being like a catapult I expected it to be similar to the larger recliner that I already owned with a spring loaded back. I was pleasantly surprised that the recliner is actually a wall hugger style recliner and I didn't need to have it as far from the wall as I anticipated. Don't know how it can be described as a catapult. Maybe they changed the design. I'm a fairly large guy and fit in the chair, snugly but still fit in quite well. I would certainly buy another one from them to go with the two I have already purchased.", 
    "overstock let me return it with no problems ....i told them about the tipping problem and other than that it was comfortable.....thanks", 
    "I enjoy reclining in my chair every evening and very glad I bought it! It's so comfortable that I find myself falling asleep in it.", 
    "We bought this chair for my special needs granddaughter. Very nice fabric and good seating posture. Easy to recline and to keep clean. Smaller size was perfect for our needs. and the price was exceptional. Easy to put together too.", 
    "it sucks nothing like what i ordered it was for my mom its like a kids chair the pic looks good but what u see is not what up get its a waste of money to shop here", 
    "The chair is okay for the price. It sits very low and seems to tip to the front. Good for people with short legs.", 
    "Chair is great/. Price was super and I am enjoying my chair in my sitting room.", 
    "The cair is a bargain price for what is out there! Good fabric and great color...and comfy!", 
    "I wanted this chair for my elderly mother's bedroom. It arrived quickly and it was just what I was looking for. A nice little chair for the price. Reclines easily and is very comfortable.", 
    "This is not a baby chair, it is a full size person recliner. Can not get any better for the price.", 
    "This is definately not an oversized-overstuffed chair.If you are over 135 pounds you will have to squeeze into it. I needed a smaller chair to replace an overstuffed which took up half of the the room and this was the perfect fit. Even tough it is not overstuffed it is still comfortable for sitting and reading or watching TV but I don't think I will be sleeping in it. For the price it was perfect and the only cons that I have is it does not rock or have a lever for the footrest so you really need to make an effort to get it to the sitting posistion", 
    "They are beautiful recliner the only thing one of the handle to the recliner broke the first time I tryed it", 
    "We are thoroughly enjoying our Tucker Cocoa Recliner. It is a race to see who gets to sit in it.", 
    "is a nice chair, a little firm and the seat is a little narrow, but over all a good chair", 
    "It is a beautiful chair, very well made and comfortable.", 
    "I bought this chair as a gift for my mom, knowing she is hard to please I took a chance and could not believe she was happy with the chair. Needless to say it made me even happier because it was a pretty big package to have to return. Yes. I would recommend this recliner for the price it serves it's purpose. Thank you overstock for selling a product as described.", 
    "Shipped promptly. Packaged well. Easy assembly. Very comfortable.", 
    "A nice, small, comfortable recliner that we ordered for our motorhome and it fits very well in a small space but adds quality at the same time. Only thing is we ordered the cocoa color and got tan instead but close enough!", 
    "This isn't a high-end product, but it is perfect for what we needed. We have this chair in our son's nursery. I don't like rockers or gliders. I just wanted a plain recliner. This was perfect! It is comfy and works out well for when I feed him. I am 5'2 and my husband is 6'. My dad has also used it and he too found it to be comfy, he is 6' and not small. Overall we are very pleased with this purchase... and won't be disappointed if we have to toss it in a year bc we paid less than $200 for it!",

    "good deal, excelent item, fast shipping, thank you", 
    "I bought this chair for my daughter's bedroom and it is perfect! The quality is great and the color was exactly as stated. Easy to assemble and delivery time was exactly as stated.", 
    "Great, well-padded chair for the money. Closer to a $$$$ chair than a $$$$ chair. Easy to open, but difficult to close from reclining position, I am not strong enough to close it with my legs while sitting, and have to get up and use my arms. Other than that, it is very comfortable if you are under about five feet- seven inches. Too low a back for my tall husband, but we knew that when we ordered it.", 
    "I love this recliner.... exactly what i was looking for. Looks great in my living room. Has amazing comfort.", 
    "I needed a compact chair to place in my bedroom, and this is just what I was looking for! Shipment was fast, and well protected. I was a breeze to put together (just slide the back on the base of the chair). It looks beautiful and it's comfortable!", 
    "I bought this chair to put in my master bedroom. It's certainly not plush, but just what I expected for the price. It is comfortable, but nothing extraordinary. A good deal for the low price! I may buy another in the future. Very fast delivery.", 
    "Nice for a small lady, but too small for a big man.... did have a small rip in the lining which required repair...", 
    "Good, cheap chair; doesn't rock; material attracts a lot of lint.", 
    "The chair si in good shape. It arrived in reasonable length of time. It was a little wrinkled but otherwise in good shape. Color and size are excellent.", 
    "Would Definetly would recommend recliner and Overstock.com to friends and family.", 
    "This is a small chair, and It is nice looking and holds up, I'm 6 foot and 300 lbs and I have no problem with it. It is not fancy and does not have all the bells and whistles, but is comftable and seems to hold up well. Plus you put one slide piece in and It is ready to go, we have 3 now so I guess we like them,.", 
    "The chair is made well and is of good quality, but the size of the chair is deceiving. I am 6'2\" tall and I could not comfortably sit in the chair -- my head did not rest on the back of the chair and when it was reclined, my legs hung over the edge. This chair is fine for smaller people, but if you are tall, this chair is not for you."
