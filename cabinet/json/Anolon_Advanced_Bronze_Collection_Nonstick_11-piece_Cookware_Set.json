  "reviews": [
    "I have had my set of the black Analon for 10+ years with never a problem. I ordered these for my daughter, as a gift, and she is just as pleased as I am with them. You can't hurt them! For somebody who cooks 2-3 times per day and doesn't want to spend $1000+ for something like All Clad, these are a given. Tried and trusted.", 
    "We couldn't wait to get the box open to see our new cooking pans - the pans were so well packed that it seemed to take forever to open the box! Great packing though insures a safe product! We LOVE them!", 
    "Great cookware. Unfortunately, I would have liked to have a 12\" lid. Otherwise, perfect.", 
    "Great set so far. I say that because most non-stick pans I've owned get beat up within a year or 2. I'm hoping these will last much longer. They seem like they will. Well built and they cook very evenly and respond to temperature changes very well.", 
    "Perfect. Heavy. Beautiful. These pots have taken my love to cook to another level.", 
    "Great cookware! Everything cooks evenly and clean up is a snap. Delivery from Overstock was fast, as usual. Would buy it again and would recommend it to my best friend!", 
    "Just what I had been wanting. Nice and sturdy! Cooks evenly on my flat-top. Haven't tried them in the oven yet though. Easy clean-up. Such a beautiful set that I wish I didn't have to store them in a cabinet, out of sight, but I have limited space. Ordered baking sheets to complete MY set. Highly recommend for the price!", 
    "I am sorry it took so long for my review but I read the reviews before I make a purchase so I thought I would take the time to catch up on my reviews. I bought these 2 years ago and except for a little nonstick occurring on my two daily used skillets I am happy with them I love the color and the heavy duty feel to them.", 
    "We like our new cookware set.", 
    "A great set. Very practical.", 
    "This set is extremely nice. Good quality and heavy pots. They cook uniformly and are easy to clean. Recommended!", 
    "Gave this set to my wife for Christmas. It is heavy duty with a finish that should last a lifetime. The handles are securely fastened", 
    "Have only had this cookware for about a month..I am very happy so far..", 
    "Love my new cookware. works great and looks good! very please so far.", 
    "A gift for my daughter and family. They really like it, so much better than what they had. Easy to clean, keeps looking good all the time.", 
    "Great product for the price!", 
    "These pots are really good, cooks great, looks great. Very well made.", 
    "I really like the color, a lot, they are truly non-stick, and they are very easy to clean. I would recommend getting this set.", 
    "Heavy duty, easy to clean, attractive. Very happy with these!", 
    "This set is not only good looking, I love how it works and feels. Very high quality, cleans easily, and cooks evenly", 
    "The quality is top notch, the color is just perfect and blends well with our espresso cabinets. Can't go wrong with this set. If you need a big Sautee pan, get it separately. This set doesn't satisfy that specific need.", 
    "I have been using this set for 3 years now and they are still in good condition. The regular price for this set is a little pricey but well worth it, overstock recently had it 40% off and I could not resist purchasing this set at a much cheaper price. Love this cookware set.", 
    "Love these nice, heavy pans. I have had them for about 6 months and no complaints yet. One pan came with a smashed lid and Overstock replaced it without any hassle.Definitely recommend.", 
    "This product is wonderful and with the sale it was a great deal!", 
    "The Analon cookware looks and feels like quality. The pots are fairly heavy giving a quality feel. The non-stick surface is very slick and easy to clean. We really like the feel of the handles giving a good comfortable grip. We are very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "item came within expected time and was as described", 
    "These are wonderful pots and pans. Just what I expected.", 
    "Nice weight. Cooks evenly. Non-stick surface is best I've used to date. Very nice looking set.", 
    "I love the frying pans in this set. They're heavy weight, with truly flat bottoms that work very well on a flat top cook top. Be advised, though, that the flared shape of the pots (larger on top than on the bottom) makes the bottom of these pots a non-standard size for a regular (totally not fancy, \"contractor-grade\") flat top cook top. Mine has \"flexible\" burners and the large setting is too big for the two large pots (you don't want to have an active burner that extends beyond the bottom of your pot on a flat top stove), while the small setting is too small to be efficient. Because the largest pot is so big, heating water for pasta takes too long. I would have returned the set because of this, but because they are so heavy I decided against paying for all that shipping and kept my old pasta pot on active duty. The frying pans are great. Wish I could use the pots... If you have gas burners you will love this set.", 
    "These pans are great! Cook evenly. Heat fast. And look good hanging from a pot rack. Highly recommended.", 
    "I love this set of cookware, it matches the browns in my glass kitchen counters (not that that's really important)! I just really like bronze's. They're heavy, sturdy, well put together set! I've been using them since Sept. 2012 & so far so good, no chips or any problems. Arrived nicely packed & secure. The only problem is that nowhere in the description or on the box does it state PFOA/PTFE free? I'm assuming it is, atleast I sure hope so!!!", 
    "I absolutely love this set and look forward to adding to it.", 
    "We love these pots and pans and are just sorry it took us so long to replace our old ones. The sizes of the pans are perfect for us and cleaning is so easy compared to other pots and pans. I especially like the handles--no need for hot pad holders. these are great pans and I would recommend them to anyone.", 
    "I love my pots and pans heat evenly easy clean up overstock easy and fast divlely", 
    "Great product! The only thing I was upset with was online it said these were dishwasher safe but the directions inside the box said they were not dishwasher safe."
