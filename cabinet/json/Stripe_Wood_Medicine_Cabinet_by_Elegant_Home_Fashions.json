    "I read the reviews prior to purchasing and am glad I did. The cabinet came as ordered within a short period of time and was clearly marked for assembly. My husband had no trouble putting it together and since the tips in other reviews mentioned to \"yes use the wood glue\" and \"no don't tighten the screws until the last minute\" we have a wonderful cabinet for our smaller basement bathroom. I love the style and the quality. The size is not too small, in fact it fits perfectly in a small bathroom and is not overbearing. I will definitely be looking at Overstock's products again.", 
    "I looked at a bunch of medicine cabinets, anything close to this one was hundreds of dollars. for the price, this one is exactly what i was looking for for a small farm house bathroom to go over a pedistal sink. it is the white laminate plastic stuff, not wood but it looks great, sturdy, fairly easy to assemble if your handy. small, nice style, good dollar value", 
    "the instructions were a problem...no instructions, just pictures. I've assembed many things before and the round metal thing that goes into the round hole is supposed to have a screw that enables it to be locked. There were 2 that there was no way for it to lock. Basically, the instructions were poor but I figured it out. There were a couple interlocking screws I was able to do that enabled the unit to hold together. I was a little disappointed when I opened it and it was in so many pieces. It is serving its purpose. If I recommended it, I'd let people know you have about 30 pieces you have to put together...well, it was packed well.", 
    "This is the perfect medicine cabinet for any small bathroom. We used it in our main bathroom upstairs to make the small space like bigger. The cubicles are great to put washcloths and other small items in and the shelving provides adequate room for toothpaste and other toilitries. Assembly really wasn't that bad. I did it on my own without my husbands assistance and I am by no means \"handy\" Anyway my only complaint to bring it down to 4 stars from 5, is the off-gassing another reviewer mentioned. Not a pleasant smell and probably not good to breathe in.", 
    "This cabinet is extremely well made and suitable for the application that I am placing it in. I am restoring a 1928 Arts and Crafts Bungalow. I have previously ordered a floor cabinet in the same style and with exception the backer board on both, I am well pleased. I will replace the backer with a piece of masonite and paint it to match my color scheme, also the main body of both cabinets I will paint to match. I have not put either cabinet together, but I do not expect difficulty as I am not a novice to these things. I am a 72 years young grandma, who is saving some of Americas historic homes little by little.", 
    "This is a great looking product. It was packed well and arrived in perfect shape. Considering everything is made of MDF these days, I felt that the price was fair. Same item at the local discount store was $30 more. It did take a little help to get this put together - you need an extra set of hands. It will make a nice addition to our guest bathroom.", 
    "I have purchased multiple items on O.co and haven't had a problem, this time the other reviews failed me! I followed all instructions, but there was no way to keep the top and bottom pieces of this cabinet sealed. The second it was assembled per instruction, I attempted to lift it and it fell apart before I could get it on the wall! I don't know if they've hanged the craftsmanship since previous reviews. Terrible. The size was just what I wanted. The front looked slightly cheap. It would do in a pinch, if you can figure out a way to keep it together. I returned it and received amazing customer service though.", 
    "I've purchased numerous products over the internet in the past ten years. This is the first time I was truly disappointed with a product due to quality. While I realize this is a very inexpensive cabinet, the truth is that the cabinet hinges hold the door extremely loose even though the hinges themselves are fastened securely. The locking mechanism that attaches one of the cabinet sides to the top of the cabinet must have been mis-drilled during production because there is about an 1/8 of an inch gab between the side of the cabinet and the top. Currently I am looking for s better cabinet and will just trash this one once I have replaced it.", 
    "Cabinet looks really nice in my bathroom, and seems very sturdy, I am very pleased. As other reviewers said it is packed really well and all parts are labeled with letters and numbers. The directions are easy to follow (just picture diagrams) but it is really easy to put together. I did have one bit of an error on my part. I installed the \"J\" piece that goes on the inside top back of the cabinet backwards, so that when I went to put the back of the cabinet on, the groove was on the inside, not the outside. By then it was too late to take everything apart so I just sawed off the top 1/4\" (approx) of the backing so it would fit. It was not able to be screwed onto the back, but since it was against the wall and on the very top inside it was not that noticeable. The picture directions don't show the groove and had I really contemplated the groove and looked at all the directions completely before I started, I would probably have figured out that it went on the outside, but oh well, it turned out fine! When putting the cam lock screws in, don't put them in too tight or it is difficult to get the cam lock to grab the screw head. I think I will order another one for the other bathroom!", 
    "I was very impressed with the quality of this cabinet! The description is accurate and it arrived promptly and was well-packaged against damage. I was able to assemble it in about an hour (and I was not in a rush for time, so I went slowly). It hangs securely on the wall and looks very well-made (I've placed it in a small powder room). The pieces fit nicely together and there were no chips or marks in the wood. My only complaint was that a lot of the construction involved wood dowels with enclosed glue; the glue did not seem to stick very well, and in retrospect I would have used my own personal wood glue. It is reinforced with cam locks, however, which did the job and the cabinet does not feel or look unsturdy.", 
    "Put it together using good directions. It looks quite nice, and the cubbies and mirrors really enhance my powder room. Great buy.", 
    "easy to assemble, perfect for my little bathroom, (roomy inside)", 
    "this is a great little cabinet for the bathroom. It was fairly easy to put together and when assembled is solid. The mirror had a small black spot on it so I did send one back but the exchange was quick and easy.", 
    "A very nice cabinet & good quality...", 
    "I have a mirror, needed more storage. Wasn't difficult to build. Took me two hours but i also had 4 kids around under the age of 9. Came out really pretty can wait until my husband hangs it.", 
    "This is perfect for when I have friends over. I put all my washcloths there, extra razors, toothbrush, etc. I love this in my shower.", 
    "Still in the box, ordered over a year ago, but it came with broken glass. Looking to replace the glass. It is a good looking item, but we have other priorities renovating the two stories and outside of our house.", 
    "Better to have 2 people to put it together but it came out great.", 
    "Great quality, easy to assemble and hang.", 
    "I really like this medicine cabinet! It was packed very carefully and I found it easy to put together and it was SO helpful that it came with a pre-measured paper form to mark the wall with before you hang it on the wall. It looks great on the wall of my bathroom and I'm thrilled I finally have this to put band aids, antiseptics, etc. in. I hung a white wicker towel rack under it to complete the wall. Looks great and holds plenty of stuff.", 
    "Nice cabinet that goes with any color scheme. Seems to be made well and should hold-up well to the constant opening and closing. A bit of pain to assemble.", 
    "Beautiful mirror cabinet, easy to put together except wiping the glue off the finished part of the cabinet from around every wood dowel was a little annoying...took about an hour to put together on my own. You need two people to hang it, as the screws to mount it go from inside the cabinet through pre-drilled holes into the wall. Comes with anchors and mounting screws.", 
    "I love this storage piece. No regrets buying it.", 
    "I have had this in my small powder room for a couple of years now. It is still in really good shape. Without being too big, it has a lot of storage space. I would really recommend this product.", 
    "Love it. Just the right size.", 
    "This was easy to put together and it looks OK. We bought it to use as a medicine cabinet, but the kind that aren't built into the wall just seem to cause problems. It was hard to hang about the sink because we had to leave room for the faucet, but then if it was too high, the light fixture above the sink would have been in the way. It would probably be better if it was located somewhere else in the room.", 
    "Not ideal for storage in a bathroom. Assembly was annoying", 
    "I was a lil skeptical due to some of the reviews but this came out amazing! I am not handy at all and it took me about 30-40 min to put together. You need to be careful in the first few steps so you put the pieces the right orientation but otherwise, it is very easy. It adds a ton of storage to my bathroom and the three compartments are great, i was worried they would be too narrow or shallow to be useful but they are the perfect place for soaps or candles. It looks just as expensive and quality as those other ones you can buy for $*+ more. recommend!", 
    "in small bathroom. looks good", 
    "Fairly easy to put together. Attractive and useful.", 
    "Easy to put together and just as easy to hang with the provided template. I have nothing but positive things to say about this cabinet. Well worth the money spent. In reading the negative reviews on this cabinet, I felt like they must be talking about a different cabinet because that wasn't my experience at all! Totally recommend purchasing this!", 
    "For what it is, the quality of this piece is very good. The cabinet arrived well packaged, so it survived shipping. The parts are numbered and picture-only instructions are sufficient to do a good job of assembly. Make sure you have a table or bench and the proper tools for assembling. They provide a small tube of glue for the dowel pins, if you're a 'stickler' you might want to provide your own favorite.", 
    "The middle shelf is not super solid, but it works. I've bought 2 of these, mirror makes this look a lot more expensive.", 
    "Very pleased with this medicine cabinet.", 
    "I'm very happy with the looks of this cabinet. Excellent price, nice quality. It did have some strange black specs on the glass that won't come off, a little odd. But other than that, it's great.", 
    "for my boys' bathroom. It was absolute perfection.", 
    "Arrived one week after ordering. All pieces were there and in good condition. Relatively easy to assemble but be careful to view the instructions and orient the pieces exactly as shown as you assemble them. Otherwise, you will be undoing your work and repeating steps. The finished product is attractive and well built.", 
    "This is a heavy piece of bath \"furniture\" and it is well made. I am quite happy with the way it looks and coordinates with the floor cabinet I bought to match. It was relatively easy to put together but not easy to get hung on the wall. I had to wait until I had an extra set of hands. I love the way it looks and I would recommend this to anybody considering it.", 
    "Its nice and works for what I need. It is all assembly and took me about an hour and a half to put it together. I thought because it was such a small item it would at the very least come partially assembled. So if you're not any good at assembling things do not get this item. Directions weren't all that great.", 
    "Cheaply made with particle board.", 
    "This product arrived great, but with normal use has really started to show its sub-par construction. The doors loosened and the paint has cracked after just over a year of use", 
    "This was and is an amazing cabinet. Easy to assemble, and looks perfect in my small bathroom in my bedroom. Highly recommend this.", 
    "Great price! Looks great!", 
    "yes it worked at the time in our bathroom size was small & price was reasonable", 
    "This was easy to put together and is nice accent above toilet. Shelve is adjustable. Mirror helps to add depth to room.", 
    "Cabinet is just what we needed. Looks attractive. I like the open compartments on the bottom. Is easy to put together. Is built well enough. White paint finish is a little thin. Chips fairly easily. Overall, I would purchase again. Good value.", 
    "I love this little cabinet for my bathroom. I have looked at several other stores & online for a similar cabinet, and am so happy I got this one. It's sturdy and well-constructed. I was able to assemble this cabinet by myself in about 20 minutes. I would recommend not attaching the door until after you hang it on the wall because it adds to the weight and gets in the way. Hanging the cabinet is definitely a two-person job because of how heavy the cabinet is. If you're looking for a cute, small cabinet for your bathroom, I'd definitely recommend this one!", 
    "For the money, this is a nice sturdy cabinet and looks great! Very easy to assemble & hang. The mirrored part arrived with a small defect in the mirror and overstock was awesome with their customer service communication. They sent me a new part to replace the defected one. Very happy with this purchase and overstock!!", 
    "Bought this for over the sink in a guest bath. It is good, looks nice but the quality could have been a little better.", 
    "I live in a very nice apt. with very limited spaace.I bought this a spice rack. It looks great AND one would not know it is a medicine cabinet.", 
    "The design is unique and does the job decorating the empty space in my bath. Only issue for which it lost a star is it comes in pieces and you need to set it up which my 14 year old enjoyed putting together but a waste of time if you have to do it your self.", 
    "Love this cabinet. looks perfect in my bathroom", 
    "I already had this is my master bathroom and was pleased with it so I bought another one for the guest bathroom. The shelves are adjustable. The bottom cubbies I use to displace perfume or a jewelry dish and keep the rest hidden in the cabinet part. We don't own a drill and I was nervous to hang it with nails in the drywall but so far we're good.", 
    "Looks nice but is made of bad quality wood.", 
    "Bought this for my daughter and son in law. They remodled a bathroom using this cabinet.", 
    "Door had to be replaced due to manufacturing defect that should have been found during manufacture. Overall meets our needs.", 
    "very easy to assemble. well made product", 
    "I am by no means a handy person; my husband usually does all the product assembly at our house. However, I decided to give this a try--and I was successful at assembling it with no problems. The directions are in diagram form and were easy to follow. Once assembled, the product is sturdy and sits well on two screws that are anchored in the wall. The parts were all well labeled, and even included an extra packet of spare parts.The only issue I ran into was that the mirror (pre-mounted in the cabinet door) arrived broken. I contacted Overstock customer service and was offered a part replacement or a full refund. I chose the part replacement. I have not received the part yet but was assured by customer service that a new cabinet door would be shipped to me to replace the old one.Very happy with the product and with the customer service from Overstock.", 
    "I like these so much, I keep looking for other places in the house to stash them. They are handsome and sturdy and price can't be beat.", 
    "Low profile, but decent storage. Only complaint is of the bars covering the mirror. Wish the front was an open mirror.", 
    "this cabinet was perfect sturdy and looks great", 
    "I purchased this for my work bathroom so didn't want to spend too much. It is very flimsy and poorly constructed. You get what you pay for - I wouldn't purchase again.", 
    "Nice upgrade to well organized bathroom great deal of storage.", 
    "This has been very helpful in our guest bathroom downstairs.", 
    "This product comes with all the parts unattached. You need a screwdriver. It went up, very sturdy, cute for my 11 year old daughters small bathroom. The shelves are adjustable so that's nice! Great product!", 
    "Sits right on my bathroom counter..awesome", 
    "The door started sagging almost right away, but we have been able to tighten it up. It was easy to put together & hang, and it looks good especially for the price.", 
    "kept item but not happy with it. It was not as expected.", 
    "I bought two of these for a rental property I have. They were easy enough to put together and look nice. My only problem is I couldn't get the doors to hang perfectly straight.", 
    "I really like this cabinet too. brightens up the place. It is very sturdy andReliable.", 
    "This product was awful. Poor poor quality.", 
    "We had a limited space for a cabinet and this one fit the biill perfectly. I really liked that all of the pieces of both the cabinet and the card that housed all the screws, pegs and misc. pieces were all clearly labeled as well making assembly pretty straightforward. Seems to be sturdier than most MDF products I've purchased. Looks very attractive.", 
    "It was exactly as pictured , it looks great in my bathroom. Good quality.", 
    "I had been looking for an attractive, reasonably priced medicine cabinet for quite some time. Overstock always came up with the best selections and price ranges, and this was reasonable. The delivery on this cabinet was timely and I was able to track delivery time. The installation instructions were straight forward and with very little problem, I assembled the cabinet. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because the front door with the glass (which is very attractive) is heavy and it doesn't line up perfectly. I will go back and work on this but I'm afraid its the way it was pre assembled. It does look very nice and is a great addition to our room. I would recommend this cabinet and hopefully this will not be an issue with someone else.", 
    "A nice, basic vanity bought for our extra bathroom in basement. It is OK quality. Be mindful, when hanging it, the bottom \"3-cubby shelf\" is exposed, so not covered by the mirror- so you might have to hang it a bit lower than expected. All-in-all, I recommend.", 
    "The cabinet is easy to put together. It just takes a little time. This is a beautiful addition to my bathroom. You can't beat the price!", 
    "There were a few scuffs when I received the product and a little crack in the front that is hardly noticeable, but all in all it is a very nice piece for the bathroom and stores a lot. The mirror is a nice touch.", 
    "I had a specific size wall to fill with a storage cabinet. This item was the measurements that I needed. The product has done a nice job so far. While you are building it, it seems a little unstable, but once all the parts are together it tightens up a lot. I imagine most pieces in the price range are similar.", 
    "I'd forgotten that I'd purchased the medicine cabinet from Overstock. Yes, it's a very nice cabinet, good nooks and shelves for b/room stuff.", 
    "The medicine cabinet arrived, packaged very well, all parts numbered and secured. I really like the design of this cabinet and it was fairly easy to put together. My overall complaint is that when putting together the wood already started splintering, making me question the quality of this item.", 
    "Looks good and well made, but a little smaller than I thought it would be, even though the demensions were given, as I looked at so many different cabnets from different suppliers, I confused myself on the size. Use it daily, and happy with it.", 
    "This small medicine cabinet was a real pain to assemble for my husband. Didn't line up properly and took a whole evening to put together. It turned out cute, but small. Not really worth the hassle though.", 
    "The only disappointment was the seam in the piece that serves as the back cover, but this is a nitpicky detail because it is either concealed by the mirrored door or (in the case of the cubby) will be covered up by some little knick-knack.", 
    "cabinet was strong, pretty, and price was better than anywhere else I had looked. Very pleased over all.", 
    "PURCHASED 3 FOR A RENTAL PROPERTIESVERY STURDY CONSTRUCTION", 
    "Pretty little cabinet. Not difficult to assemble. The mirror adds a bit of flash to the bathroom. Holds alot of materials and has adjustable shelves, which I appreciated.", 
    "When I opened the box, I discovered that the door was missing. Also, the cam screw holes on the top piece were so large that it was impossible to install the piece. Customer service was extremely helpful and got the correct pieces to me right away. Once I had the replacement parts, I was able to put the cabinet together. It was easy to put together.", 
    "It was a little hard to assemble, but accomplished it.", 
    "This was easy to put together, instructions were good, I used wood glue to ensure stability and will hang on the wall. Is perfect for what I was looking for. The only complaint I have is the door is crooked and due to the predrilled holes there is no way to correct but it is not that bad so as to send it back. Overall it is a nice looking cabinet and seems to be farily sturdy, and the price was perfect for the quality.", 
    "Searching for a vintage style cabinet, not much variety at the big home hardware stores.. Finally found this exact cabinet for $48 more at the store! I instantly ordered the cabinet from Overstock. Arrived very quicly. good quality, no shipping cost. came to my door and I'm really pleased. Old timey stylish chic.", 
    "I am using it; but, the quality just isn't there. Cheaply made.", 
    "I received it with the mirror shaddered. Thought it would be easier to replace the mirror than spend the time and money to send back...bad idea...just don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then the window 'arms' started separating...bad purchase", 
    "It came damaged with a chip in the corner. Even though that alone was enough to return it, which is taking forever & I'm still undergoing the process by the way, I noticed that it was very cheaply made overall. The striped criss-cross fake wood that was on the front door didn't even match up right and there were noticeable gaps!! Definitely would not recommend!!", 
    "I saw this same cabinet in target and several other online sites and everyone had a slightly higher price. I purchased it here at Overstock, it arrived quickly and was very easy to assemble. This piece was exactly what I was looking for and it is perfect for my small bathroom! happy with my purchase.", 
    "I was initially intimidated by putting something together. Only took 30 minutes to assemble! Great medicine cabinet. Definitely worth the $.", 
    "I bought this cabinet because I liked the style and the price was reasonable. All the holes matched up putting it together, but once put together the door hangs crooked and when it was hung on the wall, the plastic anchors that went into the wall broke. My friend replaced the anchors with metal molly bolts which fixed the problem. I would recommend this to a friend only if they were able to fix minor craftsmanship errors themselves.", 
    "needed additional reinforcement with wood glue, but an OK value for the money", 
    "We are renovating a \"camp\" and want to go with a cottage style, these are perfect. They look great and were easy for my husband to put together. If there was a shortcoming it is that there was only one shelf inside. Good value for the price.", 
    "I returned this product without opening the box and never received a refund. Although Overstock does not charge for shipping, they offered a \"hassle free\" return for *** for a *** cabinet. I will not use Overstock again.", 
    "I have had great luck with everything else I've ever ordered from Overstock, but this cabinet was a PITA. I was not expecting it to come needing A LOT of assembly, and so it sat in the box for a couple of weeks waiting for me or my husband to have time to deal with it. There were many pieces and it took my husband - normally a pretty talented DIYer - an hour and a half to assemble it. The finished piece is acceptable, but some of the dividers on the mirror have slightly frayed edges that make it look cheap. Also, you cannot close the cabinet door completely when there are rolls of toilet paper inside it. Since this was one of our intended purposes when purchasing the cabinet, it was disappointing.", 
    "It is oak . small bathroom is oak . put way some stop .", 
    "All together finish was very nice & a sturdy cabinet when assembled.", 
    "Some difficulty with assembly. Gluing in the sides helped. I was pleased with the look and quality of the product. Just what I was looking for.", 
    "Just as ordered, fast shipping, very pleased. xxxxxxxxx", 
    "This fits perfect for our spare bathroom, very nice. Price is EXCELLENT", 
    "Made in China. I was hoping for Made in USA. The description says \"assembled.\" It is NOT. You must assemble it. Just pictures - no words. You can follow and figure it out. I did. No where did the instructions say to use wood glue. Now that it is assembled, I do wish I had glued the bottom to the rest of it. I am concerned it might someday \"unlock\" and fall apart. I guess I will reassemble it then and use glue. (Not included, by the way). I put it together myself but it would be easier with 4 hands. I used blue painters tape to hold the pieces together as I assembled it.", 
    "Well made and decorative cabinet,good size for a small wall.", 
    "The instructions weren't the best, but the product itself is great. Exactly as described & looks great!", 
    "This product arrived in good condition and was easy to assemble. It is quite nice and is functioning as I desired. I also purchased two of the towers and they stand together in my bath, looking good and fitting in the small space easily.", 
    "The quality could be better. I was a bit disappointed in the finished product. It's a bit flimsy and the door doesn't line up evenly. It was fairly easy to put together", 
    "love this cabinet...bought it about a year ago. Only thing is now after some time, the water that has dripped on the smaller shelves on the bottom row from hands being wet and getting things from those cubbies or slots...the 'wood' is warped and paint is flaking off. However, I guess for the price and nice looklng cabinet it's worth it and fixable?", 
    "For the price of this cabinet it looks very elegant and very easy to put together. I would really recommend this cabinet if you are looking to put in a small space. Now my bathroom looks very organized.", 
    "I ordered this for my rental property, but was so impressed I almost ordered another to keep on hand. I tried buying at Lowe's and Home Depot, but Overstock was the only one that carried what I desired. y renter is well pleased with the product. When shopping in the future I intend to check out Overstock before checking other stores.", 
    "This was easy to mount and install, template included. Thank you!", 
    "poor quality, the wooden slats of the grid were not anchored in the holes, so the grid was slanted. Am returning it.", 
    "It arrived in good condition. The piece that held the 2 back panels together was missing. I put it together without it. It took very little time to put together. Instructions were good even without words. It is a fairly sturdy piece. I would not recommend it for a primary bathroom, or in a space where it would get constant use. I purchased it for a small secondary bathroom and it looks nice and will fill the need for some storage and a mirror over the sink.", 
    "It took about 30 min to put together, and one piece (a connector) was missing. Most of it is synthetic, not real wood. But nice looking. Good for the price.", 
    "Easy to assemble and beautiful quality, I am going to try and order another one if it is still available! I found this at other home repair stores for up to *** So what a great deal!", 
    "This is in my bathroom, along with the matching towel tower. I also bought the matching floor cabinet, used the doors and some of the trim to replace the face and the doors on an existing vanity so it is now a 3-oiece set. Not a job for everyone, but if you are handy and are good at math, it can be done!", 
    "Good product for the price, glad they included the wood glue.", 
    "While it took a long time to assemble the unit, it was worthwhile. It looks beautiful and it is so useful. Glad we made the purchase. Thinking about getting another for a guest bathroom. Great price.", 
    "Fairly easy to assemble once you figure the circular screw connectors you simply insert over head of screw and turn gently. The door fit well and very pleased with the look in our farm house setting. Accents pedestal sink very well.", 
    "Super cute cabinet! Lots of pieces to put together but it's not difficult. I'm very happy with it. It was less expensive than similar products in the home improvement stores. I really like the styling.", 
    "Just needed a small wall mount cabinet for the spare bathroom. This was just the right size and was easy to assemble.", 
    "I love this cabinet!! Worked out great in our small bathroom. We just sold our house and am sad we are leaving it behind. I hope I can get another for the new home.", 
    "Other than a few chipped places or unfinished(mostly where you wont see when it's on the wall and nothing you cant get a little paint on if it bothers you) it was very well put together and designed. Looks great and holds a lot of stuff. I love that the shelves are adjustable to how I want them and they give you options. Very nice. Had a little trouble figuring how to put it together, but only a little and it got done. So it's not hard to put together if you know how to use a screw driver and can follow pictures.", 
    "I purchased this for our master bathroom, which could contend for world's smallest. This medicine cabinet has been extremely helpful- I now have a place to store all the little items right where I need them to be. I had no issues assembling this product- be sure you read through the directions thoroughly before assembling, and you can do it with no difficulty. An extra pair of hands can be helpful when putting screws to the hinges of the door- the door's quite heavy. I don't include this in my list of issues, though- I like that the door holds firmly when shut (with the magnet and substantive door) and doesn't fly out and smack the shower surround when opened. The only caution I give you is to create your own template when installing. I made mine with butcher paper, and just traced the back and the hanging apparatus and then applied it to the wall. I also put flat L-brackets on the bottom of the medicine cabinet for extra support, but this was only because we discovered a disturbing lack of studs in the wall on which this was hung. But for this I blame the previous owners, not the medicine cabinet!", 
    "Easy to assemble, my boyfriend usually does all the assembly, but I was able to do it myself no problem. I just wish the backing was one piece; the picture does not show the sleeve that connects them, it appears as one piece. I do like how it looks in my downstairs bathroom that HAD no medicine cabinet.", 
    "great product if I ever needed another cabinet I would chose this one.", 
    "This is a good quality cabinet for the money that had excellent assembly instructions.", 
    "Beautiful just what I wanted Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah", 
    "One day after hanging one cabinet on 1/2\" sheetrock with the plastic mount pieces supplied I removed the cabinet to check on the wall and discovered the hole was already elongating as a result of its own weight on the poor mounts. I will now drill my own holes through the top-back piece and mount the cabinet with 3 each 3/8\" molly bolts per cabinet.", 
    "I purchased 2 of these as part of a bathroom remodel for my two girls. The depth makes them stick out a little more than I imagined, but overall am happy with the product for the price. Easy to assemble, nice quality. Only thing I observed after assembling is that the cross beams in the mirror might make cleaning the mirror a bit of a pain. Otherwise, looks and functions well.", 
    "This cabinet is classy and very well-made. I bought this cabinet, a matching floor cabinet, and matching mirror for a small bathroom. All products were very well made and very good buys for the money.", 
    "Nice medicine cabinet for the price. No problem putting it together. Only complaint is the seam for the back is obvious in the middle cubby. It is covered by whatever you put in the cubby but I was surprised the seam would show.", 
    "Although i was not expecting to have to completely assemble, it was not too difficult. Only picture illustrations for instructions, no wording. After the assembly i was quite surprised at the outcome, and happy with the product.", 
    "This medicine cabinet worked perfectly in our small basement bathroom. It has plenty of room amd went together easily. The quality was very good and the price was excellent.", 
    "I ordered this to go into my bathroom--which has green/white tiling and looks like it belongs in the 1930s. This was a great accent for the bath, adding storage while maintaining character. I bought it with a matching linen tower and they are great together. My only issue was the off-gassing when we first unwrapped it. That can't be good.", 
    "Nice product. It is great to have the open cubbies and then also the inside shelf. One corner had to be repaired when we got it. But, we were able to fix it up. It works great over a 24\" vanity. And, since we wanted storage and a mirror this product will do fine.", 
    "This is a solid bathroom cabinet, looks and feels high quality, I really love it. It was really easy to put together, only took about 15 minutes. BUY IT.", 
    "I really like this cabinet. Easy assembly and plenty of space inside. Very appealing in my new bathroom.", 
    "I like the unit, it is well put together and looks good. I was disappointed 75% of the way into the the process of assembly to discover that the door was nicked. After all that work I did not want to send it back but I am sure I will see that every time I look at it.", 
    "I bought the striped cabinet and then decided we needed something above it. I chose this medicine cabinet because I wanted a piece with a mirror and also a place to store makeup/ It holds everything I need and looks great as a unit with the matching base cabinet. It fits so well in a small bathroom... doesn't look too big for the room, but is substantial enough to make a statement. The parts all fit together so well that people don't realize I had to put it together myself.", 
    "Easy to put together,Looks great. I put shells in the cubbys.", 
    "The cabiinet was great. It looked even better than the picture. It was easy to assemble and is very sturdy. We are very pleased with the product.", 
    "I received this product thinking that it would be fully assembled but of course it was not. My big problem however was that I did not receive assembly instructions. Luckily for me, my roommate, being male, was able to help me assemble it but only by printing out the picture and finding instructions online. I am pretty upset that this product didn't at least come with instructions. Was my delivery just defective? Why didn't I receive instructions?!?", 
    "I was pleased with this purchase, primarily because it was for a very small bathroom with very little space. They are nice for the price.", 
    "So, being that I didn't read the reviews before I received the product, I was assuming they would come fully assembled..however, this was a project. Everything came well packed/protected, and suprisingly all parts were included. It wasn't difficult just tedious. As long as you lay all the parts out in order before you get started, and follow along with the pictures, it went just fine, and looked great when I was done. Don't forget to use the glue!", 
    "The cabinet is a nice quality. I was thankful my husband put it together - the assembly did not look too easy. My only real complaint is the glue that's used doesn't dry clear so it shows in a couple of seams. For the price, I think it's a really nice piece.", 
    "very nice looking cabinet, took me just an hour to put together, very easy to follow instructions.be careful when putting the glue in the holes, wipe away any residual right away as it is hard to clean up once it dries. put it together on a rug as it seems to scuff pretty easily.looks very nice in my small bathroom", 
    "This cabinet is very well engineered, and made of good materials. The finish is especially smooth. Lots of parts to assemble, but it is well engineered, and everything fit perfectly. It is a bit heavy, so make sure you attach it to your wall very securely.", 
    "My husband and I ordered this cabinet for our small bathroom. I was afraid it was going to look too big in it, but it looks great! It was so easy to put together. All the pieces came in tact. It looks great and exactly like it is shown in the picture!", 
    "Wow, this cabinet arrived in three days, heavily protected with no defects. Easy to assemble with ample storage and really nice looking. It does seem heavier than I thought it would be and although I haven't hung it yet using the items enclosed in the box, I may reinforce it considering the weight of it and items that will store in it. Other than that, I couldn't be more pleased.", 
    "Not \"SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED\", TOTAL assembly required! If my parspousner weren't a crafty guy with tools'a'plenty, this would still be in boxes on the floor (it was far too heavy for me to return).", 
    "After assembling them - which was easy. The doors would not close - they were VERY tight and had to be forced closed - ended up selling them in a garage sale due to the cost of returning. Would not reccomend", 
    "Very disappointed with quality,cheap material.It is not worth the trouble returning it.worst **dollars i have ever spent.Wasted my money and time putting it together.", 
    "not of very good quality. must be put completely together. wood pins don't fit tight. door doesn't fit well."
