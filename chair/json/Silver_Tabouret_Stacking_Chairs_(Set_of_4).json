    "Purchased four of these chairs because my small children had virtually destroyed our wooden chairs. I had previously purchased the counter height stools & been very pleased. We have been using the chairs about 2 weeks. They arrived no problem, no scratches or dents (despite a huge rip in the box). I pulled them out of the box ready to use. The kids have managed to tip; them with effort, & my smallest (3) has managed to fall out the side (on purpose) but overall these have been a great choice for us. The bases work well on our hardwood floors & they wipe down great (the seam at the back can get crumbs, but hasn't been difficult to clean). Decor wise, we paired them with an older wooden table & brushed nickel lighting. They definitely have a modern cafe type feel, & make the room feel more open.... Another poster mentioned they don't slide up under the table which I was concerned about, but I found they don't take up much more room than my previous chairs. Regarding fitting.... I have had a pretty heavy set guest use them for one meal, & I noticed she just sat forward in her chair with no problems.", 
    "It's difficult to give a starred review on this one. Loved the chairs themselves. Great look and high quality. Minor blemishes occurred in shipping, however, which was a bit disappointing. HOWEVER, Overstock was simply wonderful about the return. One caveat to the chairs, though. If your behind (or your expected guests' behinds) are any wider than a ladies' size 12....beware. Because of the arms, the width of the seat is limited.", 
    "I have been looking for chairs like this for a year! They are so similar to other French cafe chairs, who will remain nameless, but for a fraction of the price! Just 1 of the other chairs would have cost about as much as 8 of these!!! I am still in shock at the value of these! I plan to use them outside, so will most likely have to spray them with some kind of protective coat, as they say for indoor use only, but they look very well made and so sturdy, I do not anticipate any problems. They do not however look like galvanized metal, so if you are looking for a more rustic look, this may not be what you are looking for. I have them around a huge farmhouse outdoor table though and they look perfect!", 
    "We purchased the chairs for our conference room at the office to match the whole metal/wood vibe we are doing. The chairs look great, but aren't comfortable. I bought seat cushions at Target so the staff will sit in them. Also, I am a petite female and fit the chairs fine, but the chairs are too small for our over 6 ft male staff.", 
    "Overall, some great chairs. They feel like they're sturdy and made well - not just some flimsy metal chairs. The finish is a little bit more of a dull grey - so it's not a bright-ish silver, if that's what you're looking for. They're simple though, and pretty cool looking. First weekend we had them, we had a BBQ and got a lot of compliments on them. We're also using them for outdoor seating, and haven't had an issue with it. Who knows though, maybe after a few months the paint will start to come off since it says they're for indoor use only... so far so good though. And hey - 4 cool looking, sturdy chairs for this price? Was worth it in my opinion. Overall, we like them so far.", 
    "Our experience was consistent with other reviews. Chairs were impressively packed for shipment and arrived in perfect condition. They look great in our eclectic kitchen, blending well with stainless appliances, modern white cabinetry and butcher block farmhouse style table. Their small scale is a plus for us, as it's often hard to find dining chairs that are comfortable for relatively small/short people.", 
    "It took me a long time to order these but I am so glad I did. I paired them with a farm house style table and linen head chairs. a very cool farmhouse shabby chic look... so thrilled with the way it came out. these are NOT distressed the way some other stores sell them - they are a true metal/grey finish. if you are going them with linen chairs the nail heads should be silver in color as well. the price cannot be beat and i am so pleased with the entire look. if you are going for the industrial farmhouse look- these are the way to go. Also, my boyfriend was worried they would be \"cold\" to sit on- but they are not at all. they're quite spacious and comfy. I do not recommend a seat cover actually as I like the style as is.", 
    "2 sets of friends have seen our new chairs and are going to purchase them now! They are that great! One came slightly damaged and Overstock has blown me away with their resolution process. I am crazy about this purchase and buying bar stools to match. Fabulous! Thank you!", 
    "The main picture for this does not depict how bland these chairs look. Basically they look like the 2nd picture without the texture. These chairs look awful. The silver is painted on. 2 things that happened with these chairs. 1 chair was already chipped exposing the original metal (not sure what type of metal it is). Another chair's back is starting to split apart. Not sure what I'm going to do with these. I might need to spray paint them so they look a bit textured or something.", 
    "These are great chairs! I have seen similar chairs all across the web and until now they have seemed unaffordable at $225+ per chair, but as always Overstock has the best price. My only disappointment is they are done with a glossy finish so they are not that more rustic feel I would prefer of galvanized metal but none the less they are still great! I plan on pairing mine with a table built from salvage barnwood.", 
    "I've had these chairs for about a year and a half. Bottom line, they are sturdy and look amazing. My kids complain sometimes that the chairs are cold on their legs when wearing shorts, but I prefer a little whine from them rather than a beat of looking chair from food stains or being handled by little ones. I've never had an issue with someone not fitting in the chair.... we've had grown men who aren't string beans sit in it just fine, my husband and I are average height and weight and the chairs feel fine.", 
    "Very good price for dining chairs. They are sized a bit small. They do not fit under our table and I feel that they are a bit short looking. We ordered around Christmas time and one came damaged. Overstock was great in replacing the dented chair.", 
    "Happy with the product. Packaged well and arrived quickly. The price is great! The finish is not as great as comparable chairs, but they still look nice.", 
    "These chairs are exactly as depicted online. They are attractive, sturdy and comfortable. They are perfect for me as I have a problem with my balance and these are heavy enough to NOT slide away from me as I go to sit down or get up.I replaced chairs that were on rollers and therefore presented a safety issue for me. These Tabouret chairs have no such safety issue.", 
    "These chairs have a great style, I just wish they were a little taller. I don't think the chairs are uncomfortable like some of the other reviews. They look great and are very strudy! If they were a little taller, I would use them as my dining room chairs. I've seen these style chairs at a much higher price at other stores.", 
    "I bought these chairs for our kitchen dining room. I like the chairs. They are more sturdy than I anticipated for the material that they are built from. I liked the cafe style which will go well the overall rustic, industrial design we are going for. My son loves to sit in these chairs.", 
    "Can't really complain considering the price -the chairs look great with our butcher block table and offer an industrial look. They look sort of too \"new\" but hopefully we can bang them up over time!", 
    "I have five grandchildren under age ten. These chairs work great with them because of the easy clean up. They look very stylish in my kitchen and also match my other stainless steel appliances. I think I made a smart investment I also like that there was no assembly required . And the price was great.", 
    "Wow. Just, wow. Like all of the other reviewers, I have been shopping for this silhouette for well over a year. My desired chair was the same price. For one chair. I settled on this, after saving up Overstock gift cards, and it completely blew my expectations out of the water. The quality will definitely weather my 2 year old. I had concerns about the size, but they more than accommodate myself, my husband, and any guests that we have entertained. I did not have any issues with wobbly legs at all. I have it paired with an espresso round table from West Elm, and it is the PERFECT modern/farmhouse accent. I could not be happier!! Oh, and they arrived within 2 business days of ordering, and the packing definitely protected the shipment in transit.", 
    "Other than the one dented chair they were exactly as stated online. When I contacted Overstock about the one damaged chair they were very polite and helpful and explained that they would be sending a replacement chair. It arrived within a few days of that conversations.", 
    "I purchased these chairs as contrast pieces to a round reclaimed wood table. I was a bit hesitant to buy these based on some of the other reviews about the finish, but in fact, this doesn't bother me at all. Unfortunately, however, I was quite surprised by the height of these chairs. Up against the table, they look tiny. The seat height would have been fine for eating at the table, but the backs of these chairs barely peered over the top of the table. They looked like children's furniture. In fact, from the next room, you could not see them at all. They were also incredibly uncomfortable. The top of the chair hits my back at a weird spot, which means there's almost no way to find a comfortable position, and my butt ends up numb in about 10 minutes. I decided to keep them since I knew the return shipping would be quite expensive. I currently have them on our covered porch but will definitely need to invest in some cushions to make them work.", 
    "Purchased these for farmhouse kitchen table. Looks great. Perfect for kids. The color is more gun metal, not a shunt chrome. I was looking for shiny, I may add metallic paint. Otherwise I am satisfied.", 
    "This chairs look good, but they are NOT comfortable. My husband looked like a very large person sitting in a very small chair. The sides dig into your hips and they are extremely upright. We sent them back. I think they would be fine as extra seating to have in case of emergency. They stack nicely and serve their purpose.", 
    "After searching many different places for these types of chairs such as Restoration Hardware, Crate and Barrel, Old World Market, Industry West and so on, these were the best bang for the buck. I bought 4 to go around our Saarinen Tulip Table. They look great and the thing I like mostly is that the legs do not touch each other when they are all pushed in so there is no clanking sound when you walk by them. A great deal, believe me, I have been searching for a long time! The next best deal would be the ones at Restoration Hardware.", 
    "I ordered these in white and grey. They came packed well so that there was no damage. They are built well and very soild. I've had them now for a few months, and there have been no problems. The paint on the legs has chipped here and there (probably from stacking), and it seems the paint on the white ones is holding up better than the silver (less chipping). Only a few people have complained that they're a bit uncomfortable when sat in for a long time, but these people probably spend most of their time on a sofa, if you get my drift. These chairs are sturdy and have a nice, simple, attractive design. If you don't mind the finish fading a bit, they make great exterior chairs, as well. Definitely recommended for a cheap set of chairs.", 
    "Love these chairs, they are going to go perfectly with our industrial style table. THey are bright and shiny, I may actually take a rag with black paint to them to make them appear to be vintage. Great style, and half the price of other sites!", 
    "I've seen similar chairs on other more \"high-end\" or well-known sites I live in SF and also noticed that many high-end restaurants actually carry these chairs - indicating that they are probably the best bang for your buck! LOVE THESE!", 
    "I bought 2 sets of the chairs and out of the 8 chairs, 2 of the them make this funny popping sound when you sit down. The metal seat kind of concaves and then pops back up when you sit forward or stand up. I tried to get replacements but they are currently sold out. However Overstock offered me a discounted price to keep the chairs, and I felt that was fair. Their customer services is EXCELLENT other than that I really like them. They look great and will probably go with many different style tables. If you are looking for an inexpensive attractive modern chair...these are the ticket!", 
    "I ordered 4 for my kitchen table, which has a silver frame and silver glass top. The chairs are exactly as described and as you see in the photo.They're comfortable to seat in, although the back rest is a little short and doesn't support your full back. They're also a little narrow, but a big person would fit in them too (my friends proved it).", 
    "I've been looking for some modern-ish chairs to pair with my dark wood parsons table, and these are great! My only tiny complaint is that they don't slide all the way under the table, so I have to make sure no one rams the arms into the table. I looked high and low for chairs to handle my 240lb hubby, and these have been sturdy and comfortable. He loves them too! Amazing price per chair for such a high quality product.", 
    "I bought these after looking at many uninspiring furnishings elsewhere. These are almost exact replications of the more pricey designer version, which I would have purchased had my finances allowed. Very satisfied with the product, Overstock and the packaging of four chairs shipped (UPS).", 
    "very good accessory to our breakfast dining set. can be flexible for other uses, eg: in library or extra seating. product is cheap and nice looking, came in good shape and condition, no scratches, dents or issues. delivery was very quick. downside is, its metal and can get easily cold in winter. however, can be easily remedied by chair cushions.", 
    "Bought for a sort of transitional set of chairs for my daughter. Figured they were versatile seating. Great price. Need cushions, 14\". Most cushions don't give measurements tho. Still I think will make a great splash at newly painted old teak table to help the house present for selling:)", 
    "I think someone else mentioned that the silver of thee chairs is more like silver paint and not like metal -- I didn't realize quite how true this was and wish I had splurged and bought the red version (I think they would have been much better) The chairs are ok, I like that they stack and that they are light weight (this might be good for some and not so much for others but as extra chairs that sometimes get put in the basement it works for me)", 
    "Love these chairs! They look very much like chairs from other retailers that cost $200 apiece, and give me the exact look I wanted for a fraction of the cost. Yes, they're rather small chairs....but I am an amply-sized woman and I fit in the chairs just fine. In fact, a very big and tall friend of mine tested them out for me, and he thought they were fine too. They're light enough to be moved with one hand, which makes it easy to clean around them, and they look great! I couldn't be more pleased. One of my chairs arrived damaged, and Overstock simply replaced it, no questions asked. Quality product, great price, outstanding customer service; I have nothing but good things to say about it!", 
    "Really good buy...as others have mentioned, these are even better in person than the description suggests. They are sturdy, modern, and comfortable. I have been trying to find chairs for a long time and have sat in a bunch from Ikea to West Elm - these are the most comfortable for the best price. Now my mom wants to buy a set for herself!", 
    "As most of the previous reviewers have mentioned, I too was looking for an affordable version of these unique chairs. And although i agree that a rustic metal feel would make it perfect, the silver coating looks very nice and makes it easy to clean! I love the informal look it gives to our dining area and many guests have not only complemented us on the chairs but also mentioned they contribute to a friendly and inviting atmosphere! I was really glad to stumble on them on yet another Sunday morning scavanger hunt online for my beloved metal chairs!", 
    "My order arrived very quickly. Ordered chairs on a Friday and received them on Tuesday. Chairs were packed very well. Surprised at how light-weight the chairs are. Also, the chairs are very narrow! Anyone over size 12 won't fit comfortably sitting all the way back in the chair. But for the price and looks, they will do!", 
    "I ordered these chairs for my kitchen dining table. They replaced cloth covered ones that were disgusting - I have a four year old who cannot eat a blueberry, strawberry or spaghetti without dropping some on himself and his chair first. I also have a 15 month old who is following in her brother's footsteps. SO... these chairs are perfect. I can wipe them off, heck, I could take them outside and hose them off. Perfect! Plus, my daughter's booster seat fits on well and is strapped around the back and seat. great chairs!", 
    "I love theses chairs!! I was looking for metal chairs for our lake house, and saw these and fell in love. The finish is a little fake looking, but still very nice. I ended up buying the barstools to match. I buy several things from overstock.com and have been very pleased.", 
    "The chairs are comfortable, seem VERY durable and sturdy and look great too! One chair arrived with a small dent, but I don't notice it so I will not be bothering with a return. The chairs come with rubber sliders on the feet so I no longer have to worry about scratches on my hardwood floors when guests slide in and out from the table. Overall I love my new chairs and the price was pretty good too!", 
    "Nice chairs ..worth the price..sturdy and well made like other reviewers commented. fast shipping too!! Great!!", 
    "I had been looking for modern chairs for my dining room. These are sturdy and well made. You can't beat the price either!!! We are happy with this purchase; thanks Overstock:)", 
    "I love the dinning room chairs, they match the stools that I bought first. They are well made and fit very nicely in my home. The price was great. thank you!", 
    "I love these chairs and the modern look they add to my dining room. They stand up to a lot of abuse from my kids and wipe clean easily. My only complaint is that crumbs get down between the seat and back rest because there is a gap there. That can make it a pain to clean with little kids. Despite that one small flaw, I highly recommend these chairs!", 
    "These work great in my industrialized dining room", 
    "Can't go wrong with these chairs. They can go with any style of table...very versatile.", 
    "These are wonderful well made chairs!", 
    "I have had these chairs for a couple of years and they have proven to be durable, sturdy, and kid - proof. They stack easily and have a tip - proof base. The do not scratch my hardwood floors when moved. Aesthetically, I wish they had some color variation within each chair (perhaps a darker look at the welded joints). All in all, these have been one of my best buys from Overstock.", 
    "Even, nice color. LOVE THEM!", 
    "These are great chairs. Great for a house with kids. The rubber feet are great.", 
    "Love these chairs! They shipped out quickly, came in a big box, no assembly, no damage, and work perfectly.", 
    "Loved the cafe/industrial look of the chairs. Great it you have pets and or small children. Clean up is easy. If the seat bottoms were concave instead of flat, it would provide a more comfortable fit.", 
    "I didn't notice that the back of one was bent until well after I had them unpacked and in the dining room. I still love them and I think I can probably have the one unbent by someone stronger than myself. Check closely when unpacking.", 
    "Perfect for our new kitchen remodel. Love them!", 
    "Bright shiny silver. Sturdy, well made. Feet are protected so it won't scratch my wood floors.", 
    "We use these in the kitchen with the Tabouret dining table. Perfect for a small space and easy to clean.", 
    "We ordered these to go with our farm table. They come fast and are fully assembled. They are slightly smaller chairs and are obviously hard (as they are metal. I'm 5'10, size 12 and I fit in them just fine. Do you want to sit in them for hours? Probably not. However, they look amazing and definitely do the job. You can't beat the price and they are insanely durable.", 
    "These chairs are just what I was looking for at a good price.", 
    "I love these chairs because they look so fantastic in my condo...I also liked the price.", 
    "I use these as outdoor chairs. They look great and were just what I wanted.", 
    "Great chairs! Look awesome with our distressed table and I love that they stack!", 
    "I have had these chairs for a couple years couldn't be happier. They are very sturdy and I havent had 1 problem with them!", 
    "Chairs are comfortable and easy to clean, durable with kids", 
    "I bought these and liked them so much I bought another set...", 
    "These seem like good quality chairs. They are pretty comfy as well!", 
    "Bought as extras for dinner! Realized in the meantime the kids can use them in their rooms, outside as extra seating, etc. they don't look cheap and I wanted the industrial look for my extras", 
    "Got these for outdoor entertaining. They stack four high. Everyone who has tried them thinks they are comfortable.", 
    "These are painted and look more like patio chairs than interior seating. I was going for an industrial look, but these just look inexpensive.", 
    "I bought this for my apartment & I love it. It matches well with any color, it was more on the grey side but looks great with my chocolate brown couch. It is very well made.", 
    "These chairs are great. They sit very well. Very sturdy.", 
    "Nice chairs. Very sturdy and midern", 
    "These chairs are perfect for small spaces! They stack together when you need more space. They style and price are perfect!", 
    "Nice and versatile. Good quality", 
    "this was a great purchase. awesome price. great quality. I had seen these chairs listed other places for a whole lot more than I paid with Overstock. these chairs are durable and attractive.", 
    "These are sturdy, versatile and stackable! Whats not to love .......?", 
    "These chairs are a really good deal, they are sturdy, the legs won't mess up your wood floors, they stack nicely for when you want to mop the floor, and, they are easy to keep clean. They look great with my Emerald Rustic Weathered Dinette Table with the Butterfly Leaf.", 
    "I love these. They are a great value.", 
    "love love love my chairs! they work perfectly in my small space, but are also very stylish and are super easy to clean with my toddler", 
    "These chairs really look nice up next to a wooden dining table. They are easy to store too for future use. No assembly required with these either.", 
    "Great looking chairs. And very good customer service. One of the four arrived dented. When I called, they were very responsive and replaced the dented chair right away. Very happy with the product and the service.", 
    "We LOVE these chairs! They fit the industrial look of our house, are sturdy and not nearly as uncomfortable as you would think :)", 
    "Love these chairs! Exactly what we were wanting.", 
    "One of the four chairs was bent and overstock did not have a replacement at the time. Offered me a small credit on my next purchase that I did not use before it expired. Chairs are nice quality, easy to stack and clean.", 
    "I have a more rustic table and I was looking for something to complement that; these work perfectly to meld the old and new styles. One of my chairs did come damaged (dented a bit) but customer service was AMAZING and I received a replacement chair within a week of when I reported the problem...absolutely fantastic!", 
    "Nice quality, perfect dining chairs with our farm table", 
    "a great value! good quality! it's a must buy!", 
    "Definitely a great value for the price. Haven't used them much yet, but they look really nice and I'm looking forward to easy clean up. Distinct silver color, not galvanized or antiqued.", 
    "Chairs are much larger and take up more room than expected. The seats are a square shape which isn't obvious from the photos. Overall, they look great and a good value.", 
    "The color was cheap looking. I returned them and had to pay for shipping ($**).", 
    "These came quickly no assembly and 8 great chairs that are the perfect size for a small space. Love them", 
    "We bought these chairs about 2 years ago for our dining room table. I still love them. I bought them for the style. I love them for the functionality. They are so easy to clean! If you have children you know that their hands do not stay clean unless they are asleep. But after they hop down from the table these chairs just wipe clean with a clorox wipe! Easy peasy. They also stack! So when you need to clean the floor you can stack them up and out of the way. We added rubber feet to the bottom to protect our wood floors. Excellent purchase!", 
    "I return the product because the arms wouldn't fit under my table, cute chairs however.", 
    "Always happy with o.co products", 
    "These chairs are great looking. They are a little more matte than I was expecting but they are still a great set. I also purchased cushions to make them more comfy for my guests.", 
    "quality chairs, good price; helped finish off our breakfast table", 
    "i love these chairs. they came already assembled, perfect right out of the box. they're sturdy, appealing to the eye, and stack! and, it's the best price that i've found so far.", 
    "They fit me perfectly and are comfortable and go OH SO WELL with the table I ordered. Tabouret Dining Table.", 
    "I read through a lot of reviews before buying this set. I agree on how comfortable they actually are. My husband is very tall and he even likes them. I only wish they were more of a galvanized look instead of being shiny. Like previous reviews have said though they will become more beat up looking eventually. Overall I'm very pleased with these and they look great with my farmhouse table.", 
    "I ordered 8 but had to get 4 replaced because they came not wrapped properly (clearly returns). They sent me another 4, same thing. If your chair doesn't come wrapped like a Christmas gift, send it back. they get really dinged up in the shipping. Overstock was great about it, no complaints on them!", 
    "Goes perfect with the cable grey oak dining table. Only thing is, they're a little cold to sit on. Thought about adding a cushion but I'm afraid it may lose its modern feel.", 
    "very nice always get compliments and they stack!", 
    "I have had the bar stools for over a year and was waiting to find a reason to purchase the chairs. Changing out my sun room to make it a bit more eclectic. Pairing these chairs with a blue washed traditional x base picnic table! They are fantastic. They came quickly, in great shape and are very sturdy. They are on the smaller side but not so much so. I wouldn't want to sit in it all night but to eat and converse for awhile they are perfect! Love them!", 
    "I was looking for more of a shiny, silver chrome look, but these chairs were more of a shiny grey than silver. Returned.", 
    "We have 8 of these chairs going on 2 years. Stackable and easy to move. Stylish. Not good for a long sit but we use others furniture for that. Goes well with all kinds of decor.", 
    "Exactly what we needed. Sturdy and stackable plus the arms are excellent if one needs a bit of boost to get up.", 
    "Recommended. Hold up well.", 
    "These chairs are stylish but after a couple of hours they become uncomfortable on the bottom.", 
    "The chairs are exactly what I expected.", 
    "So cute and so versatile. I have them in a model home now around a wood table in a porch and can't wait to see all the ways I will use them.", 
    "We've been happy with these chairs. I bought them on a Black Friday sale with the idea of having extra chairs around, but have since read how great they are with children, and this is true. They're great for kids because you can simply wipe down any grimy spots where food has fallen or sticky fingers have touched. They stack, which is so fantastic for storage if you're not using them all the time. The only thing I don't like is that the opening where the seat meets the back gets kind of gross. There are now crumbs all along the line that need to be cleaned out with a toothbrush or some other fine tool.", 
    "good deal for the price, the finish is pretty bland tho. Very flat and dull.", 
    "THESE CHAIRS TAKE UP LITTLE SPACE. THE DESIGN IS CLASSIC. THEY ARE WELL CONSTRUCTED AND CAN HOLD WEIGHT. THEY COME NICELY PACKED. WE SHALL ENJOY HAVING THEM IN OUR CABIN.", 
    "Love these chairs (4) came quickly and without damage! Very comfortable seating without cushion, but am at the beach, so most likely I will be adding cushion to take the hit off the coolness of the metal. Great stacking an added feature if you live in a small space. Would highly recommend!", 
    "Great price and so cute!! Perfect addition to my home!", 
    "We had seen similar chairs in hip bars and caf\u00e9s and wanted some for our dining room. They are very sturdy and sharp looking. They stack nicely when not in use and fit well with the modern look we were going for.", 
    "I love these chairs. However, the arms may make them difficult for larger persons to use comfortably.", 
    "Love my chairs!! I have them mixed in with wood chairs around my dining table and they bring just the right amount of industrial style to cozy cottage. I would order more if I needed to.", 
    "These are great chairs! I was disappointed that I had to purchase 4 as we only needed two, but it was worth it to get these bad boys in our house. I also purchansed the matching armless chairs. Although the design of the back and legs are not the same the differences are minimal and they look great together!", 
    "sturdy, sleek, perfect for any room", 
    "I just love these. Classic look. Pair nicely w rustic to make an interesting industrial mix. Good price.", 
    "Very sturdy, great look, I'm very pleased.", 
    "Great, small Nook chairs for mixing the urban feel of metal with a wood table. Don't take up a lot of room, description and size is accurate. The metal is not too cold to sit in, even with bare legs, arms are comfortable and the little pads on the bottom of the leg keep the chair from scratching the floor as well as a noise silencer for those of us who live above others. Arrived on time in one box, with plenty of packing.. great choice!", 
    "I am so happy I bought these chairs! I thought they might be too silver for what I was going for, but they're perfect! Every person that comes into my house asks where I got them. I'm also loving the fact that I can stack them while I'm cleaning house...or later if I want to store the other two, they are easy to stack in an extra closet. I highly recommend buying the tabouret chairs.", 
    "As other reviewers state they are a bit small, but I do sit in them for a long period of time and have not had any discomfort. Larger people may not feel the same. I have them around a reclaimed wood and metal table and they really do look great. I just wish the silver finish had a more vintage look to them. Three out of four arrived perfect. One has chair has a bent back but I didn't notice it until a few days later after receiving and it doesn't affect the comfort level.", 
    "I'd been eyeing these chairs for literally years, and finally decided to take the plunge. I'd read the reviews about the size, but I guess I just hoped that the smallness of the seat wouldn't bother me. Alas, the chairs/arms and definitely too narrow for my wide hips. I'm normally a size 14/16, as a reference point. My husband is also kind of a bigger dude. We both fit in the chairs, but they just weren't comfortable enough for us to keep them. Back they went! I'm going to try the armless version instead. More pricey, yes, but worth it if they'll work for us!", 
    "Great style, quality, and at a great price! can't beat it!! I was at cost plus world market and they had them for $** a piece! so excited that I saved so much!!", 
    "I have ordered 2 sets of these chairs. Each time the top chair has come damaged. The company said they can send me a replacement but it will be another month. Hopefully they will follow thru.The price point is good for this prodct. They are sturdy and comfortable. They are attractive. You cannot stack more than 4 on top of each other.", 
    "Very disappointed. These chairs look very cheap and I am sending them back. You get what you pay for.", 
    "I originally purchased 4 of these chairs on ******* from a guy who didn't have space for them. I bought 4 more when I purchased a larger table. They have a fun look and are comfortable with the arms. They look great with both tables I have used them with. My older 4 mix right in as they still look brand new after 2 years! and the price is unbeatable. love love them!", 
    "These are a great 4 set of modern dining chairs that are a great value at an even better price. The chairs feel and are sturdy, yet they are comfortable even without a cushion, which surprised me. We love the style with the farm-style dining table we have, really gives is the modern vibe we wanted.", 
    "So first, the chairs look great. They arrived damage-free and are exactly as depicted in the first photo - as in 3 of them look the same. However, the fourth chair has a different shape to the back. Not different like it was bent or damaged, but different as in completely different from the factory. It has an angular, decorative bend to it that the other three don't have. They flow directly upward. It must not be that noticeable as I've had the chairs for quite some time and just realized this, but now I can't help but see it every time I walk through the dining room. For this reason, I give 3 stars.", 
    "found chairs not overly wide or comfortable. Arm construction doers not allow them to get close under a standard table.", 
    "I wasn't 100% sure what to expect with these chairs considering other places I shop at have these chairs priced at 1 or 2 for the 4 you get from Overstock. I was PLEASANTLY surprised that the chairs are everything I hoped for! Packaged very well and were undamaged. They are sturdy and are very attractive in person. They do have rubber soles on the feet so if you have hardwood floors like we do (until I can find a nice carpet) it helps protect against scratches on the floor. The fact I got 4 chairs for under $*** and in this style I feel like I got an amazing deal!", 
    "Excellent item. Exactly what expedited and delivered quickly. No assembly needed. Chairs look great", 
    "Love these chairs! We also got the silver 24\" counter stools and they match perfectly! The seats aren't the widest, but we LOVE the arm rests! Not many stools have them!", 
    "Chairs came quickly and look great. I may put cushions on them but they look good without and they're comfortable without them.", 
    "We'd been wanting some extra seating for our table (and picnic table, even though these are rated for outdoor use) and found ones similar at World Market, but for more expensive than on Overstock. And we got a $$$ off overstock coupon that made it totally worth getting. Since they're not meant to be kept outdoors, just bring them into your garage, shed, patio when you're not using them.", 
    "These chairs were the perpect find for my house. I don't have to worry about anyone spilling food on them, if so...i can just wipe them off because there is no fabric to clean. These chairs can be stacked and stored away easy. I bought them for family gatherings. You can dress them up around a nice wood table or use them outside for a bbq. Very stylish chairs, Great buy!!!", 
    "I have been looking at this style of chair for a few years now. I feel that I got 4 chairs for the price that I have seen 1 chair of similar style and quality. I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "We've used these chairs every day for over a year. They're great, although in colder temps can be chilly to sit on (which isn't surprising). Love the style and simplicity!", 
    "This was exactly what I was looking for and it arrived quickly. I'm very happy and will be buying matching bar stools!", 
    "I put them with a wood table in our basement kitchen, and they are perfect! The color the size everything is great! They shipped fast and came packaged well to protect them from being damaged!", 
    "Got the chairs and opened the box. Unpacking the chairs was very difficult even with two people. First chair was fine. Took out the second chair and thought it looked different. Then noticed that the whole back rest of the chair had been smashed. Very disappointed but not willing to unpack anymore chairs lest anymore of them be damaged. It's going to be difficult enough to repack the chairs for a return. I should have known that at such a low price I'd be paying for low quality.....", 
    "I was searching and searching for an industrial looking chair online to go with our industrial farmhouse design for our dining area. I am a blogger and see A LOT of ideas on the web and a lot of online shops and local shops that carry similar products. I was totally pleased to find out from my friend Liz at ******************** that she ordered these same chairs for her dining space and she passed the info on to me. When the chairs arrived, I fell in love. They have the industrial style I was going for but also felt sturdy and of quality for a very reasonable price. They look FABULOUS in our new custom home with a industrial farmhouse style. You can view more at *************************.", 
    "Perfect sturdy chairs, they are too big and are very comfortable to sit in. Love the chairs", 
    "Cute,,,I love that they stack. So when they aren't in use, they take a small space.", 
    "These chairs are super! I am totally in love with them. They arrived in perfect condition and I can hardly wait to find the perfect table to go with them.", 
    "I received the silver tabouret stacking chairs (set of 4) and really love them! We have a simple, round wooden table and needed something that was lower profile yet sturdy. These fit the bill. I love the industrial edge it gives our eclectic home. The fact that they are stackable is even better! They arrived in perfect condition (no bends or chips). The legs have rubber bumpers on the bottom so they do not slide or scratch the floor. I am very happy with this purchase!", 
    "I bought 4 of these to accompany a heavy wood table (2 on each side), and I am very pleased. The metal / wood contrast is a nice juxtaposition, and the chairs are solid without being dull. Due to the arms they only push under the table about halfway, which is just perfect for dining. There are rubber \"feet\" and I have no worries about them scratching my wooden floor. I placed colorful chair pads on 2 seats, and sheepskin throws on 2, and I couldn't be happier. They were, however, perfectly comfortable with no pads, just a little cold on bare legs. Great price for 4 chairs, and I'd highly recommend them (and they come fully assembled - woohoo!).", 
    "I just unwrapped these chairs, and they are probably the best-packaged item I've ever received. The chairs themselves are sturdy, well-made, and (I think) very comfortable. I'm 5'3\", and my boyfriend is 6'5\", so we will see what he thinks when he sits in them!! Something I think is importnat to note, though, is that these have a silver powdercoated finish. they are not a natural looking silver metal. They won't age the way i bought them to, but I should be able to knowck them around a bit to make them look older. These are beautiful well-made chairs; just know that the finish is going to be a bit too \"new\" looking if you're going for more of an industrial vibe.", 
    "These chairs take a ton of abuse from our family and are holding up beautifully. They are very sturdy and very easy to clean. My only complaint is that the silver paint is chipping some where they get knocked into the table and there is some rust forming where the back meets the bottom of the chair.....but its not super noticeable and doesn't out weight the overall value - I would buy them all over again.", 
    "The chairs arrived packed week, however one was damaged. Overstock let me keep the damaged chair and sent me a brand new one.", 
    "Stylish industrial style chairs at a great price :)", 
    "The chairs arrived as shown. They haven't been used too much but have held up well so far. They are nice and light and easy to move into other rooms. The only drawback is that they are slightly cold when you first sit in them (as it is winter), but that hasn't been too much of an issue. Seem to be good quality and looking forward to many years of use.", 
    "I redo furniture and right now have a bright red table. I am making a set with these four chairs and putting a brightly colored chair cushion on them. The chairs are a wonderful complient to this particular table. They are affordable and of a good quality and design. Thanks Overstock", 
    "I love these chairs! They look fantastic with our tulip table, and with our larger midcentury aluminum and Formica table, and fit our needs perfectly. They're easy to clean and easy for our little one (she's two and VERY tall) to climb in and out of, and she doesn't need a booster seat with these chairs. It's nice because the arms keep her contained just enough. Two issues others had with them, we found we had no problem with. My husband is 6'5\", and he finds that the seat height is actually quite comfortable for him. I am a size 18-20, and don't find the chairs to be too small. However, I do not have any hips or butt to speak of, so I might not be the best person to ask. I think if my hips were wider, the chairs might be a little uncomfortable for long meals or gaming. I did have a problem with them, because two of my chairs came damaged. I'm pretty sure the problem is with how roughly they are packed, vs. how they are treated in shipping. Overstock was great and shipped replacements right away, so everything worked out well! I am so happy with these chairs.", 
    "I ordered two sets. 8 chairs in all. shipment arrived in 6 business days. cartons were in good shape. unwrapped immediately to check for any damage or problems. NONE. We love the color, size and look. planning to use them with a custom rustic plank table. Suitable for small children (with a booster seat) and adults. Easy to keep clean. Very Happy with chairs and the price.", 
    "I wasn't expecting these chairs to be quite this nice but luckily I was wrong. The pair great with my farmhouse table and are comfortable to sit in. They can get a little cold but you can easily fit a cushion into them. I saw these chairs in stores for $100.00 a piece so I am thrilled to get these chairs, which are just as nice as the ones in stores for a lot cheaper.", 
    "These chairs are pretty and look well made. I was looking for something exactly like these and I was excited when I received the box. But when I opened, I was EXTREMELY disappointed :-( these chairs are REALLY small and I'm impressed to see just a couple of reviews mentioning this. I'm 5'8\" and 140lbs. I fit in the chair, but I was really uncomfortable because the side of the chair is really close, almost touching, and the sensation I was seating inside a box. Not really the feel you want when eating at your kitchen table. Unfortunately, I had to return the chairs (Overstock was great about returning them!!) but I'm still mad for having just a few reviews mentioning they are small. Well, they are. I do not recommend it.", 
    "I purchased these chairs for a round kitchen table, they fit perfect and look great! I have small children and I love the fact that there are no sharp or pointy edges. They can get in and out of them with ease, and they clean up is easy. They also look great and are sturdy. Big winner all the way around! Love them!", 
    "I have looked at a number of these metal chairs. I love the industrial look. These chairs are even better then I expected. The finish isn't to glossy. They are perfect. They look more expensive then all the other chairs I have looked at. I am 100% satisfied.", 
    "This set of 4 chairs came assembled... We love them!", 
    "Nice chairs to go with my massive industrial-looking dining table. Four chairs that are heavy-duty and light-weight at the same time. Was deciding between these chairs and the other brownish ones. Glad I chose these. Love that they stack.", 
    "These chairs are a great find . They look just like the expensive ones. I paired them with a vantage glass and lucite table from the 70's. Looks high end on a budget. I would recommend them highly .", 
    "I was on a hunt for these chairs for a new dining room table. Seen them elsewhere for double the price. Chairs arrived in a couple days. Very sturdy chair, good size, can be stacked for easy storage. Received many compliments on the look of the chairs.", 
    "These chairs look great and the price is excellent. When they arrived, one of the chairs was damaged, but Overstock.com's live Customer Care through the web site was very fast in resolving the issue, and a new chair was shipped within just a few days. My only complaint about the design of the chairs is that the arms prevent them from being pushed in under the dining table, as mentioned in other reviews. I knew that would be the case when I purchased them, but it would be nice to gain that extra few inches on each side by having the chairs all fully pushed in when not in use. Overall, these chairs are sturdy and comfortable (albeit cold to the touch - but we live in Florida, so no big deal!), and appear to be a great value. Overstock's Customer Service has been excellent, as well, from super fast initial shipping to simple, fast problem solving a shipping of a replacement.", 
    "We chose these a chairs for our reclaimed wood table. I love the style of them but wasn't sure if U would want to change them in a few years If I changed my mind. With these, you can get the look without paying an arm and a leg for the real, galvanized steel chairs. They are comfortable and seem to be good quality. One of our chairs came damaged (the back was bent a little). I contacted the company on the info sheet that came in the box and the replacement chair was at my house in less than 2 days. I recommend this product with the knowledge they are painted, not galvanized.", 
    "Beautiful chairs. I needed 52 of them for a restaurant dining room. Perfect!", 
    "Absolutely loved the stools! Fast shipping and WAY cheaper than other stores! Very happy with my purchase!", 
    "These chairs and matching side tables were purchased to spruce up a tired and dated waiting area in my hair salon. I also purchased a silver coat tree. Everything came packed beautifully and quickly. These additions to my salon make it feel more trendy and modern. People wont mind waiting while sitting on these chairs!", 
    "Love these chairs, and I've seen them for so much more $$ elsewhere. Only complaint is from my 9 year old daughter, who says that they are cold. She hates to sit on them when wearing shorts.", 
    "We have had these chairs for a week. I was impressed with how they arrived in the box. Nicely packed in. I was pleased to see that the legs have rubber like stoppers on them so they will not scratch up the floors. We put them around our dining table & we paired them with blue accent chairs also from Overstock. Kid friendly, just wipe them clean!", 
    "These chairs look great. They're good quality, and they come fully assembled.", 
    "love the chairs, great color,very comfy, & love that they are stackable", 
    "I had been wanting to buy these chairs for a while for my dining room table. I love the trend with this style of chairs and barstools. They look really great at my table. I have been redecorating my house and this was the perfect style I am going for. The one and only thing I do not like about these is the color of silver they are. I thought they would be a little more shiny silver. I was originally trying to choose between silver and white. I like the silver, but kind of wish I would've got the white.", 
    "These chairs were a great purchase for some extra indoor/outdoor seating. I use them predominantly for my glass-covered patio and so far they have stood up to a year's worth of weather well. I like the size and that they stack, although sometimes you have to fight with them a bit to get them unstacked. They look equally good in my kitchen as extra seating when necessary. They are a painted finish (not galvanized) so they will rust if left out in the rain. I plan to keep them covered outside for the winter. They do require chair pads for comfort. If you plan to have them in the sun, I would recommend the silver over the coloured versions as apparently they fade quite quickly.", 
    "Perfect and can't beat the price! These are excellent replicas, heavy, sturdy and nowhere near the price of the originals", 
    "I love these sturdy chairs! They have held up very well with my family of four and still look super trendy for guests. They match almost any decor! I love how easy they wipe down as well. Exactly what I expected when I ordered them.", 
    "These are beautiful chairs, and also comfortable. The stack of 4 had 2 damaged ones, but Overstock sent me 2 extra in a few days. I am using them in an outside covered patio with a large rustic wood table: it looks awsome!", 
    "We purchased 24 of these for our renovated employee break area. They are a nice spray painted finish that resembles the galvanized look. Personally, this is much BETTER than galvanized. It is washable and the finish will not turn dark or rub off on clothing like real galvanized metal. These chairs are light enough to move without noise, but not so light that they feel cheap. Great modern style, and much to my disbelief, metal chairs CAN be comfortable. We do wish they would get the armless version back in stock, as we have some employees that prefer no arms. That being said, my husband is 6'3\" and 215 lbs. He can sit in this chair and fit. He doesn't feel cramped. We paired these with grey laminate topped tables and everyone loves the new renovated look!", 
    "Heavy duty stacking chairs currently in fashion. Very comfortable, fit in nicely with other chairs around a table or as extra seating in a room. Only complaint is that some were dinged in shipping. Overstock promptly replaced them.", 
    "I got four chairs for less than the price of one from another website.", 
    "Chairs were stylish and seemed well made. Unfortunately, the set of 4 arrived with 1chair back damaged during shipping. No stock left to reorder.", 
    "chairs work perfect with my zinc top table from Ballard.", 
    "We bought these chairs for our beach house which is small but we often have a lot of guests for lobster dinners and board games. They are attractive, stackable and comfortable!", 
    "One of the four chairs arrived crushed. The shipping box was not damaged so it happened in transit. Overstock offered to send a replacement however the quality is missing so back they go. The other chairs have dimples, ridges, not of good quality. In this case you get what you pay for. I bought them based on everyone's great comments. Guess I just got a bad batch?", 
    "Very happy with the chairs overall. They are fitting with my room perfectly.", 
    "I saw these chairs in trendy restaurant patio in Florida and fell in love with the shape and look. When I was decorating my new back porch, I thought of these and started hunting for them. O had a great price on a set of 4 and they came very quickly. I realize using them outdoors may bring rust into the equation (I have a salt pool so lots of metal things rust). But, I plan to keep an eye on that and I can always spray paint them with a rust-resistant spray paint. They add a nice twist to my rustic/traditional porch. It really makes the wooden table stand out! Love, love, love these chairs :)", 
    "These go fabulous with my expensive distraught wooden dining room table with fabric end chairs. Couldn't be happier... and also saved about $300 from other sites prices.", 
    "These chairs are note comfortable without a cushion. They are not as stylish or sturdy as some of the brand name originals of this type. They are a bit bulky and cold to sit on in winter. The arms of the chairs are high, so they scrape on my table. Too much hassle to deal with a return, so I'm gonna be selling these on Craigslist.", 
    "You absolutely cannot go wrong with these chairs! Four of them for less than the cost of one of the French type which are so difficult to find in the US. I am using them outside on the patio. Use a quality spray on lacquer and use them outdoors. No problem!", 
    "I love these chairs so much I bought the stools too.", 
    "I love these chairs. They match perfectly with my new farmhouse table giving me the industrial rustic look I was going for perfectly. They are very durable which is important considering I have a 2 year old so seems to make mess wherever she walks. I can just wipe them down easily. I would definitely recommend these chairs to anyone who is interested. They are a great value! Some of the other reviews say they are too little and I disagree. Neither myself or my husband are \"little people\" I'm 5'8\" and hes 6' and they are perfect and comfortable.", 
    "I am thrilled with these chairs, they look amazing, very comfy and stylish.", 
    "These chairs are really chic and bright! What I love about these chairs is that I paired them with a smaller white table and the fact that they do not fit under the table because of the shape of the arms really helped round out my table and give my table an illusion of a larger table. They were perfect for that! Also, I think they sit an inch or two lower then a regular wood dining chair so that also was perfect for my smaller size table. The color and style of this chair can be paired with so many different table types! You will not be disappointed with this chair! They came very quickly, already assembled and the price point for four chairs cannot be beat! I just wish Overstock sold them in 2's, as well, so I could have 6 all together. The silver color was bright and not dull and I think that makes these chairs great too! I do have kids and kids can sneak out under the arm of the chair, but I don't find that to be dangerous. As long as they don't try and hang from the arm of the chair (then it will tip)", 
    "These chairs are great. I am 5'2\" and my husband is over 6 feet. They are very comfortable for both of us. They are sturdy, don't tip and solid chair. The price makes these chairs an excellent value and a purchase that won't be later regretted. After the order was placed, the shipment was at my door in just a few short days.", 
    "Love these chairs. Purchased two sets for my dining table. No assembly needed. They are actually pretty comfortable condidering they are metal. Clean polished finish is nice and compliments my reclaimed wood dining table well.", 
    "The chairs came well wrapped and protected and are exactly as described on line. They are well made and can handle a large person well. They have beautiful lines and fit under a standard height table. I love the fact that they are $50 each but look twice that. Great value.", 
    "These chairs are pretty comparable to the very expensive chairs sold by other companies. Only wish they were sold in Quantity of 2 and not just 4. I need 6 chairs not 8!", 
    "I was so disappointed with how damaged these arrived. The top chair of the stack was completely crushed in transit. That being said, even without the transportation damage, many of the chairs were scratched, scuffed, and chipped. We ended up getting a refund and replacing them with the \"vintage\" tabouret chair finish, which we're much happier with.", 
    "Bought these chairs for our kitchen and they are amazing. They are very sturdy and comfy. I love them!", 
    "I bought these chairs because they looked like a chair I had seen in the Pottery Barn line. When I got them I was very disappointed. Instead of a high end look they looked sci-fi. Not many homes could pull these off unless they are super modern. They are easy to clean but chip sometimes. Overall, I would not make the purchase again.", 
    "I was extremely pleased with the chairs! They were just as described on overstock.com. I decided to buy the matching counter stools. I have not seen this design anywhere else and they were such a good value!", 
    "The chairs were a little lower quality than expected, but great price for 4 chairs. Top chair in stack was scuffed when it arrived, so I chatted with Overstock and they sent a replacement.", 
    "Great chairs. I've received several compliments already. Very comfy, especially for petite and regular-sized people. Very sleek. 'Reminds of me of chairs I saw in Paris. We use them in the breakfast area. I constantly have to remind the kids not to rock or stand on it as per instructions. Other than that, these chairs are wonderful! And great price too!", 
    "You cannot beat the price on these chairs. Most other sites have 1 or 2 chairs for the price O.co has for 4. They are a bit narrow in the rear seat area as some of the other reviewers have mentioned but they are roomy enough for us and very comfortable.", 
    "Even though two of the chairs were slightly damaged considering how inexpensive they were, I was pleased. It would not have been worth the trouble to return two of the four chairs. I put a cushion on the scratched one and put the dented one at the back.", 
    "These chairs were bought based on their styling. The convenience factor of stacking was a bonus. The best part is they are actually comfortable. Certainly not cushy but the frame is smooth and curved in such a way as to fit well and provide support when sitting in them. Overall a very good buy.", 
    "The chairs come stacked. They're a little difficult to stack/unstack unless you get the angle just perfect. I got silver, and its a matte silver. I was hoping for more of a raw or distressed finish. The arms don't allow the chair to slide more than 1/2 way under a standard table. Seat it a little narrow, prolly would not allow a \"big\" person to fit.", 
    "Quality and style at an affordable price! These are super handsome chairs. You might buy a chair pad for seat comfort, but otherwise this is a great value.", 
    "These chairs are great. I was looking at similar ones at another store that looked nicer, but they were also much more expensive. I think these chairs are great for the price. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for chairs like this. They look great in my dining room, and really help with the industrial feel i was going for.", 
    "Awesome chairs. Love the look. Very sturdy construction. The only negative is that with most tables you can't tuck the chairs under due to the height of the arms, but I already knew this after reading other customer's reviews. Otherwise, LOVE these chairs, especially for the price. Highly recommend.", 
    "First off--- HECK OF A DEAL! I love the sleek lines and industrial modern look-- chairs are kid proof AND stylish!!! SCORE! Was concerned about the arms not going under table etc- but they are not a problem ad actuallu butt up perfectly-- I had one compressed chair upon arrival and emailed customer service-- on a sunday- - and by friday- they had delovered a new chair! awesome- I actually loved these so much that I bought another set in the limeade color too!!! Impromptu dinner guest-- ? A last minute outdoor soir\u00e9e--? I am covered!!! These chairs stack and are lightweight and so versatile -- and easy to clean!! (wouldn't recommend leaving them outside in harsh conditions etc-= rust?) but- I love them! Card party-- no problem-- extrasseating for game night?? I'm ready!!!", 
    "If there is a hesitation it is that the chairs are made in China.", 
    "I'm so proud of the this purchase! I almost bought the pretty much same chair at another furniture store for $100 each! These are a great quality chair and look great with the rustic wood table I purchased somewhere else! Chairs can get expensive, but this set of four made for a GREAT deal! I bought the set of four to go on each long side of the rectangular table and a two stools to go on each shorter side of the table. I love the modern rustic look that it gives my breakfast nook!", 
    "I was looking for a less expensive version of the Tolix Marais chairs. These aren't spot-on; but will do in a pinch - especially considering the difference in price. The chairs are extremely sturdy and come with rubber pads on the feet so they don't scratch our wood floors at all. If you're not fussy about having the name brand, then these chairs will work just fine.", 
    "These Tolix-style chairs are on-trend this season; just go to any design website or major furniture dealer and you'll see some iteration of this chair. And Overstock's version is a steal at a FRACTION of what you'll pay anywhere else. However, these are called \"silver\" for a reason: they are bright and clean looking. Not at all the modern industrial loft look I was hoping for...more on par with a galvanized metal color. Luckily Overstock carries the same chair in \"vintage\" which was perfect...and I loved those so much I bought the matching barstools, too.", 
    "Love these chairs! goes great with a homemade barn door table! rustic and modern mixed together are great compliments. The chairs are comfortable yet cold in the morning. easy to clean with kids, fits booster seats very well. i bought 8 of the chairs and only one of the chairs has a chip of paint missing so that was no big deal silver spray paint covered it up.. the chairs come fully assembled which was a breeze. nice and light.", 
    "I only bought these chairs because they were priced right and came in increments of 4. I actually wanted other chairs instead. But these are ultra-modern and hip. They look great with my dark wood table. And they're surprisingly comfortable.", 
    "I really liked these. They are pretty much what i was looking for, but my family did not like them. they are having a hard time getting over the fact that they aren't cushiony and cold. i think they match exactly as the photo shows.", 
    "I liked them but the slightly curved arm didn't fit under my table so we had to return them. Overstock's return system even for large items was easy though. I just took the box to the UPS store and it was all taken care of.", 
    "I wanted a different type of chair settling for my kitchen and these are perfect.", 
    "in search of tolix-style chairs for my kitchen (to pair with a rustic looking farm table), i found these chairs on overstock. i looked at several comparable options - industry west, restoration hardware, world market, dwr (the real deal tolix), crate & barrel, etc. i just couldnt beat the overstock price at $$$ (during a 10% off sale and using a $20 off coupon) for four chairs. the description is accurate. they came in good condition. i do wish the arms weren't as angular (they don't go under my table at all). but for what i was looking for, they do the trick. comfort level is fine - you wouldnt want to sit in them for 12 hours, but for a meal they work. my 15 month old daughter has already started banging her toys on the seats, pushing the chairs around the kitchen, etc. i love that i don't have to worry about them getting ruined. in all honesty, if i could have afforded the real deal tolix, i would've gotten them. but these will do the trick for now.", 
    "Bought the counter stools, same color, a while back, and are very happy with them. Haven't used the chairs on the patio as yet, but expect the same quality. These are NOT super-shiny, but a nice light pewter shade that works well with a lot of potential furniture partners. Great buy for the price, and as always, Overstock's packing and delivery were perfect.", 
    "I love these chairs. We bought them for our dining room and they have been perfect for us. The seat/arms are slightly narrow, but not so much you can't sit for longer periods of time. We are now thinking about getting another set for our outdoor patio.", 
    "I had looked at chairs similar to these, but couldn't ever bring myself to spend the money. When I saw these and how inexpensive they are, I was at first skeptical of the quality. Turns out, they are amazingly well built chairs AND they look like many others on the market that cost 3-4x the price. I'm extremely pleased and HIGHLY recommend them.", 
    "These chairs are perfect for so many reasons. Frst they are very well made , sturdy with no assembly required. They are stackable, so if you don't need to use all four you can just stack the rest in a corner. They look great with any decor and lend an eclectic air. I paired them with my rubberwood farmhouse table and they look great. Finally the price . I have seen similar chairs for twice what I paid here. The only downside is that if you are overweight you may not fit comfortably, as the chairs have arms . My husband is 6'1' and weighs 190 lbs and he fit in them but is wrried that not all our guests will be comfortable. But I love them. I wish the color was aliitle more weathered looking, but all in all it is fine.", 
    "Got the set very fast with choosing the standard shipping method with UPS Ground. Unfortunately, one chair was damage. I believe that it was packed that way, not a shipping problem. I got the replacement chair very fast. Customer service was very helpful. I had to keep the damage chair, not supposed to send it back (less troubles for me). Now, I enjoy the new modern look of my dining room. Be sure that you like that style. It would be perfect if Overstock offer the cushions that work for the set. It is difficult to find contemporary-looking cushions. Without the cushions it's a little cold and not comfortable. In conclusion - I like what I've got for the price I paid.", 
    "These chairs are great, and I would highly recommend them. The only thing to be aware of before purchasing is that they do have a relatively low back, and are on the small side. My brother is 6'2\" and he was felt just slightly too large for the chair.", 
    "The one downside to these chairs is that they hit your thighs. If it reminds me to eat less when I sit in them then bring it on!!! My kids finally can't damage them too!", 
    "The chairs offer a modern (slightly industrial) feel. They balance our dark wood table and rustic bench nicely. I expect the bar stools I'm waiting on will balance a cream linen sofa just ordered.", 
    "We were looking for maintenance free chairs for our kitchen table (which is dark cherry wood). We have 2 little girls (4, 18 mo) and these chairs hold up extremely well and are SO easy to clean, just wipe down! If we ever change out these chairs we can definitely use them for the playroom, bedroom or outside. Cannot beat the price, most chairs we found like these are $100 a piece.", 
    "Great chairs - fast delivery! The chairs look great for table in playroom. Sturdy and durable with a contemporary feel.", 
    "These chairs are great. Perfect for a family with lots of kids. The arms are a little too tall to slide all the way under the table, but we have plenty of room. Great product.", 
    "I love these chairs! They are exactly what I wanted for my dining room. I have two little boys who are rough on furniture and decided I needed something sturdy and saw these and the great price and I was sold! They are wipeable and sturdy. I actually have the stools like these in my kitchen, so I knew what I was getting. If you are looking for a galvinized metal finish, these arent quite like that and are more of a metalic paint finish, but still very nice. I'm happy with them and would consider buying more if I upgrade to a bigger table.", 
    "I have had these chairs for over a year now and I must say these chairs are wonderful. Durable and stylish. I have them paired with a rustic farm table in my kitchen....so the chairs get quite a bit of use.... You can't beat the price on these!!!!! They are relatively comfortable for the purpose of eating a meal or even playing cards, I mean they are not lounge chairs, but hey they fit the bill. I am pondering getting the barstools, I love them that much.", 
    "Love the chairs! one had a black mark on the seat, but it wasn't noticeable. perfect for around the table as well as extra seating around the house!", 
    "These chairs go perfect with the rustic table I purchased. I love the color and love that they are stack-able.", 
    "I love these chairs! I ordered them in Silver, but received red...but Overstock fixed it promptly and when I got them I was immediately excited!", 
    "Great chairs! I mismatched then with a white washed table. Totally changed the look of the whole setting. Love my new look!", 
    "I am very pleased with the product. It has done great in my home and I am happy I bught it. I will buy more.", 
    "I bought 8 of these chairs for our very large dark farmhouse dining table. Couldn't have been more pleased! Yes, they may not be as comfortable as plush cushioned chairs, but I was going solely for looks, and I don't want to worry about spills with four kiddos under the age of 6. They even came a little more rustic looking than they looked in the pictures, which is the look I was really going for. I hesitated for many months, because I thought they may look too perfect, without the rustic charm other tolix chairs posses, but after looking at prices, I couldn't beat overstock.com's price. I went for it, and don't regret it! Had husbands entire family of five brothers over for Christmas, and they worked perfect, no one was uncomfortable sitting in the chairs, despite them being metal.", 
    "These chairs were the first things I have ever bought from Overstock.com and I was very pleased with the chairs and Overstock.com's Customer Service. One of the legs came in bent, I talked to Customer Service and within 2 weeks a replacement was sent to my house. I recommend this item and purchasing through Overstock.com.", 
    "These metal chairs are exactly what we needed for extra chairs when we have company. We also keep one in each of the guest bedrooms for seating with a thin cushion on the flat metal seat. These are a great value! Very sturdy and love the design blends with our contemporary Southwestern decor (chose the silver metallic color) and think they\u0092d complement any decor. The chairs store easily as they stack and don\u0092t have a huge footprint. Chair back is comfortable even though it is not high. Don\u0092t know where the folks were coming from who said the seat area was tight (\u0093fitting up to a size 12\u0094 rear end) with the curved back bar that meets the seat. I guess a very heavy person would have a problem, but my 6 ft./2 in., 210 lb. husband has NO trouble sitting in the chair. The chair is not deep\u0097about 15 inches, but doubt anyone will be sitting in them for long periods. Ordered these on a Thursday evening; they arrived the following Tuesday! Can\u0092t get much better than that! The packaging was superb! These babies did not wiggle in shipment and were wrapped and protected in every way. We are extremely pleased!", 
    "These chairs are great. We have a large table that seats 10 and we already had 4 chairs but wanted another 4. I wish that they came in packs of 6 but they worked out really well. I have two toddlers and we have their booster seats strapped in them and the chairs are super easy to clean - much better than getting food off of the wooden chairs that we had before. I would recommend getting some cushions because they're not really comfortable for long dinner parties but we're really happy with them overall.", 
    "Chairs arrived with some slight marring damage to the top chair in the set of 4, due to the packing. Not structural at all. Contacted Overstock and they IMMEDIATELY resolved the problem! Ready to buy more from Overstock. Great product, great service, happy customer! What more could you want?", 
    "I paired these chairs with a wood base glass table and it looks wonderful, with two boys it would be easy to clean.maybe I should've brought a table with that material, LOL", 
    "This was a great solution to provide seating around a large wooden table. The price was so great that I bought 2 packs. The arms and backs were not as substantial as the photo, they were slimmer, but it was a great addition to the room.", 
    "Until I can afford the fancy chairs I want, these provided the perfect solution. They are comfortable and sturdy. Eventually they will move from the kitchen dining area to the outside patio and fire pit.", 
    "These are really sturdy and the color is good, however...they were a bit smaller than I expected. I have a family member that can not sit in this comfortably. If you're looking for a sturdy chair at a good price with no large family members, this is a great buy.", 
    "Looks much better in the picture. Too small. Extremely uncomfortable.", 
    "I have seen these chairs everywhere but these were a fraction of the cost. Believe me I shopped around before I purchased. I will definitely purchase from overstock again!", 
    "good quality for the price. It is not a rustic finish if that is what you are expecting. I do wish it had rubber, or something, on the arms since they set up high and hit the table when pushed under. They don't go under very far.", 
    "i searched high and low for affordable dining chairs that went with our more rustic/city style. these chairs are perfect! others of the same \"look\" cost over $100 a piece and you get 4 for $*** on overstock. the quality is great, they are lightweight and stackable, and i love to \"dress them up\" or just make them a little more comfy with a colorful pillow. they are perfectlly comfortable without, but it's a nice touch. they were delivered on time with no hassle. i could not be happier with the choice to purchase these chairs.", 
    "They were exactly what I was expecting when I ordered them. They area good basic metal chair. The shipping was quick and there was no damage to them when they arrived.", 
    "I have the stools, too, and I would say that if you have hardwood floors you need to put felt pads on these. The black foot caps left discoloration on my finish that I absolutely cannot get off unless I sand and refinish. That is a major bummer, so put pads on immediately!!! I really like these chairs, but I would go for armless chairs next time. These have a pretty wide footprint for the size of the seat, itself. The legs splay out and the arms make it impossible to push the chairs completely under a table. With that said, they are an excellent value. I may end up using them outside - they are great that way - but the industrial farmhouse mod look is perfect for modern rustic interiors.", 
    "These chairs are great!!!! I am so pleased with these chairs and the look of them with my toscana trestle table from pottery barn. Great price...great product.", 
    "Great set of four chairs especially for the money!", 
    "These chairs are modern, stylish, and a perfect fit for my home. The underside of the legs need the skid pads because otherwise its metal on the floor and makes a horrible noise when they're moved but that's the case with any metal hair. I love these and am very happy with the purchase. When not in use, they stack perfectly.", 
    "Bought the chairs to use at kids computer station....going for \"old schoolhouse\" style....bought non skid cushions for them even though they are already comfortable to sit in.....They are fantastic....Silver finish....I had to be placed on a wait list because they sold out before I could order them.....If you want them....buy them as soon as they are in stock or you will have to wait....I bought the bar stools to use at the craft table.....love all of them.....You will pay more than double for similar chairs of other brands.....also ....can't beat the shipping cost....", 
    "I LOVE these chairs. I had been looking at similar chairs for about $*** each and when I saw these, I was hesitant. I thought I'd at least give them a try. When I opened the box I peeked in and was not blown away, but when I pulled them out and put them up against my farmhouse table, I was so thrilled! These chairs far exceeded my expectations and now I am looking to buy 4 more for Thanksgiving.", 
    "Thought these chairs were a great value. They are stylish, sturdy and were well packed. Love Overstock!", 
    "My husband and I build an old farmhouse table. We were struggling to find chairs and we needed 8 of them! I started looking for metal chairs to add a modern element to this otherwise rustic table. I was finding chairs that I liked but were very very expensive. I found these chairs on Overstock.com and ordered a set of 4. We were VERY impressed in the quality and what they added to our dining room table. We actually ordered the other 4 last week and are waiting for them to arrive this week! Great value for such a great piece!", 
    "Very nice durable chairs at an affordable price! Great if you've kids...", 
    "I am very excited about these chairs. The description online was helpful and they arrived only a few days after being ordered. They were a slightly lighter gray/silver than I thought but still look very nice. I also didn't realize that they would be painted like the colored chairs on the site instead of being unfinished/clear coated metal. That didn't matter to me but may to others. Overall I had a great experience with these chairs!", 
    "I love the chairs because they are very comfortable, arrived completely assembled and feel/look that they will last for a very long time. I wish the picture would actually show the chairs and not only the display with the table I would have liked to have more detail as far as design. They look good with my tables and people are surprised with how comfortable they actually are, not expected by the looks.", 
    "Chairs were exactly as expected - great look! The only issue is the paints chips very easily, so not sure how they will hold up over time, but they are a good value for now.", 
    "Beautiful and affordable chairs for a modern dining area. I had to replace my 2 year old bentwood dining chairs. Expense was sudden, I wanted to replace quickly however always found it difficult to get affordable and modern looking chairs. Once I came across this on overstock.com couldn't believe i won't have to spend a fortune on chairs that i really like. I can always use these outdoors as well if I need to upgrade my dinning area again.", 
    "These look good in the picture, but they are light and not well made. Not very comfortable either. Look elsewhere.", 
    "We bought these chairs for everyday use, and especially sobthey could be wiped down! No more upholstery for us w 3young boys. Chairs were in great condition in the box upon delivery, wrapped like nobodys business inside them. These chairs look great, easy to clean and not heavy to move around. I bought 2 boxes of 4 chairs.", 
    "Bought these chairs for my kitchen nook after reading many reviews. I am very pleased with them. It is a small space and I tried other chairs in the area. Not only are they the right size, they are comfortable and very current and stylish in my updated kitchen. Overstock is the best at customer service, so you can't go wrong.", 
    "These chairs have been great so far. They're more comfortable than I assumed they would be. The price can't be beat either, comparable chairs were 4x as much.", 
    "Love these charis for my small kitchen area....also put two outside-works great", 
    "Great product! Got the exact look I was looking for for less than half the price of places like Pier 1 and World Market. Love them!", 
    "I am beyond impressed with the quality and integrity of these chairs. Due to the price I figured the chairs would be a cheaper quality version of what I was looking for in this style of chair. The quality is much better and definitely sturdy! I love these chairs and this was a great purchase! I highly recommend these chairs, for the price and the style you simply can't beat it!", 
    "Overall, great looking chairs. The price was so great that even if I change them out later, I think I will use them as some adorable outdoor chairs too!", 
    "As other reviewers mentioned, the color is more silver than an industrial look or than what seems to appear in the pictures. The chairs came well packaged, but they still had a few dings. Honestly, a little frustrating because it doesn't seem like a great deal for the quality and sacrifice in style. I will keep them, but mainly bc i don't want to carry them and mail them.", 
    "i had orded several sets (13) of these chairs and 7 chairs total did not make it in good shape. the boxes arrived somewhat damaged, and the chairs had various issues from cosmetic(the finish was scratched off), to completely bent footings and legs. overstock was very accommodating on fixing the problem. replacement chairs arrived quickly and in good shape. the chairs seem a good sturdy product for the price.", 
    "These chairs are great so far. I still didn't choose a table, but the chairs can carry a modern look or something rustic. They are surprisingly quite comfortable (didn't look it from the picture). They're easy and smallish but at the same time they have a lot of character. And, no assembly! A great buy :)", 
    "We have a DIY dining table that is best described as industrial farmhouse, and couldn't find chairs to match. These are absolutely perfect -- not to mention a total steal at what works out to $**/chair. I gave four stars instead of five due to comfort. These aren't the sort of chairs you and other guests can sit in all night. Eventually, you'll need to retreat to something with cushions.", 
    "If you like what you see on line, you will love these chairs. The quality is good, they are sturdy, and came well packaged so they would not be damaged. I am very happy with this purchase. Great value!!", 
    "I was hoping these were a bit darker, and more industrial, but they are more silver than gray. However, for the money, it is hard to beat. *** has a darker version which is preferable but they are a $100 per chair.", 
    "I love these chairs. However I wish they sold them in a set of 6. If you are expecting the galvanized steel look- you are not going to get it. They are just like the picture a darker grey metallic look. And I love them! Shipping as always is such a dream with overstock. They came stacked, fully assembled and wrapped up to the hilt in a huge box. These chairs are really great for an urban farmhouse feel.", 
    "I have been wanting metal chairs like these for months and months and when I saw the price of these, I was so excited! Four of these chairs were the same price as 1 from another vender. Although they are not necessarily the vintage, distressed look, for the price I am totally excited and 200% satisfied with them. They look great and are very comfortable, and I am so glad that I found them! Such a steal!", 
    "Super cute chair at a crazy low price compared to what you see just about anywhere else. Love this farmhouse style combined with my upholstered end chairs.", 
    "stylish, comfortable and best of all, no assembly required", 
    "These chairs were delivered assembled - in very large boxes. Good quality and the best price around for this type of chair. I haven't set them up with my table yet - but I am hoping they will match well with the other modern decor in my loft apartment.", 
    "These are a great pair of chairs. I bought them for my bacl patio. I was nervous that they were going to be too low and the height is perfect. They are very sturdy and very comfortable. Its really nice how easily they stack. And the best part is they came fully assembled!", 
    "It's great that these chairs come in a set of four because that's how many that I needed! I paired them with more elegant chairs in my dining room and it looks great! Going for a beach chic look! They are sturdy and have a good weight to them. I added ivory colored seat cushions to them for extra padding. Came fully assembled which is great too!", 
    "Overall a good product and pretty chair just didn't go well with the other chairs I have in the room. I was upset I couldn't keep them... if I could have returned the other ones I would have probably kept these.", 
    "Well built, funky design, perfect addition to a traditional table.", 
    "Overall I'm pleased with my purchase, the quality and the price are very good.", 
    "i really like these chairs. I have been looking at another set for some time but couldn't stand to pay the cost per chair. I found these and they are a nice size and are just the style i was looking for and bonus they were cheap! I would buy these again.", 
    "Love the chairs! Now I want the white ones, too. :)", 
    "I bought these on sale on Black Friday. I liked the look, and figured I could use them outside as well if I eventually coated them with rustoleum. They are very stable--- not a single one of them wobbled. I have checked out a lot of comparable chairs and most of them are uneven to some degree. I wish they were galvanized metal like certain other similarly-styled chairs. but I knew that when I bought them. They are definitely a good value, and since they stack, they can easily be stored.", 
    "I had been eyeing these chairs for months. I almost ordered them in June 2011, but glad I waited as the price dropped to almost half when they went on sale. I wanted something to go with my old, weathered farmhouse table. Other chairs like these were much more expensive. They don't have the galvanized look I wanted, more gray, but they still look great with the table. Easy to clean. Shipping took a full 10 days, but they were in great shape when I unwrapped them. The only negative is that they don't fit under the table, so they cannot be pushed all the way in, but it still looks fine. I've had them for 4 months now and they are holding up well. Great chairs. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "i looked at these chairs for some time and decided to order because I should be able to use them outside on the patio if I disliked them for the kitchen. I love these chairs,they are versatile and more comfortable than I thought they would be. If I tire of using them in the kitchen I can stack them out of the way until needed for extra seating.", 
    "Great stools and chairs. Perfect for our aesthetic. They are knock offs but the originals are 8 times more expensive!", 
    "I have a great farm table on my screened in porch and got these chairs to mix it up some. What a terrific look. Very happy with them. They were so well packed the UPS guy said he wasn't carrying the box up the stairs....don't blame him!", 
    "We bought these to use in our restaurant and they have been working beautifully! The wipe clean and are well built!", 
    "chairs were good quality, not as heavy duty as I thought. For the price, it would recommend", 
    "These were packed extremely well. UPS guy would not bring the huge box up the stairs and put them in my garage. It takes some work to get these unpacked but it keeps them from getting damaged.", 
    "Love these chairs. Exactly what we expected. Perfect for a busy family where they get used a LOT. Love that I can stack them out of the way if I don't need them all.", 
    "Great chairs for a great price. We use them in our dining room with a solid wooden table. Being metallic, they are sometimes cool to the touch. Note they are for indoor use only.", 
    "These chairs are just OK. They're quite small, and the legs on two of the chairs wobble.", 
    "I've been looking everywhere for metal chairs for my dining room. These are by far the BEST deal with the quality I found with chairs three times the price. They are easy to clean, comfortable to sit in, stackable and add that perfect modern touch to my dining room. Overstock shipped these in seven days to boot!", 
    "We purchased these stylish and modern chairs as a chosen gift for our children. They are very pleased with the chairs, especially with how easy they clean up after meals with small children. Very satisfied with the purchase.", 
    "Its a simple version of similar style chairs out there. Can't beat bang for the buck.", 
    "I love these chairs. I have the bar stools also & I get compliments on them all of the time.", 
    "overstock has continually given me quality products, this one is no exception. the product is exactly like the pic, my only complaint is that they are small. i read the other reviews so i had an idea they were small but they work for me.", 
    "Love love love. However I would not have bought them if they were not onsale. Sturdy, functional, will look great for a poker table or game table. Arms prevent me from pushing in under table but I would so buy this again for the price. (4 for XX...don't pay more than that)", 
    "These chairs are great. They look awesome in our dining room. The decor is transitional so a little traditional and contemporary. The two head chairs are zebra print so I was looking for chairs very simple and streamline..", 
    "I really like them! Comfortable, space saving, contemporary and unique.", 
    "I was looking for stacking chairs for our game room. These are perfect. We put them away when not in use. If my kids have their friends over to play pool/foosball we have these extra chairs for them to sit on. They are easy to stack and move around. As an added bonus they match the barstools that I purchased from OS.", 
    "I received these chairs just in time for Thanksgiving, unfortunately 2 of the chairs were damaged during shipping. Overstock had two replacement chairs sent to me, and the shipping was every bit as quick as the original shipment! Luckily, the damaged chairs were useable, so my family had somewhere to sit during Thanksgiving dinner. I highly recommend Overstock and these chairs! They are exactly what I wanted to go with my dark stained dining table and bench and they give just the right amount of an industrial atmosphere that I was looking for. Not only that, but they are very comfortable!", 
    "These are great chairs! arrived on time! great price.Love them.", 
    "Very well-designed, functional, high-quality, sturdy, completely assembled, smaller chairs. I am using them for my dining chairs in a second home, with a wood table. Great product!!", 
    "I love these chairs, good price, great value. Using them at a table in our office, complements all the wood nicely to give an industrial look. Chairs are comfortable (without being padded), sturdy and nice looking.", 
    "so glad we bought these chairs... they are exactly what we were looking for to go in our dining room & compliment our stainless steel kitchen appliances... i love the stack-ability when they aren't in use & the versatility of being formal enough for indoor use but casual enough to be used outdoors... highly recommend!", 
    "Items arrived quickly but with some scuffing and scratches on each chair. Had to get one replacement chair. Have not received it yet but had been shipped.", 
    "adds a nice bistro flair to my kitchen. very cool chairs. lightweight, but sturdy.", 
    "These chairs are a great value for the price. They would've gotten 5 stars, but one of the chairs arrived damaged. The box they came in was very thin and extremely beat up, with ripped open holes. One of the chair had a dented in back. They must've been really beaten up in transit since they are welded metal and still were damaged. I'm working with customer service to see if they can ship a new one to me. We'll see how that goes! If they hadn't been so poorly packed, they'd get 5 stars for sure!", 
    "Very happy with these chairs. I have been looking for a long time for lightweight sturdy chairs. I first looked at the galvanized chairs from *** store but at ***. they where out of my budget. These chairs are great. They do have a painted finish (you will not have the \"rustic/authentic\" look of galvanized chairs) but you can't beat the price and quality of these chairs! We love them, they are also very comfortable! I am looking to maybe have a thin cushion made for the seat, as it is getting colder now, they are getting a little chilly to sit down on, other than a little chill they are wonderful chairs!", 
    "the set is a good cost, if you tend to be on the heavy side these are not comfortable. My son and his friends can sit in them (watching TV in the basement/family room) and I don't worry about furniture being stained.", 
    "I'm very happy with this purchase and the savings. I found something very similar at another store and for the cost of 2 chairs there I got 4 here.", 
    "These chairs were small and didn't have the wow factor I was hoping for. They were almost invisible. They would look nice in an outdoor space but they aren't very comfortable.", 
    "I have always been pretty satisfied with overstock. I bought four different chairs from another online source and absolutely hated them. they were cold and so lightweight my two year old tipped over in one. These chairs are contemporary stylish while being amazingly comfortable and durable. Using them as kitchen chairs and am more than satisfied. Quality is much higher than I expected. Thx", 
    "I love these chairs, everyone asks where I purchased them. BTW, I tell them. Thanks", 
    "Met our needs perfectly. Achieved the effect we wanted.", 
    "I love the look of these chairs. They go great in my kitchen, and they are built to last.", 
    "THEY'RE GRRRRRRRRREAT! The only thing I don't like is that they don't go under my table, but that's my fault.", 
    "These are perfect with my white table. So glad I didn't spend more money on the real ones. And they're more comfortable than they look.", 
    "Pleasantly surprised at how much I love these chairs! Paired with off white round dining table...recommend!!", 
    "So glad that I continued searching for these chairs after finding a similar style at another store. These were literally less than half the cost but the exact same style. Overstock definitely came through on value here! The color is pretty accurate compared to the picture - not quite as shiny as I was expecting based on other reviews, but it looks nice. The chairs also do not push in under the table all the way (more like half way) but that's not really a problem for me. As for comfort and function, they are very sturdy and not at all wobbly (like some alternatives). I think they're perfectly comfy but my husband (who is 6ft 3in tall) says the curve of the back is not quite right for him. Not enough to be a problem for daily use but maybe we'll limit our long dinner parties.", 
    "Being on a budget made it difficult to find quality metal chairs. They go great with my reclaimed wood dinning chair. One did come damaged but Overstock sent me a replacement right away.", 
    "We bought these chairs as a more affordable alternative to similar chairs from a different store, and we're actually glad we bought these because we ended up liking them better than the other ones! Yes, the finish of these chairs isn't steel-looking at all. It's a silvery, very durable-looking coating, as others have described before. When you look at the pictures and you know about the finish, you can actually see it, so we weren't surprised at all. Many other Tolix knockoffs (I didn't even know about Tolix until I looked into the chairs I originally wanted to buy - also knockoffs) have that fake-old look, and while I definitely like the industrial, used type of look, I kind of hate it when it's obviously fake. The Tabouret chairs look shiny and new, and I'm perfectly fine with that. I was worried that the black rubber feet would be wobbly or uneven or would scuff up our hardwood floors, but we've had the chairs for a few weeks and they've been great. I was also super impressed with the packaging! The delivery person left the giant package on your patio (I had left a note for him to do so), and the whole thing was upside down! But everything was packaged so well that it didn't matter at all. There was even a little wooden platform for the chairs to stand on so the legs wouldn't poke out of the package. All in all, great purchase!", 
    "Great product for the price. Better looking than they appear online. So glad I purchased.", 
    "These chairs are great for the money. They are similar to those found in more expensive stores/catalogs, but note they are not exactly the same. The finish is painted on, so it's not truly the vintage style metal. However, that does not detract from the fact that they are simply great chairs at a great price! I have even gotten the same make in bar stools-- I would buy them again! The construction is sturdy and the finish is very nice. I will be using them in a busy location and they will most likely be used daily. Shipping: The delivery was quick (only a few days). The chairs arrived in fair condition. The structure was sound, but each chair's paint had scratches and gouges-- they were either in this condition when packed or possibly during shipping. I could not find any place on the site to help me -- I could only find info on how to return the chairs. I can agree that it would be fair for me to pay to return chairs if I didn't like them , but I don't think I should pay to exchange chairs that had paint issues. I've opted to keep the chairs despite the paint flaws as I know that they will be used often and will most likely incur some paint chipping eventually.", 
    "I had been looking for over a year to find unique smaller scale chairs to use with my grandmother's drop leaf table. These are perfect! They are a nice contrast with dark wood, love the retro look.", 
    "Love, love, love these chairs! They are in my kitchen and I get so many comments. Unique, comfortable, and easy to clean!", 
    "the chairs are very sturdy, but the metal in the seats is fairly thin so it buckles a little as you move around", 
    "Like so many others, I love the French galvanized chair that inspired this one, but it was way out of my budget. Plus I planned to use these on my porch and patio and didn't want to spend too much on anything that would be exposed to Northeast weather. Despite some reviewers complaining about the finish I went ahead and ordered them and could not be more pleased! The finish is not the same as a true galvanized steel, but it still looks pretty great. And the chairs themselves are so sturdy, light, and - best of all - comfortable. I added an inexpensive thin cushion but think they'd be fine without. I'm going to pair them with an old farmhouse table and I think the overall \"modern country\" goal will be achieved. If you're debating this I say go for it!", 
    "Very sturdy, yet lightweight, arrived in perfect condition.", 
    "These are very sturdy chairs. My only problem is that now that they're in my kitchen, I realize they're not exactly the finish I'd hoped for. More expensive metal chairs have a really nice finish to them. I think these will eventually go outside on the patio and be perfect.", 
    "Wonderfully made and adds a great touch of industrialism to the room without being overly. They are surprisingly comfortable too. Although, I added a throw pillow for extended comfort since I sit on this while spending hours on my laptop. Worth the buy!", 
    "Bought the chairs for our eat-in kitchen area. Very happy with the purchase. Chairs arrived quickly and as described.", 
    "Got four chairs for what I would have paid for one at other retailers. Chairs look great in my kitchen area and are very sturdy. The shipping was fast with no issues. Very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "These chairs are exactly what I wanted. Sturdy, already put together, modern and classic at the same time.", 
    "Great chairs, well made and sturdy! They have just the look I was looking for!", 
    "They looked nice on Overstock, and was looking for a modern dining chair to balance a rustic table. Ordered 8 chairs. But half the chairs arrived bent and scratched with paint already chipping off. 2 out of 4 chairs were presentable. Afraid to open the second box.", 
    "These chairs are an awesome Tolix replica. It's great for those who want a designer look without the insane costs.", 
    "The chairs arrived very quickly! And we have been so impressed with the quality and color of them. They look great with our white parsons table. They are very sturdy and easy to clean. We couldn't be more pleased!", 
    "love the chairs, they arrived quickly. bummer though... one was wrecked during shipping so I am yet to contact overstock for a replacement. otherwise they are super cute.", 
    "I also bought the matching stools, and I'm hoping the quality lasts. These have a great look and a great price so I will keep my fingers crossed that they will hold up to heavy use. One caution, they are not overly wide, so if you are seating wide or heavy people I'd go for another style chair.", 
    "These chairs are very sturdy, stackable and come in a nice finish. Came packed very well and arrived without any scratches. It is always good when you don't have to think about returning merchandise or waiting for replacement parts... thanks !", 
    "These chairs come completely assembled and are very contemporary, which I why I ordered them. They're versatile as contemporary dining room chairs (somewhat casual), they stack beautifully for storage as extra seating, and they would be perfect for outdoor use. They're best for average-to-slender people but pinch a little for heavier people. Quality is excellent.", 
    "Omg I loooooove these chairs! They are perfect and just what I was looking for. They are comfortable, sleek, and give my dining area just the right touch of style. They look like I paid a whole lot more and the quality is unbelievable."
