    "went together easily looks good", 
    "It is very difficult to find hardwood furniture that is affordable and well made. I was very pleased with the quality of this piece, worth the time and effort to assemble it. It was well machined, directions were clear and I couldn't be happier. I also purchased the complementary nightstand/side table and was made with the same attention to detail.", 
    "While I appreciate the electronic version of some books, nothing replaces a good old fashion hardback novel. Hench, the need for a nice size bookcase, and this one is a perfect fit.", 
    "love the 2 drawers to find cluster stuff", 
    "This will be a piece of furniture that will last. Piece is very attractive. Its very heavy. Came in two boxes. Went together pretty easy.", 
    "Very easy to put together and the wood is heavy and solid. This is not a cheap piece of furniture. I would recommend buying this and the 3 drawer entertainment center. I have both in my office and I am really happy with how they look", 
    "It looks great on the picture and its dimensions were just what I need. So I ordered it. It is of very good quality. I am assembling it alone (I am pretty handy, but I am a woman, so I go according the manual)I got stuck with assembling drawer sliders to the sides of the bookcase. If I put them according to the picture, they will slide inside the bookcase, not outside.... Common sense tells me to put them another way. But the picture is clear showing visa versa. Or the picture is misleading, or I am not into it. Customer service gave me a name of a manufacture, which is in ********. Now I am waiting for their answer. In general, I like the product very much."
