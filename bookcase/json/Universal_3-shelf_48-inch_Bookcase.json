    "I bought a pair of these bookcases, and they look good and at least after a couple of weeks are holding up fine. Well worth the money.", 
    "Very easy to assemble and instructions are the best I have ever seen. All parts are labeled and I only needed a screwdriver and small hammer.The bookcase looks very good and is sturdy for books and other items. I am concerned about the finish. I hope it will stay the same. The veneer can easily scratch.", 
    "Love this books shelf. Is sturdy and looks great in my spare room. Hold lots of things and keeps everything looking neat.", 
    "It was easy to put together and served the purpose for what I wanted to use it for.", 
    "I was impressed with the finish of the wood. It is a better quality than what I have been purchasing for bookshelves/bookcase. It kinda match the color of my other bookshelf which is good for me. I just wonder about the durability.", 
    "I had been looking for a bigger than average book case, and this one is that and more! It is taller than I thought which I am delighted with, and it is wide enough for books, nick knacks, and anything else you can think of! I am really happy with the color wood I chose, all the tools and screws were there, it wasn't hard at all to assemble, and it looks good! I am really happy with my purchase.", 
    "I was satisfied with the quality and features of this bookcase and it only took 20 minutes to put it together.", 
    "Exactly as promised. Suits our purpose precisely. Recommend to all with books and chachkas.", 
    "Waiting for replacement product to be delivered. I can rewrite a review once I have the final product and have assembled it.", 
    "my only issue was the lack of hardware for this product"
