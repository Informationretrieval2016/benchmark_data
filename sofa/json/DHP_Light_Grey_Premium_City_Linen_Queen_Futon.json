    "This is the most uncomfortable couch/futon EVER! Hard as a rock. I am surprised that Overstock would carry such a low quality piece. When it was delivered the workers took a long time to put it together, it was stained in 3 places and what is worse is I can't even return it to get full credit because it's out of the box and fully assembled. I would only get partial credit. It's the worst. Now I don't know what to do with it."
