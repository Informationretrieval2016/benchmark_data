    "I love this bench! It's the perfect size for the end of our bed. Doesn't stick out so far that I trip over it in the middle of the night! We needed something our little dog could use as a stair and it's the perfect height for her too. Also good place to sit to put on shoes. And very nice to have the storage space", 
    "I got this ottoman to double as a coffee table in my man-cave. It's soft and comfortable enough to put your feet on but also firm enough to set a drink on without worrying about the drink tipping over. The storage space is nice too.", 
    "I was worried a bit about purchasing this online without feeling the texture, how thick the fabric is, etc. I have a new puppy and a toddler, so you can imagine how skeptical I am. I am very pleased with this product. Great quality! I love the look, looks expensive and makes the room feel warm and homey.", 
    "Was looking for a storage ottoman for a smaller spaced apartment. Came across this checked the measurements, and read the reviews. So happy with this product-it doesn't take up tons of space and has a deeper storage compartment than many others seemed to. We are using it in a spare bedroom to store bedding-but it's narrow and lightweight enough to relocate tot he living room for extra seating if needed. Quite satisfied with this purchase!!", 
    "I have so far been very pleased with it. It looks much more expensive than it was. Also, it comes fully assembled! All you have to do is take it out of the box. Mine arrived quickly with no damage from shipping. It looks really good, but is much closer to black than brown, especially in dim lighting.", 
    "I needed something to help my old arthritic dog get up and down off my bed but didn't want to buy ugly dog steps. This bench is a little bit slippery but she has gotten used to it and has had no problems. It looks very nice and I am happy to have the extra storage inside. The lid lifts off rather than being hinged but it stays in place just fine.", 
    "This bench is the right size and color for my new leather couch. It doesn't take up too much room and is versatile.", 
    "Perfect for storage and looks good too. Only wish is had a hinge to open it.", 
    "Got this to serve as a coffee table/footrest/storage for games, and it does all very nicely! Good quality material. I have some books I keep on the top which I then use to set my wine glass on. Perfect!", 
    "I had been looking for quite some time for an ottoman. This fit the bill! Excellent quality, excellent delivery and shipping service! You can even turn the lid over and use as a table. Would buy from Overstock again. Great service!", 
    "I'm very pleased with this bench. It arrived with a tear in the box, but the item was packaged well so there was no damage. The lid fits snugly, but drops easily into place, so it's not difficult to take on and off. The bench has some weight to it, so it stays where it's put, but can by moved fairly easily. There's more space inside than I expected. Would probably hold a queen size comforter, but I can't be sure because we use it to hold my husbands gym and work bags and other stuff that cluttered up his side of the bedroom. Seems to be well made. Looks more expensive than it was. Seams, etc. very well done. Fabric cover underneath is not high quality, but should hold up since it won't see wear.", 
    "Nice ottoman. It is a little darker than the picture, more of an espresso, but that is what I wanted. It is good quality for the price and the size is just right for a spot in front of our bay window.", 
    "Good bench for the price. You would pay the same price for a vinyl bench here locally so I was surprised to find this so reasonably priced and looks great at the foot of my bed.", 
    "It appears brown in only bright light. Those who are buying it for brown color beware, because it looks more towards black color in normal light. Otherwise, the product is as described on the site and is sturdy enough. Only thing I wish was if the storage space was a little deeper. It isn't because it's base is a little higher due to the length of the legs. Overall a good product and recommended.", 
    "Great for storage and doubles as seating. Attractive", 
    "I love this storage bench. Quality is great and durable,,,", 
    "I simply love my ottoman! Its roomy, beautiful design and very sturdy!! Well worth the investment! :)", 
    "Best piece of furniture bought so far. It matches my bedroom set perfectly. Also roomy for storage!!!! Happy customer.....", 
    "This was a good buy. Well made, nice looking. Nothing bad to say.", 
    "Works well at the end of the bed. An adequate amount of storage within and comfortable to sit on.", 
    "Smaller width than most but it was exactly what I needed for a small one bedroom apartment.", 
    "I am very pleased with this Storage Bench.. Not at all flimsy, like the first ones that I had...Hard , Heavy and you can't tell its Faux leather. Love It . I had mine for 3 years and it still looks brand new.", 
    "Very happy with this beautiful Storage Bench!", 
    "I like it, goes well with my furniture", 
    "good quality. have it for almost 3 years now. And still in good shape", 
    "Bought this storage bench for our family room, and to store our pictures album since we have so many, and we love it. We also use it for a center table, it looks like real leather. Have received many compliments!", 
    "I like the concept of a storage bench but wish I had bought a larger one. It looks like a dwarf in front of my couch. The bench is well constructed, just too small.", 
    "Wish it was a little bigger but stores enough. Wanted to be able to put bedspread on top at night when not using, but it just falls off. I should of taken time to measure. Great for sitting and putting shoes on.", 
    "I looked around and found this gem for a great price! Couldn't be happier", 
    "good storage and right color", 
    "Perfect for my entry way. Keeps shoes handy, came completely assesembled. I just wish the top was hinged.", 
    "Works for my needs. Beautiful storage display.", 
    "I ordered this my mistake, thought I was ordering a foot stool. When I unpacked it, I decided to keep it. The only problem is I wish it was slightly higher. Otherwise it works in my entry", 
    "Very nice bench, good storage. Fits perfectly in front of my French quarter bed.", 
    "I love my storage bench, I use to store some of my items, I have at foot of my bed. It said dark brown but look almost black. But that no problem for me. I also use to sit on but I small about 110 pounds.", 
    "serves nicely as a footstool, extra seating and storage in our family room.It is good looking and would definitely recommend to others.", 
    "This bench is well made and the fabric looks like real leather. Sewn nicely and well put together. This was the perfect length for the spot I needed and not too wide. Very happy.", 
    "fits perfectly under our entryway shelf", 
    "Well made, very sturdy Excellent for extra storage", 
    "fast delivery, looks great", 
    "im vey happy with this ottoman, looks great with my bed.", 
    "Excellent for the price. Sturdy and looks great!", 
    "Exactly as described. No problems. Would recommend to a friend.", 
    "This is the second time I've bought this same ottoman. The first sits at the foot of my bed, and this one sits in front of my sofa. They hold a lot of stuff and are the right height for sitting on to put on shoes, and exactly right for putting my feet up on.", 
    "This was smaller than I thought it was going to be. It had a strong odor when I first got it so I left it outside under covered patio for a week to out gas. It is probably good for a small apartment or kids room, but does not look like an expensive piece.", 
    "the bench was just as described. makes an excellent addition to the end of a twin bed and the size is great. the storage is ample and can store 2-3 blankets/quilts.", 
    "Great value for. The price. Nicely finished on the interior and solid in weight. It's size is just what we needed.", 
    "bought this item a couple months ago and still looks as good as new and it is a very functional piece!!", 
    "Small but nice would recommend if you need a really small unit", 
    "Looks and works great in family room", 
    "Great product hands down.", 
    "I like this bench as it fits perfectly in the area it was bought for and you can sit quite comfortably on it.", 
    "Buttons started coming off after a month", 
    "It was exactly what I was expecting. The size was perfect and the color was great.", 
    "This storage bench came already assembled and fit into the space it was purchased for. Check the dimensions carefully as it is small and sits low to the ground. The interior storage is minimal - it can hold a small lap blanket or two.", 
    "Fantastic ! Roomier than I thought, cover fits snugly ,very good looking, goes well with room--and it arrived early despite the terrible weather --I'm impressed!!", 
    "The ottoman is great. I have it at the foot of my bed and use it to store all of my purses. Very handy and also comfortable to sit on.", 
    "I finally got around to ordering this bench and it arrived very quickly and in perfect shape. We tucked this bench under a window & store some of our kids' smaller toys in it. It looks very nice, a dark brown color, just as described.Only problem is: STINKY! The odor inside is awful, like fish or something. And strong! If it were warm and sunny, I'd leave this bench outside to air out for a day or two. Instead, I've sprayed Lysol a couple of times and even put a car air freshener inside of it. Still stinky!!! I would definitely not put linens in this until the smell cleared out. But odors don't really permeate plastic toys, so we make it work.", 
    "We use this bench in the hall and it works perfect for us. It is well made and sits firm. Inside we have all our hats, scarves, gloves, etc. The brown color matches well with the wood floor. I would recommend this to a friend.", 
    "You will love it too!!! Great price great item!!!", 
    "I really like the size and color and quality, but the smell is very over powering. It smells like fish. My grand daughters came and spent the night and put their pillows and blankets in it and when itwas time for bed their pillows smelt like fish. I put a stickup air freshener inside and still stinky. I'm thinking and hoping after a few days or weeks that the smell will wears off. But all and all I really like this product.", 
    "Pay the money and get a real leather bench. Fine for my purposes, but if you're looking for something in leather, stick to the real thing. You get what you pay, and its exactly what I got.", 
    "The first one I got came damaged. The top was beyond repaid. However a call to Overstock and a helpful agent got another to me ASAP. The second one arrived in perfect condition. It makes a wonderful \"under the window\" seat. I can sit on it and watch the birds outside. For the money, you can't beat the looks and style.", 
    "Very happy with the product. The price was great and would recommend to friends", 
    "I thought I was getting a deal but lo and behold, no. I wish I had bought the one I saw at ********* or ***** for ***. This one was *** but it's SO snall and the lid is not attached. I had panned to keep the throw pillows in this but it's too small. I'm not really sure what I can store in it. It's kind of just lost in the room....", 
    "The size of this bench is smaller than usual (narrow and shorter), which is the reason I chose this bench. Consequently, I wouldn't purchase this bench if your main reason is for storage. The quality is very good and there is no interior smell when you open the cover. It looks great in our spare bedroom. My only complaint is the cover is NOT hinged. The description doesn't state that it is hinged; however, I assumed it would be. For the quality and look of this bench at such a low price, I would recommend this product.", 
    "Looks exactly like the picture. Came packaged nicely. It's beautiful! Love it!", 
    "I purchased this bench in September 2013 to store linens. The linens stored in the bench have an unpleasant odor. I do not recommend this storage bench to people intending to use it for linen storage.", 
    "Needed a bench to slide under a narrow table in a restricted walk space. Just as pictured and slides very easily into place when needed. The extra storage is always a bonus!", 
    "Very sturdy and nice looking. Holds lots of bed linens", 
    "Perfect for my living room, and matches my furniture. Love it!!", 
    "It came already assembled, which was great, only problem is that, it is too small, I thought it would of been bigger but that's okay. Plenty of storage room, I keep my curtains and some blankets but nothing too heavy.", 
    "this bench is a very nice piece of furniture. The storage is very large & useful", 
    "Well I planed to use this to store record albums in, but I could not find a dimension for the inside. Of course they did not fit the way I wanted them to. It worked fine for blanket storage though, so I kept it.Good product.", 
    "Nice-looking, pretty-good quality bench, particularly for this price. I am especially pleased with the look of the faux leather, the nicely-sewn, tight seams, and the sturdy feeling of the bench. I would recommend the bench to those looking for a small, rich-brown, faux leather bench. Two small issues to consider: As someone else had said, I'm not sure that the bottom of the bench would hold heavy objects, but it clearly can be filled with linens, blankets, towels, etc. Also, the inside does have a strong, new-car smell to it, so I've not yet put any linens into it. Instead, I have left the bench open for a few days and have sprayed the inside lightly with a fabric freshener. The smell seems to be lessening in strength, but I expect to leave the bench open for at least 7-10 days.", 
    "Wanted something smallish to that would not overwhelm my living room and this storage bench is just right. Color is true to image as shown. Arrived in perfect condition. And the price was great!", 
    "Just what I needed for my closet - a sturdy place to sit & put on my shoes & bonus storage too. The gray color is so pretty & it is soft & durable. Such a great find!", 
    "I love my bench. I got it for my dogs so they can jump onto my bed and it works great. The only thing I can say negative, was it was smaller than I anticipated, but I still love it. No regrets.", 
    "Quick delivery...popped out of box...no set up.Smaller than I would have liked but good enough for one persons shoes or 2 small or some blankets.Would be better with a hinged top but oh well.", 
    "We spent a lot of time looking at benches. Read the reviews and ordered this bench. We are so very pleased with the product - much better then expected. Well made and looks like it would cost a lot more. Perfect size for our spare bedroom. Love it!", 
    "Originally bought this for my daughters toys. Didn't realize the lid completely comes off. I thought it had a slow close lid. So now I use it at the bottom of my queen bed for our extra sheets. Which it fits 3 sets if folded queen sheets to give an idea of how big the inside in. Looks nice. Not heavy at all. I'd be afraid to put anything too heavy in it as it may come through the bottom. But overall it's great for the price and came within a 3-4 days from Cali to md. Would recommend.", 
    "I've seen a few others of these purchased by friends and this one is much better looking (i.e. looks like it is of a higher quality). Bonus points, it was also cheaper than theirs! An impressive amount of storage can go on in there, which is pretty great. All in all, great buy - you won't regret it!", 
    "It is a good addition for storing bed linens. blankets, as well as footstool for the sofa bed in our guest house.", 
    "Perfect good quality and perfect size. Works great to store blankets and sheets", 
    "Love the color and material, however, the Ottoman was not as deep as I had hoped.", 
    "The ottoman is made well and looks nice. The only downfall I have with it is the old one I had did have hinges inside the lid which made it nice when opening instead of the lid coming off like the new one I just purchased. It is just something I will have to get used to, other than that, I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I desired to replace a prior bench that was not as strong. This bench works perfectly next to the fireplace in our great room. A perfect bench for storage and additional seating. Perfect.", 
    "Got this as a \"step\" to help our corgi get up and down from our high bed. It is a compact size that worked well for us. So far it has held up reasonably well to the abuse of being used as a step; abuse can be harsh especially when we have guest dogs over and it sees a lot of stomping. Two of the three buttons popped off after a couple of months, but we were able to glue them down with Shoe Goo glue. Super value -- quality is great for the low price and it also stores our spare bed sheets (2 big sets, but not much room for anything else!).", 
    "This bench is awesome! Not only does it have storage for things that I had no space for, but I now have seating in my bedroom besides on my bed. I can put on my shoes without holding on to the wall or dresser... I am so pleased.", 
    "Arrived timely, very nice and high quality. Purchased to add more seating to the dining room table if needed", 
    "I really like this little bench! It's deep enough to store the extra throws we use in the winter to keep out the chill and even a few other items. The color is just right to go with our sofa. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "If you're short on cash and want a nice bench or something for the bedroom or livingroom, this is it. Even though isn't leather-like....not real leather, it's absolutely beautiful I have two.", 
    "This was a perfect fit for a dressing room area. I needed a place for extra blankets. No assembly required. Well packed. Instant gratification for less than $100.", 
    "Purchased this as a gift for my adult son, to go with a similar-colored bed frame (also purchased at Overstock.com.) He loves it & it matches perfectly. It's given him some nice looking, extra storage in his bedroom. Will be purchasing more items, as time permits, to help him furnish his new apartment...via Overstock. This site has a vast collection of items he needs, at affordable prices. (It's been a lot of fun having a \"Mom-Adult Son\" project to work on together : )", 
    "I was please with my leather storage bench, plus I didn;t have to do any thing was already assemble", 
    "This works great in my tiny den in front of the sofa. We useit for storing extra linens for the sofabed and it doubles as a waterproof coffee table. Great for small spaces.", 
    "I am very pleased with this storage bench. Very good quality and sturdy. I wanted a place to store my blankets and for extra seating when guest came over. I am very happy with my purchace because this bench is good for both of my needs.", 
    "Perfect size. Extra storage. Could be used in bedroom or living area. I am using this as an extra seat in living room and storing music that I frequently play. It is placed under a window and makes a nice \"window seat\"", 
    "I like it. I would not send it back.I keep sheet sets in it (Da) works great and the color is just right for my room.", 
    "This was a great purchase. It arrived undamaged on time. We found no defects at all. It looks great, and it is a good value.", 
    "This bench made my day. It's perfect to store throw-blankets in and I even have extra room for that fabric I don't know what to do with yet. My only complaint (if you can call it that), is that it is a little shorter than I expected. The site rounds up on the height by almost an inch and I'm still brainstorming on how to boost the height up a little under the feet. Otherwise, buy this. Buy two. Or three!", 
    "I needed a bench for the end of our bed in the master bedroom. Really did not want a storage bench because I love the look of benches with legs but saw this one and figured the feet would be prominent enough. The interior is not as small as some others described it but then I just have books in mine", 
    "Great quality bench and had good storage. I generally use it as a seating space at the entrance of my apartment but also serves as extra seating in the living room if required. Goes well with the overall brown theme in my living room and the leather couch.", 
    "loved this storage bench, we are very happy with this item", 
    "THIS PRODUCT IS USED IN A NARROW HALLWAY, AND SERVES THE PURPOSE WELL. I LIKE THE FACT THAT THE TOP CAN BE REMOVED COMPLETELY,BECAUSE IT CAN BE PLACED CLOSE TO THE WALL AND OPENED FROM THAT POSITION. IT APPEARS STURDY AND STORES A FAIR AMOUNT OF ITEMS FOR ITS SIZE.", 
    "Just the right size for my small room. Perfect place to hide things. Wish the top was hinged, however it does remove easily.", 
    "The product is beautiful with the exception of the buttons on top. Good additional storage piece but not to do a lot of sitting on due to the quality of the stitching. Unless the stitching was loose when I received it and I didn't notice, either way that's not good. The product is good but better without the buttons because is they become loose there is way to get to them without destroying the product due to the cushion :(", 
    "I used this at the foot of my bed. I like the storage inside when i lift the top off. I sit on it to put my socks and shoes on instead of sitting on the bed. Everyone love it when they see it.", 
    "This storage bench is a nice decorative accent piece to my upstairs hallway. It's nicely made and reasonably priced - so worth buying...", 
    "I'm glad I bought this product. It is just like the picture and it looks great.", 
    "WHILE SITTING @ DOCTORS OFFICE, I NOTICED A SIMILAR PRODUCT THERE. I HAD MY \"NEXUS\" WITH ME SO I DECIDED TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR. I FOUND IT ON LINE AND INMEDIATELLY ORDERED. I AM SO GLAD I DID. TO MY SURPRISE IT HAS A VERY RICH LOOK AND WE USE IT TO STORE OUR BLANKETS AND SIT ON IT TO PUT ON OUR SHOES. GREAT BUY!", 
    "Looks great in my hall way to sit on and store all my dogs stuff in. Ferfect for my needs", 
    "Excellent, everything was like in the picture, very well package and delivery in time, I recommend this product to everybody who want to buy.", 
    "The quality was very good for the price and it was already assembled. I was able to fit 2 comforters in the storage space. I really like it.", 
    "I am very happy with this purchase. The look and feel seems like leather. This bench is well made, the material is quite soft and looks like a high end storage bench. This was a very nice addition to my bedroom and it compliments the rest of my decor nicely. Plenty of storage in this bench which is also quite verstile as it can be placed in any room of your home. Nice value for the money.", 
    "Really nice, high quality, thought it was real leather! Delivered right to my door! Love it!", 
    "I purchased this bench for a place to store hats and gloves and to sit on while changing shoes and boots. I put it just inside my front entrance and it looks more expensive that what it is. It looks like leather. I really have been highly satisfied with this bench and would definitely recommend it to other buyers. It could be used with either traditional furnishings or contemporary.", 
    "So far we are very happy with the bench. Reasonably good quality and exactly what we were looking for.", 
    "Nice bench. I am very happy with the quality and description was perfect.", 
    "love the storage bench, and the price is good. it is bit soft on top, so it is comfortable. also, you can flip the lid and use it to place smaller plates or cups on it.", 
    "This was packed nicely and looks great in my guest bedroom.", 
    "Comes all in one piece.... idea to store blankets.... went under the sofa table which is dead space....So this was perfect very happy.", 
    "Perfect size looks good and keeps my room well organized. The inside is a good space..I used it to store all the items around the room we need but had laying around. Adds fashion to my room.", 
    "I am very happy with the item. It is exactly what I hoped for when I ordered it. It is nice and roomy for storage. I wanted something to prop my feet on when I'm reading and this is comfortable and fits the bill exactly. It is good quality and the price fit my budget. I'm very happy with this purchase.", 
    "We ordered two of these storage boxes to use as corner seating with a family game table. The shipment was received quickly and they were packaged well. No damage at all. There is no assembly needed. Removed from boxes and put to use! The benches have functioned well for game and puzzle storage, with easy access. They feel solid to sit on and can comfortably accommodate 2 adults or 3 children on each bench. We love them and they look really nice in our family room!", 
    "We are very satisfied with the purchase of this bench and would recommend it to others.", 
    "Just the right size and very comfortable to sit on. So heavy, I had the UPS man carry it in for me. But WARNING. if you have a cat, do not leave the lid off. Once she got into it, she did not want to come out. So bottom line my kitty loves it too! I'm telling my neighbors (condo) to come over and see my Overstock.com home. I shop this website most of the time.", 
    "The bench looks good and strong ,very good for the money.", 
    "This is a very nice addition to my new apartment. Needed something to store the bedding from my futon during the day, This is perfect for that purpose, and it looks great as well.", 
    "I purchased this ottoman to put at the end of my queen size bed to store blankets and pillows in. I was able to fit about 4 blankets (throw sized) in this and nothing else. I really like the sleek look and color but wish there was more storage space. The longer ottomans add a few inches in length but the depth seems the same. If you only have a few items that you wish to store or want to use it as a decorative piece then I highly recommend this product.", 
    "I am using two of these in my living room as \"ottomen\", and they match the dark brown leather of the couch and love seat very nicely. I am impressed by their solid nature. The tops are actually heavy! I weigh approximately 250 lbs., and they support my weight, seemingly with ease, when I sit on them. A nice amount of storage space inside. All in all, an excellent addition to my living room.", 
    "I had researched benches for months trying to find the right price, size, color and durability before deciding on this bench. It's a perfect piece for my entry way. It's used for guests to sit and remove or put on their shoes. It's beautifully made and it can also store a few items if needed. This item did not disappoint..", 
    "Good value storage bench. Looks like more expensive benches of this type.", 
    "This is an incredibly beautiful bench. (Who would have thought a person would get so excited about an ottoman or storage bench, right?) The quality seems really good - it is a solid, somewhat heavy piece. The lid fits really nicely, the leather is nice, and the seams are really nicely done. Also, the little legs are pretty good, too! It comes packed in a nice fabric-ish cover inside the box for protection, which was a nice touch. I don't have a lot of additional specifics except to say I am truly impressed with this piece, in a way I never expected to be for what I feel is a somewhat random piece of furniture! (I am using it for an ottoman, and I'm not saying an ottoman is random, but it is not something I would normally think to get excited about.) Worth way more than it sells for on Overstock, for sure. Really great purchase!!", 
    "This is worth the purchase. We bought a sectional that didn't come with an ottoman. We were using our wood table but it was too tall and our legs kept going to sleep. So, I searched and got this one.. we are so pleased. We have a place to store or blankets that we sometimes use to watch T.V with. This is great!", 
    "I bought this as a gift and was not expecting too much for the price (I purchased this bench for just under $*** shipped). I opened the box in my office and was surprised how nice the bench looked next to my more expensive furniture. It is a functional seat, but the padding is not very thick. I doubt anyone would buy a bench like this for prolonged sitting so comfort is moot. The bench is very light so I expect it will not last long enough to be a family heirloom, but it looks great. For this price, that is all I need it to do.", 
    "Storage bench was a gift and the recipients are very pleased. The bench is strong enough to sit on and blends well with dark leather furniture. The item was received within 9 days of purchase in excellent shape. Product was a good price for the quality of the item.", 
    "This piece is smaller then a typical ottoman but excellent for a front entry as it's not too wide. It would be great in front of a twin bed or anywhere you need a decorative place to store shoes. I love it and am very happy with the quality for the price.", 
    "Not sure if its actually \"leather\". Did not stand up well to the kitty test. Claws easily marked it just by being on it.", 
    "Storage bench is very sturdy. Looks good. Great for the price.", 
    "this is the perfect dimension to fit between the couch and the wall. well made, sturdy and fashionable. there are no pictures of the under side of the bench that can be flipped over to become a table with 3 in high guard rails around the perimeter.", 
    "These benches are very attractive. I placed two of them under the windows in my family room with a small table in between. They are sturdy, but not too heavy as to be immovable. My rating would have been excellent except the storage space isn't abundant. The interior is the perfect size for a tennis racket to lay flat on the bottom and about 14 inches deep. The lids are designed well and fit securely; there is no slipping around once they are in place. This product comes fully assembled.", 
    "I love this storage bench. I wish it was a little deeper.", 
    "Love this bench, it's exactly what I've been looking for. Enough room to hold linens for the guest room, a place to put a suitcase on or sit, and doesn't take up much room.", 
    "This storage bench just came yesterday (two days earlier than estimated) and it is gorgeous. I love that it was completely assembled, legs and all so all I had to do was taken it out of the box and instant gratification! It looks beautiful, very good quality and the size is perfect. I plan to use it as an ottoman/coffee table in my attic space. Free shipping, great price, no assembly - I am a happy camper.", 
    "When I receive I was wow by it. Nice bench and was all assembled. I don't have to do anything just unpacked it and use it. Perfect for the end of my bed. I would recommend it for the price.", 
    "I e-mailed customer service as soon as I got it to let them know that the lid was damaged. They sent me a new one within a week.",

This worked well for me, though, since I placed in the entrance room in my apartment. The only thing I wish for more is the storage. I guess it is the flip side of the fact that it is smaller than it appears, so I hoped it would have more storage as well.",

    "The only thing we needed to change was we put a hinge on the lid, safer with kids getting their things in and out of the bench. It was well worth the price, the hinge cost very little and I got a much nicer piece of furniture. O.co is excellent to work with. They sell better products for a reasonable cost."
