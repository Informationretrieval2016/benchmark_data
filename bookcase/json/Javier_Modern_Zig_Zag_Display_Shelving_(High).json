    "There aren\u0092t a whole lot of options when it comes to this style of bookshelf/room divider. You can order something made of real wood and pay 5x the price or you can order this. Just so you are aware this product is made of MDF it\u0092s similar in assembly procedure to most MDF furniture made by other brands such as Sauder, ClosetMaid, and the like. On the upside the MDF thickness of the shelves itself is far beyond anything I\u0092ve ever seen at a retail outlet such as Target, Home Depot, Lowes, Walmart, etc. One support is made of thin MDF which is about the same as your standard MDF furniture you can get at those locations but it is the small support. The product shipped quickly, and arrived at my home with minimal damage. There was a bit of a scuff on a few pieces, and one dent. But I assembled the product in a way where those would not be visible. The instructions weren\u0092t all that great, but if you\u0092ve ever assembled this type of furniture before you really shouldn\u0092t need them. I took my time assembling the shelves, and made sure to use some gorilla glue in the dowel locations (buy separately) because of other reviews that mentioned the shelves were unstable. The assembly procedure involved using a phillips screw driver to install the hardware by hand and then I tightened it via cordless electric screw driver to a torque of about 9. This resulted in a pretty darn stable bookshelf. There was no wobbling, and moving it by myself didn\u0092t cause things to crack or break like other reviewers have mentioned. On the downside of things the bookshelf laminate looks like it was poorly done. The laminate is actually visible on the corners where 2 pieces of laminate meet and it looks like it will age poorly. Additionally the hardware I received was missing a couple of pieces. And I\u0092m not a fan of how poorly the actual chrome bars between the shelves attached it was far too loose for my liking. For the price I think this shelf offers style & stability. For some additional cash like money for Gorilla Glue, white touch up paint (to fix any blemishes), and some wood epoxy (to tighten up the fit for the chrome bars) which shouldn\u0092t run you more than $15 you can have a pretty nice looking/sturdy shelf. If you want to go the extra mile you could spend a little more for some good paint and you\u0092d have something that looks and functions as good as the bookshelf that costs 5x more.", 
    "It looks pretty decent, but it has a major design element you should know about before you buy. The shelves aren't tall enough to accommodate 8.5''*11'' documents vertically. I have a bunch of binders and bound documents that I can't fit in the shelf unit in the normal orientation, so I have to lay them down. This isn't really a problem, unless it's a problem for you. I know if I had known about this limitation, I would have kept shopping. I didn't take off another star because it's not really the designer's fault- I bought before I did all the research I needed. But before you buy, make sure you know it has this limitation.Otherwise, the unit is made of very lightweight veneer panels. Rather than come off as cheap, it strikes me as a design feature to make my life easier.", 
    "Assembly was not complicated and took about 90 minutes. Once I attempted to move the item, however, screws ripped out of their sockets and dowels sheared off as the item snapped in half. Mind you, this was as 2 people were delicately attempting to position the item. Hopefully will be able to get refund. Stay away.", 
    "Overall very happy with the shelves, I purchased two. Liked the style and the overall look, looks great paired together in my living room. Assembly was easy, just takes a little time when you do it alone. Only suggestion I would have is to have all sides colored and no raw sides: when you put the shelves together some of them did not come exactly together so you can see the part of the would not colored, I had to go over with a black marker. There were some scratches on some pieces of the wood but it gave it some character. Overall pleased w/purchase", 
    "I had no problems with assembling or putting a lot of stuff (heavy books) on this bookshelf. It went together well, didn't come damaged at all (no scuffs, no dents, no nothing; it was perfect), and is very stable. We did end up using a nylon bracket to attach it to the wall since it does have those heavy books and is on our 2nd floor, but I have no qualms about the stability of the shelves. The only downside is that when we did drill into the top shelf, it felt like the middle material was foam, not MDF. Time will tell how this bookshelf fares, but so far, it's been absolutely perfect. Large, beautiful, and sturdy.", 
    "I've had this shelf for over a year now and it has held up well. Very modern look.", 
    "Ordered 2 Modern Zig Zag Shelving. Both items had numerous defects in from manufacturing. White painting is uneven on the shelves. Many chips noted on the pieces. Rough edges which shows the exposed pressed wood. Extreme bad quality for the price. While they look nice in the photos online, what you actually get is junk. The veneer is so paper think and that is why many defects are caused during the manufacturing. Think twice before ordering.", 
    "This bookcase exceeded expectation as far as the quality of the shelves. It would have rated Excellent if the support bars weren't so cheap looking. Very sturdy.", 
    "This shelving can't hold heavy stuffs, material is weak. It breaks easily.", 
    "exactly as shown!!! Very happy with the quality. Looks much more expensive than what we paid!", 
    "Honestly, I fell in love with this in the catalog, and I wasn't disappointed when it arrived. It's good quality, and it looks fantastic.I only have two minor complaints about this item. First, it should have probably come in two boxes instead of one. It was very difficult to get everything where itSecond, the individual shelves are not quite tall enough for all the books I want to put in them. As I said, really minor complaints.Aside from that, it's been good. It's attractive and solid, and I expect it to be good for some time to come.", 
    "The order came very quickly. The instructions were very clear but it did take some time to put together. It was hard to do by oneself because the entire bookcase is very tall and I had to stand on a couch to put the last shelf on (I had to build it vertically instead of horizontally because of the small amount of space I had in the living room). Other than that the piece is beautiful, the wood is pretty sturdy i just wouldn't shake the entire thing too much.", 
    "Assembled pretty easily and tons of great space available in my office now.", 
    "Purchased this on sale. Very worth it! I loved the style already, but wasn't willing to buy it full price. I got an email it went on sale and we went for it! Love the shelves. They are stylish looking. And don't look cheap. Only challenge is they Are very tall. We rigged a wall anchor as it didn't come with one.", 
    "As soon as someone sees it they ask me where I got it. It finished off my modern city loft decor.", 
    "the shelf has looks but every thing else is bad. The package came with some of the face panels chipping off, scratches and the wood is badly pressed. one can fell the shelf give by pressing the board hard.", 
    "awsome i have 2 of them great dvd cd holders", 
    "The shelf seems sturdy it looks beautiful what more can I say!", 
    "Like it very much. Looking good as room divider.", 
    "Designer bookcase at fraction of price", 
    "Have 1 of these, I love...very easy to assemble", 
    "Love this shelving unit. A little wobble when on carpet, otherwise would recommend it to any one.", 
    "Good for the price. The white one looks a little cheap up close, but much nicer than many I've seen for the same price. Interesting design, but still very functional. It's better than other randomly cut shelving designs that limit what you can do with it.", 
    "Was easy to assemble, but consists of many parts. It's now a gorgeous, sturdy fixture in my home.", 
    "We got his shelving unit in white color. it came as shown in pictures and was very easy to assemble. Very stylish piece for good value of money!", 
    "This product is great and looks good with my decor. It arrived fast and hassle free. Two of the panels were slightly dented when I opened the box but the damage wasn't enough to be plainly visible once I put it all together. My only complaint is that it could stand to be a little more sturdy but other than that I am pleased with the purchase.", 
    "looks great, fairly easy to build, lots of space... love it!", 
    "This is the perfect size. Allows so much usage of space. Modern look and great quality! Super deal!! Overstock comes through again!", 
    "This looks pricey and modern. It usually is a conversation piece. I'm so glad I made this purchase. I actually set it up by myself as it was superrrrr easy to put together!", 
    "Visually interesting. Solidly made. The open design sets off anything on the shelves.", 
    "Looks good! May be a little unsteady, needs additional re enforcement.", 
    "I love the design but this is not a sturdy piece. I have traveled around the world and have items that I want to display. This is not how I willl be using this display. Perhaps some light books or cheap items will be better to place on it. You get what you pay for.", 
    "I bought two of this for my family room. pretty easy to put together. great value.", 
    "I received my Shelving a couple of days ago and I am so pleased with it, It was easy to assemble. I had so many pictures I wanted to display and now I can. The wood color was perfect with the rest of my furniture. I am very pleased with everything, Thank you.", 
    "I love the high end look of these shelves. I'm always getting wonderful compliments on them. However they took about 3 hours to put together the first one. By the time I got to the second one I was a pro.", 
    "Nice looking, but not as stable as I would like", 
    "The photo looks much better than the actual product received. Not only were some of the shelves damaged, but when we called to get replacement parts, they sent us white boards. Really?? What on earth are we supposed to do with white boards for a black shelving unit? The shelves themselves are so cheaply made that even though the box was not damaged, they were and badly, not just a scratch or nick. Would have returned it if I didn't have to take it all apart again. Would not recommend", 
    "Beautiful, easy to assemble, somewhat fragile and requires to be stuck in the wall because it is very unstable . It should have bigger feet .", 
    "After reading other reviews I was a little skeptical as to how hared this would be to put together, but if it wasn't for the beer it would of only taken 45 minutes or so. And it is beautiful in my living room! Will be ordering another one to go side by side with this one as a room divider. I did notice that some of the poles were real tight on some levels and can spin on others, but didn't take away from sturdiness.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Note.... the distance in the height of the shelves will limit the frames you can use with an 8x10. The frames will need to be very narrow to fit on the shelves.", 
    "Love this shelf. Very slick and modern and wasn't hard to put together. I'm a 33 year old woman and I did it all by myself. Looks great as a room divider in my tiny NYC apartment", 
    "I was happy with this my purchase! Currently using to display our massive lego collection! Nice bookcase and fits well in my son's room.", 
    "These weren't too bad to assemble. they look nice and are pretty sturdy. we bought two - on for each side of our TV stand. Gives a nice balanced look.", 
    "These shelves give me the open contempory look but they are cheap looking.", 
    "I love this shelf, it was easy to put together and looks just like the image online.", 
    "easy to assemble but time consumingsome pieces had nicks - not well packedbut looks good", 
    "Great looking shelf easy to put together", 
    "The product is great, however due to the shipping one part had little damage but after assembly it didn\u00b4t show.", 
    "I was just so happy with Overstock's great service, and I think this bookshelf is lovely, but really, I just was happy with Overstock giving me a discount on this product and helping me get a replacement for a defective part.", 
    "For the price point the quality is quite good, though be prepared it is made of particle board. The assembly of both of these book case took my fiance and I approximately 2hrs and was very easy. We have put up over 200 books and our cat loves jumping of off the top of the bookcase onto our bed. For the price point this is a good quality, easy to assemble nice looking piece of furniture.", 
    "Love this piece great way to showcase my retail", 
    "very easy to assemble and looks modern and great", 
    "I purchased this for my office in white color, great quality and it looks awesome.", 
    "Fits well into my 1936 home!", 
    "I like the style but the product is cheap material, had a chipped area but it will do for now", 
    "I have given 3 stars because it definitely looks pretty. but honestly I cant put a lot of stuff and I feel this should have been cheaper then what I bought it for. but definitely a good interior peace :)", 
    "Hard to put together, the camlocks never fit correctly in the shelves. I went to put the bottom piece on and the whole thing broke in half. It is unsturdy now, but looks decent.", 
    "Everyone who's seen my new shelving just loves it. It was easy to construct and is sturdy enough to hold books and other knickknacks. My kitchen has a whole new look!", 
    "A little wobbly but the price was right.", 
    "great product. have the perfect place for it in our living room", 
    "First item got severely damaged in shipping. Overstock was great about handling it and sending a replacement. Second item arrived intact, but the construction quality is really poor, with the laminate peeling in multiple places around edges and corners. Build quality is notably worse than the Ikea book cases I've had in the past.Assembly was simple enough, although there was a nut missing (luckily, I was able to replace it from the package that came damaged). The bigger problem is that this piece shakes and is very unstable. I'm nervous putting anything on here that can slip and break if it falls.I would not recommend this to others and will eventually replace this.", 
    "ikea quality. but looks good. but not sturdy. good to buy", 
    "The shelve adds a decorative flair to my living room.", 
    "Great shelf and simple assembly", 
    "We purchased two in white and are very pleased. Nice contemporary look. Good quality for the price, but we did assemble using wood glue, which made it more solid.", 
    "Good for the price. Not a high quality piece of furniture but serves our purposes. Would probably not put heavy items on the top shelves", 
    "This \u00eatag\u00e8re is in my entryway. Everyone sees it upon entry and loves it. I really like the design and display space. It's not made of fine wood or the best materials, but it looks good. The assembly is fairly easy. I did it myself- a bit unwieldy but doable.", 
    "Served the purpose but not great quality...just okay", 
    "I love this shelf. It holds tons of books, easy to assemble, and it stylish.", 
    "If this is the design, color and height you are looking for then you will be very happy with this product. I'm using it as a room divider and I'm pleased at how it compliments the area. It is sturdy and easy to put together (follow instructions)", 
    "Designer picked it out. Great piece as a transition linking kitchen and dinning room", 
    "Once unpacked, this unit screams \"cheep\". The \"wood\" parts sound hollow, especially the side ones (vertical). The flat sides of the shelve parts (horizontal) cave in a bit, so at the right angle in the light you can see the cross in their internal construction. Two of the side parts had chips, which I managed to hide somewhat (hopefully). The hardware is also made of poor quality metal. The heads of the connecting screws kept breaking, so your screwdriver (manual) will skip. The same happened to some of the fastening disks (don't know how they're called correctly), the ones that tighten the parts together.We have this standing on hardwood floor, but it still needs to be fastened to the wall, otherwise it wiggles, and it's not safe, especially if you have kids running around.In the end, very good design (it does look nice from afar) poorly implemented.", 
    "This bookshelves is so cheap it is practically made of paper...glued on pressed board. It is the worst quality I have ever received of an item from overstock or any other company. It arrived with a crack in the bottom board. The screws are so cheap they don't fit any screw driver so they dethread as you try to screw them in and the paper peels off the board as you screw them in. It has taken all day to put together because the screws are so poor quality. What a disappointment. Now that it's almost built I'll keep it but I can see it will be falling apart shortly. A piece of junk.", 
    "We are redecorating our family room and changing general color and style. This shelf with the shorter, matching shelf units are nearly perfect for the new d\u00e9cor. The shelves are a little involved in putting them together. You will need plenty of floor space and it will help to have two people lift them to upright position. I put the shorter shelves together first, then the bigger shelf which made the taller shelf easier to assemble. There is no major trick to putting them together if you follow the instructions. The shelves provide an \"open\" appearance and will help a smaller room look bigger. The materials are well made, but the shelves are \"hollow\", not solid so beware if you are looking to put heavy items on them, they may not remain straight. One issue in assembly was lining up the supports to the shelves during assembly. I would first position the back support in the next shelf, tighten it only about half way, then the end \"rods\" and make sure I could rotate them in place (tat would assure they were placed correctly in their holes, and then the end supports. The shelves look great and work well for books, pictures, and decorations. I would recommend to the manufacturer they include one extra item of each small piece in case one is damaged or not included.", 
    "VERY easy to assemble and looks great!", 
    "Perfect for how I wanted to use them, I purchased two", 
    "Put it together by myself, instructions very clear and organized. The unit looks rich, and is extremely heavy. I have two criticisms, first I needed to use wedges underneath to prevent any wobbling. It's not going to fall but I prefer it sturdy and secondly I bought it predominently for plants, unfortunately I was concerned about the depth of the shelves and never gave a thought to height availability. It handles a lot of plants, however they have to be short, max of maybe 10\". I still like it and will keep it", 
    "I absolutely love this bookshelf and would buy more if I had the space for it. The design is great, it's very sleek and contemporary. As far as sturdiness, it is pretty sturdy but use caution when cleaning or moving it as it will sway a little. I have nothing but books & DVDs on mine as well as a few decorations. It can be a bit wobbly when moving it, so if you have to move it remove everything first so nothing breaks & have 2 people move it. It's also extremely easy to put together, I did this one and the small one myself & had them together in an hour. I would recommend this if your looking for this kind of bookshelf.", 
    "I wanted to clear off several items from my kitchen counters, and was looking at several kitchen islands. Due to my kitchen being so narrow, the island idea wouldn't have worked. I happened to find this shelving unit, and it fits perfectly. I absolutely love it, it's functional and was pretty easy to assemble.", 
    "It looks nice on Overstock website, but the quality is very poor. Looks cheap with low quality wood. Not recommended.", 
    "Love these bookshelves. I wanted something modern for our entryway sitting area/library. I ordered the ones in white, and I love the combination of white and the metal bars on the sides. We also bought 2, and side-by-side they almost look like 1 unit unless you look close, which I also love. The only possible downside is that you can't adjust the height of the shelves, but that's not a big deal to me. They were very easy to assemble and I love the finished look.", 
    "It is a cool look...the shelves are thin pressed board and not standard in size...so notebooks won't fit on them unless they lay down...ok for small objects but not good for office use", 
    "These are really handsome book shelves. A bit different from the usual plain book shelves, easy to put together although instructions could have been a bit clearer and bigger type. I bought two of them to go side-by-side and they really look nice together. I like the fact that the shelves are a bit thicker than any shelves I've bought before which makes them, along with the metal pole inserts, look like a more expensive unit. I was surprised how lightweight the whole thing was. I managed to put it together all by myself. Nothing was damaged at all upon receiving, was well packed and protected. I would recommend this shelving unit to anyone who wants a bit of a flare and style to their room. I don't think it works as a room divider though because of the way it is set up. I bought the espresso color and it's nearly black but goes well with my decor. Very happy with it and it's very roomy for all my books and nic-nacks.", 
    "This is a great Shelf, it's the perfect size and looks very modern. The overall construction of the item isn't that great, a lot of the pieces feel loose but overall the design is great, it's functional and the color is as well really nice.", 
    "Wow, this bookcase/shelf is gorgeous! Yes, it's mdf, but good mdf if that makes any sense. It was very, very easy to put together and I'm a girl and put it together all by myself. It's also huge! I didn't realize it was going to be such a substantial piece. It looks and fits perfectly in my modern living room. I love it so much!", 
    "The product arrived in a timely fashion - well packaged, no damage noted. Very easy to put together by myself - directions straightforward. Had it up in 20 minutes. Sturdy, stylish, depth of shelves good - provides a great deal of storage. Outstanding unit for the price.", 
    "This shelving shelving product was easy to assemble. Good instructions. Very good to look at.", 
    "After looking for a modern bookshelf on various sites I came across the Javier Modern Zig Zag Display Shelving on One Kings Lane and Overstock. Since the item was competitively priced I went with Overstock.When the product arrived I was shocked on how cheap it looked and to top it off multiple pieces were in rough shape, with scratches and cracks in the shelves so I had to call customer service to get replacement shelves. I had request 2 scratch replacements and 2 crack replacements, but when they finally arrived there were only two shelves. We just made due with the replacements and constructed the shelf to make sure the damaged pieces weren't in eyes sight. It'll make due until a nice sturdy modern wood bookcase comes along.", 
    "Okay, I knew the book shelf would be large, but not this large. Great value for the price. Very easy to assemble - I did it all by myself. Had to use a step ladder because of the height, but overall a very easy job. No missing pieces and it looks great in my living room.", 
    "Like the look. Very Modern. This unit does not seem stable at the top but it is fine as a book shelf. really like the way it looks in our room. Fairly easy to put together.", 
    "This bookshelf was exactly the shape and style I needed for my space, so I went ahead with the purchase. However, after quite some time with them, I've come to realize that they are so-so. The bookshelves are wobbly (we set them on carpet), so they must be secured to the wall studs with additional hardware and drilling holes into it. For the quality of the pieces you get and the hours it took to assemble them layer by layer, I think they are priced very high, They worked out in our space, but this is not a purchase I would make again. Bottom line: too expensive for what you get.", 
    "Same review as on the shorter shelf set. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a modern look or is in a small space. You get all the shelving you need but without the heavy look of a solid \"bookcase/shelving\" set. Can tip over easily so be careful if you are in earthquake country or have kids that could pull it over.", 
    "This is very stylish and easy to assemble if you follow the instructions. Made from chip board and laminate and had a few very minor dings when I pulled it from the carton. Luckily they were in the rear of the unit towards the wall. If I were to use this as a room separator I may have thought otherwise.", 
    "An incredibly beautiful and stylish piece for the money. Not difficult to assemble but time consuming. The result us worth the effort.", 
    "Love the modern look of the zig zag shelving. The shelves are covered on all sides with the beautiful white finish and the chrome polls look cool. Perfect for displaying some of my fancy glass sculptures. It is solidly built, almost heavy, I would assemble it in spot you want it to be. The price was great, seen smaller version on other website that cost more. Very pleased!", 
    "After seeing a zigzag shelf in a furniture catalog, we searched for it online and found this one. We like the look and number of shelves that can be used (six of them). Some review complained about the product quality, we still wanted to give it a try:-). This is our second order from overstock. The first one was cancelled by overstock so we have not tried overstock for a long time. The delivery was quick. However, we were missing a small part and have a minor chipped finish for one small part. The rest of the product looks good and seems to be easy to set up. We contacted overstock right away (10pm) without expecting an immediate answer. To our surprise, the customer service (online chat) was very helpful and responded quickly. She even followed up two days later. Now we are waiting for the replacement. We already like the customer service this time.", 
    "This is just a gorgeous and stylish way to show books and pictures. Very easy to assemble, less than an hour. The piece wobbles a bit when you touch it but I have leaded it with heavy books so it fine. Great value for the money, and with the usual fast shipping from Overstock. Another winner!", 
    "I Love this piece... It is a lot of parts but once you get a couple of the shelves together it goes fast, be careful pounding the little wooden things in it can split of chip the wood part. It is nice and tall and the look of the open back is super cute! Buy it you will not regret it, I love it and so does everyone else that sees it.", 
    "I received this item several weeks before I actually tried to assemble it. After I opened it, I found that it had defects that were not caused by shipping. There was a dent in one of the shelves (these are hollow), which I can hide by assembling it with that shelf on the bottom. I haven't yet tried to assemble it because I need help. When I received it, there were no assembly instructions. I emailed customer service and they sent me the instructions on line, so soon I will try to assemble this thing. It's a pretty item, but it has already frustrated me with the defects.", 
    "This product has a great design and looks good, but the quality is very average. You can tell it's not very sturdy. To give you an idea, the package that is delivered weighs only 65 lbs. If you think about it, It is very light in comparison to the overall size. Now at this price you can't really expect more, so I guess it does its job. It could be sold at Ikea, it's the exact same kind of products they have. Putting it together was really easy, it took me an hour with no help.", 
    "Very modern looking shelf unit, relatively easy to assemble (one person, 1 hour). Very good quality, all pieces are well marked and line up perfectly with the hardware. Shelf color is very dark, almost black espresso, with real metal end pieces. Overall sturdy, I recommend putting heavy items on the bottom shelves for more stability. Purchased for my son's room & holds lots of books (regular hardcover novels fit on the shelves nicely); he can also display his entire collection of star trek and star wars models. I would purchase another!", 
    "We are really happy with this shelf. It is very sturdy, of excellent quality and looks great in the new \"Man Cave\".", 
    "Kind of \"junky\" looking - no bargain for the price. Several pieces arrived damaged, but Overstock promptly replaced them.", 
    "Having read all the wonderful reviews, we had high expectation for this product. I would say the quality and install method is comparable to ikea furniture. It's not hard, but given the number of pieces, it did take two of us over an hour to put one together. And because the way is it constructed, it is not that sturdy, it wobbles if you shake it. It's a good looking piece of furniture, ikea like quality.", 
    "Daughter inlaw put this together in no titme - looks awesome and matches other furniture that I purchased. Love thwe wall unit and would purchase again.", 
    "The shelf looked great and was like the picture, the problem was it was too top heavy. I was afraid to use it! I feel if it were to get bumped lightly everything would fall off, it did not even stand straight. Good news is I turned it on its side and I am using it in entry way! It gives a very artistic feel and will hold a few vases this way. Even though I made it work somewhere I am dissapointed in this product, I purchased two and planning to return one.", 
    "Easy to put together, but not super sturdy. I mounted an L bracket to the top shelf and secured it to a stud in the wall for peace of mind. I have had tons of compliments on it.", 
    "This went together fairly easy; even leveling it out, it was still very unstable. I would not put anything heavy or breakable on it.", 
    "This does look great and fits well where I wanted it too. It was pretty easy to put together by myself and the directions were easy to follow; just make sure you tighten those key screws a second time before trying to stand it upright, but otherwise it seems pretty sturdy. The shelves are about 10.5 inches deep, just slightly taller than a hardback book. I would definitely purchase it again and recommend it to others.", 
    "Buy it! It looks very modern and it is good quality bookcase. Can't beat that!", 
    "I'm very pleased with this purchase. It looks great in my TV room. Holds lots of games, books, puzzles, TV paraphernalia, books, and decorating pieces. Very attractive, easy to assemble, and very good value. I've had compliments on room and the shelving. Keeps the room uncluttered in a fashionable way.", 
    "Great contemporary bookshelf option. We really enjoy how it. The only recommendation I have is to make sure that the height between the shelves is high enough for the things you would like to place on the shelves. We didn't think of that and a few items we were hoping to display on the shelves are too tall.", 
    "Didn't come with the right parts and had to send back", 
    "I bought two of these units. Each one had damaged pieces inside. The shelves are hollow so they are very flimsy. The unit is not very sturdy and will require bracing to the wall for safety. Can't really put heavy items on it and the shelves are very low. I plan to use it just for decorations (limited by the height of each shelf) and not much more. I like how it looks and don't want to go through the trouble of returning but I would not recommend these or buy them again.Now I'm waiting for the replacement of the damaged parts, which hopefully will come quickly."
