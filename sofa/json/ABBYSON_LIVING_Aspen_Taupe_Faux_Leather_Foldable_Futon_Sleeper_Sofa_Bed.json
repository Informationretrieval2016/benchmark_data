    "Exactly as pictured. Good quality. Highly recommend. We purchased this to use in our home office but wanted the option if a friend or co-worker ever needed to stay the night. Perfect for in a pinch but won't invite them to stay longer than necessary. Would definitely buy this again if we ever need to. My dogs are over 100 lbs and jump all over it and we haven't seen any scratches since we got it and have had it for several months now!", 
    "this is NOT LEATHER it looks like some had it delivered and returned it damaged and it was then sent to me. This is my first and last time making a purchase at Overstock.", 
    "I would give this 0 stars if I could. Threads were unraveling all over the whole sofa straight out of the box. There were holes all over as well. This is NOT leather! It's faux. Don't believe the description.", 
    "Assembly took some time as pre drilled screws had to be adjusted. At the end tho, the sofa fit together nicely...looks good. The hardness tho prevents it from being good sitting or sleeping space. Really disappointed in how badly it sits.", 
    "Nice a little low but looks great in my small space", 
    "well made and is modern looking in the room. great extra bed for visits.", 
    "Easy to put together. Nice Taupe color. There is not leather on the back as a previous review stated. It's fabric. Looks ok regardless.", 
    "These was an awesome couch for the price. It was super easy to assemble and looks great.", 
    "I'm very happy with this purchase! Great quality at a low price especially for real leather! Very easy to convert to a bed. My 6yr. Old can do it!", 
    "This is a great convertible sofa. The leather is great quality and it was so easy to assemble. It's a great addition to my family room. It's easy to convert to a bed, but the length is a bit short for a tall person. Good for an occasional overnight guest."
