    "Was pleasantly surprised when I saw this product. It was one of the easiest assemblies I have ever done and I was able to do it without any assistance. And the quality is good, it looks much more expensive than it was. I am ordering a second cabinet to use for other storage - I will remove a shelf ( shelves) and possibly store handbags and/ or boots.", 
    "The shoe cabinet holds up well. The color is dark espresso. Holds one shelf for my 3 year old son (8 pairs) another shelf for my 18 year old (3 pairs) and another shelf for my husband (3 pairs). The rest of the shelves are for me. Can't really hold boots even if you remove a shelf on the right side cabinet. The boots would have to be collapsed to fit at least 3 pairs. I do plan on buying a bench with shoe storage that Overstock also sells. My husband and I put it together, it wasn't hard and took probably an hour. I love the look of it and fits my decor. It sits in the hallway. If your looking for something more that just putting in shoes or sturdy as wood, this is not it. Ship was excellent, no damage and received within a week. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "Loving it classy shoe cabinet, really makes a room great piece.\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude01", 
    "Looks great, took a bit of work to put together though. I didn't put all the shelves in so I could use baskets to out odds and ends.", 
    "This shoe cabinet is a perfect size in my living room right by the front door. able to store 20~22 pair of my shoes ( woman's shoes ), but make sure you have somebody to help you when you assemble this!", 
    "I was very disappointed to open the box and see that the item was black and not grey. I guess they are calling \"Expresso\" black. Regardless, it's decent quality and it looks more expensive than it is, I'm just disappointed I have to spray paint it now.", 
    "The description of the cabinet is spot on. Nice espresso color, and very easy to put together. Decent amount of storage, and fit my budget.", 
    "Bought this because I need another shoe cabinet that I previously purchased at OS. It was out of stock and settled for this one. I guess that I didn't pay attention to the size. My other shoe rack was at least 12\" taller. Now what do I do with this one? \"IDEA\" it sits behind my couch in my great room next to the kitchen table and holds all my dishes for entertaining. Easy access and we use the top part as the table behind the couch. It does not hold shoes very well - unless you were a kid. Size 7 woman's is about all you would be able to put in, and not very well. No boots or high heels. The shelves are pretty low. The other shoe cabinet is perfect for me and will wait until they are back in stock. I think they should sell it as pictured, a side table. The quality was very nice and color true to picture. Easy to put together (but person who put together use to do that as a living) Very nice piece with multiple uses. I would recommend. (But not for shoe cabinet)", 
    "Very cheap material.... Feels like if I kick it it might fall apart... But it wasn't hard to assemble and serves its purpose! Just wish it would've been taller! The width was perfect for me!", 
    "Very easy to put together and looks great.", 
    "The slats have a tendency to come out, but they're easy to put back in. Otherwise, the cabinet seems solid and is an attractive storage piece.", 
    "I love this cabinet. It's great. I have had it for about 2 years and it works great. Some of the paint is chipping though.", 
    "This shoe cabinet is a perfect size in my front door.", 
    "Excellent choice for shoe storage easy to assemble with directions arrived in good condition love it.", 
    "arrived in good conditionassembly was fairly easyfor the price quality is okay MDF", 
    "I had been looking for a smallish shoe cabinet for my bedroom and came across this which is absolutely great, it has plenty of room and holds a lot of shoes", 
    "great shoe cabinet, very satisfied with the purchase", 
    "Putting this together took some time, a little tricky but once complete looks great for the price.", 
    "You can yse in the master room, entry way,kitchen or Livingroom!Looks Beautiful", 
    "Cabinet went together easily, just be sure to read the instructions as provided. I used gorilla glue at the seams for additional strength. One note, if you don't put shelves in place in the sequence shown you'll still be able to do so after final assembly - BUT it'll be a bit of a challenge. Suggest also that you tether your TV to the wall upon completion, as this is a fairly narrow cabinet and would be unsteady in a seismic event.", 
    "We just moved into a rental while we build a new house and not only is it much smaller than the house we came from, but there's no storage and the closets are tiny. These shoe cabinets have been a God send. They're very attractive and sturdy and hold plenty of pairs of shoes. We bought 3 of them! We stacked two of them by keeping the feet off of one and putting it on top of the other. It looks great. I really like Baxton's storage solutions.", 
    "Looks great but is disappointingly cheap in quality. Would have been satisfied if it cost under $$$. Instructions are lousy; and it DEFINITELY takes two people to assemble. I've purchased furniture from ****** that was of better quality and significantly lower price. Good luck!"
