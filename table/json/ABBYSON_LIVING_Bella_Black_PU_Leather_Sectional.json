    "But the material is sooo thin. The thinnest leather possible. My cat tore it apart within the first month. Maybe good if you have no pets.", 
    "Love this sofa. It fits perfectly in our home and looks very model!", 
    "I'm a fairly small person at 5'2, and this couch definitely feels small. Picture is misleading in that way. Cushions are a little stiff--could use some breaking in. I can probably fit 3 people max on this, sitting straight. It's a good option if you're trying to save some space, but it feels more like a futon. Probably needs to be complimented with a lounge chair.", 
    "This sectional is truly nice and perfect offering us a comfortable spot every evening while being together with the family. I always loved simple and elegant pieces with the modern look so I am sure this was the best decision.", 
    "its tiny, the picture is really misleading. the stuffing of the couch feels weird too. can not believe this costs this much money. DEF need to return it, hopefully it will not be a problem. putting it together was easy though, did not come damaged or anything. the back is really short. can barely fit two people on this thing. i'm 5'9 and my husband is 6'1, and this was way too tiny for us. uncomfortable and small."
