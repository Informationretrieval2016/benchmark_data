    "If you are considering this desk you have to accept that it's a ~$100 desk. It looks stylish and we've had it for about a week now. The desk arrived very neatly packed, however, we were missing 4 bolts and one of the glass tops had a small scratch (the glass tops are tempered which is good to know). The website for Altra Furniture is unwieldly and submitting a request for missing parts via their website is impossible. Also, I tried calling their customer service once but had to hang up after being on hold for 20 minutes. Once I finally got through to them they quickly took note of the missing and damaged parts and sent replacements promptly with no fuss whatsoever. Big plus in my book for that. The desk is not deep at all. Note the dimensions. Also each desk can take a maximum of 60 lbs and the bridge piece 30 lbs. I'm happy with this desk. We're outfitting a new home office and it looks great it in. I'm typing up this review on my laptop on it. It shakes slightly as a I type. All in all great value for what we paid. My wife, who criticizes my taste in furniture & that I prefer what is cheap vs what is attractive noted how nice the desk looked as well.", 
    "I was interested in getting a new desk for a computer that I was building. I've seen a couple of other similar glass/metal desks on Overstock, but this one is a massively great value for $***. When it arrived (pretty fast shipping too: three or four days delivery!), It was in good condition and nothing on the outside box was dented. I opened it up and took the pieces out, and everything was in perfect shape. Altra took the time to bubblewrap all the rods and encase the glass pieces in styrofoam, cardboard, and bubblewrap, great enhancing the safety factor. I took a few days to build it, but that was my fault, and this can be done in a few hours. The rods are named with letters as to point out which one faces which way, etc., a very helpful tool. The build itself was quite easy and pretty fun. Just be sure that if you build it away from its destination that you make sure you can carry it into; I had to take it apart a bit to carry it into a room. I've had the desk for about two weeks and it has been splendid. Things look nice on it, it fits into a corner of my room perfectly, and it feels very solid. the design is simple, but it's quite striking, really. There are a few cons though, but nothing out of the ordinary. The biggest problem I have with it is that it is a big fingerprint attracter. It's not too horrible, just clean it once a week or so and it should be fine. Glass desks in general attract fingerprints, but its a con for all glass desks in general, not just this one. In conclusion, I really like this desk and would suggest it in a heartbeat to anyone looking for a glass/metal desk. If you're using it for a computer, you can take out the curved rod in the corner of the desk to store your tower, and if you're not, it's still a great desk for anything else. Great value, and I am very pleased with the desk so far. Let's see how it fares for the next few years.", 
    "The altar glass l shape desk is just the right size and perfect for my needs .i highly recommend it", 
    "Very happy with this desk! The product was packaged well during shipping and there was no damage. The desk assembled perfectly in about 30 minutes, very easy assembly. The styling of the desk is great and it is even sturdier than expected. Happy to recommend this desk to others!", 
    "I couldn't afford an expensive desk and needed something to fit a tight corner. I figured I'd roll the dice on this one and have not been disappointed. It came on the day promised and every piece was present and marked for easy identification. Assembly was fairly easy and it took about 30 minutes. I have my iMac on it and it is sturdy enough for me to be comfortable with it. It's quite stylish! Very good value.", 
    "Purchased this for my home office. Very sleek and modern. Plenty of room on the desktop. I put it together by myself in under 2 hours. Excellent value, highly recommend.", 
    "Perfect for all the things that I do.", 
    "I work from and use dual monitors this offers the perfect amount of space. It is very sturdy and fits neatly in the corner. A great desk for the price!", 
    "They look beautiful. Our only complaints: 1) we couldn't get the corner pieces to lay exactly flat like the ell pieces 2) the label stickers came off easily, but left behind lots of glue 3) directions stated to not tighten certain bolts until fully assembled, but they were unreachable once fully assembled", 
    "Easy to put together , and I suckered at that kind of stuff, but I was able to do it", 
    "I have had this product for almost a year, and I would recommend this to anyone. Very easy to assemble and easy to clean.", 
    "looks good in her room. comes with lots of space for her computer and other things. easy to put together", 
    "It's a great desk and I love it. It was easy to put together.", 
    "The desk didn't come with instructions on how to put it together so I had to google instructions, but I figured it out :-) It took some time to put together and some of the parts didn't fit as well as I thought they would, but nothing a little brains and muscles couldn't figure out ;-) Once it was all put together, it fits perfectly in the corner of our office. The face of the desk is not very wide, but works perfectly for a minimalist look.", 
    "Great desk if you have the space for it.- Great price and good quality ... too many screw, take time to put it together...", 
    "This is a very nice desk. It's much narrower than I anticipated but that's my own fault. Otherwise we are very happy.", 
    "Great fit. Sturdy and easy to put together. The price was terrific too.", 
    "The instructions showed 2 pieces that were labeled different from the picture. Once I figured it out, I just reversed the mis-labeled pieces, and I got it assembled with no problem. The desk is beautiful and modern... Just what I was looking for!", 
    "As a college student, a desk is as necessary as the food in your fridge. Unfortunately this isn't something you can easily tuck into your dorm, but it is something that takes up little space in an apartment. Package came earlier than expected and was packed very neatly. Tempered glass was highly protected within stacks of Styrofoam and cardboard and everything was in perfect condition. \"Great experience, great buy, overstock.com\".", 
    "a little small, but we knew this, the dimension was listed.", 
    "Good desk, fits into corner perfectly.", 
    "this is a good value for the price. my 18 year old daughter assembled it herself quickly. good purchase", 
    "This arrived in perfect condition. It was packed ok (I can see where it could be packed better and how it may cause issues.) All the pieces were there and I put it together solo in right under an hour. The desk is relatively light weight and looks very good in my sun room. I have a large MAC and a pc on the desk and it leaves plenty of room. The instructions were easy to follow. All in all for under $*this is a nice piece.", 
    "super easy to put togetherlooks sleeklove my desk", 
    "Very easy to put together. Nice looking and very roomy.", 
    "This was missing supporting rods. The desk is not very deep but it works as it should, even without the rods. Supports my computer and more, but the assembly is not perfect. the 3 pieces are not exactly level.", 
    "VERY STUDY DESK. ASSEMBLY DIRECTIONS COULD BE MORE CLEAR.", 
    "the product arrive without a hitch or scratch. Assembly is simple. My teenage son had it working in 15 minutes. I went back to check and tighten. Tops don't align perfectly to frame. Be careful not to over tighten on assembly. Looks good functions very well.", 
    "I put this together by myself, so it isn't difficult. Just need to remember to not tighten all the connections, until after the glass tops go on. I like that it provides space, but doesn't feel like it takes up the entire room, the glass makes it appear to take up less space.", 
    "After i found it (ups delivered it to a house down the street) i was able to put it together in about 30 minutes. The instructions were short but very clear. They suggested 2 people for setup, but i was able to do it alone, using a wall and common sense.", 
    "you get what you pay for!! It is good for the price but not sturdy enough!!", 
    "Was shipped quickly and arrived in great condition. It is exactly what I needed for my small space. The instructions were limited (as is typical for these types of assembly packages), but it was pretty easy to assemble, none-the-less.", 
    "This desk really does add style without being too bulky. Sleek and professional looking. Modern feel. A good value for the price.", 
    "I really like this desk ! It has a lot room for all my paper and things ;I need to keep organized. It was a piece of cake to put together and the shipping was really fast."
