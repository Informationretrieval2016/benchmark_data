    "We added this table to our new kitchen at the very end of a renovation. All of the workers (who see lots of kitchens) loved it and asked where it was from. Since then, friends and family have admired it. One thing to note is that the surface of the table is not completely smooth but has a few indentations to enhance the industrial look. Great choice.", 
    "The color of the table is a little darker then what the picture shows but i still loved it. the only reason i didn't give it a 5 star is there was slight damage (or maybe just how it is made) to the table top. We didn't return because i didn't notice right away. but its not significant enough for me to worry about, the medal is just gaping from the table top a little and there is a small crack. But i am happy with my table.", 
    "The first table arrived with several chunks missing as the packing was not sufficient. Overstock has such great customer service. They promptly shipped me another table top a and I love it.",
