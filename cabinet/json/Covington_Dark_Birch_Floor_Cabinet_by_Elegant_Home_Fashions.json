    "We bought this to use as a hall table in a small NYC apartment entry. Mail goes on the top and we've used the cupboard on one side for our paper recycling bin so the junk mail goes right in rather than cluttering up the house. The drawer sticks a little, so we leave it open about a 1/4 inch since it's that last little bit that sticks the most. The shelves have a couple options for placement and are tall enough for full-sized cookbooks. It smelled pretty chemically the first few days so we had to leave the cupboard and drawer open to air it out- if you're sensitive you may want to let the pieces sit outside the house for a few days. I had no problem putting it together- maybe an hour with one person, would have been a bit less with 2. The directions were clear and the hardware came packaged in a bubble pack with everything clearly labeled. Once together it's nice and sturdy and has way more style than most things that you'd find at this price point. It would blend with a traditional or modern decor and I like that we could use it in other rooms as our needs change.", 
    "We orderd 2 to be used in our Place of Business Bathrooms. Keeping with the tradition of everything we ordered 1 came perfect and the other came with a defective part. One of the wood panels was drilled wrong so we needed to once again call customer support and order another correct part. The 1 that we are using is doing just what I need it to do.", 
    "This does the job but it is flimsy and one of the hinges has already lost it's post after barely any use. Does not take up a lot of room and provides a little storage which was the goal.", 
    "This cabinet is actually 26\" wide and 34.5\" tall so didn't work for the space I had in mind.", 
    "Item arrived with several small damages. No visible damage on outside of box. Beyond the damages the item is terrible quality. The pieces do not quite line up properly. The shleves have gaps and do not really fit in the main unit. The seem to be cut shorter than they should be. The drawer does not close properly. The front panel is a little to big and cut uneven. For this quality of furniture, I could have gone to the local 99cents plus type store and saved a few dollars. This is my first purchase from Overstock.com, guess I was expecting to much.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for. All holes pre-drilled allowing for easy construction.", 
    "Nice cabinet for bathroom storage. Pretty solid and door hinges and magnetic clasp work well. Relatively easy to assemble.", 
    "This stand is solid wood and is multimedia useful", 
    "Perfect cabinet for small spaces, easy to assemble, great \"mocha\" color. Absolutely love it!", 
    "This cabinet works very nicely in my hall bathroom. It provides the needed storage space for toilet paper and other bathroom products. It would be perfect if there were an accompanying glass top for shampoo bottles that may have moister on them.", 
    "Liked the color and the look of the cabinet. The rest, not so much. The floor under the cabinet was carpeted. You couldn't open the drawers without holding the cabinet in place. I eventually screwed it into the wall for stability.", 
    "Will not work in the space I had in our rv. Wish to return but is already assembled.", 
    "I am using this cabinet as a stand for my Popcorn machine...it works great for what I needed and I really do love it. Only problems are one of the edges had a slight split in the wood (nothing to cause me to send it back) and they really should have a nail hole or two on the back to keep the cardboard backing snug to the back, it slides in on the sides, bottom, and top but kind of bulges out in the middle when all is finished. (again no biggie I drilled to very small hole and added two finishing nails and it fixed it). over all its a nice sturdy cabinet", 
    "Easy assembly, very nice looking and functional for storage of many types", 
    "Beautiful, pretty simple to assemble, especially since my husband did it. Love it!", 
    "Horrible little cabinet. was a giant PITA to put together, and once completed, there are problems galore. The door doesnt fit quite right, and the drawer doesnt pull out all the way. I kept it because I was desperate, but I should have returned it. DONT BUY!", 
    "I love the look of this cabinet & I love the price. I put it in my kids bathroom and it looks really nice. It is quite wobbly. I would not recommend this because of how wobbly it is. We followed the directions when assembling it, which took a lot of time and its just wobbly.", 
    "This piece is just ok. It is not too stable, and we put it together well. I'm not sure if this piece will survive a move, but it works for what we needed it for and the small size is nice.", 
    "We use this cabinet in our bathroom and it is working out well there. The color is basically black. We found assembly to be quite difficult and time consuming, but would purchase this nice looking cabinet again at such a good price.", 
    "I read a lot of reviews that talked about the drawer not shutting all the way. I hesitated on buying it, but could not find anything else that compared. I decided I would deal with it not shutting all the way. I was thrilled when i got it all put together and my drawer closed and opened very easily. If your looking for a piece with open shelving and closed shelving this is a great piece. The only complaint I have is the shelves fit loosely and not snug, so u can see the silver shelf mounts a little. With my towels on first two shelves and a cloth bin on the bottom you don't notice, but without anything you do notice. It was delivered to me quickly in great shape. It is so dark it almost looks black. It looks great in our bathroom.", 
    "as with all assemble yourself product it has some challenges. some of the predrilled holes for the long connector screws came stripped, but you can also hammer the bolts in and they hold. Also the pegs that hold up the shelves fall out with any movement until you plae items on the shelves. Overall it came together quickly and easily and it looks beautiful.", 
    "Overstock is awesome! They took this horrible cabinet back with no charge to me. As soon as I started to put it together, I could tell it was of the worst quality. I've put loads of furniture together and have not seen anything this cheap. The cam locks and wooden dowels were even ridiculous. Once built, the drawer didn't even fit. The whole time I was piecing it together I kept thinking I should stop and put it back in the box and send it back - but I proceeded anyway hoping for the best in the end, thinking I could use it in a closet out of sight. Don't even waste your time. I wouldn't spent $20 on this crap!", 
    "The piece was easy to assemble. It fits perfectly in my bathroom as a side cabinet. The price was right. As others have said, the drawer sticks, but it is not unsightly to leave an 1/8 of an inch at the edge of the drawer. By doing this, the drawer sticks no more. Overall a good value. Shipped fast!", 
    "a nice little black cabinet. It is sturdy and well designed, I use it for a plant stand/cookbook/linen/bowl storage in my small kitchen. I spent about an hour putting it together and adjusting the drawer hardware. The hardware was already attached to the drawer and it was a little off on one side making it stick. I easily fixed this by loosening up the tight side and moving it downward a little. This is a good value.", 
    "This is not a bad cabinet, as mentioned in other reviews, the drawer requires two hands. Overall the piece is sturdy, but had it's flaws. Shelf flips off its pegs when I remove a basket without being careful.. Thankfully I am the only one that uses it. The best part is the door area, all works well there. Size was perfect for my need and am glad I got it, but probably not worth the $$.", 
    "Easy to put together. Very sturdy. Love the color. Measurements are true.", 
    "To anyone that needs a temporary cabinet this fit the bill.", 
    "Nice small cabinet. It fits perfectly in my office for some of the overflow. Actually, quite a bit more storage provided than you would think. After I unpacked and sorted the pieces, I called in the pro ( my dear husband). The directions were sufficient for him and he had it all together and set in place in about an hour. All the pieces/parts arrived with no damage and it looks great. Happy camper!! Thanks (again) OS!", 
    "This was a perfect piece for my bathroom for extra storage. Dark espresso color and it does have a chemical smell that faded in a couple of days. For the price, it was solid and pretty easy to put together. I did it myself in an hour or so. Wish the knobs were standard sizes as I would have changed them. The ones that come with it were ok. Nice value!", 
    "Simple to put together, has a good weight and is not flimsy. Only issue is the smell of the cabinet and drawer - very chemical-y but has dissipated over the past couple of weeks. A useful size cabinet and good quality for the money.", 
    "I was really impressed with this piece. It's storage is deceiving larger than it looks and also has the top for cute accents. Very pleased overall!", 
    "Wonderful piece except a few finger prints on the side panel, but, removable sturdy, easy to assemble (about 30 min. by following the instruction line drawing step by step). With this price range, i have no complain at all and i am actually very surprised and satisfied. Good buy!!!", 
    "Bought as a matching set with wall cabinet for a bathroom renovation. Love the look of this product. Fits with the mesh of traditional and contemporary that I am trying to accomplish in our bathroom. I gave it a 4 only because it had some minor imperfections in the finish, just a few scratches. Easy to assemble. Overall great product."
