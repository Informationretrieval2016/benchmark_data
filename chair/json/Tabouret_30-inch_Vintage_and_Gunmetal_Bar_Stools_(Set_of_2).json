  "reviews": [
    "This is a great product for an industrial type decor - we put them at an in-home bar with exposed pipes, brick, etc. The paint finish is not even which is part of what we love about them but wouldn't work well in a polished decor. The hole in the seat is great for easily lifting, and they stack well. Lightweight and easy enough to move around while being extremely sturdy. They're also surprisingly comfortable for a metal stool.", 
    "Customers should note that there are two different colors of this stool, Vintage (which is an antique brown color) and Gunmetal (which is natural steel-looking color). We bought the gunmetal color in this stool and are very pleased as it is an exact match for the Tabouret Gunmetal Dining Table that we had purchased. They also go very nicely with the Tabouret Gunmetal Chairs. The finish is natural steel color with a glossy clear coating on top. They seem to be well-made and durable, we feel that they are good quality for the price.", 
    "Ordered these stools to add some industrial/vintage flair to our kitchen. The stools are fair condition, don't really see them lasting years but for the price I can't complain & can easily change again when I grow tired of them. If your looking for designer stools, these are not for you. The colour is painted on & really takes away from the charm.", 
    "I know own 6 of these now", 
    "We love these because it fits in perfectly with our decor but you don't want to sit in them for too long. Not comfortable as I'm sure you can tell by the picture. Great quality however. I would buy them again.", 
    "These stools are a wonderful addition to the style of my kitchen. They add a fun, industrial feel to the space. They are the perfect height and while lightweight, are also incredibly sturdy. The color is a very nice gunmetal, offering a polished, but not shiny finish. love, love, love!", 
    "we bought these stools after being disappointed by the same model in \"Silver\" (had a cheap sparkly look to it). i was worried about the \"Gunmetal\" finish having the same issues but was very pleasantly surprised - these look fabulous with our counter and with Tolix stools retailing for much higher - cannot beat the price!", 
    "I really like these bar stools. They're kind of industrial but not too much so... more like a suburban interpretation of vintage industrial furniture than something a hipster would be into. It took me a while to figure out which was the \"vintage\" and which was the \"gunmetal.\" Turns out \"vintage\" is the more silvery one and \"gunmetal\" is the more bronze. I got the gunmetal. The finish doesn't look like it's been painted on, like I'd read in some of the reviews before I purchased, but it also doesn't look like the natural color of the metal. There are a few areas that look like they were buffed or sanded prior to applying the final surface finish, which enhance the industrial vibe a bit. If it matters, I think it was an artifact of the manufacturing process that they left a little rough to give it a vintage vibe as opposed to a \"distressing\" process where they took something perfect and tried to make it look old. They're lightweight but sturdy and they have a nifty little cutout in the seat that makes them easy to grab.", 
    "Finish and construction is fine. As others have written, my only gripe is that the color in the picture looks more like gunmetal / raw steel but the actual stools are more like bronze/copper. Still better than paying $270 for a single Tolix stool.", 
    "Bought four of these to use in my newly-updated kitchen at the breakfast bar. They arrived in perfect condition. We use them at least twice a day for breakfast and dinner. They are stylish, comfortable, and easily moved around. This was my first purchase from Overstock.com, and I was so happy with the experience that I have become a regular customer.", 
    "Very nice light weight but solid looking bar stools. The color turned out to be perfect for my use. They are a bronze color rather than aluminium like the counter height stools.", 
    "I really like the stools. Comfortable and easy to store. Perfect for where I wanted them to go. Only comment I have is the color is more brown and the website pictures seem to show them as more gray.", 
    "Great pieces at a great price. The stools are lightweight, yet very substancial. The color is a sort of patina metal, which gives term even more character. Love these!", 
    "These stools look great under our bar. Just \"vintage\" enough to go with our rustic industrial look.", 
    "Very nice. No problems with delivery. Good sturdy stools that will hold up with teenagers. lite enough to not scratch floors.", 
    "These stools are a very solid pick for the price! They are sturdy and sit well and none of the four I ordered wobbled. They shipped promptly and are a great addition to my kitchen bar.", 
    "There was an initial problem with the product. The manufacturer replaced the defective item. Shipping information from both Overstock.com and Dimensions could have been better.", 
    "I love these! They shipped so quickly, and for free! They looked even more beautiful than in pictures, and they were sturdy & well-made.", 
    "When they arrived, every box I ordered was busted, and one of the stools was dented. I kind of feel that this adds to the \"shabby chic industrial\" feeling I want so I may not even return it. This is NOT the powder-coated silver color, the \"vintage\" color is very cool, has a brownish, aged patina", 
    "Like most pictures, these are actually a rustic taupe color but they look great non-the-less. Nicely made and a great price! I have seen these same stools on other websites for 3x as much! Overstocks prices on everything is so much less than other websites although you may have to peruse awhile to find what you are looking for.", 
    "I was looking for backless bar stools that were different and clean in style...and I found them in these stools! They go great with my mid century decor! Way cool!!", 
    "Great buy and true to the picture. The gunmetal color was perfect for my rustic home!", 
    "These are my favorite ever, they are the best bang for the buck!! I use them in my home and restaurants and they hold up great!", 
    "Great looking and sturdy. Probably will purchase more", 
    "Great finish. Perfect height for our bar. Only complaint is how easily they show dust, but that's part of having darker furniture.", 
    "good color and sturdy I love them", 
    "Great shipping/packaging and stools! Perfect addition to my kitchen counter.", 
    "These are exactly as described. I love the weight of them. They are heavy (as they should be since they are metal) and the color is perfect. It isn't a painted on silver nits a real gunmetal.", 
    "Great product. Great packaging and shipping. The stools look really nice and are very functional.", 
    "These chairs are quite high so make sure to look at the measurements. I love the color and they are very sturdy. I would recommend them!", 
    "Ordered these for my son's kitchen bar and he really likes them. Sturdy, industiral look, modern. Feet are well cushioned. No assembly at all and shipped carefully.", 
    "We love these stools! They are very heavy and substantial. They are perfect for our business. They come in several sizes, so make sure you're ordering the proper height", 
    "Very nicely finished; gunmetal color is quite nice. Good stools for the price.", 
    "This product arrived in great condition, and fits the height of the bar - which I needed it to do. Only down side is that I wish I could purchase as a single, as I need 3 all together.", 
    "I purchased 4 stools. I am very pleased. They are sturdy and I love the color.", 
    "Good solid bar stools I rather go with these then the cheap wood kind. The wood after ia few months sometimes become shaky. Not to worry this is all metal and looks awesome fro the vintage modern look!", 
    "I bought 3 sets of these chairs (the vintage color) for the island in my kitchen. they are the perfect fit and are even tall enough to help me get some dishes down from the top shelf. Cute and functional!", 
    "I will continue to purchase these stools for our home because of the price and their style! The color is as promised. Great buy!", 
    "Very sturdy, with feet at bottom to prevent scratching your floors, perfect for counter height.", 
    "Looks great at my kitchen bar!", 
    "These look great in my bar at home. Not comfortable but I have yet to find a stool that is. These were a great by and would look great in any style home.", 
    "The finish on these stools oxidized to almost a rust. We bought 4 of them and they all did it. We live in Houston where it is humid but they shouldn't do this. Overstock offered no money back. We have theses exact stools with a color paint and they are fine. I wouldn't recommend the vintage finish.", 
    "Very sturdy and comfortable. Great color. Love the way they look in my new home.", 
    "I see these same stools everywhere, bars, restaurants, etc. and I am so happy to have them in my house. Super cool look durable and comfortable.", 
    "Love them!! Light; durable; and super cool looking/ placed little cushion circles on the feet as the rubber left rub marks on the stained concrete- just ordered two more!!", 
    "We added these to our outdoor bar. They are heavy duty, worth ever penny, and look exactly as they're pictured.", 
    "Love these and they look fab.", 
    "The vintage stools look amazing in our bar. A+++++", 
    "Great buy. We've been using for a year and they still look almost perfect. My son had a jeans button that did scratch the seat of one but otherwise they seem really tough and they are comfortable.", 
    "Very happy with finish and very sturdy.", 
    "great look with my modern rustic decor", 
    "Exactly what I expected. Good product, seems sturdy so far.", 
    "Love these bar stools. Perfect for our kitchen, industrial modern style. Solid and comfy!", 
    "These fit the bill and they were an amazing bargain price. I wanted three but they came in pairs. Four won't fit in my tiny apartment. But it's been great to sit on the island and visit as I cook.", 
    "Love these barstools. They are sturdy and bring a cool industrial feel to the room.", 
    "Love the look of the barstools and they are comfortable too!", 
    "The stools have a nice finish and work well in our home, which has a global/industrial style. The foot rungs are not very comfortable - they're pretty thin.", 
    "These are amazing. Solidly made and work well in a space with rustic or industrial design. We love them so far and they came packaged well and needed no assembly which is a plus.", 
    "Love the stools. Theyre so cute and very sturdy.", 
    "A little taller than I expected but no big deal. I love the polished gunmetal!! They are a great price too if you want some industrial looking, inexpensive barstools.", 
    "Transformed my side bar to a hip industrial vibe area. I bought 4. Super sturdy and great finish. Definitely a center piece.", 
    "Got them a few months ago, still holding up well and looking good", 
    "Great quality and comfortable. Highly recommend.", 
    "Stools are as described but came with scratches in the finish - looks like made that way rather than damage", 
    "These are perfect, sturdy, and ridiculously well made for the price. great value.", 
    "Great stools - true to color and sturdy. Real fast shipment too!", 
    "Such a great look and very sturdy. I needed a true 30 inch stool and these are perfect. I have a mix of metals in my kitchen, and these complement both antique tin and oil rubbed bronze.", 
    "Great price and good quality.", 
    "Very happy with stools. Color and design are exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "These are great, fit perfectly at the breakfast bar and match chairs at the nook table", 
    "I ordered these stools to match chairs that I purchased for the dining room. They are amazing and look great!", 
    "These look good at my breakfast bar. A hint of industrial with classic lines", 
    "Absolutely love them! I have 5 kids and we use them every day. They are very sturdy, my 4 &2 year old can climb up on them without tipping", 
    "Beautiful, great quality bar stools!", 
    "Used in our restaurant for over a year, no issues", 
    "These bar stools are strong and sturdy. Finish provide a coolModern industrial look!", 
    "perfect for our space. love that they are stackable", 
    "These stools look like the expensive ones you see on other sites, but cost a fraction of them. They arrived timely with no issues and we pre-assembled.", 
    "These are sturdy, don't tip easily and are easy to get on and off of. In addition, the color and finish is very forgiving, much like leather, even if a scratch or dent occurs, it just adds to their patina, unlike painted stools. These were actually the second set we bought (purchased the 24-inch ones first) and loved them so much we bought the 30-inch for a high bar we have.", 
    "A great pair of Vintage looking bar stools!Again, a great price!", 
    "Well packed, sturdy, very pleased with these inexpensive, functional bar stools...These stools fit under my kitchen counter, and hold up well with a 200 pound adult sitting on them...For the price, these stools are a great buy!", 
    "These are great stools. The finish is a little fakey, but not so much as to be disappointed.", 
    "I needed stools to use with a stainless steel kitchen industrial work table I purchased as an island for my studio. I was trying to go for an industrial-modern, loft like feeling.But the models on the page get really confusing as it's mixing the Vintage and the Gun Metal models. So I was really apprehensive about how the Gun Metal model color would look in real life as it's hard to tell by the pictures. Mixing both models together in the same page makes it extremely hard to tell the real difference even if you put the images side by side.So I was praying I'd like the Gun Metal color I purchased when I opened the box. I didn't want to have to return it and try another color (Metal i.e.)... And to be honest, to my surprise, I really... loved it!!!, The Gun Metal model looks like the real deal, as if it was made of galvanized steel, and although we know it's made of plastic, it fakes it extremely well. It's looking gorgeous and loft-modern-chic with my stainless counter. Although I just got it today, It also seems really sturdy so far although very light weight. For this price point, I could not ask for more.This was my first purchase with Overstock and I am also quite pleased by the response rate when questions arised, to top it all the delivery was extremely fast compared to the other big website.Overall, a great experience both with Overstock and with this manufacturer, highly recommended! I'm a new fan and plan to check both more often. The 4 star review is because, well, it's still not the real thing ;) but close enough. I should know, I work with Interior Design!", 
    "I'm very pleased with my new bar stools - they look very nice in my kitchen. Fast shipping!", 
    "We just needed two stools for our island and these two did the trick. They look great and the rubber feet saved us from having to stick on felt pads.", 
    "These are awesome and sturdy! I shopped around and these were the best quality at the best price.", 
    "Makes the kitchen feel very industrial. Sturdy but comfortable. Love em", 
    "I needed extra seating for our bar and game area in the basement. These industrial style stools are great. My only knock is the welding could be better. BUT they get the job done and the price was right.", 
    "The finish on the stools is already peeling. It is going to require a coat of paint or a cushion to hide the peeling paint.", 
    "Well Packed, well made, and the vintage color looks fantastic! Table, chairs and stools (all vintage) match perfectly!", 
    "Great stools, quite sturdy, and look authentic.", 
    "Good product but arrived dented:(", 
    "Arrived packaged well and no damage. They look great.", 
    "Great bar stools, great color and exactly what we were looking for. Arrived very quickly.", 
    "A nice addition to my painting studio. Comfy & sturdy!", 
    "inexpensive and very strong - great for our bakery!", 
    "Wobbly and impossible to get the legs straight", 
    "Very practical, you can stack them up if you need more room for say a last minute party, they are light weight, functional and easy on the eye.", 
    "I purchased these for use in a rental property. They are very sturdy and I believe they will withstand high usage. Nice color.", 
    "Due to limited storage space we needed stack-able bar stools to use with our folding high top tables. These stools are perfect. They are sturdy, and comfortable. We already have had friends borrow them. Guests commented that they are comfortable, and asked where did we get them..", 
    "As expected after reading reviews. Nice stools. Make sure you measure first, to get appropriate height (counter vs bar) for your space.", 
    "Exactly what we were looking for. Great sturdy quality!", 
    "Cool design that is exactly as pictured. non marking feet. great satin finish.", 
    "I couldn't believe that I found these stools on Overstock.com for so little a price. Love them!", 
    "I've had these chairs for a year now am still in love with these chairs! They are extremely durable and wipe up well. The finish works perfect in my home.", 
    "We saw these stools in a shop near home and decided we needed some for our own. Bought a pair, liked them and so we bought another pair. They are comfortable, fit in a under the bar when not in use, stack nicely too and don't wobble on our old floors. (That is very important to me.) The only thing I don't like is I now see Overstock ads on most any page I open on the internet - if you are so smart to know I checked them out then you should know I bought them, Enough with the ads!", 
    "Love these, look just like the designer ones, just as sturdy, with a handle it the top they are easy to move.mi have a lot of them, and sometimes I use them as tables or work benches by placing wood over two, so they are a great apartmemt living item. And I use them for everything.", 
    "I've been looking for counter stools for months\u0097from swap meets, to furniture stores, Etsy to Ebay\u0097these are by far the best bang for the buck. Not too \"antiqued\" so there's a worn finish underneath, but a nice clear coat on top, so there's no patina (rust) coming through or paint chipping like you'd find on an actual vintage piece. Love these. So much so, that I bought 3 sets of two to line my entire wrap-around kitchen counter. Would buy again.", 
    "These stools are solid and look nice. The stools are tall enough to be used with a bar, but not too tall to make dismounting them uncomfortable. I ahve no doubt these stools will last a long time.", 
    "Great stools at a great price. They work well for a higher than average counter top.", 
    "Great chairs for the price. Well made. I returned them for color and ordered another pair", 
    "For whatever reason, I thought the stool would be a more shiny distressed wear, but they are still quite styling.", 
    "Bought 16 of these over a year ago. I bought a few more several weeks ago. I can't tell the difference between the old and new. They are used all day every day by students who are hard on them. Excellent quality. They aren't the most beautiful stools on the planet, but they are amazing otherwise.", 
    "Love the style of these bar stools, they are perfect for a higher counter or bar. They look more industrial than ones I had previously found at places like Target. They came well packed and delivered within 5 days.", 
    "Have bought these chairs many times for different purposes in different colors. Indestructible and stylish.", 
    "I love these. I have them at the bar of my outdoor kitchen. I love the color and the price for two was very reasonable.", 
    "Love them. Just as pictured ....arrived very quickly.", 
    "I like these bar stools. I bought them for an outdoor bar so only time will tell how well they hold up to the sun and elements. Overall I'm pleased with the design and construction. My only criticism is that they are slightly more bronze/brown than I think the online picture shows. I was hoping they had a bit more industrial grey/silver to them but overall still a good looking bar stool.", 
    "Nice chairs! Right out of the box and ready to use. They are sturdy and very fashionable!!!", 
    "The bar stools are sturdy, and good value for the price. They were packaged very well, but one stool was scratched on top. I decided to keep it because they were for our lake house, and I have lots of grandsons. I expect scratches eventually anyway.:)", 
    "Shipped super fast, came in great condition, exactly what I was looking for! Good height, sturdy.", 
    "Very glad I bought those stools. They were exactly what I was looking for, the description is accurate. Quality is perfect, color is exactly as described. I am thoroughly happy of this purchase.", 
    "I searched several sites and stores before purchasing these bar stools. They were the best value that I found and loved that they could be shipped right to my door. They arrived in perfect condition...easily unpacked and slid them right into place at our breakfast bar. Love the vintage color and industrial look. I have received several compliments on how cool they look in my space. Color is pretty true to photos. Easy to clean.", 
    "These stools came well packaged, in perfect condition, and in a timely manner. The product itself is very stylish, light, stackable, and a gorgeous color. I'm very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I bought a set of these stools for my new apartment. I would love to own the Tolix originals, but at 1/5 the price, these had to do. They really can't compare to Tolix, though they provide the same look and feel and I will happily use these for a few years until I upgrade to the real ones. They arrived pretty true to the photos, though the color is a bit darker and warmer, leaning more towards copper. There really isn't much variation in the finish at all, so it looks a little cheap for that reason. They are nice and sturdy, and work great at my bar height table. I'm happy I purchased them! They're a little more comfortable than they look, too. I'm a designer and a bit of a furniture snob so I'm critical\u0097I think most purchasers would be quite pleased :)", 
    "They are exactly what we were looking for. We are going for rustic/industrial look for our kitchen knook and this is perfect. Very sturdy. The \"vintage\" color is brown with a very subtle touch of bronze, very much like the picture.", 
    "I really liked how these look, and structurally they're well made, but the finish is too easily scratched and marred.", 
    "Really great stools. i like them alot. i mean its a stool, so theres not much it cant do, it gets sit on. i keep mine outside, they work.", 
    "These are well priced, shipping is cheap and fast. Looks great with many different decor styles.", 
    "Great stool and exactly what was expected except for the color. Was expecting them to be a bit more antique/bronze but are much more of a solid color. Regardless a great item!", 
    "I was looking for industrial/rustic/vintage stools for my eclectic style kitchen in my 100 year old house. Something that would play nice with other elements but not steal the show. These are perfect, and the patina finish is just right. Not as stark as black and not as cold as stainless. I love that they are lightweight, and they are comfortable enough. The size is great, and I love that there are no moving parts to break.", 
    "These stools are great - very good quality for a great price! They are stackable which are perfect for my apartment. I'd highly recommend.", 
    "Bought 4 as a Christmas gift for my son. Wasn't sure he would like them but he loves them. The great feature of these stools is that they fit into almost any d\u00e9cor.....they are very comfortable and well made. Very pleased overall.", 
    "Love these! We are always getting compliments on our stools. My one and only complaint is a large rust \"smudge\" on the seat part of one of the stools. I suppose this is just part of the vintage distressed look, but it is a very noticeable imperfection.", 
    "interesting detail that make them look less 'mass-produced'. rubber feet to protect the floor, easy to stack to get out of the way, if necessary. would love to see someone create a modern cushion for this style of chair.", 
    "Look great on our patio. Hope they'll weather our winter rain and not rust.", 
    "Perfect. They can be lifted up and moved around the sports room. People put their beers on them, or just move them away from bar to sit by the pool table. They look great in a modern room and are very functional.", 
    "We purchased 6 of these for a long bar wrapped around our kitchen...our 3 kids love them...very sturdy and easy to hop on/off...best of all they are cool industrial chic but blend in perfectly with wood floors and granite countertops...the vintage finish is a brown/grey metallic with an aged look...sturdy bases they do not tip...easy to clean...great style for the price.", 
    "Nice stools for the price. Sturdy construction and they match the chairs I bought perfectly. Very pleased.", 
    "Not sure I completely liked them when I opened the package...didn't take long, tho. I love them. Unique, sturdy, rustic yet modern. Fit my decor and have received frequent compliments already.", 
    "Gorgeous, industrial style chairs that work well in our vintage industrial farmhouse kitchen. Beautiful, dark patina. I bought the matching dining chairs as well. Great look. Very stylish. Very well-made, and the price is ridiculously good.", 
    "They are more light weight than I expected. The color is brown and not gray as shown on the picture.", 
    "Great quality stools for an affordable price. Purchased for our office lunch eating area and everyone loves them. Highly recommended.", 
    "These bar stools were just what I wanted as I had been keeping my eye on them for quite some time but they were sold out. Unfortunately, the UPS folks dropped the box and taped it back up so I was leery about potential damage. The metal on one stool was coming apart and can cut someone so I have to return them. Just my luck that the delivery guys screwed up something I was looking forward to having!", 
    "Stools were as advertised and look great in my garage."
