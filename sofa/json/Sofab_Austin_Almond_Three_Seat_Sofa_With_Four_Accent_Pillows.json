    "Was surprised at how well this sofa was packaged. I put it together myself and was easy. The hard part was trying to get the two boxes in the house. Happy with purchase. (Pillows are very nice quality)", 
    "Almond couch. Easily assembles.", 
    "LOOKS GREAT-AND..easy to assemble.", 
    "Single female and assembled by myself. Sturdy and comfortable.", 
    "I wasn't sure about ordering this sofa, but I was pleasantly surprised. My husband is able to lay on it and has room left over (he's 6 feet tall) and it's fairly comfortable. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the cushions slip a bit. Otherwise, I consider this a great purchase!"
