    "A little work to put together, but looks very expensive and it a decent size.", 
    "exactly what you expect - sturdy and well made, fiberboard and wood composite but solid. Took about an hour to assemble. The door hinges are adjustable - a high quality bit of hardware - so you can make sure the doors hang perfectly. Overall nicely made for the price.", 
    "Attractive and very functional.... Was a little time consuming to put together, but all parts were there and instructions were good. Happy with piece, would buy again.", 
    "Very nice and stylish combination bookcase cabinet for the price! The adjustable shelves inside the cabinet and in the upper bookcase area provide great flexibility and the drawer and worksurface area combine to make it a very versatile piece.", 
    "easy to build, sturdy perfect for what i needed it in a small apt", 
    "This bookcase is just okay, although it is sturdy for an assemble-yourself piece. The veneer is actually more like textured formica and it's quite shiny, especially if you have it right under a light. The functionality of the piece is great, but it is very small. Pay close attention to the dimensions on this before you purchase.", 
    "nice addition to my office space. not too big, so it works well in a small room", 
    "I recently purchased this bookcase for my apartment and they look really good but they come with no instructions (I purchased two, figure if they were not in the first box they will be in the 2nd), the instructions are on their website but they should include them in the box. Also, some of the parts were not labeled so it made it harder to put together.", 
    "Just the assembling. It is easy but time consuming.", 
    "Very hard to put together. Not very sturdy. Would return if I had not spent 4 hours putting together. Came with some scratches and customer service gave me a discount."
