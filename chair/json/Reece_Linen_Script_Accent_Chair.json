    "It's a great accent piece and a sturdy chair. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Great price, great quality product. Added to my bedroom, looks wonderful", 
    "The chair is really cute. For the price it is pretty sturdy. I painted the legs an ivory color to blend with my decor.", 
    "Very easy to set up. However, one of the legs is shorter than the others once installed and the chair therefore wobbles. When you sit on it and apply weight, it's very hard to notice, so not a big deal. You get what you pay for, and we have received compliments on the chair from almost everyone that comes over to our apartment for the first time. Very cool piece.", 
    "Great accent piece. The chair sits well and was not hard to put together", 
    "Stylish chair. Love the fabric. I just wish the back of the chair was higher.", 
    "Great chair, easy to put together!", 
    "Like it thanks for sending me the correct one & letting me exchange. Looks great in one of the bedrooms.", 
    "I received my package in less that five days of my purchase. The chair was in tact and all the parts were there. I looks just like the picture! I have not put it together yet because its for when I move. When I do I will leave another review.", 
    "This chair was much smaller than I expected, not very sturdy, and extremely uncomfortable. I returned it.", 
    "A great chair to complement a black and white decor. The seat is comfortable and nicely padded. Simple to put together. The perfect accent chair for a corner nook."
