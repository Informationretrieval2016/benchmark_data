    "I ordered this because when you open our front door there would be lots of pairs of shoes just sitting there that never seemed to make it to a closet. A different pair would be worn the then they were added to the collection and it looked very messy. This cabinet has cleaned up our entryway quite nicely. I positioned it on the wall to the left of our front door and it really just looks like a piece of furniture and matches our decor very well. I am sure no one has any idea what is inside. It also made a great place for me to put a scentsy \"burner\". The only thing that I would suggest is to drill some holes in the back of it so it can breathe. Also put a box of baking soda inside. It's not that anyone in the house has horribly smelling feed, but when you put 20 pairs of shoes in a closed up space it is going to have some odor. Initially I was looking for something much shorter that was almost like a bench height, but then found this and thought it would be even better. Overall I am very happy with this and wish I would have purchased it 2 years ago!", 
    "i ordered two of these in the dark color based on previous reviews and i was not disappointed. they are just what i was looking for. i wear a size 9-19 women shoe and they ftr perfectlly on the shelves. however, i don't think these closets would work for a man size shoe as the depth is not enough to accomodate their sizes.", 
    "This is a very smart purchase. I have three kids and seems like they cannot comprehend the full responsiblity of organizing their belongings especially their shoes. I bought this so that they can have a central detailed organized storage for their shoes. Works out great! The shoe cabinet is very spacious and the ventilation is great with the full two panel doors...I suggest putting some baking soda in the bottom shelves to elimate those hard stubborn smell. The storage bins are great for socks and that's where I keep them. This is now close to my front door and helps out a lot of my shoe situation with the kids.", 
    "I had lost 8 shoes (always the right one for some reason) to puppy chewing and needed something that would hold my shoes and organize them. This product fit the bill perfectly and I ordered 2. They arrived within 3 days. The first one went together with a lot of reasoning and a bit of work and looked fantastic. The second was missing a few holes for the pegs. They are sturdy and hold more than I had anticipated. I was able to fit 27 pairs of shoes in one cabinet. Altogether one of the smartest items I've purchased!", 
    "I was a bit unsure about the required assembly when I placed my order. So I called Overstock and spoke to a representative prior to purchasing to get a copy of the instruction guide. Turned out it wasn't that bad. Wish they had written instructions, but it is really more about patience than anything. My wife and I both got it together within an hour and half, which I have to say, not half bad for two people that the only thing we ever put together is a nightstand three years ago. Nice stain color that is dark. The piece feels solid all the way around after assembly, taking into consideration that you put it together yourself. I have to say that the doors where the probably the difficult part to assemble, but keep in mind that there should be little play in the hinges, which you can tighten/loosen with an allen wrench as necessary to line up the doors properly. The top small drawers pulls are smooth and surprisingly roomy for the size. I really like the modern and simple look. The cabinet fits nicely at our entry way. The back is not finished, so you might want to put it against a wall. It is not a big deal for us. I am actually purchasing another one to put it in our bathroom for towels and other utilities storage. The package is big, so ask a friend to help. Good luck and have fun!", 
    "What an great way to store shoes. Especially if you have a small closet and don't want shoes all over the floor. It holds 25 pair of shoes and makes it easier to access them and se what you have. It took a couple hours to put together and really needs 2 people. The directions weren't too clear and we made a mistake once and had to correct it. It is a very heavy piece of furniture and looks really nice in the bedroom. It is tall enough that I can put my Jewelry box on top for easy access. I like the 2 drawers to store my socks so close to my shoes.", 
    "Assembly is a \"bear\"! The directions are pictures only with no hint of what is what or which way is up or down. Some illustrations are difficult to understand and decipher. I had to redo several parts as there was no key as to how to assemble. The screws, nails, etc. were excellently packaged in one long piece of plastic with each type of fastener in a separate compartment. The finished product is fine.", 
    "i bought this time for my bedroom- to hide away my shoes. Once i saw it i decided to put it by the entrance to my apartment. Putting it together took about 2 hours, with the help of my 7 year old ( so it was pretty easy to follow). The only negative thing to say would be that it needs the covers for the screws- but the other reviewers had stated so. So far, shoes are being kept nicely and my son is also using it to keep his backpack and his hats... i am very satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "I love my shoe cabinet!! it's exactly what I needed to keep myself neat and it keeps all my shoes in a very stylish and safe cabinet. My boyfriend put it together which didn't take him very long, which was great because I was very anxious to putting all my shoes inside so I can make room in my closet. I was able to fit a lot of my shoes inside, and the quality is awesome! Everything about this shoe cabinet is great, the fast shipping, all the room for my shoes, and the price and quality. Great stuff!", 
    "Although the box was super heavy, it was broken and dented, I was afraid the wood inside would be marred too; but this storage cabinet was packed with that in mind. They used sheets of pressed wood and styrofoam to protect the cabinet wood from the shipping process and I was pleased with that. The wood was intact. The instructions were easy to follow and it contained all the parts you needed in an orderly manner. I assembled it by myself and it looks good. I didn't wind up with extra pieces like the BBQ episode on the I Love Lucy show...heh, heh. :-D", 
    "The instructions weren't as clear as expected. Took a bit time to put together but in the end it was worth it. Great product. Fit all our shoes in. The top drawers turned out to be perferct for shoe creams, brushes, sun glases, etc... Looks neat and organized! Love it!!!", 
    "Love the new shoe cabinet!! Ive been wanting one to get my shoe collection under control! It was a great price so i went for it. I ordered it and within days it was at my house. Everything was well packed and had no problems putting together. I think for the price you really cant get much better. Im completely happy with the item.", 
    "Nice looking and good quality shoe storage which holds lot of shoes.", 
    "What a great decorative unit. Nice way to conceal allot of shoes. Cabinet holds true 24 pair of shoes. Plus 2 drawers for hosiery", 
    "I need another one!! I bought one recently and i am so happy with it i want to buy another one for my sons shoes. I put it together myself and it was time consuming but if i could do it anyone can...lol....very happy with the product!", 
    "I have been looking for a shoe cabinet for some time and I am so happy I found this one. It is perfect and has made me life so much easier now that I can actually see all my shoes. It holds more than 20 pairs as I could double up on sandals and flip flops. I would definitely recommend this product.", 
    "most of my mens size 12 shoes do not fit in this and i bought 2 of them and after putting them together i just kept them :(", 
    "Awesome shoe cabinet. Took me about an hour and a half to assemble and looks good.", 
    "I love this thing.....I love my shoes and I hate having to keep all my boxes to keep my shoes organized. I couldnt pass this product up once i seen the price. I received my order in no time and now using and loving my shoe cabinet!!!", 
    "Very easy to assemble. User friendly manual and Instructions. Not too heavy and perfect for your shoes. Keeps it clean from dust and makes everything just organized. Really a space saver and really a good buy.", 
    "Purchased 2 of this gorgeous shoe cabinet. As a women, you can't never have too many shoes and so that's is the reason I bought this wonderful cabinet for my wonderful shoes. My husband put it together, which didn't take him very long, I know because I was there watching. Anyways, incredible. Once my hubbs finished assembling my cabinet, I was so excited to store all my woderful shoes. It has so much room and incredible quality to consume so many pair of shoes. Very sturdy, and love the upper two strorage, that's where I store my jewelry, so multifunctional also. I love my shoe cabinets, and I know any women would love this.", 
    "This is a cool cabinet, for shoes!! I have so many pairs of shoes that I don't whre to store them. This cabinet just helps out a lot. Very nice to have. Assembling the item took me about an hour because I was off and on but I didn't have a hard time at all, pretty easy steps. Good quality, solid panles on each shelves which can carry a lot of shoes in each shelves. Did I mention, the price is great.", 
    "I like it because rather than putting my shoes at different place in the house, I'm able to place all of my shoes inside this cabinet. It's great! The cabinet was very affordable and the quality of each shelf that holds the shoes is pretty strong and solid. It fits about 30 and some shoes of mine that I've placed inside. Anyways, I'm very happy with my purchase, is great.", 
    "This shoe cabinet was exactly what I was looking for - simple, stylish, lots of storage space, reasonably priced and in a dark wood finish.It arrived quickly and was packed well in a double-box. The package was very large and heavy, and I was initially concerned that I wouldn't be able to put it together myself. (I'm a 46-year-old, 5'2\" woman.)As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, there are many pieces and parts to this cabinet.My advice is to:1) Read the instructions first.2) Sort out and organize all the wooden pieces in the order in which you would be putting the cabinet together. 3) The hardware came in a long strip of plastic packs, without labels. Using the inventory list in the instructions, I took a marker pen and marked out each hardware part on the strip before I started to assemble to cabinet. This made it easy for me to grab the right hardware as I progressed.4) If you don't have a flat soft surface to work on, save the two largest pieces of styrofoam from the packaging and lay your cabinet pieces on them as you work. This will prevent the finish on the cabinet from getting marked or scratched, especially when hammering the back of the cabinet.5) Be careful when working on the middle shelf, especially when putting this together on your own. I managed to crack/ chip the board on one side when I forced in the dowel. So only the other side of the shelf has a dowel. Fortunately, I was able to secure the middle shelf with screws (part of the assembly process). As for tools, all I used was 2 different sizes of Philips screwdriver and a hammer.Overall, this was not as easy assembly job, but definitely manageable with patience and planning, even for one person.And definitely worth the effort!!!", 
    "I haven't been able to find another shoe holder like this no matter where I look. I needed one with doors because I have a very nosy puppy. He hasn't been able to get inside yet, luckily. I was sick of buying shoe laces. There are some assembly issues, like a lot of the reviews point out, but if you're relatively handy, it's not that big of a deal. Love the style of it. It's a nice, heavy product too; doesn't feel cheap at all.", 
    "I'm very happy with my purchase online, especially I bought a furniture, very rarely that this kind of purchase arrives in good condition, but this one did. Packaging was to perfection because it arrived in perfect condtiion. Item is is great item for a storage for all my shoes, it's very sturdy which is what I need, and lots of room for so many pairs of my shoes. It also keeps all my shoes in one neat area where no more shoes can ever be lost. I'm very happy with my purchase, I highly recommend it.", 
    "Such a remarkable shoe cabinet, it fits majority of my loves (shoes). My boyfriend did set up the cabinet for me and it didn't take him pretty long. But for sho this cabinet is cool, good sturdy quality and, is perfect for all my loves. I love it!!", 
    "Jumped on this right when I saw. I've been looking for shoe storage for months and so when I saw this online, i jumped on it and bought 2. So great. It was even shipped to me in just a couple of days and the assembly part was fast and so great that a lot of my shoes fits inside both. I have a lot of shoes and this is perfect. It's of good quality and very sturdy shoe cabinet and the style is not bad at all. i like i like very much.", 
    "I now have room for my shoes that wouldn't fit on the shelf in my clothes closet. My bedroom is not neat without shoes lined up along the wall. The drawers now have things in them that I didn't have a place for in my triple dresser. I really have too many \"things\" and will soon give them to a group that gives them to abandoned/abused women who are going out into the work force. Thanks for providing the Cabinet for a good price that works with my Cherry wood bedroom suite. Jo A", 
    "It took a bit of doing because I was putting the cabinet all by myself, but once I had someone to help me it went quite smoothly. The parts were very well packed, nothing chipped or missing. It is good looking, the drawers work well, and there is enough space to put 20 pairs of women's shoes. Good looking shoe cabinet for a good price!", 
    "This was perfect for the spot I wanted to put it in. Easy to assemble and just right for the shoes I needed to put into it.", 
    "A very sharp looking rich dark espresso color shoe cabinet. footnote: it IS made in china so, instead of being able to fit 5 pairs of shoes per shelf i can only fit 4 pairs all positioned at an angle so the doors close. I wear a 10 - 11 size shoe and our china-brotheren average shoe size is probably like a 7! So it wasnt designed with too much depth but it def makes up for it in efficiency and style. I assembled myself and took 2-1/2hrs...do not get overwhelmed by the amount of pieces/wood/screws etc....follow the instructions step by step at a slow pace and you'll get there! The 2 drawers on top are perfect too. Highly recommend this product especially at its price.", 
    "The product is a kit - assembly required. I was initially overwhelmed by the number of parts and hardware included. The instructions in fact, warn the buyer about becoming overwhelmed! If you do EXACTLY what the instructions recommend, and fully lay out and label each part prior to assembly, you'll be fine. I assembled 3 of these cabinets. The first one took me half a day! After the first one, my time was much faster, and I must say, I'm very proud of the finished product. They are sleek and contemporary and have a nice finished look. Just be patient and have great lighting and space for assembly!", 
    "This is one of the best cabinet that I have ever bought online. It's a very good cabinet for all my shoes. Easy to mainatian, I just use pledge. Assembling the item didn't take very long and no troubles at all. A very sturdy, and good quality shoe cabinet. Very affordable, and the style and quality is very classy. I like it very much, I would really recommend this to any woman or man out there, it's a good price and good investment for your shoes.", 
    "OVERALL, I'M HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE. ASSEMBLY WAS FAIRLY EASY, I USED EXTRA GLUE TO MAKE IT STRONGER. WHEN IT'S DONE, IT LOOKS LIKE A PRE-ASSEMBLED PIECE OF FURNITURE. THE SHELVES ARE ONLY DEEP ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE A MEN'S SIZE 10 SHOE. I HAD TO TURN MY SHOES IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO FIT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN AFFORDABLE SHOE STORAGE SOLUTION, THIS IS A VERY GOOD OPTION FOR YOU.", 
    "If you are tired of the family leaving multiple pairs of shoes in the foyer, this is a dream come true. I love that there are 5 sheleves which allows a shelf for each family member to limit the number of shoes near the entry way. The two drawers suit our purpose of a \"junk\" drawer. The drawers would have been nicer if they were on a track to slide out. The back of the cabinet did not allow any cutaway to place the unit flush against the wall, however a we took care of that with a jigsaw and file to cut a small groove on the back sides of the unit. The reviews and tips have been great, I was expecting holes to be misaligned, however the only issue I had was with the drawers, the back of the drawers seemed to be angled and misaligned, and the front of the drawer seemed to be positioned too high up allowing for a small unpainted gap at the bottom, which I just painted black so it is not noticeable. The box is quite heavy so place the box on a carpeted area near where you will assemble it. I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers by placing an odor absorbing air freshener inside the cabinet which appears to be helping with the consolidation of shoes. Overall I am extremely happywith the purchase and feel it was well worth the price and time to assemble. The package came extremely well packaged and I as others had received what appeared to be a damaged box, however the product was well packaged and the screws and other parts were extremely well organized. Instructions were very easy to follow. If your foyer needs some organization, this will solve your problems and will be your organizational dream!", 
    "So happy I decided to purchase this item. I was a litle worried because I really dont like buying stuff without seen it in person, but I wasnt disappointed. It was shipped fast, got it before the expected delivery date. The item was alittle time consuming to put together but well worth it. All my shoes fit perfectly and I love the fact that they all hidden and not all over the place.", 
    "I have 2 kids and lots of shoes. I was tired of the pile at the bottom of the stairs so I bought this after reading the reviews. It came well packaged and arrived quickly. It is very heavy so my husband helped carry it inside. I put the whole thing together in a hour. it looks great and all the pieces fit nicely. All the kids shoes fit and I can fit 5 pairs of mine on one row. My husband has size 12 feet so he can fit 2 pairs on the bottom shelf length wise. I knew this when I bought it. really great piece for the price, you wont be sorry.", 
    "This shoe cabinet turned out better than I expected. It went together fairly easily considering the instructions were pictures, but having done this many times before, it was better than poorly interpreted word instructions. It's sturdy and perfect for what I wanted it for....storing shoes! Love it!", 
    "I purchased this cabinet to go in our mud room to replace two cheesy metal racks that held our shoes. Pros: 1. The packing was incredible. Lots of foam and dividers to keep the pieces from getting damaged in shipment. 2. Although the construction is compressed fiberboard, the pieces are quite heavy and make a sturdy foundation. 3. The pieces fit together remarkably well for a \"build it yourself\" piece. 4. Price was fabulous; I had been considering a similar cabinet on Home Decorator's website that was twice the price! 5. I love that the shelves are optional and/or adjustable. My husband's tall work boots are on the bottom shelf and take up more height than if the shelves were evenly spaced. I was even able to make a skinny \"flip-flop\" shelf to allow more height space on other shelves. 6. I left off the doors and it looks fine. My husband wears a 12.5 size shoe and they are a little bit too long for the doors to close. You'd never know there were doors to it. Con: 1. Only one-some of the screws would not go in all the way, so there is a tiny amount of the head sticking over the top of the wood. It's not obvious. I was more concerned with stripping the screw and tearing up the wood instead of getting the screw heads perfectly flush with the surface.", 
    "This piece of furniture was so poorly constructed that once it was put together it was completely crooked. The screw holes were not placed even. Also the drawers just sit on a piece of wood inside loosely and crooked. There are no drawer guiders. If it wasn't such a pain to take this all apart again and try to puzzle it back in the box, I would return it! Love overstock.com for most things, but would not recommend buying furniture from them.", 
    "I really don't get why this shoe storage have such good reviews. In reality the quality of the cabinet is very low. The surface of particle boards scratches very easily even with no sharp objects. The whole cabinet doesn't seems to be long lasting. The worst part- the screws go through the side boards and aren't covered with decorative caps, which looks absolutely ugly and unprofessionally made. The size is good for accommodation of a lot of pairs of shoes if you don't have big feet.", 
    "I had this product for a year to hold all my kids shoes. It is a great size and storage for hats and gloves. But one day one of my kids might have leaned on the door slightly and the whole door broke off and chunk of particle board came off with the door. It is so cheaply made that it definitely was not worth the aggravation of putting it together.", 
    "Purchased based on good reviews. Should have thoroughly reviewed the bad reviews. Lost 133$ as it would cost too much to ship back. Poor craftmanship. Cheap material. Improperly drilled holes. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!", 
    "I wish I could return this product but I already spent hours putting it together and have thrown away the box. Very cheap product. I was sent two right drawers and one of the screws won't pop up like it should so I can't install the front door until I receive a replacement part. Lots of moving pieces. Instructions could have been written better. Will need brown marker or cover-up for parts of cabinet where expresso laminent pealing off. I would have been better off purchasing a cheap bookcase with shelves from Target or Kmart to put my shoes in. It would have been cheape and less work. I ended up putting this cabinet in my closet. I don't recommend item.", 
    "This product, as others have said, is a nightmare to assemble. Some pieces don't fit correctly or at all for that matter! The instructions and attempted diagrams are basically...less than useless. The frustration during assembly ( I have given up in the middle because I lack confidence it will get to completion without busting in on its self) is not even worth the supposed discount you think you are getting on the item. And forget sending it back, once it is out of the box and one attempts assembly there is NO WAY that it will find its way back into the humungous box...and good luck moving it into your car...weighs a frickin ton!!! Don't buy this product. Pay more and get better quality. Period.", 
    "This is a great piece. alittle time consuming to put together, but Im not to good at this kinda stuff anyways, Once together it looks great so it was worth it. Color was just what I expected. The item arrived fast and with no damaged pieces. Great buy.", 
    "The documentation that come with the package for assembling this item is a joke, it is very poor and misleading. The sides are not indicated properly therefore leading us to assemble incorrectly and then change again. The item is all medium density particle wood and the metal part covers the door handles and screws therefore there is literally no metal in the build. The product looks good once assembled but it may not sustain transportation after assembly because it is flimsy and frail. The holes for the screws do not align correctly therefore we the customer needs to do a bit of our own drilling. For the price it is just not worthy.", 
    "We ordered this for our foyer to fix the shoe pileup at the entrance. It's a handsome cabinet with enough shelves to accommodate several pairs of shoes. The drawers (upper storage bins) are a good touch. We use them to store children's socks. I added some customized hardware and it looks really great. Strongly recommend!", 
    "Now this was just bad quality, if you want to buy furniture that you need to assemble yourself and live close to an ikea just stick to it. I bought this because it fit my requirements and I couldn't find something similar anywhere else but on hind-sight I feel like I should have settled for whatever they had in ikea. There are unsightly scratches on doors, plus this was not very easy to assemble. The drawers don't slide in and out very well, I have to tug and push to get them open or put them back in place. I did not think this item was worth the price and would not recommend purchasing it.", 
    "I agree with other reviewers that the instructions could be a bit better, but it's a great shoe cupboard. Be aware of the size, it is large, but just what I wanted. The drawers are VERY handy.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet to organize the mess I had in my small entry hallway. Its a great piece of furniture and looks beautiful and is being extensively used for the purpose I bought it - shoe storage. It fits my husband's size 10 running shoes too! The assembly instructions could have been better. You have to be careful not to hook up the planks and boards the wrong way as not all surfaces are finished and you'll end up looking at a rough surface while the smooth faces the wall. Also, the polish of the wood scapes off easily.Except for that, good purchase.", 
    "We bought this for our walk-in closet instead of purchasing an ugly shoe caddy behind the door or hanging with our clothing. It looks really good, simulates an actual piece of furniture! Just keep in mind, it doesn't hold as many shoes as you'd think because it's not very deep (maybe 4 to 5 pairs per shelf for two people)- but if you need extra storage in an open room, this would work. The top drawers are a good size, we use those for jewelry, cufflinks, things that we need occasionally. It took my Hub about an hour to put it together - but we both moved it, it's pretty heavy.", 
    "My wife didn't know she needed this but after tripping over her shoes all the time I knew she needed this. She trully loves it, and is versatile on the size of the shoes you can store in it. also the two drawers are really handy for storing other small items. I think I need to get another one since she started buying more shoes.", 
    "It has all the room that I need for all my shoes, and to top it all the quality is great and the price is very cheap for a great quality cabinet. Easy to assemble and the shipping was quick and now I have a nice looking shoe cabinet. I really highly recommend it.", 
    "So nice to have a scattered shoes free environment! I'm so happy that I bought this save me type of shoe cabinet! It looks nice, easy to install, and and no more scattered shoes, thank goodness! The price is great and amazing quality, I've stores so many shoes in there, and it's very sturdy. Such great furniture.", 
    "The product is elegant looking and enough space for all my shoes and sandals and the upper one is very good for shoes. We have a two floor house, where I left it in the down stairs with all together, so I do not need to run to up and down for each time for socks. I would recommend this product to everyone, who is looking for a quality product. It is very easy to assemble and you can locate all the things in one place as I put all my winter wear together in one place.", 
    "After we opened the package, the piece that was placed on the top of the package, which is the part at the very bottom on the front of the cabinet, was broken. I was quite disappointed since I was very much looking forward to receiving this after I placed the order. We contacted customer service via live chat and we were offered a replacement which came a week later. Unfortunately the same exact piece came broken again. Once is bad luck, twice can't be just a coincidence. I began to question the overall quality of this product. We contacted customer service again and was able to return it with the free UPS shipping label they sent by email. This is the first time I purchased anything from Overstiock.com. Even though it didn't work out, I'm pleased with the way Overstock handled this. We received credit card refund in less than 3 weeks after we shipped it back.", 
    "I would NOT recommend this to anyone, often you get what you pay for this was not worth what I paid for it.", 
    "Have never ordered from this site before so I wasn't sure what to expect. Shipping was free, fast and item came well packaged. Item was larger than I expected and is of high quality. The design of the handles is very sleek and modern, shelves are sturdy. Doors are level and look very nice. No problems whatsoever. If you need a hallway or entryway shoe organizer this is a great one. Also great for kids because of the style of doors you can put a simple child lock on them and toddlers will no longer have shoes all over the house.", 
    "I need to get a new piece for the door as the one that they sent was broken during the assembly. I have no info on manufacturer. Need someone to contact!", 
    "Don't waste your time and money on this. I can't believe it has a 4.5 stars rating. Should be only 1 star if not less. We opened the box and was going to try to put together but immediately notice the panels were falling apart. All of the holes were oversized. My husband asked me how much i paid for it and i told him $*** so he was going to keep it anyway but the more we tried to put the pieces together the worst it got. Nothing line up. Material falling apart. Holes are crooked and misalign. I mean i can go on and on. We decided to take it apart and box it up. Got the return label from overstock for 2 week now and still haven't have time to bring the box to ups store.", 
    "I love this shoe shelf! Its attractive and easy to put together. The quality is ok for the price, thin wood and some things not lined up correctly, but overall ok. It holds a lot of shoes and blends in with the furniture we have nicely. no one knows there are shoes in there! I would recommend", 
    "Ok to use, but not wood but composite and gas scratches on it. Still ok to use.", 
    "I am actually pleased with the color of the cabinet, I chose Beech. It actually looks nicer in person than the picture. It's a large and spacious cabinet, but I wear 6.5 so no issues on that. My complaints: Horrible instructions, just pictures, so it's like putting a puzzle together. There was trial an error involved due to lack of specific written instructions. The drawers tilt forward when you open them as there are no runners/guiders. The only thing that stops them from falling out completely is a small wooden peg. I would have given this product 4 stars at least if it wasn't for the drawers. Aesthetically is really nice, but having a poor design for the drawers makes it look like really cheap product. I spent too much time assembling this, 5 hours, trying to figure out the pictures. I did it alone and I wish I had a power drill as that would have cut my time in half instead of using a regular screw driver. I wasn't aware how much assembly was required. I recommend using a power tool and a friend, the box weighs 105 lbs.", 
    "There are two top drawers that lack runners and are poorly built. The exterior appears alright but it doesn't look as if it could take any resistance.", 
    "Great shoe storage. Looks nice. Takes a little bit of time to build but overall a nice storage cabinet.", 
    "The cabinet came very quickly after I placed my order. It didnt take long to put together either. I love this peice, since I dont like clutter in my doorway, I use this for shoes. Its great. Keeps the place nice and tidy. It fits in my entry way next to my door. couldnt have chosen a better peice.", 
    "What a great idea ~ the reviews helped sell me on this product also. No one can guess what it is (maybe I should stop bragging about). It is stylish and so valuable for keeping the entrance neat and clean! Love it. Overstock does it again! You deliver on quality, uniqueness and design!", 
    "This product was horrible! Not only was the quality very poor, but the assembly instructions were impossible. It ended up going straight to the trash after hours of trying to put it together. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you simply enjoy throwing money out the window.", 
    "I read the description several times before I purchased, but I was still surprised at the high quality and the size of this item, It is a large piece of furniture. The quality is exemplified by the smooth finish and the strong doors and shelves. There is lots of room inside, and the two drawers are deep and very handy for storing misc. items (shoe trees, shoe inserts, shoe polish, remote controls, scissors, etc.). It took my nephew almost 2 hours to assemble by himself, and he is excellent at such things. The screws were provided in individual bubble packs, but were not labeled, so he first had to go through and match the screw packs to the appropriate piece of panel; there were approximately 10-12 packs of screws. This was very time consuming.", 
    "I was a little hesitant to purchase this cabinet but I needed something to organized our shoes downstairs and that would be easy enough for our kids to use as they're only 2 and 4 yrs old. The cabinet did take me four hours to put together. I am not very handy and did it all by myself. the instruction will only show pictures so make sure you organize all the parts and inventory it all to make the process easier. The quality of the product is amazing for what you pay. I do expect it to last for many years with minimal care. we put our cabinet in our foyer and it makes it easier for the kids to store their shoes as we come in the house. We have hardwood floors and I moved the cabinet about 4 feet without scratching the floors. Overall all, I am very satisfied with my purchase. Shipping was fast. the box is heavy and large but the UPS guy was kind enough to bring the box to the place where I was to assemble the cabinet.", 
    "This cabinet was so terrible I had to pack it up and send it back. The package came with screws that were either too large, too small, or not enough screws to complete the task. The directions were horrendous, they were so vague and difficult to understand. I have put so much furniture together before and never had this issue. The amount and correct type of hardware was not included, and the directions are ridiculous. Don't waste your money or time!", 
    "This shoes cabinet is practical and cool looking. The drawers on top are very handy too for mails and keys. Assembly doesn't take anymore time than any usual built it yourself furniture so no complaints on that department. Packaging was great too so no words there. Nope, can't think of anything I don't like about this shows cabinet.", 
    "All my shoes finally have a place to be stored in. Lots of room, very sturdy shelfs, and the price is a great bargain. Good quality furniture for the little price that I paid, and the style looks like a regular cabinet and not a shoe cabinet so II can put anywhere in my house. I would highly recommend this.", 
    "This is a decent cabinet for additional storage space. Shoes fit well in the unit. I was very disappointed with mounting the doors at the end of the assembly. The instructions are not at all clear that one of the plastic pieces that is inserted at the top of the door mount springs to allow depression for insertion into the fitting.", 
    "Great piece of furniture. Easy to follow assembly.", 
    "I used one of these in my entry way for all the extra shoes my four kids would leave everywhere. It really cleaned up the look of that area. The dark wood (almost black) is very beautiful and the silver knobs and handles add a cute contemporary feel... even though my home is filled with french country decor, it still looks good. I recently moved it from my entryway into my craft room as a cute way to hold all of the fabric that I had in plastic see through bins... much more decorative and definitely fits the need for me.", 
    "The cabinet's quality is very poor and easily dented or stained. It was not very easy to put it together, because the holes are not match and some of the nail holes are too deep to have the nails stay properly to hold the pieces.", 
    "I looked around for months and finally I came across this shoe cabinet. I love it! it's great, it has all the room that i need for my shoes. Easy to assemble and the quality is extremely better than I thought it would be.Great item for great price.", 
    "Pretty nice shoe cabinet, it has style and the quality is great. Very sturdy, lots of room, and the price is great. I aslo received it in just a couple of days, and assembly was easy and was quick to do.", 
    "I'm so glad I bought one of this shoe cabainet. It's great! Arrived so early, and it didn't take me very long to set it up and I like how I can fit so many pairs of shoes in each shelf inside. Very strong shoe cabinet and reliaable. It even looks great and it blends in very well with my bedroom set in my room. Plus I can use the top portion also for set up some of my stuff. I received a good deal on this cabinet because I've compared it to the one I saw in furniture store by my house. I really like this shoe cabinet, it's great.", 
    "The piece is great, just heavy and very time-consuming to put together. My boyfriend and I agreed that it was a good buy but that it needs better instructions, there were pieces everywhere! Afte we put it together though, we are very please with it. We both have about 10-12 shoes each and the top drawers really come in handy for our shoe polish and other things. Overall, I would recommend this product, just make sure to be patient when assembling it.", 
    "I have so much shoes that I needed to buy 3 of these, I wasn't sure if all will fit when I purchased it online. When it arrived, I had assembled one on the day I got it, which took about 40 mintues and the next day it only took me 45 minutes for the other two, easiest assembly that I've ever done. But I'm very happy with the storage space, it can fit majority of my shoes and now I'm planning to buy another for my future shoes that Im planning to buy. I like how the shoe cabinets are very thick in material for each shelves inside, which means it can handle all the weight for all my shoes. Wood or not, the quality is great and it's very sturdy.", 
    "I am very happy with this purchase. Plenty of storage space for my entire collection of over 30 pairs of shoes! The finish looks great in my apartment. It is also not so deep so it doesnt occupy alot of space in the doorway. The two top drawers are an added plus to put mail and other things which clutter the hallway. the colour is very rich and looks like a much more expensive piece than it acutally is. I am very happy. The only thing I would point out is that the drawers dont slide in and out as easily as i would have liked but I dont use them very regularly so this is not a big problem.", 
    "Arrived in the same week I bought it, and easy to assemble. The quality is great, and it has all the room for all my beautiful shoes that I need. Great buy for so little price.", 
    "this is a great product. It works great to hold all of my childrens shoes and keeps them organized!", 
    "strong and sturdy product. i can move it around and the kids just throw their shoes in and the cat likes to climb in sometimes, with no worries. it looked good out of the box, but i applied some wood oil and it really shines.", 
    "Very sturdy, easy set up, fits almost all my shoes (and I have lots of shoes), low price, and fast shipping! I highly recommend it.", 
    "I have a lot of shoes and i needed something fast and when I came across this shoe cabinet I bought two so I'm able to fit majority of my shoes. It arrived less than a week in great condition and the quality is great. It provided so much room for a lot of my shoes that and I'm thinking about buying another one since the price is great and I always always buy shoes so I would need extra room. So nice to have, it even looks nice in my room and I'm able to use the top compartment for other things. My shoe cabinets are splendid! I highly recommend it good price for great she cabinet with quality.", 
    "all these products you have to put together should also have instructions online. you can't tell from instructions which end is up or down. If I had it to do all over, I wouldn't have purchased it.", 
    "Great buy for all the room it provides.Easy to assemble shoe cabinet and very sturdy. Arrived quick and good condition w/ layers and layers of bubble type packaging.", 
    "it is vey good and suitable shoes storage .i like it also it took alot of shoes especialy the snackers of my kids and you can avoid the smell of the shoes by putting baking soda in the corner of the shelves the price is vey suitable for me i looked in many stores for shoes cabinet but they are very expensive .i recommended it for every one looking for shoes storage.", 
    "Ok, now that it's all together, the shoe cabinet is beautiful. However, putting it together was a huge pain. The instructions were awful. I had such high hopes too because the pieces are numbered (yah!) but I kept putting things backwards because they never said which way was up and which way was down!! It was the most annoying thing. Also, I loved that they put the different nails and screws in separate packets...but why not just label them then!?!? It's like they went half way! It was really an exhausting process and I LOVE building things too. I ended up using the wrong screws and having to redo a couple of things because the screws really looked like each other. All in all, it took my husband and me a few hours to put it together. However, this is not why I gave it an average score. I would have given it a higher score except that a couple of the holes were in the wrong places!! I can't believe that happened but yup, I wasn't able to put the little wood dowels into both right and left side because one hole was not in the right spot. We ended up just not putting the wood dowel in. Then, some of the screws didn't go in easily. Luckily, I had an electric screwdriver because I had to drill a hole through it. Ok, but the process is done. So what do I think? Well, it's a beautiful piece although there are areas that were scraped during travel (although they did an awesome job packing it for transport so maybe it wasn't transport but rather packing?) The scrapes were minor though and I'll just get a wood pen or something to try to cover them up, if I get motivated. I put all my shoes in and they were fantastic. Just a note...my husband has size 13 shoes. They don't fit straight in. However, I put the shoes in at a slight angle and I put one on top of the other and ended up being able to fit 4 on the row. That's not bad, in my mind. Even though I gave it an average score, I have to say that I would recommend it to a friend but I'd probably offer to help them build it now that I know what to look for! That way, my friends don't have to go through the frustration my husband and I went through. It is a really nice, seemingly sturdy piece, especially for the cost. And it really does the job...we've fit most of our shoes into the cabinet...my husband wasn't convinced we would be able to do that.", 
    "I bought this shoe cabinet for the entryway in my apartment. It looks nice and holds a lot of shoes. I like that the shelves can be moved just like a bookshelf. The drawers above are also nice for holding gloves and keys. I think the piece is of great quality considering the price. And it is neither too bulky nor too small like other shoe cabinets and entryway pieces. The is just the right depth. My one complaint is that the cabinet takes a few hours to build and requires more than a little patience. But the result is worth it.", 
    "I bought 2 cabinet to store shoes for family. They are looking OK. The only thing is you have to use many screws to screw all board together so all screws are on the suface. My husband said they are look like the project for high school kids. We assimbled some furniturs we bought befroe but never seen all of screws on the suface like those cabinets. It is very poor design.", 
    "I bought this item because I really needed a shoe cabinet and this item had 4.3/5 rating. I was fooled. The cons are: 1. This shoe cabinet is too expensive for the quality of material it is made of. 2. It is so easily scratched. 3. The instructions are horribly unclear and hence assembly is a huge pain. 4. The assemly is horrible also because some pieces don't quite fit together. Bad quality with such high price. 5.This shoe cabinet is very heavy, so if you are single like me and live alone moving the package once you get it is almost impossible. Pros: It looks nice and it is spacious. Perfect for a walking closet or even by the door. If I knew better I would not have bought this item, as there are similar items which are cheaper with the same quality.", 
    "I have ordered 100's of items from Overstock. Not once have I been unhappy with my purchase, until now. This item is not of good quality. It is made of particalwood/pressboard. It is somewhat heavy. I am most unhappy with the scratches, dings and overall differculty of assembling the storage cabinet. It can't be returned once it's uncrated/unwrapped. We went over the instructions , got the tools together and started to assemble, then we start to notice a ding here a scratch there etc. . The pieces did not fit properly. All the pieces seem to be just a bit off and had to be forced to fit. The two small drawers at the top are hard to open and close. I suppose you get what you pay for but in this case we didn't get our money's worth. I am very dissapointed with this purchase.", 
    "The product is nice, but it arrived Damaged. The box was wrapped in Bubble wrap. I had it shipped to my office. It weighed about 75 lbs. Once I got it home and opened it, I found the box in peices. Wood shavings and the like allover the place. The cabinet was scracthed and dented in several prominent places. It seemed the box was being held together by bubble wrap and tape. There was not enough of the box intact to even consider returning it. Plus the fact thet it weighed so much and was unweildy to handle, I decided to keep it. I assembled it, even though it comes with very vague instuctions. I am not at all happy with my experience. I know I could have tried to return it. But it would have been too painful given what I would have to do in secureing a new box and Lugging it down to the shipper. Shame on you Overstock.com!", 
    "Hard to follow instructions, the wood is not strong enough to hold the screws in place, very poor design and poor material. Do not buy.", 
    "Pro: FunctionalCon: Not fun to assemble (arrives w/ lots of pieces & poorly packaged); very cheap quality (came w/ scratches b/c of poor packaging and scratches very easily during assembly if not careful)Overall: Not worth the trouble & money.", 
    "Everything about this purchase was bad.I received a shipment which was completely damaged. When I complained I received a replacement, which was somewhat damaged too. But by that time I was bored and didn't want to return it again.Extremely difficult to assemble. Workmanship is bad,too. Moreover there were missing screws and bolts.All in all, extremely bad experience.I would strongly recommend against this product.", 
    "Sturdy, durable product. Looks great & very functional. Husband complained it took a bit of work to assemble but the end product is worth it!", 
    "Saw it online and looks nice, delivered without any damages. Looks decent when looking from the front. However, the fiberboard material used to make this product is the poorest quality I have ever seen. It easily crumbles. Like another persons review, upon close inspection, there were 2 panels that has a large scratch and it was covered up with a brush of paint similar to the finish but obvious. Instructions were no different from other self assembly furniture, but required some minor drilling to make sure the hardware will fit properly without the fiberboard material crumbling. Reasonable time to put together. Wish that they provide screw covers on the sides of the cabinet as the screws are visible and making it look cheap in quality. Also, the front doors are not adjustable. Otherwise, the cabinet functions as designed.", 
    "Looks cheap. Doors rub and can be adjusted. Very disappointed in the quality for the price", 
    "I bought this a year and a half ago. The door broke off and my husband has been unable to repair it ( he is pretty handy). He tried a couple times but can't find a replacement hinge. He told me to throw it out and get something else. So disappointed because it fit perfectly in the space.", 
    "Item not deep enough to hold size 10 men's shoes,", 
    "This product is an absolute pain to assemble. The directions are TERRIBLY written and it took me several hours. There were multiple times I had to unscrew and re-do steps due to lack of clarity in the instructions. Granted I'm not the best with putting things to together, but this was just ridiculous.", 
    "I just love this product ,very handy .My house is nice and clean.", 
    "It makes my room clean and neat ,storage many shoes.I recommended to friends.", 
    "We have a puppy who was chewing through pair after pair of shoes, so we decided to invest in this cabinet to keep them out of his reach. Our front entryway looks much more tidy now (shockingly the kids actually do put their shoes away almost every time), and we haven't had any more shoes become chewtoys. It does hold odors in, but we bought a couple of charcoal odor absorbers to tuck in with the shoes and that has helped quite a bit. With three kids (all girls!) we have quite a few pairs of shoes, and I'd estimate that about 25 pairs are in there at the moment, but my 2 yr old's fit 2 pair deep and we stack sandals and flats on top of one another. I love that the shelves are adjustable, so my boots can stand up straight on one of the shelves. The husband's shoes have to go in sideways, as they do not quite fit, depth-wise (Size 11). Still, this thing holds a lot considering it's footprint.My husband was able to put this together on his own in about 2 hours, and the peices all fit together nicely- he was pleasantly surprised that he did not have to mess with the doors/ drawers to get them to sit in the cabinet neatly as has been our experience with this kind/ price level of furniture in the past.", 
    "Much nicer than expected, well worth the money. Was able to put over 20 pairs of shoes in one cabinet.", 
    "Bought for my husband and he doesn't feel it Actually fits his size 13 shoe well. Other than that It's a nice looking cabinet.", 
    "Have been looking for something for the closet to organize my shoes aand this works great. Hubby and I (I gave the instructions and held the sides) put this together without any problems, in less than an hour. It is rather heavy so does take 2 people. Highly recommend this product. Would be great to organize other items not just shoes, in my opinion. And the price can not be beaten. Saw the same cabinet from a different supplier for over $*** more. I may purchase another to store sweaters in at a later date.", 
    "Cabinet works for my needs. There is a small area on the top that is flawed, and if it were a main piece of furniture that is on constant display I would have returned it for a new one. My husband suggested I ask for a discount, but couldn't figure out who is responsible for that contact; the manufacturer or OVERSTOCK.", 
    "I didn't really know if I would really like this shoe cabinet but I really love it. Now my shoes are so organized and not all over the bottom of my closet.", 
    "The cabinet arrived very well packaged in a double box so it was well protected. It is very good quality and although it took abut 2 hrs to put together, instructions were clear and pieces well labeled (it is a 2 person job because the piece is large). My only complaint that is preventing it from getting 5 stars is that the drawers are little difficult to push in/out because top surface is not perfectly level (but this is very minor and drawers are usable), and after all that assembly my husband was dissaponted that his shoes could not fit because shelf depth is actually 11.5 inches. I wear women's 11 and my dress shoes can fit exactly, but my sneakers which are a little bulkier do not. Men's 11.5 definitely do not fit, however we tilted them upwards and that solved the problem! In fact, we used styrofoam from the package to build a riser that fit along the back of the shelf to prop up the shoes. If you decide to do this, make sure you wrap styrofoam completely (eg with duct-tape) so that it does not shed when shoes rub over it. So using this strategy, you can fit 3 pairs of men's shoes or 4 pairs of women's shoes on each shelf (there are 5 total), but you can also stack flats and significantly increase storage capacity that way. Overall, this a modern-looking, large capacity, well-priced shoe cabinet, and I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Short review: We love this item!Longer review: It took a while to put together - 90 minutes maybe - but it's a quality piece of furniture and Rome was not built in a day, as they say. There are a lot of screws, and pieces - I would recommend having a flat surface like a table to put the bag of screws (14 compartments or so) on so you can keep track of them all. The directions are pretty straightforward and easy to follow and once it was put together is VERY sturdy. Honestly, I did not expect the wood to be of such high quality for the price. Even the drawers slide in and out very smoothly. It really looks fantastic and like a truly high quality piece of furniture when completed.As others have written, I'd recommend cutting a couple of holes in the back to vent - we also put an odor absorbing gel and a spray can for the shoes before they go in. I wear a size 10.5 and that's about as deep as the cabinet is - I can fit seven shoes (3 1/2 pairs) on one shelf and there are five shelves. It has completely cleaned up our entry way and is one of my all time favorite furniture purchases.", 
    "I love it. It was easy to put together.I have all my summer shoes in it and then I change it up for the winter. I put the shoes I'm not wearing in plastic under the bed storage containers..", 
    "I got this to put shoes in so that my dog can't chew on them but this can be use for more than just shoes.", 
    "It took 2 people to set this up. Very heavy. Lots of detail. Poor instructions. The screws, nails, etc. were excellently packaged in one long piece of plastic with each type of fastener in a separate compartment. The finished product is fine.Now that I know how to set it up. Planning to order another one soon for my bedroom. I mean shoes that you don't see, you don't wear.", 
    "The shoe cabinet was delivered on time as promised. My son was able to put it together with no problem. The light color, quality, and sturdiness for men's shoes and boots is great even though it is pressed wood! I like the fact that the cabinet has two drawers at the top where he can place socks, jewelry or more shoes if one chooses to. It sits up like an unknown piece of furniture in the bedroom even though it's a cabinet for my son's 10.5 size shoes. The cabinet is not so big and bulky. I'm very pleased.", 
    "before I purchased the cabinet I was kinda hesitant at first coz it requires assembly but my husband assembled it in a short time and it was really easy to follow the instruction. Now, my entry way is free of cluttered cozwhen they come home all they do is put their shoes in the cabinet and put on their house slipper. It looks really nice, I love the color that I chose and you won't even know it is a shoe cabinet.......", 
    "I got the beech color since the dark color was out of stock, but it looks good too. It took 2 people about 2 hours to assemble it, it is very spacious and functional, organized most of our shoes, looks neat in our living room.", 
    "The cabinet is beautiful and it can be placed almost anywhere. I bought two and built it myself with my cousins help. No help from any men. It was easy to follow the instructions. Tip for those putting it together. Keep the long package of screws in the same condition it's sent. That way you can match them immediately of where they go. I put with a magic market the letters of the alphabet and was never confused. It looks like a much more expensive cabinet.", 
    "This product is amazing, easy to put together, looks great in any room or space! Very versatile and sturdy to bring your room up to date for the guests who attend your shin digs!", 
    "Nice to have a place for the shoes. Keeps things orderly and straight.", 
    "It's exactly as all reviews said. It's perfect for what I needed it for-I wasn't expecting a XXXXXXX XXXX quality product, but it's sturdy enough for what I need it for. It wasn't as hard to put together as what some reviews indicated, but I'm pretty handy.", 
    "It looks nice and functions as a shoe cabinet and drawers. The wood is manufactured and compressed, and very weak. Screw and assemble with care because the screws will break apart the wood inside and not fasten. Half of my screws fastened and the other half is just sitting inside.", 
    "This cabinet has a lot of room for a lot of shoes. When this arrived the bottom piece had a crack in it & the left door was warped. But OS was very, very good about sending me the pieces to take care of these problems. This cabinet was very easy to put together even though I am a woman. I had no problems. The drawers are 3 inches high. Deeper than most drawers.", 
    "I love this piece of furniture. It was a lil bit larger than I thought, but not big enough for all MY shoes. I didn't put it together, but the friend who put it together did it by himself. Very sturdy, and can fit any type of furniture decor. I have had it for almost 4 months, and I think I might have to get one more ;-)", 
    "I bought this about a year ago. We have this by our back door to keep shoes in and off the floor. It is awesome. Hold tons of shoes and even has a couple a drawers for whatever else you have a tendency to throw down and clutter your entryway with. It looks like it costs a lot more than it did. Wish I had had this years ago.", 
    "this was just what i needed! i love that it had two drawers and the shelves. shoes inside socks in the drawers made perfect sense to me. unfortunately this piece was super difficult to assemble. i could not get the drawers to fit right, they close good enough for me though. just a bit odd. but definitely sturdy and still a nice piece", 
    "This is a nice piece. Not the highest quality but decent for the price paid. Holds more shoes then I thought. Took about 2 hours to put together.", 
    "The shoe cabinet was difficult to put together, as the instructions give you only two pages with about 30 instructions smooshed on one page. Once put together, it looks very nice, sturdy, and keeps our foyer clean. One thing we noticed, is the cabinet has very poor ventilation, we might end up drilling some holes in the back to help with this.", 
    "The cabinet is exactly what I needed to fit into the space. The instructions need to be more detailed though.", 
    "Love this shoe cabinet..It was really easy to put together and works really well. A great way to organize shoes and keeps your space very clean looking.", 
    "Considering how low the price is for this cabinet, the quality of this cabinet is really great. Very sturdy, lots of room, very practical. The look of it is also good. The boards are made of particle woods, but they are solid, do not look cheap. Much better than Ikea furniture. The only complain I have is about the assembly instruction. There are only drawings, no single word of explanation. So you really need to pay attention to all the details of drawings while following the instruction. We missed one little detail, ended up installing the door inside out. But door installation is not reversible, once the hinge is clicked in, you can not take the door out to re-install it. The good thing is that the hinge is made of plastic. We called the Overstock customer care, they sent us couple more hinges. We cut the old hinge, took the door out and re-installed it correctly. Problem solved and the end product is very satisfying.", 
    "Nice looking, not to difficult to put together. My grandchildren are putting their shoes away; not just thrown in the closet in disorder.", 
    "Somewhat difficult to assemble. May have been missing a part or two. Product looks just like picture and serves purpose of storing woman's shoes well. Beware that large men's shoes would have to be put in sideways to fit.", 
    "beautiful dark expresso finish, slim and tall. holds enough pairs of shoes. only the product is a little hard to put together.", 
    "I was happily surprised at the overall quality of the product, packing, delivery time, and match to the cabinet's description. Having ordered a few other assemble-it-yourself products, I was just a little reluctant. However, the cabinet was incredibly well packed and arrived with all parts in one box, without damage, and all pieces were intact, with no scratches or banged corners, etc. I followed the \"instructions,\" which mostly consisted of suggestions about how to proceed, followed by a pictorial guide to assembly. The only difficulty was that some of the parts in the drawing were so tiny that it was hard to distinguish one from another. It took about 3 1/2 hours in total for me to assemble it by myself, with only a screwdriver and a hammer. It is really beautiful and fits in perfectly.", 
    "my daughter thinks it is a chest of drawer for shoes. i used the top for nick nacks and the two drawers i used for jewelry.", 
    "Overall this is a great product. It did take a long time to put together, but it was manageable (and I rarely put things together). It has a nice finish and looks very nice in the entryway.", 
    "This cabinet looks good but assembly instructions are not good at all, it leaves a lot to the assumptions of the assembler. Packaging was really good. The screws for the magnet were very low quality and its grooves got eroded by the screw driver without the screw fitting all the way. Overall very cheap, would not recommend this product", 
    "This shoe cabinet is the perfect size for a family with kids; most of the other cabinets I looked at would not have been large enough. It looks ok, the quality is what you would expect, which is to say not great, but it works well in an entryway/mud room area. I will tell you that the assembly is a nightmare - not terribly difficult, but many, many pieces and time consuming. And, the drawers and doors do not fit exactly perfect. All in all, for the money, this is a decent buy.", 
    "The cabinet took some effort to put together and the instructions were clear. The quality is fair and is what is expected in a piece of \"secondary\" furniture for the home. I consider this a smart purchase because the cabinet is extremely functional. Happy that all the shoes by the front door can be hidden in the cabinet so the foyer does not look like chaotic shoe central. Not so happy that the drawers are sitting a bit crooked on the guides, and that one door is hanging a bit wonky. We carefully followed the instructions and diagrams while assembling. The cabinet looked great in the picture... but the cabinet we have does not appear so perfect. Fortunately, it is sitting in an area where it is not seen unless coming in through the front door. I would have given a 4 star rating if it was not for the crooked drawers and one door.", 
    "My husband and I love this product. Delivery was fast. packaging was easy to open and assembling was easy. We truly love it.", 
    "Looks good when put together, but a nightmare to assemble. Chips easily, and doesn't line up well. Expensive for the quality of product.", 
    "The product installation guide very very poor. You guys have to add more steps for installation. The instillation took around two hours. over all product is worth.", 
    "No color option was avaialable during order process. No idea which color is going to deliver.", 
    "We are a family of five and always had a pile of shoes by the door. This took car of the problem. For a self assemble product it is good quality & heavy. It looks nice & you wouldn't know it was full of shoes. Overall for the price I think this was a great buy!", 
    "I would get it again. Very roomie, very attractive. Easy to assemble- it just takes an hour to put together.", 
    "The only drawbacks were no written instructions and all the pieces weren't labeled. It was sometimes difficult to tell from the pictures exactly what to do, which caused me to put a piece on backwards which I didn't realize until we were putting the doors on at the very last. Fortunately my son was with me to help partially take it apart and put back together correctly. Once we got it together I love it. It's taller than I expected and I love the fact that the shelves are adjustable. The problem with the directions is the only reason I dont' give it 5 stars.", 
    "I like the dresser..the shoes fit perfect. The only flaw are the drawers on top. Even though once built everything is sturdy the drawers don't have an inner built in track to hold them so they will hang a bit once opened. But we are going to try and put one in ourselves. I have recommended this product because it looks good and adds style to my room. Shoes fit nice I can fit 4 to a row and overlap flats making it 5 pair to a row. Measurements were accurate.", 
    "I purchased this after researching these for a long time. I wanted something that would hold my size 11 1/2 mens shoes and close them out of the way in the corner of my kitchen by my entryway. There are not as many shelves with doors/cabinets that meet this dimensional criteria, nor the price range I was looking for, and all are the laminate/partical board in this price range, sort of a specialty item. This shelf went together in about 3 hours, built well. and directions were pretty clear. Overall, I gave it 4 stars because I think it is a bit pricey for ready to assemble press board, but again, surprised buy weight/build of it, and appears sturdy. I would reccomend this to a friend.", 
    "We are always satisfied with the quality of products from Overstock; this was no different; we have had for several months/maybe a year now, and it is still in good shape for all its use; excellent place to keep shoes and holds lots; could also asily be used for storage for other stuff the right size too.", 
    "I bought this shelf to use as a a shoe storage for our entry way. it fit perfectly and matched the dimmensions provided on the site. Since then everyone who enteres our house goes and buys this shelf, even my cleaning lady ordered one! Its excellent, there is no more shoe clutter at the entrance and the price is very reasonable. The color matches my other shelf exactly which was an added bonus as sometimes colors don't match 100%. I ordered it in the dark make so not sure about the lighter wood cabinet but assume it would be the same.", 
    "Time consuming to put together. Mostly it's simple, but the drawers are pretty confusing. I ended up going with trial and error. The bad part of the cabinet is that mens shoes don't fit if you put them in toe to heel. I'm a size 10 and most of my shoes require that they be put in with the side of the shoes toward the doors. The quality is alright - it's exactly what you would expect from a flatpack shoe cabinet. It keeps your shoes out of sight, and that's the main goal so I can't complain too much. Still wish I had an extra 1/2 inch of depth though (TWSS).", 
    "This cabinet looks great in my mudroom. We now have a space for all of my kid's shoes. It was fairly easy to put together because I have assembled a lot of furniture before. For someone that hasn't assembled furniture before the instructions might be confusing. After assembling the cabinet, you will need to secure it to the wall with the attached brackets because it is very wobbly. My biggest complaint about the cabinet is that the inside shelf measures only 11 1/2\". The measurement on the website says that it is 13\" deep but this is an outside measurement. My husband wears size 12 shoes and they do not fit in the cabinet. I have to turn them sideway to make them fit; taking up a lot of space.", 
    "The quality is just fine. You get what you pay for. It's acceptable product for the price. Nice looking. The only problem was assembly. The assembly instruction isn't easy to understand and it made my husband and I to reassemble many times. So tiring. Other than that it's nice looking and has lot of room for your shoes.", 
    "Excellent!!! I would recommend it to my friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "I like the shoe cabinate. Only drawback was assembly part was little painful. I wish manual be more clear on step by step assembly process. We faced some challenges when assembling some parts, as pictures were not very descriptive. I certainly recommend this product and overall rate this product with 4 star. Initially I used this for as my shoe cabinate, now I am using as book cabinets.", 
    "Instructions for assembly are concise and have to be accurately followed. It is very easy to go wrong and fit a part upside down. The top drawers do not have any rails and do not slide in and out smoothly. Apart from the above gripes, the cabinet looks good, is sturdy and tall.", 
    "The cabinet is simple and elegant. The advertised number of shoes fits if no shoe size is greater than 10 or so, otherwise you need to put larger shoes diagonally, and you can fit fewer. I put the cabinet in my garage, and it is by far the most elegant piece of furniture in there (admittedly, this is not a very high bar). It would look well also in an interior room if the rest of your furniture matches in style. The overall design looks modern, with hardware (handles and knobs) of surprisingly good quality and look for the price. The construction is fairly solid. As for most of this type of self-assembly furniture, do not expect to drag the cabinet around a carpeted floor without damaging it. To move it, you need to empty it and lift it. It is not very heavy. I have assembled a lot of furniture for myself or others. This cabinet is no more difficult to put together than others, but the instructions are sketchy, and it is easy to assemble some parts in the wrong orientation. If you do that, it is difficult to recover, as some steps involve glue and screws that screw in only once. To avoid this, pay close attention to where the various holes need to be, especially those for the hinges of the cabinet doors.", 
    "It looks cheap, the shelves keep falling, it's O.K. if you hid the cabinet somewhere in a closet, but I would not display this in the living room or at the entrance to my apartment.", 
    "I received the order within a week. I would have rated 4stars but the knob for the storage bin did not hav ethe thread for the screw to work. So waiting on replace part that will work. It takes atleast 4 hours to put everything together. if you are DIY type may be 2-3hours. But needs a lot of patience and a friends help to be able to put it together. I still couldn't figure out how to use some parts in the last step. But didn't look like it was needed. Overall took a lot of time to put it together. Guess thats why the price is low.", 
    "I read a lot of reviews of this product where people were very satisfied. I actually feel that for the price you are paying, the quality is not so great. First of all it is not so easy to assemble. There are really no proper directions just diagrams. There is no number or letter system that tells you which piece is which, you kinda just have to figure it out and hope you're right. My husband is pretty handy and it took him 4hours to assemble this unit. The wood is not as sturdy as it claims to be. There were even some panels which had scratches on them, and one piece that was actually cracked a little bit. I ordered 2 units which I paid $*** for each. I really think I overpaid. I think the appropriate price should have been more like around 50-60 bucks. I guess if I had paid about $50 for each unit then I definitely think its worth the price, but not at $***.", 
    "I wish it was a bit deeper given it doesn't really fit a men's size 10 or 11 shoe. The drawers are not fitted with rails. They use a wooden peg to keep the drawer from falling out. This is a big negative but otherwise it works in our home. The color is great though and the hardware is nice too. Shipment was incredibly quick. I received this shoe cabinet before a book I ordered(from another site).", 
    "It broke after a month because my 7 years old child was playing with the door. But my husband place new hinges, and it worked fine. It worth the price I payed for, No more than that, no less than that. You get what you payed for.", 
    "It's a great way to organize your shoes, especially on the entryway. You no longer have to worry about guests coming over looking at that hideous corner filled with piled up shoes.", 
    "I should have paid the extra money, and gotten the \"real\" wood version. This was a cumbersome to assemble. A few of the pre-drilled holes did not line up. And, a few of the pieces were \"direction\" specific. Because of that, we had to undo and reassemble a piece of the shelving. We did it incorrectly the first time because of the holes that did not line up. Overall, it meets my needs to get the shoes off of m steps. However, I will definitely spend the money next time for the higher quality piece of furniture.", 
    "One drawer on the product would not slide fl;ush with the cabinet. The holes did not line up for the screws and will have to be re-drilled in order to slide the drawer in", 
    "There's a few things going on with this thing. First off, it's heavy which I consider a good thing. Once assembled, it pretty much looks like the picture. It's actually a little but bigger than expected, but works out okay since the top of the cabinet is a good height to put stuff on. That's about it for the positives. The low score is due to what I'm thinking is either a defective unit or a defective builder, or maybe just poor build quality/design. On my cabinet, the doors are cut slightly off. Just enough to the point where I can't close both of them at the same time unless force my body against it. I tried reinstalling the doors, but I determined they're just cut that way. Unless I just messed up the whole cabinet, in which case there's no going back and redoing the whole thing. Another problem is the shelves don't stay in place very well. When I do use brute strength to close the doors, the shelves all collapse. I was looking for grooves in the shelves are something to keep them in place when resting on the adjustable pegs. The last problem is the drawers on top. There's no rails and just a dowel on the upper side about halfway back that hits the back of the drawer to stop it from coming all the way out. Once the drawers a few inches out it gets loose and starts flopping around. Overall I would've liked the cabinet if at least the doors closed properly. The other things I could've dealt with, or at least jury rigged to work.", 
    "like the cabinet/ the concept is great/ but it is very cheap made. Considering the prices of the other ones of that size, I guess not too bad. Does clean up the clutter of all the shoes and looks like a storage cabinet which goes perfect in my living room.", 
    "I should have read closer, I wasn't really expecting to have to put this together. It was a lot of pieces and took me more than an hour to do it alone. Once together it seemed bigger than i was imagining based on the description. But it does hold a lot of shoes.", 
    "It was OK for the price. It met my requirements in the end.", 
    "very quality, very neat, just exactly what I expected. Love it.", 
    "It looks good after assembly. However, the assembling process is kinda time consuming, took my husband 2-3 hours. It's a more functioning piece of furniture than a showcase piece, so I may consider moving it from our foyer for guest use to garage for our daily use. For the price we paid, I say this meets our expectations but not exceed.", 
    "This is the perfect shoe cabinet to hide away unsightly clutter. I have an older house with very small closets, but with this in my mud room, my shoes are not longer all over the placce.", 
    "We live in a 3 story townhouse, so we needed a place to put our shoes when we come in from the garage. This works well for storage, but I'm not too happy with the quality of this piece. One of the doors doesn't shut flush. Normally the stuff we purchase on Overstock is good quality, but we were disappointed with this purchase.", 
    "This is an awsome buy! The item depicted in the picture matches exactly. It was easy to put together. My husband wears a size 10 shoe. His sneakers fit, however, his dress shoes need to be stored facing side-ways. For the price...it's great! Just what I was looking for.", 
    "I purchased this shoe cabinet and assembed it. The assembly took me about 4 to 5 hours. The supplier provded decent instructions. I fumbled while assembiling the drawers (upper storage bins). I had to unscrew and rescrew them back. The shelfs are fine but the two drawers are not so good. The do not have rollers!!! also when I pull these drawers they are scraping the paint off the cabinet. I felt the manufacturer did a poor job with the two upper storeage bins. Otherwise this product rocks.", 
    "I had been looking for something to store my shoes in since I ran out of room on my shoe rack. The quality for the price was not that great but it does the job. The drawers do not sit in their space very well and tend to stick out at times. Overall it is OK", 
    "well its a good shoe cabinet with storage also I like the coffee color,its perfect for my needs and budget,thank U O stock.", 
    "I'm actually impress of the quality of the wood on this shoe cabinet, is solid and the whole material is solid and sturdy. I purchased the brown one and it matches my bedroom furniture just fine, which works out good. The set up was fast, with easy instructions to follow. I'm actually glad that I bought this, it keeps my all my shoes in a good place. Highly recommended.", 
    "This the perfect piece of furniture for a shoe lover. I have so many shoes and so does my son, they were always all over the place and this is a perfect solution to the shoe problem. Im thinking since its the hoilday season i might get one for my mother who also has to many shoes. The product was easy to put together and shipped with no problems. The product has held up great and since im thinking of buying one for my mother i would say yes I would recommend to another shopper.", 
    "I am in love with this shoes cabinet. It fits perfectly at the corner space in my room. I've find ways to utilize everything this cabinet has to offer. I'm using the top panel for addtional display space for picture frames and the two drawers to store books and notepads. The quality and finish is very nice so it doesn't look like the typical cheap shoes cabinet so you can definitely showcasing it out in the open. So in addition to using it for my shoes, it's useful in other ways. I'm happy that the door is closed shut even with my pointy toe shoes are in there. The only complaint is the assembly time, which takes about 1 1/2 hour because it has more than a few parts to put together. That's is no biggy really. Overall very pleased.", 
    "I got mine not too long ago which came pretty fast, and right away I assembled the shoe cabinet, and it was easy and simple instructions to follow. After I assembled it, I was so happy of the master piece. So much room for majority of my shoes, and very solid shelves, unbelivable especially with the price that I paid for it, it was a bargain. I highly recommend it, good quality, easy set up, and the price is a good deal.", 
    "I purchase two for all my shoes, and I love it! Fast delivery, and lots of room for all my shoes. Verys trong quality, and each shelves are very sturdy, and I also love the design, it's pretty. Assembly was easy to follow, and it didn't take a lot of my time. I highly recommend it.", 
    "If you purchase this unit, plan to spend about eight to ten hours figuring out how to and then assembling it. Unless you have done this type assembly before and are proficient at it you will find the directions lacking. I chuckled when I first looked at the directions which began, 'STOP' and read this carefully. Well, WE ( you will need a second set of hands throughout this project) did read carefully and laid out each piece in an organized manner. The hardware was packaged in a long plastic strip corresponding to the description listed in the directions. CAREFULLY NOTE THIS LIST. COUNT EACH UNIT IN THIS PLASTIC STRIP!!! A FEW SCREWS WERE MISSING HERE AND THERE IN MINE!!! ALSO, LABEL THE PLASTIC DIVIDERS IN THIS STRIP WITH 'A' THROUGH 'U' SO IT WILL BE EASIER TO IDENTIFY EACH PIECE OF HARDWARD. IF SCREWS OR OTHER ITEMS ARE MISSING, EITHER GO TO A HARDWARE STORE TO BUY MORE OR NOTIFY THE COMPANY TO SEND THE ITEMS NEEDED. WE WENT TO THE HARDWARE FOR SCREWS, BUT STILL NEED A BROKEN HINGE. Directions to assemble this unit are vague. There are drawings with arrows to guide correct assembly using the necessary hardward, but that is all. In some areas, it is very confusing. However, if you endure, like puzzles, have a good Phillip's head screwdriver and lots of strength, you will end up with a really nice cabinet. Actually, I am considering buying another unit and, with this experience, hope to have it done in six hours instead of eight or ten.", 
    "Instruction set isn't the greatest but overall this is a really nice product. My husband wears a size 11 shoes and his shoes have to go in at an angle for the doors to close.", 
    "Love this piece! It's a perfect fit for the space. People were surprised that it held shoes - way better than the previous metal rack.", 
    "The cabinet was what I needed for my hall-way entry, the color was perfect and add some flare to the entry. i will recommend it to anyone.", 
    "got this for my sons room! He was in despreate need of some organization or at least something to hide the mess. I bought this shoe cabinet, It was a great price and looked great. We got it right away and my son is 17 and put it together himself, so I would have to say its not to hard to assembly. The delivery was fine and everything was there expect for the instrutions but they were able to be emailed to me in about half an hour after calling customer service which was exceptional! I would recommend", 
    "love this cabinet! Its very large, fits tons of shoes and is pretty! the drawers dont have a nice slide, but they are great to have. so glad i bought it and the price is the lowest youll find", 
    "This is a great product. It arrived promptly and was very well wrapped with bubble wrap. Fairly easy to assemble and definately worth the money.", 
    "I bought 3 for all my shoes, and I love it. I take care of my shoes so I would like them to be in a safe place , and the cabinets that I bought is perfect for it. It was easy to assemble when it arrived in just 3 days!, and I was able to fit all my shoes in each shelves inside. Very strong, and sturdy shoe cabinet to have. I love it! ,and I know you will too. Great price for a good quality shoe cabinet.", 
    "This shoe storage is very nice. It stores everyday used shoes nicely to keep our foyer clean and organize. And, 2 top drawers are nice for keys, daily mails, and coupon. Love it :)", 
    "The shoe Cabinet is great. I needed something to organize the shoes but didnt want to have something where you could see all the shoes out in the open. This works perfectly. It keeps the shoes hidden and the floor clean and organized. The item has held up great considering its constantly opened everyday. Very happy with the item and price.", 
    "It took about 2 hrs to build the whole cabinet. But it looks really nice & it fits all my shoes that were scattered in the front door area. I can also put 9-10\" shaft height boots. Shelves are adjustable.", 
    "Nicely packed. it took a little long for me to get it. but i was happy once it arrive. it took sbout 4 hours to put together. the instructions were not as clear. It had a few marks on the front panell.", 
    "Overalll it was what we needed to get the shoes off the mat and out of sight at our front door. It is tall so need a good space to put it otherwise it takes up a lot of your entry....ours is off to the side. I see how it scuffs and you cannot get it off since it is not real wood but again it was worth the price, not exactly real wood.,", 
    "The shoe cabinet arrived with both back panels damaged (Pieces # 16). I did not have the patience to return or exchange the product so I assembled it with the damaged back panels. However, this has left me feeling that there is minimal quality control in the furniture shipped by Overstock. In the future I plan to avoid buying furniture from Overstock. Another issue was that all the pieces of the cabinet were not labelled. As a result I had to use trial and error method to figure out which piece goes where.", 
    "Looks pretty good for the price but it took my husband 4 hours to put together and he said the directions were very difficult.", 
    "This piece has what seemed like an unending number of pieces to assemble. Took a long time and much patience. It does have a lot of space for the shoes.", 
    "Firstly I have to say wow at the speed of delivery! So I got the cabinet and after reading the various reviews wasnt sure if I would be able to build it myself or if I'd need my dad to come over and do it :) the fact that I couldnt get the box up the stairs meant I had to call my dad lol.. (the box is super heavy as an fyi) and am glad I did.. though it wasnt super hard, I was glad to have an extra set of (very handy) hands.. it still took us over an hour to finish.. but the finished cabinet ilooks great.. The wood is laminated mdf or particle board so not solid wood... but it seems like its a pretty durable sold cabinet.. It fits perfectly behind my bedroom door and I have about 28 pais of shoes in there (about 6 of them are flip flop/sandals that I piled one over the other..) but it means I have a nice ordganised area for my shoes.. and they're not all over the house.. Love it!", 
    "The drawers aren't great and the cabinet isn't deep enough for my longer shoes, but overall i'm happy with it", 
    "It is not easy to put it together. Still, we have not build it yet. Product is very poor.", 
    "Good and suitable. too heavy though - the shipped box was over 70lbs! as always, overstock shipping was fast and at great price!", 
    "This is a great product and I am so happy I bought it!", 
    "I love the idea of this shoe cabinet. I can store a lot of my shoes and sturdy. My husband put it together with our son and it didn't take very long until I started putting all my shoes inside. I like it very much, and it keeps the surroundings clear or tripping over shoes. I'm happy with my purchase, I hight recommend it, really useful.", 
    "I bought this as a gift for a friend and assembled it myself. It was of such poor quality I couldn't give it to my friend. It's not nice enough to have in a house. It is now in the garage holding my gardening supplies. The pieces are not sized properly and some of the unfinished portions can be seen under the drawers. Since the holes are pre-drilled, you can't adjust anything. There were several large scratches on the front panels as well. This is not worth the price. I am very disappointed.", 
    "This shoe cabinet came apart after couple of months. The wood is not of good quaity. The inside racks keep falling if 4 pairs of shoes are kept. When the racks and shoes fell it ripped apart the back panel. The overstock shipping etc., was good, but just not happy with this product itself.", 
    "Cabinet is nice looking overall. However, it took a couple of hours to put together because the instructions were not clear. Also, the pieces break off easily and we are missing a screw for one of the knobs.", 
    "We bought this organizer....it looked good on internet. However it does not look good in real. Wood looks cheap. Installation was fairly easy. However you need to ensure correct sides....", 
    "A bit disappointed with this piece. It was very hard to put together - directions were not clearly marked. It looks fine once it is put together but it is not something I can really recommend.", 
    "Took hours to assemble cabinet, too heavy, bad quality, not worth the price. Makes me wander who actually writes all these positive reviews.", 
    "One of the worst items I have ever purchased on this site, Really cheap craftsmanship and instructions are not good, takes a while to put together and pieces break off wayy to easily. I actually read reviews and thought I could trust them I Would Not Recommend this,", 
    "Poor package results in scratched and dented pieces. Moreover, screws are missing, and the instruction are not quite clear. With a fairly handy hand, the installation is finished after hours of working. 2 stars for the fact: it can stand and hold shoes.", 
    "I don't know where are those 5 stars reviews came from, this shoe cabinet is by far the WORST product I've ever purchased from Overstock!! the panel did not line up correct, missing bolts, very very cheap compressed wood , don't waste your time like i did, I'm returning this item!!", 
    "Received quickly and in good shape. In LOTS AND LOTS of pieces - each of which was really, really wrapped well. A bit more difficult to put together than I had anticipated, but a beautiful, extremely useful piece when completed.", 
    "This cabinet is just the right size for the alcoves I have, and is well-made and smart looking. Your shoes are out-of-sight and aligned well, and you can also store shoe boxes, and shoe polish etc in the drawers. The cabinet can also be used for other storage, I have one in the kitchen and one in the entryway, they do not take up a lot of space but are perfect for storing.", 
    "Adds a unique touch to organizing! Love the final look and storage capacity! Didn't get 5 stars since one of the drawers didn't have the right holes for the rest of the pieces (yes we tried it different ways before realizing it was a bad drill). My husband had to adjust that mishap.", 
    "Great price and the two top drawers are quite convent for keys or storing shoe polish and such. The only caveat is that if you wish to store shoes of size 11 or higher they will not fit.", 
    "Packaging is excellent. No damage although it was handled rough in shipping. Recommend sorting hardware in cupcake tins .It made the assembly go smoothly . Would purchase again.", 
    "It is still working amazingly well and still looks pretty good after having it for so long.", 
    "The cabinet is very good looking. We have been loyal customers of Overstock.com, however this particular piece disappointment us greatly.Just 4 months after assembling it, the hinges of one door broke off. They are made of plastic.Through email I requested the company to mail me some more pieces so I can fix the door leafs if they come out again in future. In spite of requesting several times they sent me exactly 2 hinges for one door. Next time if it comes off, I do not know what to do. I paid almost $*** because it was the doors that fulfilled my purpose, I did not buy grantee as I could not afford it. All I had asked for was more than 4 pairs of hinges so if the doors came off in future, I could fix them back, as they are made of plastic. But I guess hinges are very expensive.", 
    "The shoe cabinet is in my bedroom. It is simple and classy. It stores so many shoes! My husband had a little difficulty assembling the hardware and caused some scratches but the scratches on the dark wood were easy to conceal with a black pentel pen.", 
    "This thing is awesome. Now there's no pile of shoes and it blends in with my other furniture so I can have it right there in my living room.", 
    "I needed to control the mess of shoes on the floor of my closet and this filled the bill. I have a large double bi-fold door closet and this cabinet fit exactly in the middle. I hang my clothes on each side of the cabinet and my shoes are neatly placed on the shelves. I had room enough to utilize the top shelf for my pj's. The to drawers hold my scarfs and miscellaneous items that ordinarily wind up in the dresser drawers. i am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.", 
    "Bought it to use as a shoe cabinet, but I use it for almost anything that will fit. Compact and goes well with my room decor!", 
    "Very nice quality and holds shoes on each shelf.", 
    "Good quality, proctects my shoes", 
    "It took me several hours to assemble by myself. I'm not used to this kind of furniture. I prefer hardwoods, but this does the job, economically too. I purchased a mid century classic Ranch style house that lacks sufficient closet space. Lifestyle was different in 1950, so you must be able to remodel, update, but live with smaller closets, and bathrooms. We use our wonderful non-finished basement to the maximum. It's functional, spacious, and gives us a good deal of additional square footage for a laundry with a handy laundry shoot, a home office, a family & game room, a home bar, and storage including a circular commercial clothes rack for hanging out of season clothing, but we still needed additional space for shoes. This shoe cabinet allows us to hide away half of our shoes while the closet holds the in-season clothes, and the other half of our shoes. I can't complain, and it blends in with our quality hardwood bedroom furniture much better than I expected. The only negative is my 10.5 men's shoes can't fit on the shelves straight, so fewer pairs can be placed on my shelves. Luckily, my spouse's 8.5 men's shoes go in straight, so he ended up with two shelves while I got three shelves, which works because he can put just as many pairs of shoes in the cabinet on fewer shelves. Also, if the cabinet's shelves were deeper, the cabinet would have been too big for the space that we had. All in all we're delighted, and our small bedroom closet if finally neat, and organized, which makes me happy because I no longer have the sensation that everything is falling out on me when I open the sliding doors, which is why I rate 5\u2606's.", 
    "This cabinet was just what we needed to hide store shoes in our entrance hallway. The cabinet is attractive and fitted neatly in the corner next to the main entrance door.", 
    "The assemble for this was unforgiving. I love the cabinet, and it holds lots of shoes, but the doors don't hang symmetrically and I don't know if that was due to my assembly or the materials provided to assemble. I'm just glad it sits behind my front door and no one notices the crooked doors except me, my son, my brother (a carpenter), my dad (an architect), my nephew (another carpenter)...", 
    "served my purpose. excellent for wht I brought it for", 
    "Screws came out of wood on doors leaving unrepairable holes.", 
    "it makes shoe storage look good.", 
    "A good looking shoe cabinet, easy to build and has lot of room. The little pegs that hold the shelves fit loosely and they come off easily causing the shelves to fall off.", 
    "Overall this is a very good cabinet to keep shoes out of site.", 
    "practical, looks nice for the price, must turn men's shoes at angle or theywon't fit", 
    "Overall I'm very happy with it. But it was hell putting it together. And a lot of prices came with minor scratches on the edges. And while putting it together it's easy to get more scratches on the edges. Luckily the whole thing doesn't get scratched up easily. The back is very light and flimsy, wish it was more sturdy and strong. The drawers are a little uneven and it bothers me but I tell myself to get over it. It's not deep at all, my husbands feet are a size 9 and they just just just fit. Anything bigger would have to be set side ways. Other than that very pretty it matches my other furniture perfectly I love the color. (Got the coffee bean one) it does the job in putting our shoes away nearly by the door while making my entrance look fantastic", 
    "We don't wear shoes in our house and shoes pile up quickly near the smaller shoe racks we used to have. This cabinet is discreet and holds lots of shoes. Not enough for 3 people, but enough for the shoes we wear regularly. Assembly was easy enough, encountered no problems. It's holding up fine after a year of constant use and a move.", 
    "The cabinet is ok, as long your shoe size isn't larger than a 10. If they are bigger then you have to store them in a slight angle.", 
    "Overstock or their vendor, how could you! I checked all the parts before I assembled the cabinet but I did not check closely enough. When it was almost completely assembled, two hours in, I saw the long scratch on the side, that somebody tried to repair. The repair was not effective and makes this cabinet nearly useless to me.At best the piece is destined for the garage but it may be simply put out next trash day. Overstock's response to the issue was not sufficient in my opinion. The piece cannot really be disassembled because the back is nailed on. Getting that off I probably would have damaged every major piece. So return is not really possible. Small store credit not sufficient to make up for the time and energy and the fact Overstock or their vendor knew! Likely won't buy from Overstock again.One thing Overstock should do is provide the installation instructions online! Many people may not want to attempt the assembly of this cabinet.", 
    "it is a useful piece of furniture. Suitable for smaller sizes of shoes. The original package was missing a small piece of wood. I called Overstock and they sent me a whole new package. Very efficiently resolved. I am very pleased with Overstock.com", 
    "Bought this to organize shoes in our entryway. The door fell off in a couple of days. Superglued it to the screw and it works fine, but have to be extra careful about it. The doors are rather flimsy. I wouldn't buy this again.", 
    "Poor quality. Not impressed! Drawers don't close all the way! Disappointed!", 
    "Very sturdy. Decent material. Easy to assemble. Nice addition to hide your shoes! Would highly recommend!", 
    "I had a little trouble putting this together, but finally did and I really like the look.", 
    "nice cabinet but NO INSTRUCTIONS for putting it together. You get a sheet with diagrams and unmarked packages with screws etc, so you don't know what goes where or how to even begin to put it together. I laid the wood pieces on the floor according to how the cabinet looks in the picture, and went from there. Nice sturdy cabinet when it's all done, but because there were no instructions I give it a 4 rating.", 
    "I enjoy this piece. It stores all of my shoes out of sight. I Love it!", 
    "Helped me organize my shoes . Looks good!", 
    "Easy to assemble and all of my husband's shoes fit perfectly. No more shoes around the house.", 
    "Although it was little bit challenging to put it together , however after it's done looks beautiful And functions really well . Great piece !", 
    "I have been looking for the perfect shoe cabinet and i think i found it. As the reviews have said it is a hassle to put together, but the finished product is fantastic looking! I put it between two birch colored armoires and it looks very California Closet.", 
    "I love this piece. I assembled it myself, which was time consuming, but manageable. If you have taller high heels, don't bank on being able to fit them all in here. The shelves can be adjusted, but there is one that cannot and I couldn't make it work", 
    "i really like it..............", 
    "very happy with quality and look", 
    "Best cabinet ever love it", 
    "A great shoe closet for myself..", 
    "We had a small condo with five people and way too many shoes. I needed something to organize the shoes without looking messy or cheap. This cabinet is HEAVY and looks amazing while being very functional. Just make sure to buy some baking soda - all those shoes in a tight area can be a bit much.", 
    "Very nice! I really like it!", 
    "This is a great shoe cupboard and I could fit in several pairs of my shoes. My husband could get about 3 pairs on a shelf. The drawers are an added bonus, and useful for storing keys or gloves/mittens/hats in winter. The drawers didn't align completely though, so i'm deducting a star.", 
    "Fits perfectly in the space and has a very upscale look. So glad I made this purchase!", 
    "I like the looks and all of the space. We dropped a drawer and the front broke off. I haven't tried to fix it yet. I am expecting problems since it is particle board.", 
    "a lot of room to store shoes.", 
    "Definitely cheap material, but works well.", 
    "This is a horrendously hard piece of furniture to put together. This is after my boyfriend and I put together a dresser and two side tables we purchased from IKEA and IKEA makes the process SO easy. The instructions were hard to read. Too bad IKEA doesn't have similar designs otherwise I would have purchased from them. It serves it's purpose, but I would rather not go through this process again.", 
    "My brother put this together, he said you must organize all pieces first and after that it was easy going. I like the piece and goes with my existing furniture... blends in well. Not too happy with the material it is made from but at this price, it is okay.", 
    "Love this shoe cabinet! It's a nice, modern piece and we placed it by the front door. We bought it for my husband's shoes and he wears a size 10. Some of his dress shoes need to be angled to fit. It fits 3 pairs per shelf. After reading the reviews about assembly, we were very careful to take our time and follow the directions. The pieces are numbered. The screws are in a plastic pouch in order by A, B, C etc. according to the illustrations. It's not difficult to put together; just takes patience.", 
    "Nice piece of furniture, helped me tame my shoe clutter.", 
    "very spacious, can fit a lot of shoes. the two drawers are great for keys and small stuff. overall, i like it very much", 
    "Easy to assemble and it looks like a quality piece of furniture.", 
    "This shoe cabinet is just the right size for my space, and has lots of rooms. One of the drawer could not close all the way. Need two people to assemble it.", 
    "I'm always looking for solutions to help de-clutter my house and make life easier. I was ending up with a pile of shoes next to my bed because it was such a pain to put them away in the small space I had for them in my closet. While this shoe cabinet is not quite the same quality as the rest of our bedroom furniture, at least it's a good color match and looks fine in the room. My husband put it together without too much trouble. After discarding shoes I really don't wear, all my shoes (22 pairs) fit in the cabinet nicely. Now it is easy to find and put away my shoes. I'm happy I got this cabinet.", 
    "I purchased this shoe cabinet based on other reviews, and I found it is turned out quite nice. The boards are packed very well, and it took me quite a time to get it assembled. I like the shoe cabinet.", 
    "What I like about this cabinet is that it is narrow so it does not stick out to far into the room. It was a little difficult to put together. The doors are not quite straight, but it is okay. Directions are only pictures, so it was a good thing I have put together furniture before. Make sure all the finished edges face forward. It would have been easier with two people.", 
    "I love the look of this piece but it doesn't fully serve our needs as it is not deep enough to house my husband's size 12 shoes. Mine fit fine but he has to put his sideways which means less room for other shoes.", 
    "This shelf is excellent for small entry way. It keeps my space neat and tidy. I have a no shoes zone, so i used this for guest shoes accommodation.", 
    "My husband, a woodworker by trade, assumed the back piece was cut square. Once the cabinet was close to finished, the problem became clear and he had to spend a lot of time reworking the assembly. In the end it was nice.", 
    "Took a few hours to assemble, but not very difficult.", 
    "This little cabinet was a breeze to set up. It works great, and has stood up to heavy use, and an overseas move. It looks great, and it is a creative set up. My only complaint would be the drawers at the top. It doesn't have a track, and the only thing stopping it from coming out all the way is a peg; the drawers can become unseated and you have to tinker for a half second to get it to sit flush.", 
    "While not exactly an attractive piece of furniture, this cabinet solved a huge problem for me.", 
    "Assembly required which took my husband and I forever. I encourage for those who are amateur to ask for help.", 
    "This is probably the best purchase I've made with overstock. This is a solid piece of furniture. Holds a lot of shoes and the top drawers are great for car keys and umbrellas. The hard wear to take rail for one of the drawer was off and we had to take it out and reinstall to make the drawer go in completely. It was an easy fix and I consider this a great purchase.", 
    "took awhile to put together but once done, pretty nice!", 
    "average shoe cabinet made in china. cheap but is made cheap.", 
    "Great shoe storage for the money you pay. Took longer than stated to put it together. If the they would have used thicker wood on the back of this cabinet it would have been rated excellent. Works great.", 
    "We ordered this online after reading the good reviews and researching for a nice-looking, and good quality shoe storage cabinet for our entry way. We got the dark espresso/coffee-colored cabinet, and it was a pretty heavy box. There are lots of piece, but they're all pretty well marked. We only made one mistake, but it wasn't much to re-do once we discovered it. Even though I read and took measurements, it's a little bit bigger than I expected once it was all put together, but it's not an issue of it fitting in the space. Nonetheless, it looks great, stores a good number of shoes, and makes things so much more organized. My husband's shoes had to be put at a slight angle in order to close the cabinet doors (and he wears extra wide shoes), so he can't fit as many in the cabinet as I can, but they still fit. I'd recommend this cabinet.", 
    "This is a nice cabinet with a contemporary look. It is of good quality.", 
    "It was very, very poor material, cheap crape. Lots of damaged on edges, coroners. I spent thousands of dollars at Overstock, this is the end. I still have several orders on my shopping cart, I am not going to buy anymore. Overstock now totally disappointed me after several returning. I don't want to bother them with return, it's just a shoes cabinet, threw it into the gabage.", 
    "I love my shoe storage cabinet. I was able to get more shoes in than outlined on the advertisement. This was due to me alternating my shoes on each row. I am very happy with my shoe cabinet and love it I would definitely recommend. The only caveat is it is a little time-consuming to assemble.", 
    "I was able to put this cabinet together myself and I love it. I highly recommend it and I will probably order another soon.", 
    "Hubby who is a great handyman, who builds furniture and puts together furniture all the time found the instructions lacking. Product must have changed the quality of the materials of this unit since it first became available in 2009. The particle board is so very brittle hammering the nails chips/splits/warps the board pieces. I have never seem so many chips come loose in the assembly of a unit. Be prepared to touch up blemished areas with a wood-finish markers. Not worth the price I paid for it, don't add this to cart unless it dips under $120.", 
    "Love it but has the four stars because assembly wasn't as easy as I thought it would be and directions were hard to read.", 
    "I was so excited to order and receive this shoe cabinet. First of all, the storage space is great. However, that is the only good thing about it. The materials are all particleboard which splintered. The screws show all over unit. You can see at least 8-10 screws on each side. I\u2019m trying to find something to cover the screws so I don\u2019t get upset each time I walk by it. The worst part of this whole order was the instructions. There are six pictures, without written instructions, to put together this multi-piece furniture. It is impossible to determine which side faces which and I ended up having to take it apart twice to fix boards that were facing the wrong way. I am not new to assembling furniture and usually enjoy it, but this was horrible. The particleboard splintered or turned to dust when I had to reassemble pieces so I ended up using glue to hold a few pieces together. I have ordered other furniture from Overstock and have been happy with the materials and the instructions, but for the price, this was not worth it. It is too big to send back or else I would.", 
    "Bought it has a gift.y son inlaw loves it. Keeps shoes neatly away from dog.", 
    "I like the look of this in my entry. It is rather fragile though and I feel it will not last long with wear", 
    "going to get a second one..", 
    "I love my shoe cabinet. It is a very sturdy piece of furniture.", 
    "great for my shoes. keeps everything organized and clean.", 
    "We have one really tall shelf for swim back packs and then short shelves beneath to have 2 shelves for flip flops and shoes. It is in our laundry room and keeps my floors clean.", 
    "It is a very nice product. Another good buy from Overstock.com.", 
    "Tons of shoe storage. Quality is okay. Size is good.", 
    "missing a few screws but made do with what i was given. too much hassle to wait for the other screws...easy to assemble but i'm not a carpenter so a few mishaps like the drawer was askew when i finally put it together...but other than that, the cabinet is very spacious and perfect for my intended storage.", 
    "Caution - Lay out the screws first - and look closely at the instructions. I initially used the wrong screws in assembling the drawers and handles, and made unwanted holes that protrude through the front of one of the drawers. Unsightly. LOL. But, still a functional, affordable piece. So much better than a rack with exposed shoes!", 
    "fits great where we wanted this to go in the new closet", 
    "This was pretty easy to put together and I love the fact that it hides all of our shoes.", 
    "I ordered two and put them side by side. Great way to organize our shoes! Easy to assemble and very sturdy. Shoes are all in one place instead of scattered about.", 
    "Overall a wonderful cabinet, and despite how careful I was about assembling it thanks to the other reviewers' warnings, I still had challenges. A worthy purchase, just take your time and don't guess on anything!", 
    "The unit was easy to assembled and it is steady. Great size and true to their description.", 
    "so far so good with the price", 
    "It took a long time to assemble, I put it together myself. The drop right drawer closes weird. (kind of have to jam it shut, I think the plank was cut badly/off) I built both sides the same so I'm sure its not because of the way I built it when the one side closes fine. Still its a good addition to my room and hides my shoes!", 
    "This is a very nice cabinet. It can be used for all kinds of storage in addition to shoes. The color is as shown, and it is very sturdy. Took my husband a full day to put it together by himself, but we are very happy with it. It provides some much-needed storage in our spare bedroom.", 
    "I gave this an average to excellent review, basically because you get what you pay for. This took my husband and I about 2 hours to put together. Save yourself some time and make sure you have an electric screwdriver. The directions are fairly easy to understand,however, it took sometime deciphering which part was which as the parts are not labeled very well. the labels are a stamped red ink which is blurred on most of the pieces. I am a size 7 and can get a good 24-26 pairs of shoes, boots, etc. the color on line is a true color to the product and looks nice.", 
    "Looks great in my room helps give me a excellent storage space for the many pair of shoes I have love it maybe I need another", 
    "One of my best purchases from Overstock. Very roomy and functional, and fits our entryway perfectly. Requires some time to put together, but overall is a great piece of furniture. Keeps up to 25 pairs and the whole family loves it. Highly recommend.", 
    "quality is not that good, takes time to assemble it. but it is a good design.", 
    "I have always been more of a neat freak than my wife, she has a tendency to leave her shoe collection all over the closet floor and it annoyed me a bit, so i bought this just for her to make thing a little cleaner around the bedroom. It arrived on time and assembly was real fast took me about an hour to to complete. The instructions are simple to follow especially with the pictures.", 
    "This is a great piece of furniture but you need two people to put it together. The only complaint I have is the directions are very poorly written. They leave a lot to be desired. Great cubby, this is our second.", 
    "As stated by other reviewers this can be very difficult to put together. I found some trial and error involved because some pieces looked the same on both sides until you realized that much later in the steps that there were some extra holes on one side for magnets. The directions probably could have put that earlier in the order. Also I found an important piece was missing. Did I want to ship a 100 pound box back for one small piece. Of course not. But it is kind of critical. It holds the door in place. I had extra of other things. If you buy this here is a couple of helpful hints. First check if you have all your pieces. Review all the steps before starting so you know the big picture rather than guessing which the directions will make you do if you focus just on the immediate step. The directions have no words just pictures. Leave the cardboard as protection when setting it up. Use a power drill. When installing the sides screw in all the screws of one side only. Then screw in the other side. This is important: Make sure the back is pushed all the way to the top because once you hammer the nails in it will be difficult to get them out. This took me a long time to set up and a lot of cleaning. Of course it was cheaper than buying some quality furniture but you get what you pay for.", 
    "Great, compact storage unit for shoes. But, you build it from scratch -- it litterally comes in pieces of wood and over a dozen packets of hardware! It took my husband and me 4 hours to put it together.", 
    "It looks great! Of course, putting it together was a big issue. The directions are absolutely HORRIBLE!!!! The final product though is nice.", 
    "it is very functional, quality is good. It looks chic.", 
    "I had lots of sandals, boots, etc., my size is 5-6 and my husbands is 10.The cabinet fits as described. The color is bit dark, matches my \"\"\"\" TV shelf. It has a modern look. It was hard to put together (the upper part gave us issues we attached it the wrong way and had to drill holes). As a clue watch the magnets for the doors and holes. It took my husband the whole day. It is taller than I thought. Overall a good purchase due to the storage capacity. The price is reasonable.", 
    "Excellent for our shoe storage in garage. Fits nicely along wall and looks much better than the wire storage shelves it replaced. Instructions should be more detailed. Just pictures are not enough!", 
    "Instructions for assembly are a bit vague - not enough detail. The shelves are just a tad short for men's size 11 & 12 shoes but we angled the moveable shelves and were able to fit them. Other than that, it's a nice sturdy piece of furniture that holds a lot in a narrow space.", 
    "This came quickly with no damages. It was not hard to put together. A few tricky items (there are some special screws that you have to figure out if you are not used to this type of furniture). As someone that has never put together furniture before, it took my friend and I about 2 hours to assemble. It is best with two people as the gluing of the dowels, etc. and putting things and holding things together is difficult alone. I am quite pleased. I have it in my closet and didn't put on the doors as they are not necessary and it is very sturdy.", 
    "Difficult to build without a power drill-- LOTS of Phillips head screws with predrilled holes. For such a simple piece of furniture, probably the longest furniture build I've ever done. That being said, it's got a fantastic price, looks nice, and is super convenient in our bedroom. Didn't need to drill it into our wall, stands up quite nice on its own (no wobble).", 
    "Very easy to assemble , I wish they could provide tools too. Very nice looking shelf", 
    "The product came in so many tiny pieces that my husband felt completely daunted by the prospect of putting it together for several months. Eventually, he did, though. It looks nice an is useful now that it has been assembled. I'd recommend before someone buys this to think about how patient and/or mechanically inclined you are.", 
    "The good points: Great ordering experience, quick delivery, very well packed and no damage. Once put together the cabinet looks good and really holds a lot of shoes. I have 26 pairs of shoes (2 pairs sneakers, several heels, mules, sandals, etc) stored in the cabinet and several flip flops in one of the drawers. I love this extra storage and have it in my bedroom. The 1, and only, although major, problem was in putting the cabinet together. The screws and such were well organized in the way they were sealed in plastic, but the instructions were really poor. My husband is very handy and has done many DIY projects around the house and he found it extremely difficult to follow the instructions and do it correctly. We had to undo a section to install another section that wasn't clear to us had to go first. It took several hours and when we were done, and thought we had it put together properly, the drawers wouldn't close all the way. So, we obviously did something wrong when constructing the drawer area, but, since the drawers closed enough (just not flush) and it's not a central piece of furniture, I didn't want my husband to take it apart and try again. So, be aware that the instructions may be a challenge to follow properly and allow plenty of time to construct this cabinet. If you can do it properly, it will defiantly provide very adequate shoe storage.", 
    "It was a huge pain to put it together with endless assembling steps that were unnecessarily complex. The drawers never fitted right. Didn't have a stopper for the drawers included. I have large feet, size 13, and the showes don't fit so I have to put them sideways otherwise It won't close.", 
    "Fairly easy to put together. Great alternative to a closet floor full of shoes and love the additional drawers for small items! Will fit even more shoes than advertised if you have a lot of sandals/flip flops.", 
    "This unobtrusive cabinet very nicely holds any pairs of shoes without advertising what is inside!! I bought this as a gift and the recipient was thrilled with the color and style of such a useful piece......", 
    "Very functional and the dark color blends into the wall in our entryway. I'm pretty experienced with ready to assemble furniture and this one is a bear. Took 1/2 a day at least. The bottom shelf is not adjustable, so you would need to lose a shelf to have room for tall boots. I would purchase again.", 
    "I have mixed feelings concerning this product its very good for what it is i also use to put my ball caps as well as shoes, putting together something i did many many times over the years, the weight and size of this product will require two people like they say. The cheap type of wood cracks easy so BEWARE be warned! Other than that it looks great when finally done. Securing to wall a must with the strap it comes with.", 
    "Looks nice when built, but was a disaster it was to build this thing! Between my husband and I we spent a few hours putting it together and reinforcing much of it. The holes are misaligned and the quality of the product is not great. I shouldn't have expected much based on the price I suppose. Once put together it's functional and looks nice (from afar) but the drawers do not slide well and the cabinet itself doesn't seem very sturdy. If it's against a wall and used gently it should be fine. The door on our broke during a move, but we weren't really surprised. I am not sure it's worth it. Although it looks nice, I would spend a little more and buy a better made product with a good instruction manual.", 
    "I've put together more than 40 things like this, and this is the most difficult I've ever encountered. So, some tips to help others. Assemble it on something you can pull around (tarp, bedspread) because this unit is very, very heavy. There are no written instructions, just diagrams and Step 2 is reversed. Put the solid board on the bottom in Step 2 or the doors won't work. I didn't & had to drill new holes for the doors. I recommend putting the door spring on the bottom so gravity will work with you. Good luck figuring out all the screw sizes, I never did. But, after all is said and done, it's a pretty nice looking unit that works great with my shoes.", 
    "very nice piece great for shoes very well made and strong", 
    "I love this hidden shoe cabinet! My shoes were starting to pile up by the door, and I didn't want a tacky shoe step with the shoes exposed, serving no real functionality. This cabinet is awesome and great value for the price! I have it in my hallway off the entry way, and it looks like a nice hall cabinet, can't even tell its for shoes! Love it!", 
    "perfect for shoe storage! fits a lot of shoes, looks great.", 
    "All was going well until we needed to put the drawer faces on. One went okay but the other just doesn't fit right. We are still trying to figure out how to make it fit.", 
    "Great product for Overstock. Shipped fast from overstock. The product took 3 hrs to assemble but was sturdy and stable. We did not screw it to the wall, instead stuck a few felt pads under the front bottom edge. It looks good and is plenty spacious. holds men's size 9 shoes along it's depth", 
    "It was a breeze to assemble and it fits so many pairs. I'm so glad I bought this. It is a real space saver. If you have humongous shoes you might have to put it sideways. I have one long toed size 11 fancy dress shoes which I have to put sideways. All the other size 11 shoes and slipons fit in just fine.", 
    "Forgot about this purchase. This is every woman's dream shoe rack. What can I say...it's great.", 
    "I needed a shoe rack that didn't take up a lot of floor space, but allowed me to stow away many pairs of shoes near our doorway. The cabinet was fairly easy to put together (disclaimer: I've assembled many items from Ikea in the past) but it took me a few hours putting it together alone (carefully using a power drill did speed up the job a bit). The shelves have enough room to store ~15 pairs of shoes, but be advised that some men's shoes are too long to fit on the shelves as intended (i.e. my husband's size 11 sneakers fit fine, but his dress shoes do not). Two of the shelves are adjustable so you can fit winter or short rain boots if needed. The two drawers at the top are a huge bonus. I'm happy with the quality of this based on the price (this was one of the cheaper units I found on overstock but still had a lot of storage), and it looks great.", 
    "When put together right this is a very functional we'll made cabinet. I can fit many pairs of my size shoes in it.Myhusbands size 12 will no t fit unless I put them in sideways. I put the cabinet together myself. Took me around 5 hours and was a little frustrating at times. Be careful what screws you use on the front of the drawers or you may go through the front like I did. Also when you are putting the back on not much to work with and I went through and chipped some on the inside. All in all ,I think it is a good ,solid piece of furniture for the price!", 
    "Love the piece... Only down fall was assembly. The instructions were vague. Thank god I'm handy! Looks awesome", 
    "I bought these shoe cabinets as I was in need of shoe storage after moving into a new house with limited closet space. They look great in the room and keep the shoes organized, hidden, and protected from dust, etc. I wear a size 6 1/2- 7 and I fit about 5 pairs on each shelf, totaling about 25 pairs of shoes. You put in the shelves so you can adjust the height for boots, flats, sneakers. The drawers at the top are also useful for storing accessories. I use it for belts. As with most put together furniture, the instructions are a bit confusing at first, it took about an hour to put together. I got the dark brown color and the color is as pictured. I am glad that I purchased two of these cabinets and they could also be used to store basically anything if I didn't need it for shoes at any point.", 
    "I'm really enjoying the shoe cabinet . . . looks great . . . keeps me organized . . . and the darker wood color is ex actly as pictured on-line. No regrets from me. I gave it 4 stars because it was difficult to assemble and required a call to customer service. Be patient during assembly, it's totally worth it.", 
    "I have purchased many fiberboard products in the past and this is by far the best looking. The wood grain is superior and the finish very high quality. I'm was very plesantly surprised at the quality for the price. I definitely see this piece lasting for a long time of use. The only drawback for me was the weight of the box when received but if you have a assistance to bring it in or at least a helpful delivery person then that shouldn't be to big an issue. Just keep in mind to put it together as close to the final location as possible like the instructions advise. It took me several hours to put it together on my own but I'm sure if I had assistance it would have gone much faster.", 
    "The shoerack cabinet was great. The only thing was I got the manual missing pages 4 to 6, so I was stuck in the middle of assembling it. Luckily, I contact customer service and agent Brooke, was able to help me and emailed me the rest of the pages that they have in their archives. Kudos and thanks a lot.", 
    "Product as described. Delivered on time. It came with no damage", 
    "This is a great cabinet. love the storage space. the assembly instructions were a bit vague, but most are that come from china, sturdy and solid! I bought two, and they are just right!", 
    "needs additional shelving and holes drilled. did that and able to store additional sandals. .great for the mud room. when you are assembling label bags of hardware with corresponding letters makes putting it together easier and faster, assemble in large space garage is good lots of syrafoam. very well packed box within a box. packaging was damaged but not the product.", 
    "The shoe closet is good looking. It may be a little too tall but it stores many pairs of shoes. My kids are very good at putting away their shoes once they are inside now. It is pretty heavy and takes time to put together (1 1/2 hour for my husband and my son working together.) It's worth the effort. The price is good especially with free shipping. I'd buy again if I need it somewhere else.", 
    "Love this cabinet. It makes my small apartment look better and it holds a lot of our familes shoes with room for guests. I love the two drawers. We place things there that we need to take as were heading out such as sunglasses and sunblock.", 
    "Great purchase. We are very happy with the quality and the color of the furniture since it matches the one shown online as well as with the rest of our furniture in the house. There is enough space per plank to keep at max 5 pairs of shoes and maybe squeeze some to fit in 6. The upper two drawers are helpful as well to keep items like shoe polish, socks, etc.", 
    "Did not realize that this box was 100 lbs and regretting that I lived on the fourth floor without an elevator. However, very impressed with the quality of the cabinet and wife loves it. A great deal for the money but be willing to invest time in putting it together. The directions were Ikea style but sometimes confusing. Sometimes the directions would not show certain holes where they should have been to minimize confusion. Overall, once it was complete it looked like we spent much more. But impressed at the quality.", 
    "Make the room looks organized and clatter free. It fits 20 pair of shoes.", 
    "we purchased the dark chocolate color, and put it by the door, it looks much more expensive than it costs us. so our entryway is presentable and organized. it took approx 1 hour to set it up by both of us (my husband did most of the work, I was just passing parts and tools over). instructions could be more clear- some drawings are not accurate in sizes so you have to spend a little time to visualize- but it wasn't difficult to understand. we messed up one step (the board underneath the drawer needed to be flipped over, and we just discovered that at the last step of putting up doors), but it wasn't difficult to fix it- we didn't have to tear everything apart and redo it. overall very impressed by the product and delivery. it holds shoes of winter or summer from a family of 3 maximum. We just put our winter shoes away in a box, use the cabinet for summer shoes only right now.", 
    "I am very happy with this shoe cabinet. A great product at a great price! good quality, sturdy, easy to assemble. I would definitely buy again. Overstock offers great products at a great price. Now I can hide the shoes, keep the shoes dust free, and have the place nice and neat.", 
    "A great way to hide shoes. Pleasing to the eye and great storage. Quite a bargain for the price. The only reason I rated it 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars is due to the hassle of putting the unit together. It wasn't the easiest task (says my husband).", 
    "Great for the price!! Happy to have a new home for my shoes!", 
    "I'll admit I was nervous about ordering furniture online. However, I couldn't be happier with this product! Nothing was damaged in the shipping process. Every piece was excellent! It took my husband about 3 hours to put it together. The instructions were clear. The shelves are sturdy and the drawers slide in and out very smoothly. Everything about this product exceeded my expectations! And it looks fabulous in my apartment.", 
    "exactly what i was looking for. my new puppy chewed about 10 pairs of my shoes, so this is perfect. also has 2 drawers on top for hats, gloves, etc. no more mess of shoes in from of the door.", 
    "This shoe cabinet was easy to put together (though I like doing that kind of thing) and I only needed minimal assistance from an extra set of hands. It is really heavy- poor UPS guy! The piece compliments my existing furniture and works well to hid the normal eruption of shoes near my doorway! The only complaint I have is that the drawer pulls are brushed silver while the cabinet handles are shiny. I did go out and purchase new brushed metal handles that were more my taste. Overall, great purchase.", 
    "Quality: pretty good, but finish is liable to eventually get worn off on edges assembly: good insructions but had to raise the magnets with shims in order to get the magnets hold doors tightly. In other words, the magnets don't align correctly with metal plates unless you make correction (best to add your own shims to raise magnets from undersurface) Usage: To fit big shoes, insert at angle.", 
    "The Five Shelf Shoe Cabinet was received promptly and without damage. The instructions were difficult to read and know what to do. The finished product was exactly what we expected. We are very pleaase.", 
    "Assembly instructions can be better. For an untrained person he/she is likely to mess it up. Before attaching it is a good idea to look at the diagram repeatedly so that the chances of error diminish", 
    "Looks as depicted in the picture. Was more challenging to assemble then anticipated. Pay close attention to the different screw types!", 
    "i am the one in the house to put all the furniture together, so when I read the reviews on the difficulties I really didn't think I would mind the challenge WELL the box arrived (extremely heavy), that was ok but the real fun came when the directions came out of the box!!!! IT TOOK FOREVER to assemble it !!! I'm use to putting Ikea furniture together and I thought this piece would be simular in time and ease BUT BE FOR WARNED, it took much longer b/c the really are no words to go with the directions! With that said, once this piece is put together it STORES ALOT and looks nice in my hallway, you would never shoes were hidden inside! GOOD LUCK !!.", 
    "Somewhat time consuming assembling, however once it's together, it's well worth it.", 
    "It's an OK product, serves its purpose, with some pros & cons to it - Purpose - I bought this piece to take the shoes off the floor and open shoe rack, out of reach of my toddler. It works well for female shoes, but not deep enough for male ones. Not functional for high boots either as one has to give up a lot of space (pretty much eliminates one shelf); - Shipment - the product was well packed, no broken pieces, but somehow the edge of one door was scuffed showing the plywood underneath thing cover; - Assembly - my recommendation would be to put it together using power tools. Otherwise it takes too long and leaves one with blistered hands. Took me 4 hours from start to finish with no power tools; - Quality - not the best, but not bad, best association I have is with **** furniture. It looks nice in a hallway & does what it's supposed to do - I no longer have to chase my kid who's running away chewing on my shoe!", 
    "We love this product, my wife is a genius at finding good stuff.", 
    "Takes about 3 hours to assemble, the package contained all the necessary pieces. The cabinet is simple and practical. Be careful when putting the front dors - they need to be placed properly from the beggining. The only observation is that there is no sliding system in place for the upper drawers, but this is not such a big issue. Overall I am very pleased with it.", 
    "I purchased this shoe cabinet for my grandson, who loves his shoes! He was so very thrilled to get this as a birthday gift. I love the top two drawers where he can put extra shoe laces, socks, etc. His parents are also impressed with the product! Very nice cabinet! Thanks from us all!!", 
    "I am pleased and recommend this product to others. The assembly took me 3 hrs. The instructions are informative.", 
    "I was looking for a shoe case and it was difficult to find one that is nice and with a good price. I came across this product and the design look very nice so I decided to order it. The package came and it was heavy. As we were building it, we could feel how cheap the material was! The wood is fragile, it chips and cracks. When we were done, the cabinet looked pretty nice but the drawers didn't close tightly and were poorly held by the cheap materials. I would not recommend this product. The product does not look like it will last for long", 
    "Lets face it, it's not heirloom quality furniture for that price, however, I needed a cabinet to \"puppy-proof\" my shoes and it works great! The cabinet is much taller than it appears online though, so keep that in mind. I put it together myself with no problems, but be sure to read the instructions first.", 
    "This fit the purpose--I needed a space to store office supplies in my home office. I would have preferred a color closer to oak. . .this makes the room more eclectic!!!", 
    "This piece is nice looking. It looks great in my son's room. The only thing is that my son's foot is a size 13 so you can't put the shoes in the right way you have to put them sideways because the doors would close properly.", 
    "Visible blemishes on top surface of the cabinet. It was noticed too late to send the shelf back. I guess I have to live with it now. As some satisfaction, Overstock returned $$$.", 
    "If i needed shoe storage space, i would buy another one.", 
    "This cabinet, once put together, has been good-looking. It was a good buy. It is a great height and sophisticated enough to stand in my entry way. I love that there are two drawers in addition to the storage below. The drawers are so handy for keys and small electronics like my camera and handicam. My few complaints or caveats would be these: 1) the handles and pulls for the drawers seemed slightly unsophisticated or plain and didn't seem to go with the the rest of the look of the cabinet. The handles and pulls had a bright shiny silver finish - a matte nickel or burnished bronze worked better for this dark of a cabinet. I ended up buying burnished bronze pulls and handles for the cabinet. 2) the unit has a tendency to tip, especially with both doors open. Be sure to anchor it to the wall. 3) putting the unit together was quite a chore and took several hours to complete. Be sure to give yourself at least half a day to put it together. 4) the interior or the cabinet has no ventilation and can get stinky with all the shoes enclosed inside. To combat this, we drilled about 15 holes in the back of the cabinet using a 1/4\" drill bit which has helped immensely.", 
    "worth the price except I had to pay someone to assemble it. Very nice looking", 
    "Very nice design for 20 pairs of shoes. The drawers are a little flimsy. Wish it would be easy to correct a mistake. (We put the right hand door on the left hand side and when we took out the door, we had broken the plastic hinge.) Once you put the doors in, you cannot take them out without ruining the hinges. It may help if extra plastic hinges are included in the parts.", 
    "I like the quality of this product. It's elegant looking piece.", 
    "Great value for the $$. We purshased one for me and then purchased a second one as my hubby decided he wanted one too. Assembly was a touch chellenging - instructions could've been better. Also, men's size 11 would have a challenge getting the doors closed... Other than that - love it!", 
    "Very pleased with this item and the ease of assembly. Perfect for shoes or anything you want to store. The 5 shelves are quite roomy! Highly recommend!", 
    "This is a nice-looking and functional piece of furniture. We bought two (one for a closet and one for our entry area). No one would know that the one that's out in the entry holds the kids shoes! Very good quality with plenty of space inside. I love the sock drawers up top. For men's shoes, we had to put them in sideways, so you are more limited in the number of pairs you can store. For women's shoes we were able to fit 20+ pairs. Assembly was easy with a drill, but I wouldn't recommend assembling it with hand tools only. Definitely another great buy from Overstock.com.", 
    "This is a great idea, especially for apartment residents. Looks very good in the entrance way and takes care of managing shoes. It can hold up to men's size 11 shoes comfortably. If you are debating between these and the other kind where the shoes are stored in a \"slanting\" manner, where the doors close upwards, then don't waste your time and get this! The two drawers are very useful for the day to day items, e.g. coupons, mail, keys. Please note this is made of MDF, so have reasonable expectation of its durability. If you take care of it, it will serve you for a long time. After about two years of use, one of my magnets came loose, but with a little bit of epoxy putty I was able to put it back in place. This is normal for MDF based furniture.", 
    "I ordered this shoe cabinet because My son bought a lot of shoes and we don't have a closet for shoe at the front door and when you open our front door there would be lots of pairs of shoes just sitting there, and it looked so messy .This cabinet has cleaned up our entryway quite nicely. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "The shelf cabinet was much bigger than I expected, but it was a good surprise. My daughter will be able to use it for years to come.", 
    "We needed a storage unit on our enclosed porch for garden shoes and other things like barbecue utensils and outdoor placemats and napkins.. This works great. We'll bring it indoors in the winter. My husband has size 12 shoes and they have to go in sideways to fit. We are happy with this purchase", 
    "pros: quality of wood is good. nice finish. cons: wood is not perfectly aligned, but that could be my own fault. DRAWERS DO NOT HAVE SLIDERS.", 
    "I'm pleased as peaches with this purchase. The quality is exceptional and the color is very complimentary. I've no doubt it will serve me well for many years. Thanks for a wonderful experience! :)", 
    "This product fit our needs just perfect. With two kids coming and going for different activities and sports - they are constantly changing shoes and leaving them at the door as they come in. Now I have a place to put them all and I don't have to look at a pile of shoes in the foyer! I also love the two drawers - now my husband has a place to put his keys and his wallet when he comes in the door instead of leaving them on the kitchen counter every night!", 
    "I am giving this a 4 star because one of my drawers did not fit properly. Also, it is made of MDF and for the price, it was decent enough.", 
    "I love my shoe cabinet. It is very sturdy and a nice piece of furnituire. Well put together.", 
    "The package arrived will protected and every piece was intact and in good quality. Assembly was easy and instructions were simple. The package parts for assembly were nicely labeled and even the nails, screws, etc were organized in order to prevent confusion. After assembly, the item felt sturdy and didn't look cheap. What prevented me from giving the item a five star rating would be the lack of tracking for the two top drawers. There is a peg on top of each to prevent it from dropping, but it would have been nice to actually have tracking.", 
    "This piece is exactly what we had been searching for - sleek, large enough for two person's worth of shoes, and with doors to hide them away. However, it took two of us 2 hours to put this together, which we weren't expecting. In the end, it was worth it because of the price, finished look, and functionality.", 
    "Overall, the product was a good buy. The description fit that which was on the site, except for the colour. I ordered Beech, but it was darker that I expected. It is pretty sturdy and doesn't take up much space in the room I placed it. Also, it would have been nice if the product came with cover-ups for the exposed screws on the side panels of the product. I guess I will try and something about that myself, as it is so obvious.", 
    "Space being an issue in NYC, I had my handyman mount this on the wall. Looks quite lovely in my bedroom. The parts were well packaged individually so you don't have to go through a million pieces to find what you need. Just be prepared to spend a good amount of time putting it together.", 
    "It took my husband and I about 45 minutes to put together. There are a lot of pieces but just take your time and keep all the pieces organized. The finished product looks great. We originally ordered the piece for my husband's shoes but now I would like to order a second cabinet for my shoes.", 
    "This piece took my husband about two hours to put together, which is not very long considering all the parts that came. It looks beautiful in my front entrance and the shoes are finally put away and hidden!! The drawers on top are an extra bonus for things like shoe horn, shoe polish, etc. We love it!", 
    "Easy assembly; good instructions with orderly packaging and numbering of all parts; the finished product is really nice.", 
    "I was looking at shoe cabinet near my door entrance. This product satisfies my needs with great look and finishing. It is perfect and have space for all kind of shoes and socks. Like it very much....", 
    "It's a excellent price for the big storage. I've been looking for shoe cabinet to place at the entrance, and this was perfect!", 
    "The instructions are 100% visual, no literature which leads to mistakes in the build process.", 
    "it was not hard to put together and it's good quality", 
    "I bought this shoe cabinet so we could keep our shoes off the closet floor and away from our puppy. It's so much easier to find shoes on shelves (and to put them away there) than it is to dig through a mess in the closet. Since it doesn't get a ton of use (opened maybe four times a day), I think the quality will be fine, but I don't see it lasting an awfully long time. My husband built it and he's good at that kind of thing, but the doors didn't match up quite right and generally the furniture looks sort of cheap. We have a dresser by the same company that's better quality. This cabinet was less expensive, though not much smaller than the dresser, so maybe that's why. It sits in the far corner of our bedroom, but I don't think I'd want it by my front door or anywhere highly visible. As far as a method of shoe organization goes, I love it and now I can't imagine living without one.My husband wears a men's US size 10 1/2 and some of his shoes barely fit the shelves, so keep that in mind. With his shoes on one side, we get about four pairs per shelf, but there's enough vertical space on each shelve for me to stack my flip flops, sandals, ballet shoes, etc.", 
    "Looks nice, works great. not great quality, but pretty good for particle board.", 
    "It took a little time to put together. It's a very nice and sturdy shoe storage. We are very pleased with this purchase and the price was just right.", 
    "We bought this cabinet for our newly finished basement. It looks beautiful. The quality cannot compare with the real wood, but it is ok with the price range. The draw is not crafted with sliding guide so it is relatively easy to slide out.", 
    "This item is just as pictured. Fairly easy to assemble and holds a lot of shoes.", 
    "my wife found these & wanted to get them for the front entrance to our house. delivery was prompt & the packaging was solid. me & my dad are pretty handy when it comes to putting things together & it took us about an hour to build each one (bought 2). overall we are very pleased with this product, it has a clean & stylish appearance.", 
    "My husband bought me this cabinet & I absolutely love it! We're already talking about purchasing another one :) It was exactly as pictured & described. I was able to get 20 pairs of my shoes in...the only thing I would have liked different is for ine shelf to be a little taller for my boots. Since it is completely enclosed, it is a good idea to put a box of baking soda in there!", 
    "this shop cabnet was just what Iwas looking for it works great", 
    "I am very glad I had read the reviews. The cabinet is great, but does not have very good directs on how to put it together. Someone had said to pull everything out and organize all of the pieces before starting and that is a very good idea. I am lucky I have a very handy husband. It says to conect piece 1 to piece 2 and none of the pieces are labled. Pull everything out and look it all over and you shouldn't have much trouble getting it together. Good Luck! I would of given it 5 stars if I could of put it together without help.", 
    "It looks great. Works great for small and large shoes. And the two top draws are and extra plus for storing small things. It's pretty tall though, so make sure you measure the height to make sure it will work in your space. It worked great for me.", 
    "Great furniture to have at home so shoes are not all over the place. I have a big family and whenever they get home, shoes are all over the place! So I saw this online when I was shopping for clothes on the Overstock website, and I jumped on it right away because I know it will help me a lot. It arrived in less than 3 days and had my husband assemble it which didn't take him long and there goes a nice she cabinet which saved me from my misery of shoes all around the house. I would of course recommend this to everybody that I know, great price with high qualities all around. Love my shoe cabinet a lot!", 
    "Putting the doors on this piece was a real bear. Piece broke off and now need to reorder. Very nice looking but will be better once I have the doos put on properly.", 
    "This is a fine, affordable cabinet. The color is very similar to the photo. There are two small drawers on the top and storage for way more than the number of pairs of shoes that are shown in the photo. The drawers kind of fall out when you open them so you have to be careful and the doors on the cabinet don't always close. The wood is a pressed variety and looks like it might nick easily. The screws are exposed on the side of the cabinet and don't look that attractive. It you are looking for a posh, high end shoe cabinet this is not it. On the other hand, we were looking for a shoe storage solution that hid all the shoes from site for our mudroom. It works perfect for this! It looks nice enough and seems like it should hold up for a while. It looks much better than our open shelving system that we had before! Plus, it's hard to beat free shipping! The directions were very short and not very helpful but my husband managed to get all the parts together. Be warned that it might be a challenge.", 
    "This is a great product for a great price. Took about 30 min for me and my husband to put it together, very well organized instructions. One little thing- the wood shelve that holds the top drawers has to have holes on the bottom. It does not specified anywhere and, of course, we put it wrong and had to redo it. No big deal. Cabinet looks great and really fits a lot of shoes, you can even stuck them up on top of each other. I wish I would buy it again, but I really don't need one any more, all our shoes are in there now.", 
    "Our family does not wear shoes in the house. So, all of our shoes end up on the floor by the hallway. Overall, this cabinet is a great idea and serves as an excellent way to get shoes off the floor and in one place. It is roomy and holds at least 3-4 pairs of shoes per shelf. There are five of us in our house and each of us has 2-3 pairs of shoes in the cabinet. The downside is that there is no ventilation and it gets a little stinky. We bought an air freshener to put in the cabinet and it has neutralized the odor pretty well. The cabinet is not the best quality wood I have ever seen, but it is functional and pretty durable. Totally worth the investment to me. I recommend this product without hesitation!", 
    "Our unit came and looks good. It was easy to assemble, however, one of the drawer fronts was drilled wrong and the drawer is a little crooked and won't quite slide in all the way.", 
    "before my house entry was such a mess with all my kids shoes, now my kids know exactly where they have to put there shoes and they like the idea. fast shipping, easy instruction, it took 2 hour to assemble. happy :)", 
    "This cabinet holds all of my family's shoes that were previously laying all over the floor of the mud room. It looks so much less cluttered and the color matched with the bench already in there. Love Overstock's products!!", 
    "I did not find any sizes for the shelf, I went ahead and ordered it anyway, I wanted it at my back door. These type of shelves are usually about 30-35 inches tall. This is to tall for the area I wanted. I did find a place for it thou and I am using it for storage for my computer items.", 
    "This is a bargain! especially comapred to the one I almost bought at a furniture store. I sceptic about buying this online at first but with the return policy I wasn't worried. It arrived in 3 days, easy to assemble about 30 mins or so, and wow! the quality is great. Very sturdy, and nice looking shoe cabinet. So of course I didn't return it becuase I very happy with it. It looks very nice, and no more scatterred shoes! I'm so glad I found this online, saved me a lot of money.", 
    "I LOVE my shoe cabinet(s) - yes I got two, and placed them on either side of the bed in my spare bedroom. One for winter shoes and one for summer shoes. They look great and I love them. These cabinets were a little challenging to put together, you need two people for sure. Be sure to obey the suggestion that you read all of the directions before starting. There are some errors that can be made that will cause you to dismantle to fix. The cabinets are sturdy and attractive - very happy that I got them.", 
    "We don't have enough room in our master closet for my shoes to fit, so we ordered this so that I could get them off of my office floor. Thankfully the furniture was just as advertized and it fits perfectly into our home. I wear a size 12 shoe, so the shelves aren't big enough for my shoes to fit straight into it. However, by turning them slightly to the side I'm still able to fit 15 pairs of shoes into it. The assembly wasn't difficult, although the instructions were definitely lacking in detail and clarity. About half of the pieces were clearly marked...had to sort through the others to make sure that I was using the right pieces. NOTE: they are written in red ink on the side of the pieces, but the markings are somewhat difficult to read (at least on the one I put together.) There are probably upwards of 40 or 50 screws that you'll use to assemble it, so using a power drill to assemble it will save you A LOT of time! One last note...save the color matched screws for the areas on the outside of the furniture.", 
    "I love the shoe cabinet that I bought, everything about it is great. I got mine in less than 5 days, and building it was not hard at all. Very good, and sturdy shelf for all my shoes, and almost all my shoes can fit inside, it's great piece of furniture. The wood, veneer or not, it's a very solid material, and very strong. I' impress with the quality I got for such little price, I would recommend this shoe cabinet to anybody who needs one. It's a great deal!", 
    "I just moved into my own apartment. No furniture and not alot of money but I really needed new stuff for my home. The shoe cabinet is a keeper. Im always having ppl over at my house and I hate when their shoes are all over the place. The cabinet was my answer. It looks great doesnt take up to much room and now I cant see everyones shoes laying around. Great quailty for the money and the assembly isnt to bad.", 
    "I looked at many shoe cabinets and found this one. I was little skeptical about quality but decided to buy it. Was happy with quality & can't beat the price.", 
    "I'm enjoying my shoe cabinet, it's great. I only paid so little for it, and received good service delivery, and good quality shoe cabinet. The assembly part was over half an hour but it was easy to follow. Now I have a very nice shoe cabinet where I can store all my shoes, I'm so glad I searched online and got exactly what I purchased and needed.", 
    "This is a great shoe cabinet. Stylish, lots of room, and very strong panels. Price is remarkable!, and I would highly recommend it! Good buy!", 
    "The quality of this product is good you have to be aware when assembling this unit to follow the assemble instruction carefully because remember you are working with particle board that do not like to be assemble and disassemble several times so with that in mind start assembling your project ,you will end up with a beautiful piece of furniture if you follow the instructions. First lay out all your parts first and figure out were all screws go before you start, and have a helper with you things will go much easy I put casters on mine also put rollers on drawers but you don't have to do that this was my preference.", 
    "This opens up my foyer so much! The package was so heavy, I needed to help the guy take it out of his truck. I have the mentality that the heavier, the better the quality. The instructions are horrible! I had to redo a few steps twice which wasted probably an extra hour. Overall, awesome product!", 
    "I had been looking for something that would hold/hide all the family shoes because we remove our shoes when we walk in the door.I had been using an unattractive one until I found this one!! I love it!! You can't beat the value!! Now my entryway is clutter free and beautiful!! Thank You Overstock.com!!", 
    "This cabinet is a ok product, not very impressive. If I know I would buy the more expensive one, maybe the quality would be better.", 
    "when I first received the heavy box, I wasnt informed that it was total assembly required. I called up the company to return the item, but found it would have cost me half of the item itself to ship it back. so I asked my nephew and his friend to put it together for me. To my surprise, it took them less than one hour and it looked like an expensive pc...Holds all of my shoes...so I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I bought 2 of these cabinets and placed them in my garage - they were perfect and fit most of my family's shoes. Each row fits about 4 pairs of shoes. The height is not adjustable to fit even ankle boots so I had to put them somewhere else. Nevertheless, they serve the purpose and kept our shoes dust-free and neatly stored in one place.", 
    "I've been looking for a product that would hold a number of shoes, looks great and you can't see the shoes. This product fits all those requirements. It did take my husband about 3 hrs, using a small power screw driver, to assemble .", 
    "The five shelf shoe cabinet lived up to my expectation. The most frusterating thing was how heavy the box was and how difficult it was to put it together. I got what I paid for and at least I have more room freed up in the apartment.", 
    "this cabinet is very usefull for my family.One problem is that cabinet is littlebit bigger than I thought but it very useful.", 
    "I'm very happy with my shoe cabinet it's perfect! just what I needed. The price, quality, and color is perfect. Very easy to set up, and UPS shipped it to me just a couple of days. Love it!", 
    "Such a great idea for my shoes. Better than those small little shoe racks that you set on the floor. I always trip over those. This cabinet, keeps all my shoes in a very neat and nice place. The cabinet itself has a really nice style to it and good in quality. I enjoy it very much.", 
    "Very helpful in storing all my shoes and Inever have to look around for my shoes again. The dark color is very nice and it was very easy to assemble. The instructions were easy to follow and it didn't take very long to assemble. The shoe cabinet is sturdy and not at all expensive. i love the shoe cabinet, never had one before and I'm very happy with this one. No more shoe rack hanging behind my door. yes!", 
    "I love this cabient for all my shoes, it keeps it in a nice place and you can't even tell that's a shoe cabinet, that's why I like it. I'm also able to use the top portion for all my other things in the room and it works out perfectly, very useful. The quality is good and it didn't take my boyfriend very long to assemble the cabinet, and I even helped and it was easy. I highly recommend this shoe cabinet, very useful, and the price was also great, didn't spend a lot at all.", 
    "Very useful for all of my shoes, and it keeps my shoes from getting lost around the house. I've set it right next to the stairs so it's easy for me to just get my shoes and go. Easy to assemble and very sturdy for such a bargain price shoe cabinet. Very useful for me, I'm thinking of buying one more if I buy more shoes. Thank you overstock for such great ideas!", 
    "It has a lot of room for my shoes, and it keeps it in a neat place. The cabinet has a nice dark color to it which matches my bedroom set and it's sturdy and the purchase price was such bargain. I assembled the cabinet with my sister and it didn't take us very long at all just like the delivery it was just a couple of days.", 
    "Good quality and very nice looking. Good size, can fit 4-5 pairs of shoes per shelf. Adjustable shelves to accomodate boots or high-heel shoes. Good value for themoney. Requires assembly - a few hours of work.", 
    "I like it for my shoes, it has the room that I need and I like how it didn't take me a long time to set it up. I can fit about 25+ pairs of shoes which is perfect. It only took a few days for the shoe cabient to arrive and you'll be happy with the quality and how sturdy the shoe cabient is. I highly recommend it.", 
    "When saw this online I couldn't overstock makes shoe cabinet that look so stylish! so of course I bought a couple for my collection of shoes. I'm glad I bought it, it was delivered it to me in just a couple of days, easy instructions for assembly and the quality and all the room for my shoes is great!!!", 
    "Great room for a good amount of my shoes, I have a lot of shoes so any cabinet that's able to keep it organized is great. i bought two and it's great. I got the dark color one and I like. Very sturdy cabinet for my shoes and it has all the room that I need. Great stuff.", 
    "I can't believe how nice it looks, it doesn't even look like a shoe cabinet. The shipping was fast and so was the assembly. The quality of the cabinet is good and it can hold a good amount of shoes.",

So satisfied with my purchase, it came fast and it only took me 20 minutes to create all the pieces together into a master piece shoe cabinet. Love it.", 
    "Great for all my shoes. It was practically on sale and the I received it early which was good cuz I was going on vaca. But anyways I assembled it myself before I left for my trip and it was not bad, easy. Shoes look grea and safe inside and the panels that hold the shoes is pretty thick, solid so no worries about falling through.", 
    "My girfriend couldn't believe that I bought two of this for her. I wanted to surprise her so I bought and it arrived right and it took me about an hour for both to set up. My girlfriend loves it, now she can get rid of the hanging thing for her shoes that she has behind the door that always falls off and mest up out door because of all the weight of the shoes. She's happy so that's cool. I paid less for it and those things are very sturdy and the wood is actually solid.", 
    "i read one of the reviews and said that some shoes may not fit but you know I needed something fast and this was affordable than anything else and it comes in two shades and I got the darkk one. Anyways i got it at the same week I purchased the item and then after a 30-40 minutes of assembly i was very surprised my shoes fit and I'm a size 11 men so I guess some consumers are exaturating. Poor sports.", 
    "The Shelf Shoe is perfect for storage. The Quality is no good. putting every piece together easy can break.", 
    "I set up for my daugher before she got home from school and it only took me no more than 20 mintues. When she got home she loved it! she even saw how neatly I've placed her shoes and she loved the way it looked. I like it too, now her closet is not full of shoes, and plus she likes it because it doesn't look like a shoe cabinet. I like it because the price is great and the quality is awesome!", 
    "I bought two for my room, they are great, i turned a pile of shoes that wouldnt stay on my other shelves, into neatly stored shoes, that stay clean and dust free in these cabinets. and make my bedroom more orginized. would buy them again and would highly recommend it. Good price and good sturdy wood that provide great support.", 
    "Easy process in ordering it online, fast delivery service, and the set up was also easy and only took a short amount of time. The quality is also great ,and it provides all the space I need for my shoes that I don't use during certain season.", 
    "Fit perfectly in the corner of my walk in closet, very sturdy and attractive. You don't realize that it is a shoe cabinet until you open it, and it provides all the storage for shoes that I needed.", 
    "I got my shoe cabient so fast and it's just the right amount of room for my shoes. Easy to assembly and very sturdy.", 
    "I'm very happy with my shoe cabinet, what's not to like....The delvery is fast and so is the set up!, and the qality is more than what I paid for it so it's great!", 
    "It is quite easy to set up with the instructions that came in the box. It has pictures of each part oft the cabinet and illustreations in how you should set the item and so on and so on. great directions. All in all the cabinet is of good price and you get so much quality and it is also sturdy where it stays on its place without rocking when you open the door. Very sturdy thing.", 
    "It was easy to put together, delivery was very very cheap, and I got good quality cabinet for my shoes that's all I can say about that...",

My shoes are very expensive and I make sure I take care of them and this is one way for me to do that. the cabinet was very affordable, didn't hurt my pocket at all. Glad I got it and I only paid *** for delivery, how great is that.", 
    "Very affordable, easy to assemble, and overstock provided a good service wtih the delivery. The cabinet can fit a great amount of shoes and everyone is right it is made out of real solid wood that's sturdy and a beautiful colored finish.", 
    "this shoe cabinet is a great idea, it has been very helpful in keeping all my shoes in a neat place and very easy access storage. I never have to go in the garage again and go through all my boxes of shoes and messing it up, now I have a relaible shoe cabinet that's sturdy and the quality is great especially with the money spent on it.", 
    "i own lots of shoes and I neede a good quality cabinet that will be able to handle all of it. So I bought 3 because that's all I needed since I have a few already for my other shoes. The 3 cabinets that arrived, came in 3-5 days and I thought it would take me a very long time for 3 cabinet but it came with easy to follow instructions and it tooks me a little over an hour for all 3 so I was very glad. The cabinet I must say is of good quality and I have a few more rooms in one of them so I'm happy. Now my shoes has a safe home.", 
    "My shoe cabinet is the perfect for me and my boyfriend, we share it and we like it a lot. I mean not all my shoes are in there only the ones we use oftern at a daily basis. The shoe cabinet is very sturdy and it looks great by the stairs.", 
    "great cabient, I can store all my shoes and still have room for new ones. My boyfriend set it up for me and only took him a lil over 15 mins so great. It's also sturdy and I like the dark wood color it looks great. It doesn't even look like a shoe cabinet which is what's great about it, it looks nice.", 
    "This cabient has help me organize my shoes where I don't need to look for them everywhere. I saw it online and showed up at my door step within a few day, quite fast. and it was easy and fast for me to assemble. I only had a glass of wine and I finished assembling the cabinet already so anyways it was fast. But it's been very helpful and it keeps me from loosing my shoes.", 
    "perfect product and very detailed alignment of the cabinet. Lots of storage space for all kinds of shoes and sturdy in its place. I love my shoe cabi.", 
    "Oh my gosh the packaging was crazy! It's like opening a gift, it comes with lots of packaging. I guess that's good so it will prevent the cabinet from getting damage. But after all the packaging, I discovered a great cabient with quality made of all wood material so I'm for sure I paid for something good.", 
    "Cabinet is great, lot of room for my shoes and each cabinet is solid and sturdy so yah I like it, I got my moneys worth.", 
    "I bought four for my garage so my family can store all there shoes but keep the garage neat at the same time. This cabinet is what helped me do that. There's 6 of us in the family and you can only imagine how many shoes are stored in each cabinet, and still it stands strong. The quality is great that's why it will last for a life time. Great deal.", 
    "I bought mine about 5-6 months and love it! Great ability to endure heavy shoes and can hold lot of them. I'm happy that I bought this, because I almost bought a shoe rack from some store like my sister did and hers broke and she just bought a couple of months ago. I told her where I bought mine and she's thinking of purchasing it.", 
    "The product arrived in good shape. The assembly took about 2 hours by 1 person. You need to follow the instructions to avoid redoing parts of it. But once it's assembled, it looks great in my entry way. Held way more shoes than I expected. It fits a variety of shoes, the only drawback is that it doesn't really fit my thigh-high boots, but no biggie since I only own one but it fits all other sizes boots. I'm quite pleased with the style, the quality and I don't think it is overpriced at all given how nice it looks and it keeps my condo very tidy.", 
    "It stays in the family room next to the garage door and it's perfect when the kids or my husband comes home and goes throught the garage, they can just put their shoes in the cabinet and keeps my floor clean. I have 3 kids and they have about 3-4 pair of shoes that they use throughout the week and so does my husband and myself and the cabinet holds it ground. Very sturdy and food quality and I like that it does not look like a shoe cabinet. So it hides the shoes and the family room look tighty.", 
    "The packing was great to make sure it arrived without damage - few nicks here and there but nothing owrth getting upset over, assembly went well (about an hour by myself) with one exception - there is no back piece (missing from box) to keep the cabinet stable and square...however, this works out as my location for the cabinet does the job and because there is no back my husband's size eleven work boots and sneakers fit. The only other downfall is the drawers have no glides but they still function well enough. Overall I am happy with the purchase and would reccommend this if you, like me, could not afford a higher priced cabinet.", 
    "I bought 2 months ago!!! and placed it in the garage and I love it! good quality shoe cabinet and the shelfs inside is very steady and solid. I love it!", 
    "The finished product is great after all the pieces are put together. I'm a female and didn't not have the patience to put this together so I had my boyfriend do it- took him over three hours! Atleast I don't have to store my shoes under my bed anymore!", 
    "I can't believe that for the price I paid for the shoe cabinet, the quality and sturdiness is great! You can only imagine how many pairs of shoes I have in my cabinet and still standing strong. This thing is for sure made out of real wood because the parts are very heavy when I was putting it together, which by the way was easy! I'm thinking of really buying another one for other use. I'm happy that I bought my shoe cabint from overstoc because it came fast when I really needed it the most.", 
    "Enjoying my new shoe cabinet.....it came in 3 days and I asked my boyfriend to assemble it and he didn't have any trouble at all. I love it, it fits a lot of my pumps and it's very sturdy. So glad I bought it.", 
    "Perfect shoe cabinet especially with limited space. I like it because the material used to assemble this cabinet is made out of solid wood that's why is so sturdy and can take all the shoes you want to place inside. With the assembly I can see that others experienced the same easy and fast process, it was easy becasue the instructions helped out a lot with detailed pictures to guide you.", 
    "I bought this product to solve the problem of lost shoes at our house. My children were always looking for their shoes as we were heading out the door. Also, it definitely tidy up the place. The assembly wasn't difficult for DIY furniture. Stands very sturdy and I haven't had any problem with it, been an owner of this cabinet for 7 months now. Excellent choice Overstock.", 
    "a nice cabinet considering that it's pressed particle board and not solid wood, but it is still very heavy (about 90 lbs) and cumbersome once assembled. Looks very nice though and is very functional. A little overpriced, but still cheaper than you'd get in other stores.", 
    "Very good and very strong cabinet. Very easy to assemble, it took 2 hours with help of my friend and my son. Great item for shoe storage in entryway.", 
    "I was looking for for something nice for my expensive shoes so they stay in good shape and then I can across this wonderful cabinet. I bought three in the dark color and love it! Exactly what I had in mind. The shelf inside is stable and strong which is great so it does not fall through. I had my brother put it together and it took him about an hour for the three cabinets so I think that's good considering there's 3. But now my lovely collection of shoes are in a safe home. Thank you OVERSTOCK!", 
    "I love my shoe cabinet, every thing fits!! delivery and assembly easy and fast. I paid less than what I thoght I would spend for this kind of stuff. good quality cabinet, realy like it.", 
    "This cabinet was easy to put together. took me about 2 1/2 hrs. Instructions would have been better if some of the instructions were in words. I put shoes and books in it and I am happy because it has served it's purpose and looks nice in my foyer. Some of the veneer came off while putting it together. I do wish it was made better. Overall though, I am satisfied.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Blends with my existing furniture.", 
    "Held way more shoes than I expected! It arrived early and in good shape. the assembly took less time than expected. It's of course sturdy and strong quality, I'm glad that I bought it.", 
    "The product arrived in a week and in good condition. Setting the whole thing by myslef took a good hour because I was doing other things. It holds quite a few pair of shoes, because it contains good quality wood that is sturdy and I like the closing doors which makes the surroundings look neat and organized. I'm thinking of buying another one just in case I buy more shoes.", 
    "This is a spacious shoe cabinet which was easy to assemble. For the price, it is a good buy. The only complaint I have, is that it scratches easily so be careful with it.", 
    "Wow, I was impressed! It was packed extremely well. Like others said, assembly was a breeze and only about 1/2 hour just like the delivery service it was a breeze before 7 days. The quality of the wood is extremely solid, and color finish is nice and clean. The shelfs inside is sturdy and it can hold any type of shoes, and it looks like I paid a lot of money for it. Impressive shoe cabinet.", 
    "The cabinet back panels were broken on the edges - probably happened during shipping. Also a number of scratches were found on the shelves and closing doors. Overstock should take care to provide better packaging during shipping.", 
    "I didn't buy this for my shoes, I read a lot of books so I use it for that. I tell yah, the quality and the sturdyness of the panels is pretty good. I had someone else assemble it for me and they didn't take very long just like the shipping. I store a lot of books in this cabinet and I'm glad that I paid less for great and strong quality.", 
    "I bought the dark brawn one. After I put them together, its look really exceeds my expectation. Unlike most of other products in this price range, the drawers use the real wood. What I mean is ususally the bottom of the drawer is made of a piece of thin wood, but this one actually uses very sturdy thick wood. I am very happy with this produce. Pros: nice finishing; two drawers at the top can be used for keys, coins, letters, etc; totally worth the money Cons: take 2-3 hours to to assemble.", 
    "Nicely done w/ the fast delivery and easy assembly. I wanted to be able to find and access my shoes quickly, and not have them laying around in my closet. This is a nice piece of furniture which works well to organize shoes. Mine is in my walk-in closet, but it could sit in a room as a piece of furniture. I like shoe cabinet, it keeps me organize and the quality is very exceptional.", 
    "This shoes has helped a lot of my kids from loosing their shoes. Ever since I bought this item, I don't hear my kids complaining in the morning anymore. This shoe cabinet storage holds a lot of shoes, and it is very stable. It was easy for me to install, so that's even better for me. I'm so glad that I bought this shoe storage, my mornings are a lot more peaceful now. Thank you.", 
    "Nice looking piece of furniture, the design and ease of use is great. The shoe cabinet itself definitely makes a difference and keeps the hallway alot more tidy. One of the parts broke, but it was replaced by Overstock three days after i emailed my notice to them, Very good customer service and the product is superb!", 
    "This product is amazing, a lot of my family likes this item that I bought. They like the fact that it looks like a regular cabinet, but is acutally for shoes. I like a lot I bought two of them, and all my shoes, including my boots, and my snowboarding shoes fits inside. Very strong even when sometimes I put other shoes on top of each other. The other one that I have I use is in my living room as a storage for books, magazine that family leave around. I really like this cabinet, you practically use it for anything even though is for shoes. It has a nice look to it, and the quality in how strong it is, is very good.", 
    "I needed something for my entry to keep our shoes contained. I had been searching for a while and this was really the look I wanted. Size wise it is great - a little taller than I wanted but that was my mistake in measuring but the depth is perfect for what I needed. It is very heavy when delivered had a few nicks in the \"wood\" but nothing too serious. The quality is so-so pressboard but the screws didnt always feel like they grabbed the \"wood\" must use the glue included and more. The instructions are what they are just pictures. Also be careful putting the nails in the back board, no guide and we did put 2 through that went straight through into the cabinet, and they are difficult to get back out wihtout damaging the finish. All in all its pretty sturdy and will serve its purpose well. I would have hoped for a bit better quality of the pressboard but Im hoping that it will last a few years.", 
    "love it! delivered in great condition. fits men size 11.5. looks modern and sleek.", 
    "I only intended to purchase one but after organizing all my shoes, I had realized the shoe lover in me. Obviously, I realized I needed more storage. One in the guest bedroom, while the other is in the front hall. For the money they do look lovely and I can fit in plenty of shoes, was easy to put together, the instructions were a bit vague in one place, but it is very easy to work out what goes where. Its a definite must have buy and would look the part in any home.", 
    "I've been looking for a shoe storage for a long time. This one satisfies most of my requirements, I like it very much! The reason I don't give a five star is because there are a few scratches on the front. Other than that, it's great!", 
    "I ordered this for my apartment and it looks great. It is quite big but it is still perfect for my space. It was easy to put together and stand solid and looks great. You can't tell it's not solid wood because it's crazy heavy like real solid wood once I was done with the assembling, trust me! Order one yourself and find out!", 
    "This cabinet may not made of super solid wood material, but I am telling you, it took no effort to assemble, seems sturdy to me, price is dirt cheap, and looks great. It may or may not last for the next 10 years but even if it only lasted for the next 2-3 years or so, I'd buy it again! It's a super buy.", 
    "This was a terrific buy for the money. I don't have anything different to say than any of the good reviews on here...so I'll keep it short. Buy it if you want something to tidy up your shoes collection.", 
    "Slim and compact, just what we needed. Arrived less than 5 days after ordering. Well packaged, no chance of damaged in transit - even with UPS. The product works very well and I wouldn't mind owning a few more for each room in the house, but of course that'll be costly so we'll just have to do with 1 for now. Definitely worth the price.", 
    "Put together on my own in one evening quite easily. Best to build it near location where it is to be sited to avoid carrying upstairs etc as quite heavy. Can fit plenty of pairs in. Overall, very happy with this, would def recommend!", 
    "I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this product. Most customers claimed that the product came damaged but i decided that my need to tidy up my entryway was worth the chance. Needless to say the product did arrive damaged. It wasn't too bad or noticeable so i decided to keep it anyway. it also came in quite a few pieces so putting it together was a challenge. Overall it did a wonderful job in clearing my entryway and it really does store lots of shoes. the top two cabinets are great for storing mail- keys etc... and although it's a cheap product it doesn't look like it is.", 
    "it took several hours to put together and none of the pieces were labeled. for a few extra dollars, I think we could have found something from target or ikea. the product is fine for the price. it is too small for mens shoes (size 10 1/2)....they have to be turned on it's side. some of the pices were nicked at the corners (but we just touched it up with those wood colored markers)", 
    "It's sad that we had to keep this in our condo's garage instead of our front doorway because we are so limited in space. It looks real nice and works wonderfully. My husband no longer complains about his missing sandals or shoes. A very useful product for every household.", 
    "This is a fantastic little cabinet, and my husband and I didn't have any problem with the assembly aside from having to use the first 25 minutes identifying all the parts and screws. Other than that all good - and no problems with chipping, denting - Everything in tip top shape. THANK YOU Overstock! this definitely tidy up my hallway and no more shoes being kicked around the entrance area.", 
    "All the parts were clearly identifiable and the instructions idiot proof. Solid cabinet but the top two drawers could be a bit bigger. Even that I still think it is worth the money paid.", 
    "A million thank you for providing the almost the most sensible assembly instructions ever produced with clear and easy to follow numbering and alphabetical labeling of each pieces and plastic bags. Not a million and ONE thank you just because, words with pictures would been much much better. Bottom line is that the product looks nice and neat. exactly what we needed to keep in the hallway to keep shoes tidy.", 
    "This is a great, solid shoe cabinet for the money. It was fairly easy to put together, despite some parts that were incorrectly labeled. That said, though, if you read it through all the way as they recommend, look at the pieces and make sure to attach each pieces correctly, you will avoid doing what I did, which was to put it together and take it apart about 2x. The good news is the cabinet is solid, sturdy and really looks good The cabinet feels like it should cost more.", 
    "The cabinet is simply wonderful once it is put together. Getting there is a bit of a challenge. The materials are labeled wonderfully, but the instructions are only pictures. I hooked one piece in upside down by accident, and then made things more difficult when I put the doors on. It was already nailed in place so there was no turning back. The one part of the magnet was not on the instructions at all, but the impressions were there to easily screw them in. The cabinet looks great, and is very sturdy. You can actually fit 20 pairs of adult shoes. That is fabulous.", 
    "The cabinet looks good and has taken away the clutter from my hallway. I have kept a basket on top to hold my umbrellas, caps, etc. The only downside is that the top scratches very easily. We also received a chipped top but it was too much trouble to return it. All in all a good buy and would recommend it.", 
    "I have bought several of these for various furnished rental and vacation units - even for my own home. Very good quality. Definitely worth the money spent. Great looks and very functional. A great value. Everybody love it!", 
    "This piece is the perfect size for a hallway or even a walk in closet. If you have a regular closet, it might be a bit too big. Measure before you buy! Plenty of storage and crisp design. It's quite substantial weight wise, much more so than you'd think at this price point! Functionality and clean lines all at a fantastic price! What a bargain! I love it!", 
    "This is a great cabinet It looks just like the picture online. We're not using it to store shoes like the many others, we're actually using it in our office to store office supplies. It's great and fit the area we designated for it like a glove! We all appreciate a versatile and functional cabinet such as this!", 
    "The shoe cabinet is everything I thought it would be. It hides the shoes and protects the walls. The assembly instructions were easy to follow, and all the parts were clearly labeled. The only thing I would change is the hardware used for the handles. They give the cabinet an older feel (kinda like from the 70s). The finish (I got the coffee bean color) is a little easy to tear, so be careful during assembly. One last note: There were a lot of small packing pieces/particles on the parts when you open the box. I vacuumed up the particulates as I removed each piece from the box to prevent it spreading all over the house or me inhaling it as I assembled. I like having the 2 drawers at the top, but it would have been nice if there were tracks to guide each drawer out smoothly. (Although, that probably would have increased the price.)", 
    "Great for its purpose. I bought 2 to put side by side (big family). Neat and tidy for the hallway. If you don't want dirt on the floor and miss-match shoes - you should get this cabinet. Fits almost all shoe sizes, I'm a size 9 and still has much room to spare.", 
    "Absolutely loved the storage cabinet. Bought coffee bean color for the hallway. Looks very elegant and modern. Fits A LOT of shoes and all sized man as well. Loved so much bought another one in tan color for the bedroom just for my own shoes alone. Looks greats, would never know its a shoe cabinet and with easy access. Top drawers are a little cheap, but overall very much satisfied with these pieces.", 
    "I bought this as we're a family of 3 and it's a good size for our family, although I will probably be buying one more just for my daughter in her room for her shoes. To summarize this product: good size, nice color, sturdy, a bit long to assemble. Be quite honestly, I love it a lot. Even if I have to pay a bit more for it I still think it's worth it still. Will definitely recommend this shoe cabinet.", 
    "Want to tidy up your place? Get this shoes cabinet! No more shoes lying around? Get this shoes cabinet! No more sucking shoe laces up the hoover? Get this shoes cabinet. I'm not going to lie and say that it didn't took my boys and I hours to put together, but for what this cabinet does - I'm willing to buy another one and take another shot at the assembly - only I have more space for another one........", 
    "Bought this to tidy up my apartment. Looks really smart and shoes fit in nicely. Can fit plenty of pairs in. Definitely a great little shoes cabinet. Not difficult to put together if you read the instructions carefully. Overall, I am super pleased and would definitely recommend it.", 
    "Definitely one of the best shoe storage solutions you can get for the price!", 
    "It is a very useful cabinet, is very good for the money and does exactly what the book says. Keeps shoes out of sight!! Could be used to tidy away more than shoes too!", 
    "I was going to write a review for this product the day after I finished assembling the product. i don't have a drill or any power tools, so when putting this together had to rely on an \"all-in-one\" kind of screwdriver. I was going to give 2-3 stars, but after having this furniture for several weeks...well I like it =) Pros: 1.) All pieces come numbered so you can easily identify what pieces go together when following directions 2.) Good directions 3.) Good solid, wood 4.) Sturdy 5.) Cleared out my hall full of shoes Cons 1.) Lot of pieces! 2.)Tough to assemble in a small space. 3.) if you don't have a drill/power tools, and just have a hammer and screw driver, ready for a long day At the end, it took me 3 hours to assemble, maybe a bit more cause I screwed up also. But note i had a very small space to assemble this and no power tools. I think with enough space and tools...you can do it in half my time But I'm happy with the overall product. It's sturdy, good looking, and fits 20-30 pairs of shoes (as long as you properly use all the space!). I'm happy with the product...and yes - I'd go through the torture of assembling this product again if I had to!!", 
    "Easy to put together, well worth the money to make my hall alot tidier. Even the kids have taken to putting their shoes away. Would recommend it.", 
    "This is a great way to store shoes in closets or inside the house. It is cleverly designed and well made. Do measure your closet space or where ever you are planning on placing it. I'm hoping to get one more for my daugther closet, I love it so much! I proudly show it off to all my friends and would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "Wish i had got one of these alot sooner. All our shoes were scattered all over the place before now they are all neatly placed. Although we have this cabinet out of sight, the finish quality is good enough for it to be on open display. The product works very well. The doors have one strong magnet each to keep the door shut but it is no trouble to open - it's smooth. Took a little while to assemble, but my husband said it was easy enough. Overall, it is a pretty neat shoes cabinet that probably could work for other purposes too. Very good buy.", 
    "Bigger than I thought. Nice quality and roomy. Looks like a nice piece of furniture.", 
    "This shoes cabinet is practical and cool looking. The drawers on top are very handy too for mails and keys. Assembly doesn't take anymore time than any usual built it yourself furniture so no complaints on that department. Packaging was great too so no words there. Nope, can't think of anything I don't like about this shows cabinet.", 
    "i knew i had bought a good product when it was delivered and weighed 50 lbs! so no cheap flimsy wood products.the only problem i ran into was missing a whole section of screws within the package,so i had to hit a store to find some to finish the cabinet..it is a great piece of furniture and suited my needs perfectly well worth the money", 
    "Boght this for my townhouse entry way. Love the 2 drawers since we used to have lots of stuff kids brought from school laying on top of our old shoe storage. The drawers becomes the transition space that keeps the entry way looking orderly.Fairly easy to assemble. The parts leave room for marginal error so even if you did not put the door in right the first time, it is easily adjustable.Bought the birch color option, Since it is hard to match the color to the decor/furniture around it exactly, I pick a mat under the shoe storage to add an accent color and blend the piece in. The mat also serves as the second dirt trap. The only word of caution is to measure your space (particularly the height) to make sure the size fits your need.Overall a great piece.", 
    "I just got my shoe cabinet Saturday. I love everything about this shoe cabinet the quality and it was pretty simple to put together. I did it myself and yes I am a woman. All the other bad reviews was nonsense, this piece looks good and did not look cheap. I got mine right before it sold out. I highly recommend this product to everyone, you won't be disappointed. Btw...none of my pieces was damage, packaging was amazingly done. Every piece of this product was in perfect condition. Keep up the great job OVERSTOCK. I will be returning very soon. ;-)", 
    "This shoe organizer definitely holds lots of shoes, from heels to gym shoes in male and female sizes. It's not as sturdy as I hoped, but so much better than several others I've seen around. It's great for apartment living. Hides your shoes away and looks just like a office or bedroom dresser. I think its a good purchase, just don't expect it look like a fancy piece of furniture.", 
    "I love our new shoe cabinet. It was very easy to assemble as long as you have an electric screwdriver. It is very aesthetically pleasing and sturdy. I love that there are no more shoes on the floor!", 
    "I was looking for a shoe cabinet that doesn't take up too much space and looks good. This Five Shelf Shoes Cabinet with Storage serves the purpose. I bought this one for my kids' shoes but if you are looking to fit an adult size female/male shoes, the shelves are definitely wide enough too. I was able to put it together in about an hour or so - not easy but not too difficult. So far it holds a good amount of shoes and very sturdy.", 
    "My husband put it together within an hour so, it keeps my shoes very organized and the cabinet helps our place look organized. We ordered two, one for our closet and one for our entry way. I have a lot of stilettos and it fits nicely in there. Its easy to store doesn't need a lot of space, so still have a lot of room left for more shoes shopping. This cabinet works great for my purpose. Will recommend it.", 
    "Contrary to some other reviewers, I found this item to not be worth the price paid. It was difficult to put together (some items were labeled and some where not). Screws sometimes did not \"catch\" which leads me to believe over time we'll have some sturdiness issues with this item. There were already nicks in multiple places on the cabinet when we received it as well. (I think the packaging was poor and the items were not well protected in transit.). This is a VERY heavy piece of furniture. Of note, make sure that this will fit your shoes. It is fine for smaller shoes...but my son's size 12s must go in sideways as they are too long otherwise--so check the measurements. Overall, I expected more quality for the price of this item. It will do (it is in my mudroom) but this is a rare occasion when I think I made a purchase choice off of user reviews and was not satisfied with the product.", 
    "For the price this is a solid and attractive cabinet. Can holds lots of shoes and boots. Love that the shelves are movalbe to fit different sizes.", 
    "shoe cabinet is awesome, only thing, couple of \"dings\" in the door, not to difficult to assemble, looks great, such a neat addition to my family room, shoes put away, no more pile of shoes in doorway", 
    "Like all the customers have mentioned, this piece is a good piece of furniture. Classy looking. They have now labeled each part/panel for easy ID. They packaged the product a bit carefully yet some of the corners still nipped and chipped. But nothing major damage. Overall, function-wise, its excellent. Looks-wise, its classy. Putting it together is a bit challenging but not too difficult. Some of the reviews scared me but when we put it together, it was not as difficult as some reviewers' experience. I highly recommend this piece. You may even use it as clothes storage and other type of storage. Very functional.", 
    "This is a very nice looking shoes cabinet. Very sleek in the design, looks the best on this website and other websites I looked at. We got ours within one week of ordering it, we order the beech color. Fits nicely in our closet. It's not the smaller cabinet, but it is the right size for our closet and I just love how i can organize my shoes and not having to go look for the \"other\" pair all the times. Excellent quality, well worth the money spent.", 
    "I ordered the coffee bean color, it is a very nice rich espresso color. Looks and feel very solidly made; therefore, not much to complaint about the craftsmanship. The height is just right for seems like most type of shoes. I'd stored boots and they fit nicely in the cabinet. Overall, the product is worth the money spent.", 
    "My sister and both got the beech color shoes cabinet and we love it very much. Very convenient and neat looking. The kids use to toss their shoes at the hallway near the door all the time, now there is a place for us to put their shoes in there. It just makes the entrance area much cleaner and more neat. Expecially those rainy days where shoes are all muddy, just have them wipe it on the rug and store it in the cabinet. Works great! I am very pleased with the product. Very sturdy and inexpensive compare to all other of the same quality product. The drawers work for umbrellas for a raining days too, especially these days california weather been so gloomy. Good product and I will recommend this to anyone.", 
    "I am happy with the five shelf shoes cabinet. I browsed through almost the whole shoes cabinet sections and I have to say this one is probably the best looking one. Read some bad, decent and good reviews for it and still decided to buy it. Got my order and I am glad that I had bought it. There were some issues with a few of the parts, but I think it was because the outside packaging was a little damaged, but I contacted Overstock and they were able to help me take care of the problem right away. They had the warehouse send me new parts and I got it within a couple of days. Put the product together, and I have to say that I am very pleased with the final results. Spacious shelves and very sturdy. We're putting it at the entrance hall, so that we an use the two drawers for keys and garage remotes. Will recommend this product", 
    "This is a great cabinet for shoes or anything else that will fit on a 12 inch wide shelf that you want behind doors. I would not call it \"fine\" furniture but it's also not priced that way. If you want \"fine\" pay more and get real wood. For me this is a very good deal for a nice looking, sturdy utilitarian piece of furniture that does what it says it will do - hold lots of shoes. As with other reviewers my cabinet came with damaged or scratched pieces, but Overstock did a great job of getting replacement pieces to me in a very timely manner. Assembly is not difficult - just follow the picture instructions step by step. I did it alone but do admit that another pair of hands would have been helpful at times. I had no problems with pieces fitting or lining up together. I did put one piece in backwards and had to undo and redo steps so pay attention to the relationship of pieces to one another in the pictures. All in all it took me a leisurely 2 hours. Overall, I am very pleased with this cabinet.", 
    "The item arrived in excellent condition and on time. Appeared exactly as I saw it on the picture.", 
    "I am in love with this shoes cabinet. It fits perfectly at the corner space in my room. I've find ways to utilize everything this cabinet has to offer. I'm using the top panel for addtional display space for picture frames and the two drawers to store books and notepads. The quality and finish is very nice so it doesn't look like the typical cheap shoes cabinet so you can definitely showcasing it out in the open. So in addition to using it for my shoes, it's useful in other ways. I'm happy that the door is closed shut even with my pointy toe shoes are in there. The only complaint is the assembly time, which takes about 1 1/2 hour because it has more than a few parts to put together. That's is no biggy really. Overall very pleased.", 
    "This shoe cabinet holds up to 20 adult pairs, 4 on each shelf. I'm very satisfied with this product. So, let me talk about dislikes. The magnets on the front large doors are a bit weak so doors are easily open if you pull them. The upper drawers are not based on bottom wheels. So if you think of smooth opening and closing of the drawers, this is not the case. You will need 1~2 hour work for assembly.", 
    "I'm more likely to read reviews when I buy something online, so I wanted to share mine after purchasing this shoes cabinet. I like the look and functionality. Organize and most importantly looks so much better than scattering all your shoes around the entrance area or even in the backyard. It works well, and even full of boots, it doesn't flop open if you push the drawer all the way in. Assembly took quite a bit of time, because it does have a lot of pieces to put together but with some patience this baby will be a piece of eye candy in the end. I like this shoes cabinet a lot.", 
    "We really like having the shoes that used to clutter the front hallway hidden in this cabinet However, although the piece(s) were well packaged, the corners of the partical board arrived dented, and there was a slight chip in one of the doors, but a brown sharpy market made these nicks almost invisible. Also, it holds 20 pairs of ladies' size 8.5 shoes, but only 10 pairs of men's size 12 shoes, so between my husband and I we can hide about 15 pairs.", 
    "I was looking for a shoe cabinet with doors to keep my shoes protected and this piece was the perfect option. It looks ver handsome inside our closet and it goes nicely with the rest of our Oak furniture. It was not difficult to put together, just make sure that you \"understand\" how the pieces fit before you actually start hammering and screwing in bolts. But once you start it will be a breeze. The shelves are roomy enough for me to put my shoes one of top of the other, that way I can fit double the number of pairs. I wear a lot of high heels and they all fit without any problems. Plus you have 3 different positions for the shelves so you can place them according to your own needs. The drawers are smallish, but roomy enough for my wallets/clutches on one side, and gloves and hats on the other. I am very pleased with everything I have gotten from Overstock so far.", 
    "This is probably the end of my search for a nice looking shoes cabinet/racks. Been going through a bunch of different racks, from wall mount racks to regular to the most recent cabinet that we purchase at the local store - Honestly, nothing compare to the sleek look of this cabinet. It's neat, nice and convenient. It fits nicely in the corner of our entrance area. No more shoes laying around the floor. The only complaint is the item comes with a few torn areas on the packaging, but once open it up the inner protection foam is very good so no damages. Overall very happy with this purchase. Thanks Overstock for a great buy and keep up with offering us such good quality items like this!", 
    "I was looking for a decent size shoe cabinet for a while and I found out that it is not that easy to find. I accidentally stumbled into the one here. It seemed to be big enough for all our shoes and it seemed like people liked it so I decided to take a chance and purchase it. I was just too tired of having shoes scattered everywhere.The first thing you need to know about this cabinet is that it is huge. I was quite surprised when I saw the assembed version and I thought initially that it is too big, but it tuned out that it is looking pretty good. I love the fact that it hides the shoes (much better than a shoe rack) and for the money I think that it is a pretty good purchase. It is not a great quality and I was dissapointed with the drawers that are just not very well done, but on the outside it is looking very good.The assembly was a pain. I left this to my husband and he worked on it for 3 hours. However, once he was done, it was great. There was a little damage in one of the parts, but it is inside the drawer and you cannot really see it on the outside. Overall, I am really satisfied since the cabinet although not very high quality is looking good and serves its purpose.", 
    "Title says it all...This is exactly what I wanted and needed, but I wish the directions would've made it clear that this is truly a 2 adult person job. The directions are completely in pictures, which is fine, but there are several KEY pieces that are very ambiguous. I was in the final stage of putting it together when I realized that one piece was upside down (and you couldn't tell that from the directions). I had to take it apart and reassemble it again. The other times (3) I was lucky enough to catch my mistakes.Despite all the assembly issues, the piece is exactly what I wanted and fits perfectly. It isn't a very great value, though. The materials were rather flimsy and there were lots of parts that broke (chipped off) due to being too close to the edges.Maybe if I would've had adult hands helping me, then perhaps I would feel differently.", 
    "This is probably the most nice looking shoes cabinet I've seen thus far and the price is reasonable, especially for the quality of the material used. Excellent craftsmanship and great design. The size is compact so it fits good almost anywhere. It looks like a cabinet so it makes my house entrance look more neat and clean with all the shoes inside. Very roomy for all different type of shoes. I like how it has two drawers so I can store miscellaneous items inside. Assembly takes time but it came out nicely at the end, so it is worth the time. I am very happy with this purchase, I don't know what is there to complaint about. Neat, clean and roomy. Will definitely recommend this purchase to anyone.", 
    "Size fits perfect love the color. The only thing that I didn't like was the assembly part too many pieces to put it together.", 
    "Very Satisfied with this product, very functional and beautiful color. This shoe cabinet really holds lots of shoes from womans boots,to mens or big boys sneakers. Looks great, too. It is perfect for any decor.", 
    "It's bigger and roomy than I expect. Absoulately love it!! It took my boyfriend and I almost 40 mints to set it up. Although it took us a while, the instruction manual is still very easy to read and follow. It's MDF and compressed wood material. Seems durable. Love it.", 
    "What a pain to assemble.. It was a pain to do.. but in the end, its a nice piece.. just not as strong as I thought it would be. Draws are stupid and not worth the space. No tracks, they just sort of sit in there and are not worth the time.", 
    "I bought this to put inside of my closet as a baby organizer...To store onesies, bibs, clothes, shoes, blankets etc. Once my bundle of joy gets here...it will work out perfect. Great look, sturdy and fits perfectly inside of the closet to keep clutter at a minimum. Once my baby outgrows this, it will be perfect for many other uses like a Shoe Organizer, DVD holder (Fits DVD's perfect on the top shelf), Hat Storage, Book Storage Toy Storage etc. Very pleased with my purchase.The only complaint I would have is it had minor scratches on it. I utilized a black magic marker to fill in the stratches. If this piece was any other color than a dark expresso color, my technique would not have worked.", 
    "It holds lots of shoes and looks great,too!! It's very GOOD value for the $. I am not very handy person. But it only took me about 30 mint to set up everything. I'm very happy with this purchase, highly recommended !!", 
    "We bought this shoe storage after living with so many shoes scattered all over the place at the entrance of our house. It took a while for my son and husband to put it all together. Overall, the instruction manual is easy to follow. There are storage space is bigger than we throught, and there are lot of room. Very good value and appearance is quite nice too. I would recommend this cabinet to others.", 
    "I too had trouble with the packaging. The cabinet had 2 scuffs and both of the rear panels were cracked. Since only one of the scuffs was visible, I kept the cabinet. Assembly was fairly easy and overall, I'm happy with the quality of the product.I was a little surprised by the size of the cabinet. It weighs approximately 80lbs (according to the packaging) and is a little taller than my dresser. I wasn't really expecting to get that much cabinet but now that I have it, I'm pretty happy with it.", 
    "The cabinet came via UPS and the packing was not that good. The assembly was very easy and very well lined up. I loved the cabinet and it looks good in our entry way. Great looking and good price. I really recommend this product.", 
    "It looks very good, I simply love it. This is a very nice piece for the money. It was extremely easy to put it together. Great product. Looks really stylish.", 
    "The cabinet itself is exquisite. It is a quality piece and one would assume that it is very expensive.The workmanship is good - this is excellent value. I would recommend this piece and the delivery was quick and painless.", 
    "This is the best and quickest way to organize the families shoes. my entry stays neat and orderly with this. I was concerned about the plywood, however, this has held up fantastic! Thanks so much to Overstock.com.", 
    "I bought the shoe storage cabinet to keep in my closet because I had a floor of un-organized shoes. This has worked wonders for my organization skills, and I enjoy it very much.", 
    "Ordered two cabinets initially and going to order one more for my sister. Pretty easy to assemble and works great! Much stronger than I thought it would be. Looks great in our home and is a beautiful way to keep all shoes out of the way. For assembly it was helpful to have my drill handy, made it easier and faster to assemble (keep on a low setting to avoid damage...", 
    "This shoe cabinet was everything I hoped for. It looks great and assemble smoothly. I was a little worried about the size of the cubbies, but they are perfect!! In general, I think these are a great value for the price!", 
    "The pictorial instructions were very easy to follow. Total assembly time for one cabinet was probably about an hour, and that was with very carefully checking the inventory. We really like the way the cabinets look .they're perfect for fitting our shoes. In general, we think these are a great value for the price!", 
    "It looks great and assemble smoothly. I was a little worried about the size of the cubbies, but they are perfect!! I bought it mostly for my children's shoes that collect by the front door. Great purchase.", 
    "A very nice looking, sturdy cabinet that answered our need for storage in our entry hallway. It is a large cabinet and well work the money. It took 2 hours to assemble. Two of the pieces were damaged during shipment and they were promptly replaced by Overstock - 'great customer service! The only complaint I have is that the assembly instructions are lacking, but we figured it out.", 
    "I'm very happy with the Shoe Cabinet . It looks just like the picture and is beautiful in person...it's really a quality piece. It took my husband one hours to assemble, but he says the instructions were very good.", 
    "It was easy to assemble and arrived in less than 7 days. The product was well packaged and well built. I found this product on our local furniture store and sold much higher price. I love it and I think you would too.", 
    "I bought this Shoes cabinet for may family. it was so great! everyone was very like it !! this pieces were made very well and really stand out. Very good pieces for the money.", 
    "It is solid piece and looks nice. The handles are plastic (can be replaced if you want). I think it is a good value for the money.My biggest complaint as with all furniture that you need to assemble is that the instructions come with very little information. I ended up putting the top shelf in upside down. And you would never the proper directions by looking at the instructions unless you look carefully and notice that holes are not there! How frustrating. So I had to drill the holes in myself because they were on the wrong side and I cannot install the doors. These instruction writers are lazy! The one helpful thing is that the pieces are numbered. This is my only complaint.", 
    "Would definitely buy again", 
    "The top 2 drawers did not seem to have been cut accurately and/or the problem is because they do not use drawer glides. The bottoms of the drawers scrape the top edges of the cabinet below the drawers because when the drawers are opened and closed, the move against the edge of the cabinet under the drawers and this takes off the brown stain which is very obvious and cannot be hidden. I had to use matching stain to cover up the problem periodically. If the drawers had glides then maybe this wouldn't be a problem.", 
    "cost me extra money to hire someone professional to build it out, which took almost 2 hours for a pro to build it... otherwise, works ok... nothing spectacular", 
    "Its functional, but feels very cheap. Assembly is very time consuming. The shelves on the inside are adjustable, so you can use them for things other than shoes as well.", 
    "The concept of this armoire is great. It's exactly what I was looking for to store shoes in my mud room. However the item is a pain in the neck to put together. It's very low quality and I'm guessing I received a defective one as the front doors don't align with each other. The left door is higher than the right door. I've tried to adjust the height of the screws etc and the doors never look even. Oh well... ; )", 
    "If you want something that is ready to go out of the box, this is not for you. This came in at least 40 - 50 pieces and took a couple hours to put together...mind you, I have experience in putting these things together. In the end, it's not as sturdy as it looks; however, it is stylish and functional for the entryway in my home. I am putting it to good use.", 
    "I love the shoe cabinet but the material is not that sturdy. Please be very careful putting it together. But I love the fact that you can put your shoes in the cabinet and close it up.", 
    "Poor instructions, difficult to assemble. items had illegible labeling.", 
    "Wood was bent as if it was soaked in water for sometime. Instructions for assembly just plain stink. Would have sent it back but I'm 70 yrs old and to heavy to mess with.", 
    "We were looking for an inexpensive option for shoe storage. Once it came together, the piece looks good, however, there are a few issues with the unit. One, the top shelf was bowed/warped, so it isn't flush on top. Two, the drawers aren't flush in the front either. Both problems aren't extremely noticeable, but I know they're there. Last, the drawers don't fit quite right and they don't have a rail to keep them in place. You and lift them up to get them to close. Aesthetically, this is a good piece of inexpensive furniture and will suit our purposes for the time being. It would be nice if it came together as expected, but that was not the case.", 
    "Five Shelf Shoe Cabinet with Two Upper Storage Bins, is good but the draws are a bit of a problem, does not close flush, you have to push it up a bit to get it flush, the shelves are a good size to fit shoes not boots, overall for the price it is good.", 
    "Our entry looks much improved from before when all of our shoes were scattered all over! I was eyeing this piece for a couple weeks but when our baby went to put a shoe in his mouth, I scooped this up the same day. Overstock had the best price by far when you factor in the free shipping and coupon we found. This piece is much taller than we had anticipated and easily houses several pairs of shoes. It weighs 150 pounds so I was surprised that the back looks like a piece of cardboard with tape going down the center and the finish looks like a shiny plastic laminate, but the color is a beautiful, rich espresso. The hardware is cheap looking in size and finish (brushed silver). The drawers are surprisingly on wheels and tracks but do not go in and out smoothly at all-they actually feel similar to the drawers in our desktop organizer w no wheels/tracks. We are quite pleased w the width and depth even though my husband's size 11.5 sneakers must be turned sideways (two pair fit with room to spare on one shelf). The box arrived in less than 2 days and was beat up with holes in the cardboard, but there was not even a scratch on any of the pieces. My husband complained about the # of parts and assembly but no cuss words, so I wd rate assembly on the easier side. If you can get a super deal on this as we did, snag it!", 
    "Setup instruction is horrible however. My engineer husband screaming up and down when he was trying to set this up. Instruction is bad or none, you have to guess what go where and he is not a beginner either. He setup/build zillion of things in my house and this is the worst one on his list. Having said that I am happy when it is done because we have 4 members in our family and there are 4 shelves that hold up to 4-5 pairs of shoe each.", 
    "This was ordered to be in my entrance under my mirror but it was too tall and It was not the way I imagine it. it is doing it function for the shoes but it is cheap looking.", 
    "This hasn't lasted very long for me. The laminate started to peel and the back fell off. If you want something that will last around a year and would likely not through a move, it'll probably do fine.", 
    "the materials used are lower quality than expected.", 
    "The instructions are poorly written and vague. The pre-drilled holes were not aligned properly and therefore afftected the sturdiness and square of all angles. As a result, the quality looks worse. Be careful of the length of the screws. One of the screws went through the front facing of the drawer. This purchase did not meet my expectations and I'm regret purchasing it.", 
    "The number of parts is too many for one person to assemble quickly or without scarring some of the finished products. Once assembled (aproximately 8hrs) it serves the purpose it was selected for.", 
    "I had problems assembling the rack, some screws were missing and some screw holes were not easy to fit. i have to live with it as again packing and sending back is almost impossible", 
    "bad instructions-I placed mid drawer shelf upside down. Had to drill holes. missing screws. Will not buy MDF furniture agian. The structure is not strong enough.", 
    "Be prepared to have patience to assemble. I took my time to glue and fit the pieces together~3 hours.", 
    "The assembly instructions were very poor. It took several hours for 2 skilled handymen to assemble the shoe cabinet as some pieces were not fitting well, so they had to undo, redo, undo, redo to realize that they could not fix the pieces. The result is a nice looking cabinet with drawers that can't open properly. Hmm...not what I expected.", 
    "I have previously bought 3 bookshelves from Overstock and assembled them all by myself and had no problems. This cabinet however was a total different story. Some of the screw holes were not in place, the \"fake\" wood is of the poorest quality I have ever seen. You have to be so careful or you will screw the screws through the wood. The only good thing I can say about this purchase is that the screws, bolts and nuts were nicely organized. Luckily I bought it to decoupage it - so hopefully I would be able to make something nice out of it.", 
    "WASTE OF MONEY. This piece comes with parts missing, things not lining up, the drawers don't recess correctly, the screws don't hold pieces together well because some holes are too big and the particle board chips and breaks when you screw things in in other areas. Took professionals hours to put together and was missing hinges and didn't have holes drilled where it should have. Pieces are poorly labeled. Overstock customer service not impressive, telling me that if I send it back it may be at my own expense if they do not agree that the chest is defective. I have ordered a lot from Overstock, and this is the first thing I have really had a problem with and wanted to return, and its not worth it., and I find their customer service poor. Don't believe the 4 star rating - must be faked by seller. Read the one star ratings for description. HORRIBLE.", 
    "Putting together was hard enough with two ppl. But to finish and realize that drawers metal was intalled not straight and the drawers don't go in evenly was very disappointing", 
    "I have several friends who have shelf shoe bins which I have used and was so excited when I found this one online. With a friend I assembled it, thank goodness for the expert help but what a surprise when it turned out to be a very heavy bookcase with many shelves. And quite large, so much so that it was not at all what my fiends had at their front door entry spaces. I decided that I could only use it in my garage for a bookcase now that it wouldn't work for shoe storage but even then it's too deep to fit into the side of the garage with the car inside. I am very disappointed and would not recommend this item to someone who is looking for a place to store shoes in their entry way. Also, it is very heavy, it takes power tools, and someone familiar with assembly to put it together.", 
    "the quality is so so. and its surface got some scratches after we finished assembly.", 
    "The color is perfect. The wood is not to strong but the style and space is perfect.", 
    "The style of this shoe cabinet is nice. Price is right for it also.", 
    "This product arrived is several pieces for assembly. I had a friend come over to help me assemble it and a part necessary in step 2 to put it together is missing. I called overstock, and they will send me another, but meanwhile I am in a very small apartment with this stuff spread out all over the place and can't move forward, and have destroyed the box to send it back and I'll need to get someone another day to come back and help me assemble it. The closet may have done the job but I'd rather pay more and have something come assembled. Does anybody make these things that come assembled?", 
    "I should have listened to the warnings. It waited for my son to come home from college to help me build this (several weeks), and then it was missing parts, has poor instructions and is still not completed. I usually have great success with overstock, but this is a major dud. The parts are all stacked up in a corner of my living room, next stop the garbage, what an expensive lesson. No more items to build from Overstock.", 
    "A very cheap stuff. I am disappointed. Period. Plus, too expensive. It is not wood for sure."
