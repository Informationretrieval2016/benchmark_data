    "The sectional sofa arrived in two very large boxes. The ottoman in a separate box. These boxes were packed tight with the body of each part of the sectional and the corresponding back support pieces that you assemble by screw/ washer/ & nut, the zippered enclosed cushions for the back support of the sofa that are removable for laundering that had large Velcro strips sewn to place on the back support pieces to hold in place, seating cushions also zippered enclosed and removable for laundering, feet, & hardware. The only tool needed was included an allen wrench. The sofa sections and backings were clearly labeled to correspond with the easy to follow instruction assembly 2 page paper instruction leaflet with diagrams and parts identification. The instructions to assemble were fairly easy to put together. I am impressed with the construction. The sofa is very firm, which should give some with years of wear. I was happy to know this since it was not a buyers remorse resulting with a sagging sofa. The foundation on the couch frames where the cushions sat on was a trampoline weave, very sturdy, no board slats, YEAH! I am very impressed with the construction, the comfort, the visual appeal. The only thing I purchased was scotch guard to protect the fabric for easy clean ups of possible spills. I am extremely pleased.", 
    "First off I want to say I'm 100% in love with this product and the value was incredible. I saw couches like this at local furniture stores for 4-5x the price.That said there are 2 things I felt could be improved (if I'm really being picky). I thought the color of the couch was a lot darker grey than was pictures and although I love it I was a bit shocked when it arrived. I would recommend they re photograph this couch to portray the coloring more accurately. Secondly some of the \"arms\" are not as sturdy as they could be. Like I said, I'm still 100% satisfied but just wanted to mention this in case they wanted to improve it in the future.This couch looks so great in our living room and we've had SO many compliments on it! It's super cozy and can fit a LOT of people on it which we love too.Thanks overstock!", 
    "Worth the value, stiff cushions that have remained solid 6 to 7 months after purchase. Comfortable, easy to assemble. Overall pretty good product.", 
    "Disappointed with the late delivery by the carrier. Received the sofa in three rather huge boxes. Took over 2 hours to put together.Some of the pre-drilled holes were not lined up.Looks good and light enough to move around my family room.", 
    "Many reviews discuss the firmness as negative... I think it's great and shows the couch will last much longer! Love this couch! It is absolutely beautiful!", 
    "Purchased coach online never ordered furniture on line before would recommend to a friend and family member. great price and val", 
    "We love this sectional! It is high quality construction. Putting it together was fairly easy We were somewhat limited what we could get down our narrow twisting stairway to our basement and because this came in pieces it worked out exceptionally.We recently had out basement finished and wanted a nice sectional. This one is beautiful. The color is a dark gray/khaki color. The frame is made of wood and I love how the pins hold it together. The chaise is even long enough for my 6'4\" hubby to lay on it comfortably. This was an excellent purchase. The ONLY negative I can even mention is it came with 2 of the ugliest throw pillows I have ever seen. They were gold and black and went immediately in the trash! I purchased some lovely gray and teal throw pillows that look gorgeous on it. Can you find this item cheaper somewhere else? Possibly yes but with the free shipping and the fact we could get it down our stairs was all worth it to me.Happy Customer :)", 
    "I never thought I'd order such a large furniture item online, sight virtually unseen. But after reading the other reviews I was encouraged. As all other reviews mentioned, the materials is much darker than it appears in the photo, which was great for us! I love the versatility of being able to switch which side the chaise is on, giving us the maximum flexibility in the configuration of our media room. It is a very spacious couch and can easily seat all 6 of us. There is certainly assembly required, and I can't imaging doing it solo just due to the size of the sofa. The seat cushions are firm, and I can almost occasionally feel the stiff wire frame that encase the cushion, but that will likely keep it in good shape for longer. All in all, VERY happy with the purchase and would recommend!", 
    "When our couch came, we were a little shocked at the color. We were expecting a much lighter gray like in the picture. The color is pretty but not what we expected. One of the cushions came damaged, and we are still waiting for it to be replaced (it was supposed to come in 2-5 days and it has already been 7 business days. Other than that, the couch is nice. The cushions are fairly stiff but it is comfortable. We loved that it came with the ottoman.", 
    "Awesome couch easy set up our family loves it so comfy!!!", 
    "Bought this couch elsewhere for half the price and love it, shipping was a nightmare so you get what you pay for. A good deal is still a good deal though. Easy enough to assemble. Have been using daily for a couple months now and its still firm and like new. This thing is huge, I find a new position to lay everyday. No need for additional furniture in my living room now. Can seat 6 adults.Love it, just shop around for the best price first.", 
    "Very DISAPPOINTED! Looks cheap and the color is way off ,I ordered the charcoal grey it looks brown. Looks NOTHING like this photo.", 
    "The couch pictured looks great The couch received was very cheap looking. For the price paid you can find something better", 
    "Very firm as reviews indicated - a little darker than the picture, which was fine with me. Excellent rugged couch that is good for family but can provide a little style too.", 
    "disliked this product. Very stiff. Did not feel sturdy. Also you could feel the springs in the sofa. AWFUL", 
    "The color looks much different in person, the fabric also looks different. The ottoman has no storage and it is not comfortable. The couch itself is comfortable but it feels cheaply made and with teens in the house I am afraid it wont last long. Not worth the price in my opinion.", 
    "The seat support system consists of elastic bands that wear out much faster than expected. FORTUNATELY---OVERSTOCK'S CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SUPERIOR!!!!!!!!!!!! The Overstock customer service team, especially AMY S. are fantastic people to work with and truly make the buyer feel like they are important. They resolved my issue much to my satisfaction. We can't thank them enough for the kind, caring attention they gave us.", 
    "Very stiff cushions, firmly comfortable but cloth material is thin and seems cheap. Zippers failed but are fixable.", 
    "The color is NOTHING like the photo. I most certainly over paid for this sectional,it's not worth the $1500 price tag.", 
    "This couch was exactly what I wanted. It's big! Firm! And you can put the chaise on either side. Just be careful when you take it out of the boxes. The pieces in each box went together but we did not no that and they all got mixed up. Took us an hour just to figure out what went with what. Not to bad to assemble.", 
    "Everyone who visits loves this couch. It's a little harder than I thought but it's still comfortable. The foot rat is nice and soft. Sometimes my kids will just lay on that part. The only turn off was that the couch arrived in pieces and needed to be assembled. I had no idea. My mother in law helped me and it took about an hour. Great couch, good price.", 
    "It's a gorgeous couch. The ottoman threads are a bit loose and the tufted effect isn't great in it like other parts. It's comfortable and sturdy. I like the color.", 
    "Absolutely love this sofa. It is a little darker than the picture for some reason, but I am fine with that! Comfortable, fantastic!", 
    "Couch cushions are stiff and uncomfortable. Quality did not meet expectations.", 
    "Very cheap and poor quality.", 
    "Just as described...color (brown) just as pictured... assembly was easy. The sectional was shipped and delivered w/in 2 weeks; Overstock customer service was pivotal in coordinating prompt delivery... great experience from start to finish!", 
    "The couch we received is nice (sans a few overly wrinkled pillows) but the horrible customer service we received both from Overstock and their delivery company CEVA was enough to convince both my boyfriend and I never to order from Overstock again. I suggest if you're looking for a timely delivery, a positive experience, and to not miss multiple days of work (for nothing) you search elsewhere for a couch."
