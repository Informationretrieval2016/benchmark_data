    "This is a nice accent table. Color is a dark espresso brown. It did take me about an hour to assemble. It is perfect as a side table for a chair in my den. Good price!", 
    "Very cheap, very poor quality. WOuld not buy again", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks great next to the sofa chair.", 
    "good product and faster delivery", 
    "Not easy to assemble and just \"so so\"", 
    "for the quality but looks nice. If you aren't good at assembling things this is not the table for you, every piece has to be assembled including the drawer.", 
    "It is not worth the money,the top comes of if you touch it,the sides you need to bend them and in time they crack in fine white lines,Very low quality,very unhappy with this purchase", 
    "This is great, looks nice and doesn't take up too much room", 
    "it looks nice, but the top is hard to get together, I don't feel like this is worth all the trouble", 
    "looks just as it looks on the picture", 
    "works well and looks good", 
    "This was just the table I needed to place a lamp in a small room. It was fairly easy to assemble and it looks very nice in the corner.", 
    "very nice ith table, want another always out of stock", 
    "I was looking for small end tables to go between bookcases and the couch. I wanted something round and this item fit both the smaller and round requirements. The two rounded sides and back round side are this somewhat flexible wood boards. I broke one. The secret to success is using steam (i.e. tea kettle) to soften the pieces before bending them to fit into the slots. Despite breaking the one piece, I did not send it back- I called the company to get a replacement piece. They were cheap (on sale, plus an extra discount) so I'm not overly upset. They do look GREAT once they are assembled. I'm happy with the one that I put together without breaking those boards!!!!", 
    "Easy to assemble, Looks good", 
    "Very nice, except the quality of the wood that's used to side the drawer is cheap and cracked during assembly.", 
    "It's perfect. Just what I needed to finish off the set.", 
    "The shelves are not real wood and won't hold up under normal use. Arrived with broken part and company has not replaced it as of this review.", 
    "Great end table. Arrived quickly. Easy to put together. Directions called for two screwdrivers, a hammer and two people. I put it together alone and did not need a hammer.", 
    "A little unsturdy on carpet but just right for between two chairs!", 
    "Nice little table for the price. It fits very well in the spot I needed it for. It's a little unsturdy as we couldn't tighten the legs anymore but it's fine for a small side table. I would recommend it!", 
    "Great price but a bit on the wobbly side. Looks cute in the spare room but don't feel it will hold much weight.", 
    "Perfect height for next to the recliner. easy to put together.", 
    "For the price it works ok in a small place. Darker in color but it works.", 
    "It was true in size, color and price. It doesn't take up room. A well designed end table for my living room. I have a very limited maintenance skill and the installation was simple.", 
    "I was really pleased with this small table, it was a little awkward to put together, but the pieces were all well labeled.", 
    "Smaller than I expected but fits nicely in the corner of my kitchen", 
    "The round sides are made of a thin piece of wood to allow curve for the sides but trying to curve wood without damaging it or even breaking it is pretty tedious. It is an excellent accent piece for any room", 
    "I purchased this side table because I needed something small and inexpensive for next to a chair. It's just right for that purpose. Quality wise, it's not great. I expected it to need assembling, but I didn't expect it to come completely disassembled, even requiring the drawer to be put together. It took some time, but we did it. The most difficult part was bending the side pieces to fit into a groove. The pieces are thin and one of them cracked. Fortunately, the company sent me a new piece, which arrived quickly. The color is very dark, perhaps a bit darker than the picture.", 
    "Perfect size for a small room. The little drawer provides a bit of storage, too!", 
    "The instructions to assemble this table were not very good. Also the thin strips of wood that goes to make the round edges on the top were of a very poor quality. We saw cracks in the finish when we bent it to get the round sides. For the price, it will make do but I would not recommend this table to anyone.", 
    "OMG, to easy to put together, instruction and pcs, made it easy.", 
    "Very pretty & was easy to assemble", 
    "Cute table but very low quality. Use only in area that will not get light knocks. In this case you do get what you pay for....", 
    "Very cute. Only 4 stars because a little flimsy. Cuteness wins out though.", 
    "It fits perfectly in the little nook between our lazy boy and our sofa. Its drawer is handy, though the wood is not super durable (we have a toddler, things happen), it still looks nice and does what we need it to.", 
    "Very pleased. Nicely constructed/built. Very pleased.", 
    "Cheap, not very sturdy. You get what you pay for.", 
    "Beautiful wood. Very easy assembly. Sturdy. A+"
