  "description": "The Eames Style Side Chair will look fabulous in any home, restaurant or commercial office. The slender yet sturdy solid wood dowel legs and Eiffel-style frame complement and support a seat made of tough plastic. However you use this Side Chair it is sure to mold itself to your needs. These chairs are robust enough to take the pressure in a commercial setting and they provide stylish comfort with clean lines. Immediately recognizable for its Eiffel tower frame crafted from beech, the original DSW Chair was one of the first plastic chairs to be mass produced. Its popularity is well deserved, with a strong yet flexible polypropylene seat, perfectly contoured for maximum comfort. The profile is striking, combining bright colors with strong, wood legs to create a look that is classic yet contemporary in any setting. Our replica continues to provide the same example of functionality and form.Set includes: One (1) ChairNon-marking plastic caps on feet of chairs to prevent scratching floorsClassic, contemporary chair for your modern dining room or kitchenMaterials: Polypropylene, Wood, MetalFinish: PolishedUpholstery color: OrangeSeat dimensions: 23.25 inches long x 18.5 inches wide x 16.25 inches highDimensions (overall): 23.25 inches long x 18.5 inches wide x 31.5 inches highStyleMid-CenturyMaterialMetal, Polypropylene, WoodChair TypeAccent Chairs, Dining Chairs, Side ChairsGenderUnisexWorldstock CountryChinaAssemblyAssembly RequiredChair Back HeightStandardColorWhiteFurniture PatternSolid"
