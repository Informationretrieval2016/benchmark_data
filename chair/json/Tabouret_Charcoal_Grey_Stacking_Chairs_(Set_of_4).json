    "These metal stacking chairs are a great deal for the set, and they look very modern and stylish in person. I'm pairing them with a concrete table with a wood base in my back lanai.", 
    "I have looked long and hard at these chairs, and finally took the plunge and ordered some! We have the Jackson table from World Market, which has a wood top and metal base. The chairs recommended for it were out of our budget at *** each. I debated for a long time which color to purchase, and ended up with these for a few reasons: The vintage color appealed to me more, but after examining the pictures and seeing hints of copper, (which is lovely) I decided that it would not match our table base 100%, and they also cost a lot more. I considered black, but a mom of kids said that they really showed fingerprints and she had to wipe them down after each meal - no thank you! These charcoal color chairs were the perfect compromise. Still gray, matching the table. The classy look of black, yet powder coated, as yet I have not had to wash them! We have small dining room, these fit the bill, and fit under our table perfectly. The only reason I gave them 4 stars was that the seat depth was a lot shorter than I like or had anticipated. Not once did I read about that in reviews. However, they are overall comfortable, and as a mom, I am always jumping up anyway. :) Color is very true to photos. They came in less than a week, and were well packaged. The paint has chipped when we stacked them to wash the floor, but it's okay with me because I was going for that look anyway, and since they are gray, it's just gray on gray, and not noticeable. If this is the look you are going for, I would recommend them. I am not sure yet how they will hold up, I will add another review in time to come.", 
    "These chairs have served us well. I have had these for quite some time and they are holding up well considering the price and usage level. I will say that you should be careful of metal-to-chair contact (like keys or purses) and general repeated contact. Our chairs have permanent scrapes where my husband's keys (hooked to his pants) knock on the chair, and there is permanent rub marks (kind of like smudged paint looking) on the arms where, when pushed in, they come in contact with our wooden table.", 
    "Nice chair for extra seating in my industrial loft. A little cold to the bum but very chic. Sturdy and level - no teetering. Excellent quality, nice thick paint and love the color.", 
    "These chairs are great and look awesome in my apartment. Last night I went to a cool, trendy dinner and drinks spot downtown and they actually had these exact same chairs in the restaurant except they were red and distressed which I thought was pretty cool.", 
    "These chairs add style to any room and are more comfortable then envisged. Love them! Only slight negative is that I wish there were more of a matt finish.", 
    "Solid, Sturdy, Looks Great! Good Price!", 
    "The chairs are perfect on my patio with a square table. Very sturdy and contemporary in style. Packaged very well for shipping.", 
    "So easy to clean, and great look", 
    "Problem with one of the chairs.", 
    "When I ordered these I was a little worried they wouldn't work with our table, but it actually turned out great. The pictures are true to what you get and they are comfortable as well. I wish they would fit under my table a little more but overall, I'm very happy with them and it was an amazing price as well!", 
    "Great value. Looks great, sturdy, as described and shipping was easy. All stacked in one box. No complaints.", 
    "We have a small city bungalow and these chairs are perfect for our little dining nook", 
    "Love these chairs ! I would order it again!", 
    "Nice chairs, especially for the price. I wish they offered a more distressed look but they still look good with my long farm table.", 
    "For the price, these chairs are just what I was looking for. I've gotten numerous compliments on them. My only complaint is they are a little on the smaller side for some guests.", 
    "We bought these chairs for our school's teacher lounge makeover and they are perfect! Great size for every body type. Great paint job and really sturdy. Very excited about them!", 
    "Very sturdy chairs. They look modern which what I was going for. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Comfortable. Sturdy and easy to clean. The gray looks really sharp.", 
    "Great looking chairs. Color is accurate, and they look great with my wood and metal dining room table.", 
    "The quality is good and they look great.", 
    "Really cool and surprisingly sturdy yet comfortable. Looks great, just like the picture. :)", 
    "I love the shape, color, and size.", 
    "Definitely gave my dinning set a different look. I highly recommend to buy", 
    "Get the industrial look without the jacked up price. Construction is durable. But my larger friends and family can't fit or sit comfortably because the the arms that jut out are narrow. I wish I had bought the straight backed chairs instead of w these arms. They'd also fit under the table better when not in use.", 
    "Surprisingly comfortable for a metal chair! Sturdy, and comes fully assembled. All you need to do is take it out of the box!", 
    "Great price, stack nicely, fast shipping.", 
    "Love these chairs - and the rubber tips which don't scratch up my wood floors.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised at the packaging the chairs arrived in. All in one piece but very well wrapped. No scratches or dents. The other reviewer was correct, the chairs are a bit small, but both my husband and father in law, who are approximately 6 feet and 200 pounds, don't seem to have a problem sitting in them. The color is very accurate to what is pictured. And you can't beat the price! As a family of 6, I can see that these will stand up to our active lives.", 
    "Awesome chairs - solid, heavy and arrived fully assembled! That provide a great rustic or industrial look. I bought 1 set of 4 first to really test them out, then a year later after seeing how well they have held up I bought a second set! Great price for 4 chairs, absolutely can't beat the durability, stability, look and price.", 
    "I purchased these chairs to go with a Crate & Barrel table that were styled with similar metal chairs at 4X the price. Overall, I'm happy with the Tabouret chairs--they are exactly what I was looking for at the price I wanted to stay in. I specifically wanted stackable chairs, as our dining room is tiny and we won't have them out unless entertaining, so these were a perfect solution for our budget.I don't know that we'll keep them forever--as many other reviewers have noted, the chairs are on the small side. My husband and I primarily bought the dining table to entertain, and I suspect that some of our guests will find the chairs a little tight. We may eventually purchase chairs with a larger seat and/or no curved backing to allow for a more comfortable sit.Regarding comfort, after reading others' suggestions I purchased 4 chair pads for these. I actually found the chair pad obnoxious and took mine off. My husband liked it and kept it on. Clearly, a matter of preference.Shipping was quick and the chairs were well-packed so they arrived unscathed. Overall, I got exactly what I was looking for, so I'm pretty pleased!", 
    "They are chic and stylish. I am using them in a restaurant. They are sturdy but small. Very stylish and the color is exactly as shown online. They arrived only a few days after ordering. Very good value for the money.", 
    "I purchased these chairs because I needed replacement chairs for a round glass table (my son systematically broke all of my chairs while I was out of town) The price was the main reason I purchased them... I needed quantity more than quality. (should have gotten more quality chairs the first time) However, I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy they were and really good looking as well. They are true to color - as depicted by the pictures on the website. They stack nicely but I keep them out all the time. My son asked why we had lawn chairs in the sunroom but, please, what does he know? . yes, they are casual and utilitarian but I think they have a modern, edgy look. Very happy with my purchase and would purchase again.. Plan to accessorize with cushions...", 
    "The package was wrapped nicely and they look exactly like the picture.", 
    "I love, love, love these chairs! They just arrived today. I was worried I wouldn't like them with my table, or they might be too short for my 30 inch table but they are just perfect. I ordered four more today. I wish Overstock allowed you to submit pictures like some sites do. They look great with my dark stained farm style table.", 
    "I love these chairs. If I had a complaint its that they were out of stock for so long when I wanted them. But I finally got them and they look great and are very strong. The way these are packed and shipped are great too. Someone took their time.", 
    "These are the FIRST chairs I've ever bought/owned (others were always roommates' or hand-me-downs and I couldn't be more thrilled. I've longed for chairs in this style for a few years and the price is right with this set, the seat is very comfortable, the back of the chair hits my back at just the right spot (not too low, not too high - I'm 5' 6\") and the arms have the perfect curve. Leaning back in them is just as comfortable as sitting straight. Couldn't have been more pleased with the speediness of Overstock's shipping (shocked actually!). Bought a round wooden table from Overstock last night and can't wait to pair the chairs with the table!!", 
    "These chairs are very sturdy and quite comfortable. They arrived so quickly I couldn't believe it- and the packing was amazingly sturdy. Very good value- I am quite pleased.", 
    "The chairs are probably a little less heavy than similar designs at other places--but these are also considerably cheaper than we've found anywhere else. They are sturdy enough that we use them as dining room chairs with no problem, and they are surprisingly comfortable.", 
    "Got these in time for some family to come into town. Love them, and they shipped so fast I couldn't believe it. Thanks Overstock.com!", 
    "Very god looking with my rustic farm table. Excellent quality for the price."
