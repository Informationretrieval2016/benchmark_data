    "I like many urban dwellers have a hard time finding quality compact furniture for my small digs downtown. You often end up with ikea or ikea like looking furniture. This product is the perfect size and its plush, well constructed, and easy to assemble and it fits wonderfully in my corner window nook! If you are looking for affordable and quality this chair is for you! I might buy another for just a gaming chair!", 
    "The chair perfectly meets all my needs--size, color, style, comfort, and ease of operation. I was a bit nervous ordering without trying it out as I am rather picky about furniture. The chair arrived quickly, the shipping box was not damaged, and it was simple to set up. I may want another one since my spouse seems to enjoy sitting in it too. I am 5'4\"; spouse is 6'2\", so that tells you it suits a range of heights!", 
    "I said I would not recommend as the chair is smaller than I was expecting. I am 6'3\" 210lbs and feel like a monster in the chair. The chair looks great but was hoping to use this as a primary chair for in front of the TV, but looks like it will be pushed off to the side for guest and I'll continue my search for a comfortable primary chair.", 
    "These chairs exactly match my sofa/chaise which I ordered some time ago from Overstock. I am very happy with both products, and I recommend purchasing any furniture from your business, as it is delivered quickly, and right to your door. Thanks again for meeting my requirements in furnishings. I have a friend who is thrilled with them and she will probably be ordering in the future when she needs or wants something special. Believe me, I have told every one that they won't go wrong doing business with Overstock.com.", 
    "We've had our chair for about a month in a beach house and it hasn't even been sat in. The trim/piping on our WHITE chair turned YELLOW and the whole chair looks really weird now. I contacted Overstock, but they wanted me to disassemble the chair, find a giant box to send it back and the whole transaction would be MY problem. I said I didn't want to go through all that, so I'm throwing chair away. Waste of resources (production of the chair), time, and money!", 
    "Chair looked good in the picture. It was easy to put together. That's all the good.It still smells like chemicals. It is not comfortable at all. It's designed for small size people, not most people. Over priced for what you get. Look for a better product.", 
    "They are fabulous!!!! Needed some compact,yet comfortable chairs. Perfect for our needs and incredibly comfortable", 
    "Sleek design, not bulky, extremely comfortable.", 
    "Don't expect to sink into a large reclining chair. Nice quality, but small scale. VERY comfortable. Very supportive.", 
    "Perfect for the space! Not very big so if you are a big or tall person it's not going to work for you. It was exactly what we wanted.", 
    "Not very satisfied with this chair. It sits to low to the floor and is not very comfortable", 
    "Easy to put together and looks amazing in my living room. The only down fall is that it is a little hard on the skinny behind and legs. It's not very comfortable after an hour's sitting. However, she swivels with easy and reclines nicely.", 
    "It has a small foot print for this kind of chair which I needed to place in small bedroom for handicapped person. He is tall but not overweight so the chair fits him fine. This chair would not be good for a 'fat' heavy person because not wide seat but good for all other people not overweight. It is strong enough to hold weight, just not wide enough in the seat. It is extremely comfortable and easy to move around yet it is very strong. I am very pleased with this chair. It is just right for people not too wide in the butt. It is just right for normal size people, tall or short.", 
    "This is a small recliner that is exceptionally confortable. Excellent choice for smaller space.", 
    "I had this chair since January. The arms are fading. Good design but poor workmanship. Leather starting to come apart at the seams. And, this chair is hardly ever used.", 
    "Easy to assemble, comfortable, and functional chair for my half-story attic studio. I weigh 140 pounds and am 5'7\" and it fits me perfectly - not sure it would be comfortable for someone who is XL.", 
    "This was a gift to my daughter and she loves it! This fits in well with the d\u00e9cor in her room, and she says the chair is very comfortable. She loves that it has an ottoman to put your feel up. A wonderful piece!", 
    "very easy to assemble and comfortable", 
    "It's comfortable....not as big as we thought but still functional for what we need. I'm happy with the chair but wish it was a bit cheaper since it's not as big as others that are priced the same.", 
    "The chairs are actually pretty comfortable and assembled quite easily. They are pretty sturdy, but I would say NOT made for very large people. They are a bit smaller than I had hoped, but for the price, pretty fair deal.", 
    "This chair was very easy to put together. I didn't realize it was a recliner when I purchased it. So that was a very nice surprise. I bought this to use in a furnished rental unit but I'm using it myself. Very comfortable and easy to get out of.", 
    "Comfortable and cushiony. Not too wide.", 
    "I love this chair, it's comfy, and cozy, no extra support is needed. I use this as a kind of computer chair, really I just use it to watch movies from my computer, but it works when I need to do any work on it too. I don't want it where my boys can be on it because I bought it in white, plus they're older and have a tendancy not to realize how tall and strong that are, where as I like to curl up with a throw blanket and veg out for a while by myself, I don't think they would appreciate the fact that I bought this just for me. Selfish? Maybe, but I love the leather and want to keep it for years to come.", 
    "Very relaxing. Almost as comfortable as the Serta Perfectsleeper after a 16 hour shift at the hospital", 
    "Light weight . Bought them for my RV. perfect size.", 
    "This Chair was so wonderfully comfortable! Thank you so much.", 
    "We are very happy with the performance of this chair so far.", 
    "My husband prefers this chair over the couch for watching television especially because it came with the Ottoman. I thought it would look like a nice leather chair but it definitely looks pleather. Our daughter complains about it whenever she comes to visit asking why we have a computer chair sitting in our living room. It wasn't quite the look that I wanted and for that I gave it a 3 star. I also believe it's a bit overpriced due to the cheesiness of it. But the reclining feature is wonderful and it is very comfortable. Probably a better gaming chair for kids rooms in a piece of living room furniture.", 
    "The chair is lovely. It arrived in a timely fashion, it's easy to put together and very comfy! It's not a bulky piece and fits easily in my office space. I'd definitely recommend it. Everyone who sits in it is impressed. Hope this helps.", 
    "This recliner chair was a Christmas gift for my hubbys man cave...he loves it! quality is really nice I only wish is was a little bit wider but other than that a very classy chair", 
    "Good price easy assembly, very comfortable.", 
    "It got 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't recline all the way. Looks great and is a perfect size.", 
    "This chair is the perfect size and looks good! Comfortable and fits in the small space we had available for additional seating. The price was right. A real winner for us.", 
    "I have been looking for something like this for a few years! This is perfect! Even though it's \"my\" chair I know everyone else will be trying to get to it before I do!", 
    "Love this recliner/ottoman. They look great in the master bedroom.", 
    "This recliner looks just as good as the picture and is even more comfortable than I thought it would be! The seat and back are very cushy and looks more expensive than it is. Reclines easily and is very comfortable. It was easy to build by following the instructions included. No regrets on this buy.", 
    "Comfy and fit well in small room", 
    "The chair is well made, comfortable and the design is very nice.", 
    "For the price their comfy and look great.", 
    "I am very happy with this recliner. It looks good and seems well made. It is perfect for what I got it for, a little smaller than my old recliner.", 
    "Very nice chairs. Easy to put together. Comfortable. Great for the price. I got two. Love them.", 
    "This chair is very good for the price. The headrest area isn\u2019t very high. It isn\u2019t highly cushioned but is very attractive in the room, and good for short term sitting, not cuddling up for a good movie.", 
    "look great in the room put in.", 
    "Assembly was moderately easy and the finished chair is very comfortable to rest in and looks good, too. It does not take up a large footprint in the room, either.", 
    "Comfortable and easy to put together, but very low to the ground. I will keep it for now but most likely replace it in a few months and give this to grandson.", 
    "very easy to assemble and plush. bought it for an elderly relative who needs her legs up, but had trouble getting out of the deep chairs. smart looking.", 
    "It is very comfortable and a good value for the money. I bought this for a den. The only reason I am giving it four stars is it doesn't look particularly high-end.", 
    "we love this chair. Would like another and would recommend", 
    "Bought 2 for the kid's TV/game room. They love them. Comfortable and attractive. Easy to wipe clean!", 
    "After reading all of the reviews I knew this was what we wanted and we were not disappointed. It is comfortable, not too bulky, easy to move, attractive and most of all, the price was right! Someone of large stature might have a problem but my husband (5' 8\", 142 lbs.) and I (5'4\", 175 lbs.) both fit in the chair just right. As bonus points the chair took up much less room than many others of this type I have looked at.", 
    "I love my new chair. It's super comfortable. My 76 year old husband assembled it in 5 minutes. It is not for a giant body, but I'm not a petite woman and it does well for me. I wish I'd purchased another one.", 
    "This chair is the one of the best purchases that I have made. I would recommend this chair to anyone that is looking for a very comfortable chair for a room. Easy assembly, and very comfortable. Love it!", 
    "This chair is great for spending some time reading a book (or surfing the web, etc). But, it is not a recliner chair in which you can rock back and take a nap - it is too small for that.So, a great chair (especially for the price) if a comfortable \"book reading\" chair is what you are looking for.", 
    "This chair when assembled appeared to be in a declined position. It put pressure on my lower back. This chair did not work at all for me. The wonderful thing is OVerstock made the return very easy. Once again, hats off to your terrific customer service.You are unbelievable!", 
    "Grandson using it in his room Great Chair", 
    "Very easy to assemble and surprisingly comfortable. Have wanted a recliner for awhile, but space was small. This was a perfect fit.", 
    "Beautiful, but didnt get 5 stars because the instructions are stupid and still not sure it is all together correctly! But if you can fugure things out easily on your own, definitely recommended. Comfy and good looking.", 
    "The chairs were relatively easy to assemble, the quality was super for the price paid and they are very comfortable for all sizes of people, from small frame to large guys 6'2\". Everyone who sat in them bragged on how comfy they were. I have pets and they have sat and stood in them to look out the windows and there has been no damage what so ever to the bonded leather. I am well pleased with the chairs and would recommend them.", 
    "Purchased this recliner for bedroom, decided to put in living room,great size for limited space.", 
    "I've never met a recliner I really liked...until now. I'm 5'3\" and it seems most recliners are sized for 6' people, but this one fits me! So comfortable, I can understand the reviews that say they're ordering another. Takes up little space, looks good, quality is what I hoped, which means I got a very good price. I'm very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I purchased this chair b/c I need a white recliner for a small space. The 1st chair tilted when put together & there were missing pieces. The replacement chair is now yellowed after a few months. Appears nothing can be done to white leather that has yellowed. Not the best at all.", 
    "Recliner very comfortable, easy to assemble and I recommend. I may consider purchasing another one family enjoy lounging at watching TV.", 
    "I purchased this for my son as a Christmas present.It assembled quickly and is a nice inexpensive piece for his first apartment. He said it's very comfortable and likes it.", 
    "When I removed this chair from the box, the noxious smell was overpowering. I got physically sick sitting in it. After almost three weeks, the smell is gone, but now the cording around the arms and the seat has turned yellow. (The chair is white.) I guess you get what you pay for. Don't waste your money!!", 
    "I really like this chair and the cat does, too. When I am not sitting in it she is snoozing in it.", 
    "I love it. Great quality. Looks wonderful. No complaints.", 
    "I was astounded at the quality. They are comfortable, stylish and affordable. Fit perfectly in my post modern decor and the light weight makes cleaning easy as they move easily when needed and stay put when wanted.", 
    "Great chair for the price... Leather match looks nice. Easy assembly. I would not recommend for large or very heavy people.", 
    "Needed a smaller chair this fit the bill perfectly. Came with no damage and was pretty easy to put together did it myself. the price was right and chair was good quality.", 
    "The chair came in a large box. Easy to put together. I'm 70 and had no problems. except 1. The arms were very hard to get the screws in. Other than that the chair is comfortable for me 5'4\". It is low. Would like to have it taller. It would be easier to get out of.", 
    "it was just as pictured. Easy to put together. Color was what we were looking for. It fit nicely into a small space and is so comfortable. My husband and I love it.", 
    "This Swivel Recliner with Ottoman is perfect for my smaller living room. Seems to be well constructed and is very comfortable in upright and reclining position. Would buy this again.", 
    "We absolutely love this! It looks great in the bedroom!!!", 
    "The chair arrived on time and in top condition. My son assembled it with ease in little time. It is of awesome quality and I would buy another one in the future,", 
    "It is worth the price and what we expected! Easy to assemble and nothing was missing or damaged!", 
    "looks beautiful. Easy to assemble. comfortable.", 
    "Love it, it is comfy the only thing missing is that it don't recline"
