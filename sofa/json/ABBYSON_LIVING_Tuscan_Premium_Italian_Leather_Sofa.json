    "This couch was purchased for our family room. What we liked about the style was that it was not an over sized piece, nice lines and would work well in our more narrow, longer sized room. I will not miss maintaining a fabric couch. Very well made, super comfortable, nice stitching pattern across the back and classic details. Can't wait to take my first nap on it!!! Best leather furniture we have owned!", 
    "This was my first furniture purchase from Overstock, and it seemed like such a great deal, so I was a little skeptical. No need for skepticism - it IS a great deal! This is a fantastic couch - I love how deep the seats are in combination with the low back. The material is lovely and I'm certain will wear well with time. I have a dog and a cat, and so far not a single claw scratch or mark. My only complaint is that the cushions are sewn on, so it makes getting in the crevices to vaccum the pet hair slightly more difficult. But, even had I known that going in, I still would have purchased the couch. I'm thrilled with my purchase!", 
    "The sofa is far is more beautiful than the photo. For three years, I have been searching for just the right sofa; and this was worth the wait. I was reluctant make a major purchase online, but I have no regrets. The sofa arrived quickly; and the two men who delivered it (Wallace & Joe) were friendly and professional. What a pleasure it is to own a quality product, delivered by quality people!", 
    "My husband wanted a leather sofa; I wanted something stylish. This sofa was the perfect compromise for us. It's the perfect firmness, not too soft, not too hard. It's beautiful and well made. We have children, so we also didn't want to spend a lot of money on a sofa right now and this piece was a great value for the style, material, and comfort. We've only had it a few weeks, so I can't speak to durability yet, but so far, we're delighted with it!", 
    "My only complaint is that these took so long to arrive (I bought 2 of them), but they were definitely worth the wait! Gorgeous Italian leather, and this chesterfield styling is identical to others at the more ecpensive brick and mortar stores but at half the price! These were an exceptional value and they are stunning... And very comfortable!", 
    "I've always wanted a chesterfield. It's comfortable. Easy to clean. An eye catcher. Abbyson living quality never fails", 
    "It arrived today. Loved the look of the sofa in the picture, it had that old fashioned library or study sofa look to it with tone variations in the leather, it is actually on the darker side (more chocolate) with not as much tone variation but that could be luck of the draw with the leather. The leather sample included (in case you need to go find chairs, etc) was a quality piece of leather.The sofa is VERY firm, but I believe it will soften up. I had leather chairs at my office that were like this and they eventually softened up.With that said I still think it's a value for the money, good quality and almost half what you'd pay for the same thing elsewhere. I would have liked more of a medium-dark brown instead of more chocolate but it was replacing a chocolate leather sofa so still works with my decor.", 
    "This is a great couch for the money. Excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail.", 
    "This sofa is great, such great quality and comfortable. Looks great in my basement!", 
    "What you see is what you get - looks exactly as advertised online as seeing from my computer. It is not soft, not hard, just what I would expect. I feel comfortable in it. True to size. might be small for some people, so check out the dimension before you buy. I wish they come in different color. I personally prefer light color. Took almost 2 months to arrive. The first shipment never made it to me. I had to speak to customer service who tried to track I down but had no glue what happened to it. They had to send a replacement order.", 
    "I love the Abbyson Living collection. This sofa is very comfortable, exceptional quality, and design.", 
    "This couch looks great and is extremely comfortable!", 
    "great quality and perfect sleek look!", 
    "At first, I was not sure about buying big piece of furniture from website that I can not touch or feel the cushion. We shopped local for sofa in the living room, and we decided to buy a $$$$ leather sofa. However, I just love this design, and can not get over with this Abbyson living leather sofa. My hubby tried to stop me from buying this one. And now he just enjoys this sofa and can not love it more. Everyone who saw it, would ask me how many thousand of dollars i paid for it. The delivery was fantastic, it was white glove. The sofa is sturdy, the leather is shiny, I just love everything of it.", 
    "Couch is absolutely stunning! yes it was a bit out of my price range, but I'm glad I wrnt ahead and spent more for this couch. I can tell it's going to last", 
    "Don't hesitate it's a great coach. I'm so happy we decided to take a chance. I would give it a 5 but some of the piping is reversed but still worth it.", 
    "This was a home run. Fit perfectly into the planned space. Was exactly what I wanted. Stylish, attractive..and most important to me...VERY comfortable. The delivery experience was just excellent. The delivery crew did everything from unpacking to complete placement and set up. Rare to get service at that high level these days. I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "As beautiful as it looks. We've had this sofa about a month, sit on it every day and my husband and I both find it comfortable and good looking. I've now ordered the matching chair, Size, color, leather quality, delivery -- Five Stars.", 
    "Looks beautiful and excited about the positive reviews. Can anyone who purchased advise on the actual seat cushion depth? One reviewer said they were deep. I'm hoping at least 30\".", 
    "I am so happy with this purchase- the couch is beautiful firm and fits perfectly in my room- the delivery men were polite and helped screw in the feet and place the couch exactly where I wanted it- the whole process from the time they arrived to the time they left took about 15 minutes!", 
    "a little shiny, delivered fast", 
    "The styling is classic Chesterfield minus the metal studs. The leather and the color and the smell all combine to make a perfect sofa. The cushions are bit firm in the beginning but after a month, the leather soften and is now my favorite place to lounge. The leather cleans up with a single wipe. Love it.", 
    "Very Durable and great quality. The color is warm and comfort is great.looks beautiful in our living room.", 
    "ABBYSON-LIVING is the besttt", 
    "Sofa arrived earlier than estimated, which was great. Delivery company was fantastic. Sofa is a great quality leather. We setup the sofa in our home office and the room smells of leather. It's a great addition to our home and I think it will last for years to come.", 
    "I love my new sofa it looks better than the photo , rich color and very comfortable Thanks overstock", 
    "steve and klye were just great never saw such patience workers are these guys.i was at work steve&klye actually waited in the truck until I came home.they handled my sofa with great care and professionalism. lookingforward to doing more business with this co.", 
    "Very nice couch, back is really low so take that into consideration. Slight scratch at back but very minor. Leather seems quality. Be aware it's a firm couch, not one that you sink into, so you must want firm cushioning. Animals have jumped on couch numerous times and I see 0 scratch marks, also near heat source which they don't recommend, but no sign of fading. Only one concern. I saw a pic of this couch on decorating site and it was very used. The back and side looked great but the cushions looked really worn and bumpy. Hoping I won't have that experienceThat's all folks (and pardon all my grammar mistakes)", 
    "Not only is it beautiful, it's comfortable!", 
    "A classic piece of furniture to have around the house.", 
    "The look and feel are great. We've only had it for a couple months, so can't comment on durability. But it looks and feels like a quality couch. Great buy.", 
    "The leather is so soft and comfortable. This was definitely a wise purchase. My husband wanted a leather sofa but I wanted something with character and stylish. So we compromised and ended up purchasing this sofa. What a great decision. It is great for relaxing and napping and it makes the living room look elegant.", 
    "Looks great and extra long. Low back", 
    "This looks stunning in my living room. Can't say anything negative about it. You will not be disappointed.", 
    "Really a good quality couch. Well made and seems like it will stand up to our 4 dogs on the farm. The low back style makes the room seem bigger. It is very very firm - which takes getting used to at first. I think it's softening up with use but it is very firm. I looked around quite a bit for a good leather couch and for the price -you can't beat this one; though it is very firm. Takes about a month after ordering, but is totally worth it.", 
    "I have had my couch for about 3 weeks now, and I love it. I think the couch is comfortable and the material looks great!", 
    "Very Very beautiful and very good quality", 
    "My 6'3 husband and my 5'7 self are in love with this couch....even my four year old reclines in comfort. The leather appears espresso in color, is rich looking,and is buttery soft. Most Importantly the seat is comfortable it's not sloped awkwardly like most couches of this style (jack-knifing your low back) it feels good on the back without the aid of cushions which is an A+ in my book....we have all been caught napping on it as well. The dimensions listed are correct.", 
    "it has been a year now since i received it, still looks like new. if you don't like the hard feeling of the leather, this is not good for you. very classy and elegant.", 
    "Just as shown, looks rich and expensive; very happy with purchase", 
    "Looks nice but cushions are attached. Sofa is very low and very stiff. Not comfortable at all. :(", 
    "Very elegant piece. I love it!"
