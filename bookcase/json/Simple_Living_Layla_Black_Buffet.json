    "I received the buffet and had really high hopes. The quality of the workmanship is unimaginably poor. Holes were drilled on the wrong sides, some holes were just nonexistent. The quality of the wood is terrible, the finish is uneven, the glass is barely held in place. I really wanted to like this piece and could not be more disappointed.", 
    "This piece is so beautiful and very high in quality, It matches the photo and description perfectly. It is is moderately easy to assemble , it comes with many parts but should take about and hour and a half to assemble. The doors are soft close which was an added surprise. I love this buffet and get many positive compliments about it.", 
    "Instructions were horrible, there were scratches all over the buffet. This item serves it's purpose but should have been more attentive to the reviews.", 
    "I started out thinking that I just needed a temporary piece to hold some china and I didn't want to spend a lot of money only to replace it later with something more expensive/better quality. I was delightfully surprised when it arrived! I will not be replacing it after all! It is good quality materials that assemble easily.", 
    "This buffet is just what I was looking for!! Not big and bulky...just right for my small dining room!! I wanted something with glass doors to show off my Waterford china that's been hiding in my kitchen cupboards. Easy to put together (with my husbands help)!All pre-drilled holes lined up...had no problem with assembly.", 
    "Easy to assembly, roomy and perfect for my silverware and some bowls in the dining room. Black is rick colored and drawers work just fine.", 
    "I used as for a dining room bar", 
    "This piece is well worth the money and looks simply beautiful in my mother in law's kitchen. She is using it as a bar area when guest come over and has received a million compliments already.", 
    "I SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN TO EXPECT MUCH MORE, BUT ALREADY SHOWING SIGNS OF WEAR WITH LITTLE USE IN TWO SHORTS MONTHS. SPEND MORE AND GET SOLID FURNITURE.", 
    "The only reason I would recommend this product to a friend is because of the value. It is a good price, but some of the pieces were either scratched or not matching up properly. Thankfully my father was able to put this together for me - as wood glue was a necessity on some parts. All in all, it looks great in my dining room as a liquor/wine cabinet.", 
    "For most part looks like picture, did come with multiple scratches to exterior surfaces. Time consuming to put together but instructions are very clear and easy to understand. You get what you pay for, lower quality for lower price.", 
    "Looks Great! Looks ekegant. Looks like an expensive piece of furniture. Easy to set up if you follow the instructions. Just do an inventory of all the parts before you start the assembly process. Perfect size for my loft. I did find a few small nicks and scratches. I covered them with a black permanent marker which blends in pretty good with the black Server. The factory could use better foam to protect the heavier pieces of furniture. Other than that, my wife loves it!", 
    "Upon receipt, had damaged glass door. Was able to fix it myself.", 
    "After having 'put together' many pieces of furniture over the years, I was very surprised at how easy this piece was to assemble. There were only 2 small issues but otherwise easy. And once finished, it looks great in my dining room. I also must note that each piece is well manufactured. As I said, I've put together many others but this was by far the best. The back piece, which is usually junky thin cardboard, was heavy duty and was attached to the main cabinet with small screws - not nails! Even the shelves were notched to rest the side pegs. No slipping here! Needless to say, I am extremely pleased with my purchase and at 70 lbs., it's a very heavy and beautiful piece of furniture.", 
    "It matched my dining room table perfect.", 
    "looks excellent in my dining room.", 
    "I would have given this 5 stars but: it said it was easy to put together. It was, all pieces are all nicely marked. But, the instructions said it needs 2 people to put it together. I had hoped to put it together myself but had to call in help. It is beautiful. Sorry for all the buts.", 
    "This was easy to assemble and looks great!", 
    "I bought this buffet for my foyer. It is in no way a disappointment considering I spent $130 (on sale) on it. With that said its a nice piece for a starter home.", 
    "Purchased as a small cabinet to hold headsets, handsets, etc. in a teen room and was surprised it was taller and much nicer than I imagined. Ended up using in a different room where it looks much more expensive now that I added crystal knobs and a silk runner on top! So pleasantly surprised for so little out of pocket!", 
    "This is sort-of a temporary fix for my dining room until I find something perfect. It looks fine if you don't get too close. It doesn't look bad, but it doesn't look amazing either. Expected as much for the price.", 
    "It's exactly what I was looking for. The pieces were labeled well and the instructions were very easy to understand and follow. While it says not to, I put it together myself. It wasn't that hard but two people would have made it a bit easier. It looks great in my house.", 
    "Very nice product. Love it.", 
    "This buffet is lovely and the sale price I received makes it even better. I already knew the size I wanted for the dining room and after comparing measurements of several buffets, I chose this one. The picture makes it look smaller than it actually is. I have chair rail molding around my dining room and the buffet hits slightly above the trim, which I wanted. It's going to hold my mothers old silver and crystal pieces. I will also use it for both additional serving space and/or bar. I wish O allowed photo reviews, as I would leave a photo for you.", 
    "Received the buffet table in a timely matter, unboxed everything and started assembling and that is where the problems started. The paint is blotchy and off in places and one of the end pieces has a crack in the joint in which chipped the paint all the way down from top to bottom. The front glass doors are also cheaply made and looking as if they are starting to come apart at the seams where the had been glued. At $*it is inexpensive, but you get what you pay for.", 
    "This piece fits perfectly with our decor and was easy to put together. It did help having 2 people.", 
    "I needed this to fit into a space and not over crowd it and this it did - it looks great and it does the job I need - great buy for your money", 
    "This is a beautiful unit. It fits perfectly in my small dining room.", 
    "Nice piece of furniture, I came dented but I decided to keep it as I really like it. I ended up using for my TV and it looks really nice.", 
    "Easy to put together and still looks great after a year of use.", 
    "Easy to put together, well made I bought 2of theses to go on each side of Mr fireplace they look great and I love the extra storage for wine glasses and dishes", 
    "Looks great. However it's finish chips at the slightest touch. Where's a black sharpie to cover the white nicks? \ud83d\ude03 And I was so careful putting it together. Fits perfectly in my dining room.", 
    "Over all easy to assembly. Glass doors somewhat lightweight.", 
    "Thought I was just filling a void in the room, but this buffet looks like a nice piece of furniture...very surprised", 
    "Easy assemble, looks not a cheap! highly recommend this kitchen buffet for who look for a bit extra space for dishes and wine glasses!", 
    "Looks great, but it is not very sturdy, but it was not very expensive. Using it as a coffee bar in the office. The drawer are not very good. But it holds some extra supplies. The cabinet part is very roomy and I put frosted contact paper on the glass so I could store more coffee stuff behind it.", 
    "The buffet is exactly as pictured. Shiny black finish matched well with existing furniture. Drawers are a bit small. I had no difficulty putting the piece together. For holding my wine glasses, I couldnt beat the price.", 
    "Quality compared to ikea. Came nicely packaged but I need to call overstock cause one of the legs came broken.", 
    "Nice, not high end furniture but very nice for the price. You will need basic skills at constructing furniture as there are quite a few pieces. Went together easily. Instructions were clear. Very pleased.", 
    "it is well built and has more storage space then i expected. great buy for the price.", 
    "My husband and I ordered this cabinet and had some issues putting it together. Several pieces were damaged and we had to have the company ship us new ones. They made us take pictures of each piece we needed replacements for and then a few days later we'd receive an email saying our new piece would be delivered the following week. This happened three times!! So what should have taken a day to assemble, stayed in our living room for almost a month while we waited for replacement parts.", 
    "This is a beautiful addition to any home. The design is second to none.", 
    "Nice, smaller buffet, fits in a small space between two doors in my living room and holds a nice amount of electronics/DVDs in an attractive, out of the way place. Quality is appropriate for the price. Sits high enough off the floor that I can place it over a HVAC register without obstruction of airflow. Would buy it again.", 
    "Absolutely perfect and beautiful. Extremely satisfied.", 
    "Not the best quality .. but its serves it purpose ...", 
    "This is a nice piece, for the price, but just a couple of minor issues. One of the legs was broken right out of the box, but we were able to fix with some wood glue we had in the garage. Fixed easily and no problems since. The other issue is more of a nuisance: The magnets that are supposed to hold the glass doors closed are so small and weak that they swing open VERY easily. In fact, just setting something down on top of the buffet is enough to jostle them open. Eventually I'll look into replacing the magnets to make them stronger. Other than these two issues, the piece is a nice addition to our formal dining room.", 
    "This buffet came really quick and was pretty easy to put together. I was almost done and was putting the last piece on...the final door. Everything went well when I noticed the left door went on with a gap on the top and for the life of me I could not get that gap out. Not sure what was wrong, but every other piece of the furniture went together with no issues, but that last door. At that point I was too frustrated to take it apart and send back. Aside from that, it looks great.", 
    "I am not very handy but put it together in about 2-3 hours", 
    "The buffet is much better than I expected for the price. It was easy to put together and looks fantastic in my dining room. Love it!!", 
    "another great buy in the Overstock furniture dept. solid wood, beautiful color,", 
    "Beautiful piece of furniture. Great for entry, dining, or living room. Anywhere you need a cabinet. Very solid.", 
    "This one was a bit trickier to put together, but worth it in the end. Once I got the items in it I wanted to store, I didn't love the look of the clear glass, so I added 2 sheets of contact paper to the glass and now they look like frosted panes. Plus, we can remove the contact paper at any time and have clear glass again, if we so choose. The instructions were horrible (think worse than ****), however we did get it all out together in the end. I'd say an hour and a half and we were done. Worth the elbow grease and frustrating moments in the end.", 
    "Great hutch for the price. Looks exactly like the picture!", 
    "Looks great in our dining area.", 
    "Purchased this for my kitchen. It's perfect! Received on time. No problems with delivery.", 
    "My buffet arrived on time and in good condition. Upon opening and separating the pieces I found the top hard a serious scratch about 6 inches long. It was packaged well so it was done at the factory - not in shipping.... The buffet went together well . All pieces lined up and makes for a nice little cabinet to hold wine and drink glasses. Other than the scratch I like it....", 
    "Very good value. Clean lines. Very easy to assemble (one person, one screwdriver). Arrived without damage. Perfect size for a smaller dining room or to pair with a 4 person table.", 
    "This year i wanted to have the best thanksgiving ever!!,so I purchased the butterfly diningroom table and 6 red leather chair .My final piece was my black buffet and let me tell you! My diningroom is gorgeous.I am so ready for thanksgiving!!I love,love,Overstock!!!", 
    "The buffet is a lot bigger and better than I would have expected for such an inexpensive price. It looks great in my breakfast nook area, a modern yet classic look.", 
    "Solid piece that looks substantial. The glass doors are pretty. A great value but took a while to put together.", 
    "The buffet table is very nice but the glass doors came scratch.", 
    "The doors were a little tricky to put together but overall it's a beautiful accent piece to my new kitchen. Holds a lot of mixing bowls and other items.", 
    "This buffet will do alright in my home as I do not have children. I was attempting to take product out of tightly packed carton, and the top hit the floor and suffered a dent. The back is like thick oak tag. As one may gather, this is not what I expected.I must say the nuts and bolts were well marked, and the directions were excellent.It looks fine in my dining room, but I will have to see how it stands the test of time.", 
    "For the money I paid for this item it was great, I would buy it again and it was the perfect size for the space I had. It was easy to put together and that was something I was a little bit worried about.", 
    "I purchased this buffet for my small dining area. I realized before purchasing that it was not a high quality piece of funiture but it does look nice and matches my furniture and was easy on the budget. All of the doors and drawers match up perfectly which I have found to be a problem on some of the \"put together yourself\" pieces I have purchased in the past. It arrived on time, was packed securely and was simple to assemble.", 
    "I love the look and style of this buffet. It looks awesome in my kitchen. The only complaint I have is with the doors. They do not line up. I would say that there was probably a half inch difference. Not sure if that was because of the hinges or if it had to do with the predrilled holes being off. There really is no way to drill different holes. So I had to find a way to level them out with a little ingenuity. Now the buffet looks great. I would have given it a five star rating if it had not been for that.", 
    "I like the look of this piece, but the construction isn't great. It was one of the lower-priced items of this type, but when I put it together, I found that the doors and drawers don't line up quite right. Everything was pre-drilled, and I carefully followed the instructions, so I don't think the error is on my end. If you don't look closely, it's a nice-looking cabinet, but when you open the doors they scrape against the drawers above, definitely uneven. Suits my purposes, but certainly not high-quality.", 
    "This product is cheap and not a good purchase. Product does not look like over picture displayed. Not 100% solid wood through-out.", 
    "This is a nice little piece of furniture for small space apartment. .was very easy to assembly , the only problem I found is that the door won't stay lock.", 
    "This buffet is so perfect! Measurements are precise. Wasn't difficult to assemble. We just love it. Looks just like the picture displayed. The glass doors lmakes it look very elegant. Worth every penny. We have never been disappointed with any items we have purchased from Overstock.", 
    "Took about 30 min to put together with my husband. We love the way it looks and holds large bowls and recipe books in our kitchen. Good storage solution for the price!", 
    "We bought this for our formal dining room & it looks great! We changed out the knobs to make it more stylish & it looks way more expensive than it really is.", 
    "very hard to put together. doors are very hard to put together. wholes to hang doors were not predrilled. would not recommend. looks cheap"
