    "I love the cart now that it's assembled; however, the assembly was a pain and caused the loss of one star in my recommendation. It took my husband and me (you NEED 2 people) more than 2 hours (and he is really handy at this stuff) to put it together ONLY because we needed to take it apart twice during assembly since it wasn't clear on the instruction sheet in what order things should be done. The instruction sheet is pictorial only and has multiple tasks on step 1 and step 2, etc. but, in reality they needed to be done in a certain order which could not be foreseen until you got to step 4.All in all I would buy it again. I've already had several complements on it. It has locking wheels, which many carts don't. It has sides around 2 of the shelves, which is so important if you are actually moving the cart, and it has 3 shelves providing more space than most. We are using it on our elevator to transport meals from our kitchen on the 2nd floor of our home, to the rooftop deck on our 5th floor. Couldn't enjoy a meal up there without this cart.", 
    "Exactly what I wanted! Perfect for having a small bar in your living room or by the kitchen. True to size and very sturdy construction. I did repaint it with chalk paint to give it a distressed look and it turned out great!", 
    "This piece is perfect for our needs on a protected patio. From the reviews, I was concerned about assembly. What?!? Took me 45 minutes start to finish and I only needed my husband to help for literally 30 seconds. Of the 45 minutes, I spent 3 minutes studying the assembly diagram and 5 minutes unpacking. Old adage - haste makes waste. Love this product!", 
    "Great product, nice medium brown rustic stain that seems to go with any room with the combination of metal framework. Very solid, rustic but updated look and timeless. The instructions are a bit tricky and we ended up having to undo it all and redo it because we forgot to put the X bar sides on the bottom shelf sides until after we had the rest of it put together. Total assembly time 30 minutes. Love it! Great quality piece.", 
    "All the other reviews talked about how hard this cart was to put together. OK, the directions are lousy. Pictures only. The thing that saved me was that I knew it was difficult, so I took my time and kept looking at the picture of the finished cart to see what went where. First, get both wood shelves in place before you tighten any of the side screws or you can't get the second shelf in between the legs. Second, when you are figuring out which side bars go where, look for the small holes that are pre-drilled for the lattice work...once you figure out which direction those holes have to face, it's easy. Just don't tighten any of the screws totally until it's all put together, then do them. I build mine on it's side instead of upside down like the directions show and it only took 45 minutes. VERY sturdy and great color. I would definitely recommend it!", 
    "Love the cart-directions are shady. For anyone buying it, well worth it but when putting it together, you need the stretcher bars on the bottom of the cart to have the mini-holes facing out so you can attach the lattice-had to take mine apart about 5 times before I figured that out! Also had a caster missing so can't give it an excellent rating. Didn't want to reorder and send back for one wheel but otherwise a very nice product.", 
    "This is a heavy duty and functional bar cart that we use to bring things to our deck for outdoor dining. It arrived on time. Assembly was straightforward and directions were accurate. The cart fits nicely with my decor and I am happy with this purchase.", 
    "It turned out just like it's picture which doesn't happen often. The wood and metal used in it's construction is very sturdy also, not cheap veneer. Take your time putting it together though. I put so stuff on backwards and so it took a little longer.", 
    "This is the perfect purchase. It was a bit of a splurge but definitely worth it. There is a varnish smell when you open the box, but it seems to be fading (I have had it about 24 hours). It was easy to put together and looks amazing!!", 
    "I am very happy with the rustic/ industrial look of this cart. It holds a decent assortment of bottles and supplies, keeping us at the ready for entertaining. A practical and stylish item for the home!", 
    "The cart arrived as scheduled but one part was missing. Customer service was very helpful, however, the process was a bit cumbersome. Although I only needed one part, a second cart was sent out-from which I had to extract the part. Overstock customer service arranged for *** to pick up the remaining pieces. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "Love this bar cart! It was pretty easy to put together and seems very sturdy. Plenty of room for glasses, bottles, ice bucket, etc. Bought it because it had the same look as a bookcase I had gotten elsewhere and the two are great together! Highly recommend this cart!", 
    "I built this bar four times. The instructions are so difficult to understand I damaged a piece and had to order another. Customer service was lovely but it was frustrating. The bar looks great. Build with a friend and go slow.", 
    "I love this cart, it's beautiful! Thanks to some of the previous reviews we had better written instructions to put it together because the picture instructions it comes with really are terrible. But its very well made and looks gorgeous. My only complaint which I hadn't read in anyone else's review, so I'm very upset, is that the base of my wine glasses are too big to slide in the rack! No one else commented on this so I had no clue..and was planning to use the racks for my glasses. Luckily there's so muchh space in the cart so I just placed them on the bottom shelf, but I was pretty disappointed about it...otherwise all good!", 
    "This bar is a beautiful addition to our living room! The quality is great and the size is perfect - love that it has the wine glass holders.We were a little afraid of assembly after reading some other reviews (and yes, the instructions are definitely lacking), but it was relatively painless and not as bad as we expected at all.", 
    "My husband put it together within an hour. Very easy and all the pieces were quick to assemble. It arrived 1 week after I ordered it and i was happy with the style. It's a nice rustic brown that goes with my other vintage pieces. It holds a lot of glasses and bottles on top of the cart. This is my second time buying something for O and I love it. I was hesitant at first to buy offline, but so far no disappointments. Love it!", 
    "I love my new cart. It is very sturdy. It was a little time consuming putting it all together. Totally worth it.", 
    "This bar cart took some effort to put together, but nothing overly difficult. The colors and style are neutral and would fit in just about anywhere. The top part is a tray that can lift completely off. Great product!", 
    "I am so thrilled with this beautiful and well constructed cart! I was even impressed with how well it was carefully and securely packed in the box. The assembly was very frustrating however. The illustrations are nicely drawn and all the ABC an 123 of parts on the instructions was clear, but the order in which to do them was not. I did and redid so many steps. It would have been nice to have a written list of steps and important points. But now it's done and holding lots of kitchen items and I love it!", 
    "I got this item to use as a coffee cart for my guest suite in my house. I put a little mini bar refrigerator on the bottom and coffee machine and cups etc. on top. I love it. It was east to put together and is very sturdy.", 
    "This cart was easy to assemble and looks really good. It rolls easily from our kitchen to our screened in porch and is big enough to hold everything we need. The directions were a little confusing we felt, but then my husband and I are not very good at putting things together. We did however figure it out without too much difficulty.", 
    "Love it!! It was very easy to put together. Looks great! I've gotten many compliments on it. I would definitely recommend it to others.", 
    "We have three pieces of this set and we love them all. We get tons of compliments on the serving cart. It was easy to put together and is very durable. It fits in perfectly with our d\u00e9cor.", 
    "Love this cart BUT it was so very difficult to put it together. My husband and I worked 2 hours on it and three attempts before we got it right.Looks great however and I'm glad I purchased it!", 
    "I had been looking for a bar cart, but wanted something sturdy. This was a fantastic purchase. It was easy to put together and looks great. The removal tray and third shelf are extra bonuses. So happy!", 
    "Great looking cart for my coffee station. Relatively easy to assemble, although instructions could be clearer. Make sure holes are facing outside on the next to bottom cross supports (where x-shaped decorative pieces go).", 
    "Beautifully constructed, nice and solid. Had a little trouble putting it together but did it. Looks great in my dining area, nice for extra wine glasses, serving pieces, etc.", 
    "This is a very well made piece of furniture for being a kit. Warning that it is a bear to put together---it's not that it's difficult per se, but the instructions are vague at best and it's very important that you line up each piece and triple check that it's facing the right way prior to putting everything together. This sounds like common sense. However, they have you put it together upside down, which throws off your perspective. In addition, the directions aren't very clear about when or how to put in the wooden shelves, so you really do need to conceptualize the entire process in advance, and don't assume that the directions will guide you through---they don't. Take your time, put on relaxing music, and prepare to have to disassemble at least once. It will be worth it when you're finished.", 
    "Beautiful elegant cart and very sturdy. However instructions are not clear.", 
    "Bought this for my husband for Xmas,as a portable bar. Works out great. Plenty of room on top and bottom 2 shelves. Very sturdy and well built. Looks great!", 
    "Came just as pictured. A little time to put it together (make sure the rails are facing the right way, you will need those little holes at the end to attach the lattice), but as expected. Solidly built, rolls smoothly.", 
    "I assembled it myself and it was a little tricky, but I took my time and it looks beautiful. The tip that you need to know is to keep the lower and top stretch iron pieces separated, because all 6 pieces look alike. Make sure the bottom iiron stretchers are facing that right direction. Don't tighten all screws at first. Assemble left part of cart then right part. It was tricky, I had to loosen screws to put the iron stretchers on.", 
    "Nice quasi-industrial style. Good size - holds a reasonable number of bottles, glasses and supplies. A little tricky to put together so read and follow the instructions VERY carefully. Even so, you might have to drill a couple of holes as not everything lines up perfectly. Doesn't affect the look. Pretty much looks like picture.", 
    "This bar is really beautiful. The quality is top notch and it exactly what is noted on the site. I'm happy with the purchase.", 
    "Perfect for the space. Really like the cart and the added room it gives me", 
    "This bar cart is exactly what I was looking for- rustic industrial. It is a perfect size and has great storage. I love the top tray and that it has a lip/edge to hold things on it securely. My husband put it together easily although he did say there were a fair number of pieces. I absolutely love it and for the money it seems like great quality and value.", 
    "I read a lot of reviews that said this bar was difficult to set up. It's not. You just need to think about how you're going to put it together. We put all the bars and shelves on one side before attaching the other. This made sliding everything in place a lot easier. Took about 45 mins from unpacking to being finished with two people.", 
    "I bought this with the matching office desk and two shelving units, and this is my favorite (and my husband's favorite) piece! The top shelf is removeable and the quality is fantastic.", 
    "Sturdy, easily assembled. Looks great and offers a bit of additional storage!", 
    "I bought this last minute for holiday entertaining and I was so excited when it arrived. The cart is well built, has a lock (lever) on the wheels so that ir will not move. Truly rustic", 
    "I love this bar cart! I got it in brown and color is perfect. It was easy to put together too.", 
    "Arrived as it looks online ... love it! Love the removable tray on top and the fact that it can wheel around.", 
    "most of the reviews seemed to say it was difficult to assemble. although it wasn't the easiest task to do by myself, i accomplished it in about an hour. so if two ppl are assembling, should be very easy! great touch to our space!", 
    "This was a gift to my daughter and she said it was great but tough to put together.", 
    "This cart was bought to complete my new kitchen. Was looking for something to display my wine and glasses. The Wine Rack however did not fit all of my glasses. The one set of glass I had was too wide so my husband had to modify it for me, good thing he's a welder. If you are looking into this the stem size to fit the rack are standard, not the wider based glasses on say a red wine glass. Easy to put together myself and very sturdy.", 
    "Fairly simple to put together. It looks just like in the picture. The only thing is that it had a very strong gasoline smell when pulled out of the box. Not sure if the smell was from the finishes on the metal, but it lingered for a few days. Other than that, LOVE the piece and would totally recommend it.", 
    "Not too difficult to put together, nice looking.", 
    "I love this bar cart it matches perfectly with my dining set. I absolutely love it.", 
    "Easy to put together and all pieces were in good shape. Like the industrial look.", 
    "Love it!! Looks great in my home", 
    "We are using this as a coffee bar. It's perfect. Easy to assemble. Sturdy. And beautiful.", 
    "Just what we were looking and the service was awesome.", 
    "The bar cart is great! Made of real wood instead of the fake, cheap veneer and fiberboard. Well worth the money!", 
    "Looks great and is a wonderful addition to my home. I get tons of compliments on this beauty.", 
    "This bar cart is exactly as pictured. Very sturdy. A bit complicated to put together, but overall it is a wonderful addition to our home and I would definitely recommend it.", 
    "perfect for my living room", 
    "This cart was a great addition to our home. fairly easy to assemble. I would recommend this product", 
    "I LOVE my new bar cart. It's exactally what I was looking for. Rustic looking but extremely sturdy. Well made. Kinda hard to put together (the directions are terrible) but once together it looks amazing.", 
    "I love the look of this cart and it fits perfectly in the space where I placed it. Most of the carts I've seen were too wide. I love the distressed wood and metal combination - it really gives it a very masculine appearance. My only complaint is that the instructions are very confusing to follow and seems a bit out of order. Also, I wish the wine racks were space a little wider so it could accommodate my larger wine glass stems.", 
    "Just what we needed for a small space!", 
    "Love that this bar cart holds so much and is so sturdy! It's perfect not only as a home bar, but for extra storage in a kitchen. Packaging for shipment was much better than for your average assemble-at-home product. Relatively easy to assemble despite the less than ideal instructions. Note that the tray is large and heavy on its own, so if you have it loaded with bottles or other items, it might be hard to remove from the cart and carry around.", 
    "Love this item. Well made and sturdy, and looks exactly like picture. Fits perfectly in the space I purchased it for. Easy to put together. Couldn't be happier.", 
    "Just redid my sunroom and put this in the corner with a little light up \"Bar\" sign on it and I've gotten SO many compliments already. Definitely the best corner of the room! And the top comes off and can be used as a serving platter for when we have company! Love it!", 
    "Love Love Love! Perfect kitchen bar! The picture does it no justice. You have no idea how long I stalked overstock waiting for them to restock this product.", 
    "We love this bar cart. It's functinal, priced well and looks great! Can't go wrong with this purchase.", 
    "as a professional in the field of Architecture and Design I appreciate unique items, This is one of those items.", 
    "Extremely study and useful for my bar area. Love that it is made of genuine wood", 
    "My fiance was able to put it together himself, and it looks AMAZING! So excited to have this in our loft. Great quality.", 
    "This is a solid, beautiful bar cart. Easy to put together, but definitely requires 2 people. Looks great in my kitchen, has the perfect blend of rustic and industrial that I was looking for. And a great price, as always!", 
    "Try to find a small bar with this quality and detail anywhere else for this price. A great value and easy to assemble.", 
    "Very nice looking accent piece. Assembly was manageable , and other reviews with detailed instructions helped. Great buy!", 
    "Easy to assemble. Very beautiful. My husband was happy!", 
    "went together easily, looks great in our great room, love the functionality and design...and well made, for a great price!", 
    "I have a very tall sofa and needed something tall for a side table - this fits the bill and I can roll it out of the way to vacuum very easily! holds everything I need - trays, magazines, dog blankets. It's great!", 
    "This is a nice piece but I messed up putting it together. Be very careful before attaching shelves. Instructions could be a lot clearer.", 
    "this is a super nice bar cart...the perfect size and I love the look of it. Rustic but contemporary. A bit tedious to put together but not impossible. Better instructions should be provided.", 
    "I've really enjoyed this bar cart so far. It holds all of my bar essentials and looks so nice. I was on a long-time hunt for the perfect cart, and I found it in this one. It's worth the price tag.", 
    "Thanks to earlier reviews my husband and I approached the assembly of this bar cart with fair warning. As a result we were able to put the cart together first try in less than an hour. Our suggestion is to begin assembly with the cart upside down. Line up all bars with the screw holes per diagram making sure that stretcher bar B has the front holes facing outward to later accept the front metals. Hold off placing screws. Turn the cart upright and gently pull the stretcher bars apart on one side so you can slide in the 2 shelves. Then realign the stretcher bars with the holes. Now begin placing the long screws into the shelves to secure them. Do not tighten them down yet. Next turn the cart upside down again and place the remaining screws. Once all screws are in place. Tighten everything. Add casters. Reverse handles on the tray. Upright the cart and place the tray on the top. Should be perfect. Our only complaint was a small split in the top tray where the laminate had cracked. A little Elmers glue fixed it easily. Love the cart.", 
    "Pretty good product for the price. Not high end furniture.", 
    "Cart is built really well. It's definitely worth the money. The only downside is the assembly, but that's no biggie.", 
    "I love this for our kitchen. It doesn't take up much space and can be moved easily. I'm looking forward to using it this summer. We can take the top tray off and take food and drink to the porch. The finish was nicer than I thought, and my husband had no trouble with assembly. I'm very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I had my eye on this for awhile to fill an empty wall between the kitchen and dining room. It is a good size in height, even with putting items of various heights on top tray, it still falls below the level of the light switch on the wall. The biggest features for me was the additional shelf space and the open design of the cart. It doesn't crowd the small space that it is in and I got an additional flat shelf surface that most carts do not have. I like the hanging storage for the wine glasses, it still has usable room on the other side of the bottom shelf. My teenage son put it together for me while I was at work, I didn't hear any complaints from him, but I can't speak on how long it took or how hard it was to follow the included instructions. I've gotten multiple compliments on this cart. I am very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Great looking product. The instructions need improvement. Make sure you have the correct bars with the holes facing out so you can screw in the criss cross panels. Start assembly with the bottom of the cart facing you. Looks great when finished.", 
    "The wheels are rubber on this cart, which means it is easy to relocate without scratches on floor or much pressure. Perfect size for a few bottles of your favorite drink and glasses. I love the wood color and all my furniture is the Myra Vintage.", 
    "This fit my son's apartment both functionally and style-wise. Very versatile and looks great. You have to look at the directions closely to ensure some of the pieces go on the correct direction.", 
    "can build the item when it doesn't even have a single screw. guess its suppose to be put together with duct tape.", 
    "Loved it but it took hours to assemble."
