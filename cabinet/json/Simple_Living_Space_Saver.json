    "We had just bought a new house and was super excited to have finally found a space-saving cabinet for our powder room! This was exactly what I was looking for. The delivery was super fast as it came in just two days. My husband found it a little difficult to assemble but it all worked out in the end. The only problem was the paint job. The paint around the knob of the horizontal drawer (an area about 6 inches wide and two inches tall) was faded. The best way I can describe it is that, it appears as if they ran out of paint, and someone went over the wood with \"overly runny white-out\". We tried kitchen cabinet mark-up stuff on it and it looks a little better but guests can definitely notice it. Had I known the poor quality, I would have not ordered it. It was too difficult to return as my husband had already assembled it and customer service didn't answer. We had a stressful evening so I just gave up and accepted that we had received a lemon.", 
    "I bought this for my daughter's bathroom in the condo we just bought. The unit fit perfect where I wanted it to go in but was difficult to get put together the whole way because of how hard it was to get the screws in. Several of the screws stripped when putting it together and I was unable to put the stability bar in the bottom because I couldn't get the screws in because it was very close. Had trouble understanding the directions at times too. The directions to put the hinges on was very poor and took some changes to figure out. The middle door doesn't stay shut.", 
    "I love the space saver, It gave me the extra storage space I need to keep items off the floor and the 2 spaces for on each side of the space saver for toilet paper and the space behind for extra rolls is wonderful. I could not have designed a better fix for me and it is not tall, just the right size.. Thank you!", 
    "Was hesitant about ordering after a couple of the reviews since I am so NOT a handy DIY'er. But this was just what I needed for my bathroom and so I took my chances. The instructions are illustrated and I received all hardware. It took me about 2 hours with a time out to find a small hex key shaped screwdriver for the tight spaces. As long as you have that one tool you will be ok. The finished product is sturdy and of good quality. I would definitely recommend.", 
    "I didn't have any trouble putting it together. I did have to reposition the stabilizing bar to go under toilet. Shelves rearrange easily. I found it was too low fr the new top plunger flushing toilets so we elevated it with nail in tabs.", 
    "I have experience assembling items... so if you do not... stay away from this item? All you need is a very small phillips screwdriver but you would think that they would state this. All they have are five diagrams for the complete assemble but they do not go into detail. ie. do you put wood glue on the dowels? I know that you are suppose to turn the medal bracket in order to secure the screws to the other piece but if you haven't assembled something like this before you wouldn't know this. Diagrams show place this here and here but you need to figure out how to secure the pieces together. Other then having the pieces labeled for you along with the quantity, and the diagrams numbered for you ~ there aren't any words on the instruction sheets. I finished assembling this and the item looks okay but not worth the price. Poor quality for the money I spent. Disappointed and I would not recommend this item.", 
    "I was very upset when I opened the box to find that the directions to put it together was torn up into shreds. Then when we finally received the directions my husband proceeded to take the boards out to put it together and the paint was chipped on one of the boards. Now I am waiting for another board to replace chipped board.", 
    "The directions on assembly of this product are very unclear. I consider myself pretty handy around the house, and have assembled various IKEA products without much trouble. This had a very large PITA factor. First, you have to be sure that your toilet is centered on the wall, and there is enough space for the stabilizer bar to pass behind it. The direction don't say you can put the bar in several places, depending on the height of the toilet and available space. The directions also call for putting on the door hinges last, when in fact they should go on first because there is no room to put a standard screwdriver into the space, and you will strip the small screws. Some parts were missing the labeling. and it wasn't clear which is the front or the back. It does make a difference when you try and put on the facings on the back. No pilot holes for the small screws for the facings, either. I bought two of these, and after spending 2 1/2 hours putting this together and still having to take some of the pieces off for it to work, I'm sending the other one back.", 
    "Not too difficult to assemble. Fits perfectly in my power-room. It does have a painted/turpentine like smell. I would recommend airing the boards before assembling it. Otherwise I would have rated it Excellent.", 
    "It came with a lot of pieces. For someone experienced in putting this stuff together, no problem. For your average person, a big pain in the butt. I put it together over a few days. It wasn't that sturdy so I used wood glue as I put it together. Then I remembered that I forgot to measure and the darn thing was to big for behind my toilet. I ended up donating it. It was alright for my daughters bathroom if it wasn't so big.", 
    "Kind of a pain to put together. Don't really like that it had two toilet paper holders. Overall looks ok.", 
    "I cannot say enough about this product. I had a small narrow guest bath and this gave me the storage I needed as well as it is nicely made and looks great in there. I will say it's a little overwhelming when I opened the box to assemble but it was well worth the time it took. Already recommended to a couple family members.", 
    "Went together pretty easy. I'm 74 and didn't have any problems. Looks and fits great in our small bathroom. I would buy again.", 
    "I ordered one for each bathroom, It looks great, adds storage for those personal needs and gets wonderful compliments from guests.", 
    "love the finished product, but was not very easy to put together. def need 2 for this project. overall very satisfied with the end product. i love shopping with the O, im an addict. thx O", 
    "This space saver was a perfect solution to our powder room storage problem. It stores 5 large rolls of toilet paper in reach when needed. The instructions were a little complicated but we got it done easy enough by laying out the pieces, which were marked, to identify what was what. It took us about 90 minutes to finish it. There are plenty of compartments with adjustable shelves to meet your needs. Instead of using the slots for toilet paper, I use the space for an air freshener. The opening is perfect for that. I would recommend this product to anyone with a small powder room that needs storage.", 
    "The instructions are not at all clear, just a picture. With a little thought you can figure it out but we got the top piece on backwards the first try. The paining is not good and it mars easily. The piece serves its purpose fine and since it is hidden in the water closet, the appearance problems are not a real issue.", 
    "We needed this for a master bathroom where the toilet occupies its own tiny room. I was happy to find this design since we did not need a tall shelving-type unit. This fits perfectly, holds everything someone might need in that room, and looks great. As with most of the assembly required stuff I've purchased from Overstock, the pieces and hardware were well marked. The instructions were okay (mostly illustrative). Assembly was fairly quick and easy -- maybe an hour. Would purchase this again, though I do think it is somewhat overpriced given its construction!", 
    "Was disappointed with the quality not to sturdy to expensive for this item because of the quality. Flimsy.", 
    "Well, I finally put this together yesterday. I was a little worried a s a lot of people had problems putting it together. After identifying all of the pieces and getting familiar with them I put it together in 45 minutes. The only thing I'm not real happy with are the toilet paper slots. There are two of them and with the space saver behind the toilet it is awkward to reach for it. And who needs two? Maybe it's designed for a right or left-handed person. LOL \ud83d\ude04", 
    "holds a lot of extra tissue rolls", 
    "This is a very nice addition to the bathroom and holds multiple rolls of toilet paper. It will hold shampoos and bathroom items. Was very easy to assemble.", 
    "It's sturdy, good quality, and I love it.", 
    "This product was ok for the price but they could have done a better job at making sure all pieces fit together as they are supposed to", 
    "I thank that this is the best space saver and attractive, everyone ask me where did you get that, I want one, that is so pretty. It was reduced on line from $88.00 to I thank $68.00 but I mist that sell. I love it", 
    "It came with 1 million screws and was a pain in the neck to assemble", 
    "Love it great deal nice space saver", 
    "Got what I paid for. Very cheap and unsturdy", 
    "I purchased this last year and I absolutely love it!!! Just the right size and plenty of storage. I assembled it myself and it wasn't difficult at all. Anytime I have guest over they comment and want to know where I got it", 
    "This took two people 2.5 hours to assemble,did not get the door of the top unit installed. The hinge could not be placed by eye and there were no instructions or pictures. Overall, the instructions are barely adequate, hard to translate from the pictures to the parts to be assembled", 
    "It's a nice set up but I had to send it back cause it did not fit in my bathroomthat's all I can say about it.", 
    "This is a cute space Saber. The door magnets don't work very well so hard to keep top drawer closed. It's nice and provides the extra storage my son needed for his bathroom", 
    "This space saver makes my bathroom look real nice. I love the additional bathroom paper storage space! Directions are easy to follow and the piece after being build is sturdy enough for the purpose. Nice addition to any bathroom lacking storage.", 
    "This is the perfect space saver for a bathroom where their is no room for a taller one.", 
    "to big for the back of my toilet, wish i would have measured it first.", 
    "I've always disliked over the toilet organizers...but this one is awesome! It hides everything behind doors so the items you are storing don't get dusty.", 
    "it is a very nice size but is a bear to put together, the screws are so tiny and there are so many..once you get it done it is nice, but not for the faint of heart!", 
    "Very functional except for the two toilet roll holders; They work but hard to reach around. However it works", 
    "Absolute junk. Strong odor of paint when the box was opened. Missing one screw for the stabilizer bar and one magnet for the middle drawer. Several pre-drilled holes were misaligned. Screws stripped out with the slightest amount of torque. Overall quality very poor. I was so disgusted I put the whole thing out for trash pick-up. Did not want to spend any more time to disassemble and box back up.", 
    "This was delivered in very good condition, went together just fine although there are MANY pieces and you need to follow LOTS of directions which include looking very carefully to the pictures and the identified parts which are marked on each piece with a removable sticker. There are 2 sets of tiny screws which look almost identical but are not so be careful. Took me, (58 yr. old female) about 2 full hours to assemble with 2 screw drivers. I was not able to put the cross bracing which would go behind the toilet and connects the 2 side pieces to make this more sturdy because there was not enough space behind the commode to accommodate it, so I removed it and it is still sturdy and fits just fine without it. If we ever move I may put it on just to brace it for travel. This is made mostly of engineered wood and particle board, but it looks fine once together. I also left out the shelves on one side to fit the toilet bowl brush behind that door, so no more clutter. I am going to get 3 brushed nickel knobs to replace the wooden ones which I don't really like, or you can paint them with an metallic or colored enamel too. I will match them with the rest of my bathroom hardware knobs as closely as possible. Very good price - very labor intensive assembly.", 
    "The product is very useful in small bathroom the assembly went well just take your time. Some of the predrilled holes were misaligned but that is easily cared for. Great product", 
    "This might be a nice product if they would send good directions. The directions suck. If you have a few days to spare then you might get it put together Im on day 2 now and still trying. if I dont get it done by today it will be returned", 
    "Missing crucial parts. Front doors are the same hole orientation. Steer clear of this chintzy piece of crap.", 
    "It goes perfect with my average size bathroom. Perfect space saver!!!", 
    "Love everything about this item, except putting it together. Fits sooooo much that would be on the countertop.", 
    "A million piece jigsaw puzzle would be a better description. When almost completely assembled, a numbered punch was missing on one of the planks. We took it apart, returned it and had to pay $$ for return shipping - I won't take a chance on things like this anymore. Too costly.", 
    "This item had too many pieces and not enough directions. I didn't like it after I purchased it overall..", 
    "We remodeled our bathroom, and bought this space saver not to save space... but because it perfectly fit and looks great. In the meantime storing toilet papers and other things is really easy in this little cabinet. Putting it together took about an hour, and it wasn't that bad as others described. Everyone who has seen it asking me where did I get this perfect little cabinet.", 
    "The \"instructions\" for this item are vague and practically non-existent. Mostly they consist only of diagrams, which are not very clear. I spent longer putting this together than any other assembly required item I have ever purchased. Then it was way too wide to accommodate my space. Going to the local hardware/lumber store would have been a wiser move. Save your money and your sanity. This item is NOT worth either!", 
    "This is a POS...Hard to put together, did not fit propertly", 
    "I thought this was going to be so cute over my toilet and I was SO excited when it finally arrived! Unfortunately, the piece was very difficult to build (trust me, we have ordered tons of furniture on Overstock and built all of it and never had a problem). The quality just didn't live up to its cost. Some of the panels got damaged simply from the poor design of where you were supposed to screw in the nails, etc. Overstock.com customer service was very helpful in rectifying the situation, but I would not recommend the product.", 
    "For broad acceptance dimensions must be more specifically considered. Bowl and reservoir dimensions must be exactly known as well as relationship to any obstruction such as wall(s), vanity, tub, etc.. ours would not fit due to vanity and tub locations. a little design and flexibility in the design of the space saver should provide an attractive product for virtually all applications. Good luck! We are still in the market. My wife found an application for the unit we bought so we are very happy with the one we bought.", 
    "Real nice fit. Ideal for some many needed items.", 
    "The quality is not worth the price.", 
    "Assembly was made difficult due to a hole missing on one of the side panels.", 
    "Very fast, smooth & professional. Highly recommend seller!! Thank you! A+", 
    "It gives us cottage storage but came in many, many pieces!", 
    "I love the look of this space saver. It allows for a cleaner design and better organization. I would purchase this again.", 
    "If I didn't have experience building cabinets I would have been lost. 1st off the left door was warped so put it in a jig and twisted it the opposite direction. then steamed it with a steamer I use for building mandolins and guitars. It still wasn't perfect. but close enough for an eagle eye. Next the hinges were paper thin tin, I had some brass ones the right size in my hinge bin [I'm sorry if rhymes] and put them on instead. Anyway I gave it 4 stars because of the twisted door and the hinges are a joke. But it is a useful Simple Living Space Saver...CB", 
    "I recently bought a new condo. One of the bathrooms was built into an odd little space which contained a pedestal sink and a toilet, and that's all. The builder covered the walls of this very tiny space with wallpaper in a pattern of large palm fronds--a pattern that is echoed elsewhere in my new home. No shelves. No cabinets. No storage at all. Furthermore, there's simply no room to add a cabinet around the sink.This small bathroom is the one guests will use when visiting so it needed a bit of storage to insure everything a guest might need would be at hand. The other two bathrooms (much larger, with ample storage space) are upstairs. Call me lazy but I don't want to forever be running up and downstairs to do a little bit of every day cleaning. This tiny bathroom, therefore, urgently needed a bit of shelving or storage.I began to search. At 75x45 inches (190.5x114 centimeters), there's very little available that will fit into a bathroom as small as my little gem. The width (45in/114cm) insured I would not find a pre-manufactured unit in which to enclose my sink and, so, it became absolutely necessary that I find shelving to install on the 75in (114cm) \"big\" wall.After a little searching, I came across Simple Living Space Saver's Bathroom Cabinet. I had very little choice in the matter of storage for my tiny bathroom, and so was quite pleased when I happened upon it; even the online pictures were attractive. So I purchased one.My friend said it was easy to put together. All the small parts were present--and there were even a couple extra screws, just in case. He had it together and in the bathroom in no time.It nicely complements the bold wallpaper of my tiny bathroom and also goes very well with the other storage pieces I chose for this space. As well as being quite attractive, it's also impressively strong and has lots of room for everything from bathroom cleaning products to extra TP, from a plant to a scattering of smaller personal items.I don't feel I can adequately express my enthusiasm for this wonderful, small shelving uni. I wish I could add a picture or two to show how good it looks--but I can't see how to do that here at Overstock. Oh well: It's definitely very nice, this item!", 
    "Great product, excellent product, unfortunately I missed measured my space and it is two large. However, I manage to use it in another area. Easy assembly.", 
    "My son has a small condo in J.C. his bathroom has only a medicine cabinet this fits perfect over the toilet and in between toilet and sink.He loves it.", 
    "We have a small half bathroom with limited vertical space because it's built under the stairs. That doesn't mean we don't have the same storage needs. It fits perfectly around or toilet and store all of our toilet paper as well as extra makeup for me. The top is a great place for decoration - the plant and framed art we put on it almost disguise that the toilet it underneath it all!", 
    "It fits well over my toilet bowl and doesn't make my bathroom look crowded. I just wish the shelf supports were more secure.", 
    "Great addition to my bathroom lots of storage which was badly needed.", 
    "Two were ordered. One box was missing hardware and a panel, the other box had the wrong hardware and was missing hardware as well. In a confined space the doors would not open either if you are looking for a product that will save space in a confined area of the bathroom.", 
    "It's a good item that fits perfectly over my tankless toilet (we have the other kind - the kind of toilet that uses pressure or something...very old school) and fills in that space nicely. Turns out I have more products than expected so the two towers are a little too narrow. This items stands perfectly level which is great. The only thing I hate: the pre-drilled holes on one tower were \"off\" so that when I put the door on, it was not level or even. It won't close all the way and slowly swings open. You would have to take the WHOLE THING APART if you want to adjust something like that. In addition, the holes I need would cut into the ones that are there and just make the problem worse. I'm going to try and get another piece from the manufacturer. Fingers crossed. This item has many pieces but once you start, you'll get the hang of it. It takes some time to put together so be patient and make it a project where you can take your time completing.", 
    "This product was extremely hard to put together and then I had to drill holes and use my own screws to get it aligned. You will also need a LOT of glue. I would have sent it back if I hadn't already drilled those holes! I'm quite disappointed and it will be a long time before I buy another product from this site. I would put the value at about $XX.X.", 
    "This isn't the highest quality product, but it has a great look and feel for a space saving bathroom feature. You'll need slightly more space than indicated around your toilet for this to fit. Mine was \"just fit\" with measurements, and I had to return it. Sort of standard construction for furniture these days, so it's solid but will probably break in five years with normal wear and tear. Of course that's all speculation since I returned it.", 
    "This space saver arrived in a reasonable amount of time. With the help of directions that reminded me of Lego directions, It took my husband and son a short time to put together. There were a couple of pieces that didn't line up quite right but It looks great in our bathroom. If you need \"space\" in a small bathroom - this is exactly what you need.", 
    "Very difficult to put together. Very heavy but attractive and holds the items I wanted to remove from view and have convenient to access. You'll need at least 2 hours and 2 people to put together and place behind a toilet.", 
    "This is a good looking little cabinet. Not fine furniture, but very functional and decent looking for the price. It can in a million little piece, so you need to enjoy that sort of thing if you are going to buy this. Unfortunately we measured wrong and it did not fit in the space we had! Had to \"un-put-together\" and Overstock was very good about letting us return it with a small \"open box\" charge.", 
    "Brought this as a gift for my Best Friend. Easy to assemble alone but better with 2 people. Used wood glue to reinforce structure along with the hardware (screws) that came with it. Product looks like picture, luv the storage compartments, especially the 2 slots for toilet paper. A couple of screws could of been a little longer on the hinges because the weight of the door compartment. Note the back panel is of a cardboard like material but overall the Space Saver is good and serves its purpose very well.", 
    "took a very long time to put together. instructions hard to follow", 
    "A useful product. wider than it appears in the photograph. But it has lots of additional storage space, especially if the Bathroom is small and narrow.", 
    "The space saver is very nice, except it gould have been a little wider and deeper, but otherwise good.", 
    "I love the cabinet, it is cheap made, but I think it looks good in my bathroom!!!", 
    "Too many parts. Very difficult to put together. I still do not have it put together. Big project!", 
    "I would definitely recommend this item, I have a small area for storage in a compact area & this is an ideal solution & easy to assemble.", 
    "I was putting together this space saver and it's not hard, but there are only pictures; no words to tell you what to do. I was missing half of the hardware that it stated I should have. I had to go to ******** to get a lot more screws. (FREAKING ANNOYING) The middle drawer (above the tank itself) was drilled incorrectly. There is a magnet that holds the doors shut (which is nice); however all over my holes on that pull down were drilled incorrect. I had to drill all new holes, and now there is a new hole for the handle that I had to drill, which leaves the bottom hole, well a hole in the front. The long arm hinge didn't work since the holes were drilled on the wrong side, so I had to drill some new holes. Very annoying overall. If this unit was properly manufactured and one received ALL of the hardware that it says is included...then I'd give it a better review. PROs: Magnets help hold doors shut, moveable shelves, two places for toilet paper or tissues, added storage. CONs: Missing hardware, wood dowels were too small (I used Elmers glue to get them to stick in there), poor drilling of holes, directions need to be more clear.", 
    "Never assume anything! Measure, measure, measure. Rather than return and pay shipping & a possible restocking fee, I kept it. If I ever get a larger bathroom with the clearance needed between the toilet and other fixtures, I will use it there.", 
    "Overall I am pleased with the purchase. The instructions for assembly were not helpful.", 
    "It fits perfect in my little bathroom. It takes the place of a cabinet because I put in a new pedastel sink.", 
    "overall the product was good . the knobs were missing , so I will have to purchase them .The price dropped 15% just after I received. There should be a price gurantee.Need to be double jointed to use toilet paper", 
    "We have a window right in front of our toilet so the traditional taller over the toilet space savers & cabinets wouldn't work in our situation so this was the perfect solution for us as it sits BELOW our window sill. Lots of compartments but be aware that shelves on adjust so high for taller items. Directions had some unclear areas, but logic helped. Some of the predrilled screw holes (on backing pieces) were poorly spaced too close to edge so take caution to line up carefully (again, pressboard)! Overall, this piece is a unique design that really can really maxiumize your space when it's limited.", 
    "I love this space saver, I bed I'd love it more if I knew how to put it together. It didn't come with directions. Can someone help me?", 
    "Because I had assembled many pieces of furniture far more complicated, I had no trouble with assembly. It took less than 2 hours. The instruction sheet had only pictures. There were no written directions and the individual pieces were not identified with letter or numbers. Someone with no assembly experience might have more trouble.", 
    "I am very pleased with my purchase. The item was exactly as the picture looks online and is very sturdy. I would definitely recommend.", 
    "This product was great. Not being a DIY, i was impressed with how well everything was organized in baggies, etc. A few items were not marked but just by the pictures on the box and instructions, you could tell what piece went where. Easy to assemble and excellent for additional storage. Not disappointed at all. My only regret was not measuring more accurately, but i had another location to use.", 
    "nice for my bathroom! Love it", 
    "never again would we order this",
