    "I searched for a futon with a thicker mattress. I was impressed that this product advertised a 13 inch thickness - 10 inches when compressed. - WRONG! Mattress is no more than 8 inches - fluffed, compressed, or otherwise. Very misleading! Assembly was made easier with the manufacturer's step-by-step youtube video. We had a screw head shear off during assembly, made a trip to Home Depot for a replacement as we were expecting overnight guests that weekend and not enough time to request from manufacturer. When I asked our guest on the comfort level, she politely advised, it was \"okay\" but could feel springs. Time to search for a foam topper! Know that as a queen size futon, it has a very high back. All-in-all, for the low price, product is not horrible, not great, but is okay for occasional use.", 
    "This was much easier to put together than other sofa beds I've had in the past. Make sure that you lay all of the parts out and check them off against the parts list. Depending on the arms that you choose, you may have more parts than you actually need, which is a bit worrying until you realize what they've done. The instructions are excellent. I used some non-permanent glue dots to keep the little wooden plugs that cover the bolt heads in securely. That will make it easier to dismantle it if I ever have to move it. The overall quality is really good, with a sturdy frame and a thicker than average seat/back/mattress. The back is high, so the \"sofa\" doesn't jut out far from the wall. giving you more space to move around in a visitor room. Use a bit of WD40 on the joints to make it easier to convert it from sofa to bed, otherwise it's best to have two people change it back to a sofa until the mechanism gets a bit of use. The futon comes in two big boxes, one of which arrived two days ahead of the projected time and the other a day early, so we were pleasantly surprised and impressed by how quickly it came. Shipping times will vary, of course, depending on stock and where you are.", 
    "Reviewers posted that this was hard to assemble. While I did not do the assembly, I watched my husband and he had no problems what so ever. The thick mattress sits beautifully on the frame (I ordered the olive with the lighter wood frame). I am sure that we will get years of use from this futon. This is a great value for the price and I recommend it. Shipping was fast and while the mattress did not arrive with the shipment of the frame, the online chat was very helpful and the mattress arrived 2 days later", 
    "Within the last week we had 5 guests sleep on this futon, and everyone remarked on how comfortable they were. Assembly instructions were very clear (including that if you had a metal frame, there would be extra pieces). The only trouble we had was converting from bed back to sofa, and that's simply because of stiff new springs.", 
    "I purchased this to replace my college bound daughter's twin bed in the room she shared with her younger sister who wanted the room to feel more apartment like. We also wanted it to be comfortable sleeping quarters for friends and her sister when she came home from college. Both girls enjoy the purpose it serves for each of them. My college daughter never complains about sleeping on it and she was very picky about what she was going to allow her sister to get.", 
    "Somewhat disappointed, but it will have to do. Difficult to assemble...instructions were very difficult to understand, things just didn't line up with correctly with the assembly and it took several hours to make it right. Disappointed in the quality of the mattress. Only keeping it because it's too much trouble to return. Would not purchase this particular set again.", 
    "I had my first company to use the bed last month and they told me was great for sleeping. I bought it for the thicker mattress and I think that made the difference over other futons I have seen. It is great for my small house where space is limited but I wanted to have a bed when company comes. Meets all my needs and then some....especially with the drawers underneath for storage.", 
    "This futon is comfy enough to provide a good night's rest for our 6-foot plus adult 20-something \"kids\" when they visit, and I actually like the higher back when in sofa position- it's a nice rest for one's head if watching media. That being said, I initially ordered the \"mahogany\"- BIG mistake.. it channels the purple seating found at most Chinese buffet.. it would have been returned immediately for that reason alone.. however, it also arrived mis-shipped (I received \"Ben Shui\" arm pieces, not \"Mission\", and one of the arms had a ten-inch split in the wood).. So, I called Overstock, and they were truly very helpful and arranged the return.. The walnut color was out of stock, at first, and I was promised that Overstock would work with me on the pricing (esp. as I had used a signif coupon discount) if/when the correct style was available. Well, long and short, we now (after a total of about three weeks and LOTS of packing/unpacking/cardboard to recycle/HEAVY lifting and toting to UPS/and, of course, assembly) have a very nice futon for the $ that works well-- a good value for occasional use-- and IS the right color and style.", 
    "We purchased this as a bed for our studio apartment. Had it for nearly two months and love it. Fairly easy to put together. Some unnecessary pieces included and directions aren't very clear. With some patience and basic building skills this is an easy assemble. We had to purchase a down pillow topper making it more comfortable!", 
    "We brought this sofa bed for our son's playroom. He loves the chair. It is big enough for 3-4 kids to sleep on it together when he has sleepovers. It is very comfortable according to our adult guests who have slept on it also.", 
    "It's a little deeper sit than I realized but that's because it's a queen. Nice rich deep blue color. Kind of easy assembly but one bar was bent so it took a while to straighten it.", 
    "I had to put a memory foam topper on it to make it comfortable. It has a weird tobacco smell, but otherwise it's okay for the price.", 
    "This pull out futon frame and mattress was a great choice: super sturdy construction, easy to unfold and refold. We wanted a step up from the standard futon for a guest room but didn't want a sofa bed. This fit the bill and is really comfortable with the thick mattress. Great value and investment. My only issue is we ordered the bright green cover (like kiwi) and what we got was different, more of an olive green, but this is not a deal breaker and we are happy with the color.", 
    "Futons have come a long way since my college days! This is the perfect solution to our office/guest room. The mattress is wonderful, so comfortable. It was easy to assemble and looks like it cost much more than it actually did!", 
    "I like the look of the bed. I love how the head portion of the bed is very high for when you have it up as a seat. The most bothersome thing about this bed is that there is only one thin stick in the center of the bed holding it up. So, if someone sleeps on it frequently, already it begins to dent inward. We are two very small people and we make sure to get on the bed super lightly so not to break it. It is very comfortable, id just wish that the frames went all around, not just the center...TOO HUGE TO RETURN so think wisely..", 
    "The sofa was relatively easy to put together. It is practical and comfy. Plus, it looks great!", 
    "I bought this futon to use in my studio apartment. I got the queen size mattress. It is a total step up from my previous sleeping arrangement. Great functionality. The mattress is more than sufficient with a 2\" memory foam topper added, though I plan I buying a much nicer one this fall.", 
    "The futon does it's job. It's just to have in our office to hang out and sleep on when we have company. It was okay to sleep on, more Soave than a regular size futon. If you can get this below $*** shipped it's a great deal. The back is a little high when in couch mode, but you are getting a queen bee and not a cramped full. Very happy with purchase.", 
    "I have not slept on it yet but teeanage grandson liked sleeping on it. My brother saw it and said he wishes he had bought one like this one.", 
    "We bought this futon as a guest bed but I like to sleep on it myself. It is firm and feels good on my back. The red/rust fabric is also really pretty..", 
    "The futon frame is great. Very sturdy and well made. I am very happy with the frame. The mattress is not comfortable at all. I thought by being an inter spring mattress it would be more comfortable than a foam mattress. I was wrong. I am now buying a foam mattress to go over the top. Very disappointing. Also the mattress came with 3 splits in the cover. These are where it is quilted. Too much trouble trying to return this large item, so I will try to sew it and hope it does not look too bad.", 
    "Took several hours to put together but had easy directions and great quality", 
    "GREAT SLEEPING, GOOD LOOKING", 
    "This is a beautiful futon. It isn't to difficult to put together and is very comfortable.", 
    "These futons serve our purpose. However, the first problem was that I ordered two which were guaranteed to be received by a certain date for a gathering at our home. Only one arrived, and we discovered that the other had not been shipped. We survived with folding chairs and eventually received the second one. We have had them for slightly over one year, and the mattresses are losing shape. The thought of having to replace the mattresses is daunting.", 
    "The instructions took some time to figure out, and assembly required some very awkward hand positions. All parts were there. The mattress is heavy, which in this case is a good thing, but took two people to place correctly. The mechanism isn't the smoothest to operate, but OK for us as an emergency guest bed. Very comfortable to sit on, and pretty supportive as a bed. We were prepared for the very high back, which is needed for this to open to a queen size bed.", 
    "I bought this to use as seating and an extra bed in an office. I think it will work for those purposes although no one has slept on it yet. It was not difficult to put together and because it was in pieces, it was easy to fit through a narrow hallway and doorway.However, when the mattress box was opened, it had a strange sort of chemical smell,. That did disappear after a week or so although there is still a slight smell after about 3 weeks.The other problem is that several of the areas where the material is tufted are pulled so tight that the material has small rips in it. The white stuffing shows.Overstock was good about finding a compromise to fix it. They sent a cover a slipcover no charge. However, it is just a plain cover with no tufting so the futon will not have any character as before.I sort of had the option of returning the mattress but I seemed to be discouraged from doing that. It is also very heavy and bulky and would have been difficult to package.This futon will be OK because it's in an office that few people will see. Although the frame looks good, I would not use this is a room where you want a nice looking piece of furniture especially if you get a defective mattress.", 
    "This futon is very comfortable and sturdy. The mattress is thick and very heavy. It's perfect for a guest room. Very happy with this purchase. It was delivered so quickly, I couldn't believe it!", 
    "Comfortable as a couch or a bed. The back is very high as a couch, but this is a necessity for a queen-sized futon. The directions were okay--had a left and right piece mislabeled and one bolt that wouldn't fit (had to drill to make a hole bigger), but overall, I am very happy with it.", 
    "Using it in sunroom so that it can double as guestroom. My guests say it's very comfortable. Easy to pull out. Has a cool industrial look to it. We're pleased with this purchase.", 
    "This is a queen sized mattress on an oddly made queen sized futon. The worst part is that the mattress tag says \"not to be used on a futon\". Why would you sell a futon with a mattress not made for a futon?? The odd shape makes the back two feet higher than your head while you are seated.... I would love a refund on this! Would not recommend to anyone looking to add another sleeper to your decor! :-(", 
    "The frame and mechanism of this futon seem pretty good, but the cover of the mattress is awful. It is made of some paper-like material and was already ripped where it was attached to the mattress. It also crinkles like paper when you sit on it. At first I thought that it was just a protective cover for shipping, but no such luck. I am going to have to order a decent cover to cover the cover.", 
    "Not all that greatCheaply madeI have to take cushon off to close.", 
    "We like this futon as it sits in our entertainment room in the finished basement which also serves as our guest area.", 
    "The futon sleeper is wonderful. Was not hard to put together.", 
    "My sister was coming from VA to spend Thanksgiving week with me. I needed to purchase a queen size futon to fit her and her husband. I was very nervous the first night they slept on it and was waiting for complaints the next morning. Futon mattresses are not the most comfortable. To my shock, they both raved about how great they slept and how comfortable the mattress was. Even after a week they were still raving about it. It was pretty easy to put together also. Came a day early by UPS, so it was left on the stoop. That's the only negative.", 
    "The frame holes did not match up when we put it together, had to alter frame to get it to work. Also, where the fabric tucks in the cushion, the fabric has holes where it was stitched and the inner lining shows through. Poor quality in the workmanship, cheaply made. Probably won't last for long before it breaks and is rendered useless.", 
    "This is a decent quality basic futon. The innerspring mattress seems comfortable enough, though anyone sleeping on it more than one or two nights in a row will probably want to invest in a thick mattress topper as the springs can certainly be felt. The cover is a nice soft sueded fabric, and the mattress itself has a very pleasant cedar scent. The queen size means that the back is very high in the sofa position, which can look a bit odd. A throw blanket across the top can help break that up visually. This biggest downside that I can see is that unless you have two people or herculean strength, it is nearly impossible to wrangle back into the sofa position from the flat bed position. I ended up having to remove the unwieldy mattress, fold the frame back to the sofa setting and then wrestle the mattress back on. Phew. Assembly was straightforward and easily managed by one person. The included instructions seem to have been photocopied so often that the images were too dark to see some critical details, but it's uncomplicated enough that you can figure it out without. It comes with all of the tools needed (alan and crescent wrenches), but I used my impact driver to save time and effort. The most difficult part of assembly funnily enough was lining up the front mattress retainer brackets that keep it from sliding off when in the sofa position. The cotter pins provided to secure the hook connecting the back and seat were laughably insufficient so I did replace those with some that I had on hand - but a bobby pin or similar would probably do in a pinch if they ever needed replacing.", 
    "I ordered the walnut futon with Cardinal red mattress because all of my furniture in this room is dark wood, espresso or dark walnut. The box says walnut, but it's a much lighter color, more like a golden honey oak. The red fabric is also lighter than pictured. Otherwise, the mattress is comfortable, the directions were clear and easy to follow, and the frame was not difficult to assemble.", 
    "Was not \"red\" more of a rust color. Also the back is so tall it looks awkward. However it is very comfortable for a futon and sending it back would be too much trouble \ud83d\ude0f", 
    "I don't use this everyday, it is for my overnight guests that report it is very comfortable. I like that it is queen size. Besides some difficulty with putting it together, ( the instructions were not clear and you need 2 people for sure ), it is awfully difficult folding it back to sitting, and sitting to bed. I followed the instructions but you really have to have 2 people on either side to fold or open. For me, mostly as a sofa, it works great and comfy. It would be a pain if I had to fold it up and down on daily basis. Tried DW40. If you buy this, before you start, take the hinges and really loosen them up with DW40 and manually push them in and out.", 
    "After a few days of thinking on it, I purchased this for our smaller spare room. I chose the Cardinal Red with mahogany arms. I'd say that the red upholstery is more of a faded brick red than the much more vibrant red shown in the pictures (I realize that all monitors are different but the contrast IRL vs in person on this one is striking). I'll be making a slipcover for it. Shipping was faster than expected (In fact we received the ship confirmation the day after it actually arrived, in two boxes). Putting it together was as expected, we got the job done although there was some cursing involved. It's very comfortable and the mattress is quite thick. Folding it up and down is definitely a two person job, even after oiling the contact points of the hinge. There is a faint odor from the mattress that I believe will air out over time. Overall, I'm glad that I got it on sale because it's going to need some work before I'm totally happy with it.", 
    "love this queen futon/bed, it saved my weekend, had guest and everyone had a bed , not a blow up, all slept comfy, so far great product and the customer help .was great. I def would buy this . Thank you", 
    "Tina R. at customer service was efficient and professional. Would have her on my staff in a heartbeat. Very satisfied with my purchase.John W. *Col. USAF(RET)", 
    "Good looking piece of furniture, but remember it opens to a Queen size bed. So the back sits up higher than normal chairs, more like a winged chair. But it is light. i can move it myself. I can open it myself and make the bed. (I am an \"older\" woman.) I have had two different family members use it and they said it was comfy and good. Good! That was the aim. To return it to a sofa, it takes two people, but that seems to be the norm. The price was reasonable. I am glad i bought it. If you wan an extra Queen bed/ sofa, then i recommend this one.", 
    "Excellent product..feels like a real bed! Takes some time to put together. Family members love sleeping on it. Attractive as a sofa...a lil strange looking with the high back.", 
    "Mattress arrived smelling like it had sat in chemical plant the past couple weeks. Went to wash what looked like a remove-able cover, turns out the mattress is filled with loose matting and the cover isn't remove-able at all. The zipper then promptly separated and refused to re-zip. So we are stuck with a fake mattress that smells so bad it makes people sick and faced with either buying a cover and hoping it gets better or throwing the whole thing out. The only wood part of the futon frame is the side rails, the rest is super thin steel. I almost punched through several tubes just trying to tighten down bolts. Included tools are vastly insufficient, make sure you have your own socket and Allen wrench set.", 
    "Have this in an office. Looks good as sofa but has a high back. Very comfortable to sit on. Is a little difficult to convert to bed, maybe because it is new but takes two of us to open it and close it back to sofa", 
    "We ordered this early in the week so it would arrive in time for assembly and use tomorrow night, Sunday night. One box arrived on Thursday. It's now Saturday and still no mattress yet. But bigger problem is four missing parts which cannot be ordered except during business hours. So this means we'll order the parts Monday and won't be able to assemble the bed, if all goes well, until Thursday or so. So much for having the bed ready for a guest tomorrow! Can't speak to the quality or functionality of the bed yet. I would just recommend planning on missing parts and it taking 2+ weeks from order to being able to use the bed.", 
    "Wanted a comfortable bed for guests without taking up too much space. This meets all criteria. Initial smell from the filling dissipated quickly.", 
    "I am happy with my purchase. My son is 6'2 and weighs 260 pounds. Well built, sturdy and great quality.", 
    "I got this in black arm and a blue mattress. It's really comfortable and looks great. It took awhile to put it together but it got done. My only issue is the strong smell of the chemicals used in the mattress. I've had it 4 days and the smell is still so strong.very nice and true to color.", 
    "The futon is fairly comfy and looks alright, but there are some issues. The good: The colour of the mattress is very pretty and matches the picture online (I got the sage green). It's rather comfortable for sitting on, and okay for sleeping (not as good as a real bed, but much better than other futons/sofa beds I've slept on). The bad: Assembly is extremely difficult, and for some steps downright impossible to do as directed (you cannot fit a washer, lock washer, and nut on the end of that bolt, it is physically just not long enough). The stain on the futon arms is a little runny-looking in spots. When we first unboxed the mattress is positively reeked of catnip of all things (this has faded somewhat over time, but the scent is still there a little). Actually having the mattress behind the mattress stops on the frame in sofa position makes it fold oddly and the back stick up really far. And to top it all off they put the wrong address on the box (other products I purchased at the same time from Overstock had the correct address, so I didn't enter it in wrong), meaning there was a delay in shipping and it got here late.Overall an okay futon. Works well as a sofa in my office that can turn into a guest bed. Probably wouldn't buy again, but not unhappy with the purchase.", 
    "This was a great price and it looks good in my spare room / office. It was comfortable to sleep in I almost have to evict guests. There are a lot of parts to put together but the instructions are very readable and easy to follow.", 
    "This arrived quickly and was easy to assemble. We have only had it a couple weeks and haven't used it as a bed yet but it's comfortable for sitting.", 
    "We made our first purchase with overstock in buying this queen size futon. The arrival was quick and excited to put it together. It arrived in 2 sections and both were very heavy, so make sure you have help if you can't lift items too heavy. Everything was well packed with instructions. Diffidently follow the directions. It will make the assembly much quicker. Although the parts, screw, bolts, watcher, etc., come with tools, we recommend you real tools. There would have been no way that I would have finished the assembly without a few words that I can't say here. It took two of us to assembly in less than an hour. We have had family spend the night on it and they both stated it is very comfortable. It looks great in our spare room.The only other concern is that the where the mattress is tufted, the fabric has pulled away. If the futon would receive regular use, I would be more concerned, but as for now it is wearing very well.I would recommend the purchase of this item.", 
    "Very comfortable. A good night's sleep. Very attractive couch. Opens easily, takes two to close it. Good customer service. Mattress was poorly packaged when delivered.Came with a tear in the cover. They replaced the cover promptly. Glad I didn't have to send the mattress back, it would have been very expensive.", 
    "Exactly as promised. High back is odd, but works ok, I was able to put it together myself (middle aged moderately handy woman) from watching the online video + instructions. Good buy for the $.", 
    "Very stylish, comfortable, futon. Used for extra sleeping area. Many compliments from familyAnd friends.", 
    "The mattress is pretty good, but the frame doesn't feel very long lasting.", 
    "This was an excellent item for my living room. I did not want a very bulky sofa so this fits the bill. It will also be handy for when I need an extra bed for a guest.", 
    "We needed something quick for company coming. They were very comfortable on it. Great for the price!", 
    "Was exactly what I needed for company as I have a large family. Was a little difficult to assemble at times but I don't do these kinds of things much!", 
    "I purchased this futon for occasional use as a bed, but mostly for a sofa to give extra room in our spare bedroom/computer room. It does both and is attractive. Our daughter used it while visiting and said it was OK to sleep on but she has a bad back so the comfort level must be above average. The only problem we had was converting the bed back to a sofa, we had to remove the mattress in order to do this.That was not a major problem as the bed will only be used sparingly. The assembly was average and instructions were clear. The futon hardware was for several models, so we had some parts left over.", 
    "It was a pain to assemble for one person, especially when some of the screws/washers/nuts didn't fit appropriately. The base is a universal which definitely should be larger for a queen mattress. Works but hard to convert with a queen mattress....lots of muscle required (I have to take the mattress off to shift the frame to upright position). Really does need a larger base. All in all it's sturdy, a good price for the product, and works for the occasional guest(s) sleep overs. Guests may need to help putting back to original position though :)", 
    "A little difficult o put together but worth it. Very bright color blue. It is very comfortable to sit or lay on.", 
    "The futon was relatively easy to put together even though we were missing some bolts. Once it was finished, the back of the futon was a lot higher than the part that you sit on. I\"m not sure if this is because it's a queen or what but it looks awkward. To be fair, I still need to call the company to see if this is normal and if I put it together right. From what I've noticed though, it's put together fine. Otherwise the mattress and frame is good quality for a decent price.", 
    "When I received the Fulton onevofvthe spats in the right arm was crushed.I called the customer service like and got no satisfaction, I was pretty much just blown off. My husband just boought some stuff and fixed it.", 
    "Love my futon. Great extra bed for my company. Very comfortable.", 
    "Mattress isn't the greatest. I would suggest getting a something better. The overall value is great but from a comfort level, no. Shipping was incredibly fast, received it in three days.", 
    "The shipping was very fast. It was not difficult to put together. We used it as a space saving option to replace a terribly uncomfortable pull-out sofa. This looks much sleaker, simple and clean. The wood arms is very nice quality and its been very comfortable. It has a slight springy feeling, but it's soft and comfortable to sleep on.", 
    "Very attractive, and easily converts from a comfortable sofa into a comfortable queen-sized bed. The mattress takes a few hours to completely inflate but is very comfortable once completely inflated. A good buy!"
