    "Perfect addition to my reading nook for the kids!", 
    "Love this bookcase. Design is very cute", 
    "Shipped fast and packaged very well. There was a strong smell when I first pulled out the parts but it quickly diminished. no biggie. Very easy to put together. My 2 year old enjoyed handling the screwdriver to help me put it together. The farm scene is gorgeous. I thought it would be a cheap looking screen print because of the price I paid but it looks amazing with great detail. Worth every penny!", 
    "This is good looking for young children. The top pole cracked with little pressure and the screws broke off. I am keeping it to avoid hassle.", 
    "The item is exactly as pictured and just what I expected."
