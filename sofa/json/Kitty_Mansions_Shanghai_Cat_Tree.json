    "My husband said this product was very well made with quality pieces and so easy to put together. It does not wobble at all. Nikki Is still \"investagating\" this and loves to hide in the middle section where there is a hole. I think this would be great for more than one cat and kittens would love it.", 
    "I have been looking everywhere for cat furniture and it is so expensive everywhere else. If I bought cat furniture elsewhere, for the same price, I would only have gotten 1/3 of the cat play area I got from Overstock.com.", 
    "This was a gift for my daughter's new kitten. I did not want a large item that she would have to schlep around during this highly mobile phase of life (she's in college). However, as I reviewed the items, I realized that I was going to have to give on size to achieve my goals of (1) not using furniture as a scratching post and (2) perching kitty to \"bird-hunt\" through windows, and (3) not give the appearance of a totally cat-centric household with a gaudy tower replete with hanging cat gadgets. This tower fit the bill perfectly. There are many cat scratch places and the material seems like it's going to last for a good while. The color is subtle and beautiful. The kitty can bird-hunt or climb into her \"cave\" to stalk larger human prey - or nap. There's a lot of that. It is tall, but does not take up a gross amount of floor space for all the versatility that you get. Overall a great hit!", 
    "this is the first cat tree so I don't have much to compare it to. It is very sturdy and blends in very well with the colors of my living room. I put it together myself in about an hour....I'm not very good at that sort of thing. My kitten sleeps on the top and the other cat doesn't have any interest at all. That is really the only time it is used.", 
    "Its a nice cat tree! Although its bigger than I anticipated it would be.", 
    "Great quality product. My cats absolutely love it. They sleep on the top level, inside the house and lounge on the bottom level. I couldn't have selected a better cat tree.", 
    "I read several reviews when searching for this. Since we have received it, EVERYONE who sees it, complements it. Our kitties LOVE it. We have 1 bigger cat, who sleeps on top all of the time and one small cat, who uses the cubby to sleep in. The fabric is wonderful and doesn't shed like the other stuff. It is sturdy and well built, doesn't rock when cats jump on it. Beautiful cat tower, doesn't look cheap. We have had it about 3 weeks now.", 
    "My husband put this together, and we both had some problems with the instructions. The finished product looks great and is steady. Only problem: none of our four cats will use it. They are 4-20 years old. If they were in their first year of life, I think they would have loved it; however, all of the platforms, as well as the scratcher/ladder, are a bit too small for them. I'm keeping it out in hopes that over the next year they'll gain their confidence. So -- I would heartily recommend this for kittens and very young cats...with slightly better instructions. Perhaps the pieces should be stamped A, B, C, D, etc. and then the instructions can refer to them that way.", 
    "We have 3 cats and needed an extra cat tree for our patio window. Beautiful color and height is perfect for the size of the window. Took approx 20 mins to assemble. The plush is soft but not as thick as it appears (Very thin layer of plush on the plywood but our cats still love it). We sprinkled some catnip on the tree so they would adapt easily, which was a success!", 
    "This tree is an amazing bargain! The price was perfect, it was very easy to put together, it seems very stable, and it is nice to look at as well. I couldn't be more pleased with this tree. I should note that while it's not something that bothered me, the picture isn't quite accurate, in the picture it shows two red paw print designs on the tree, but my tree had no such design just the grey faux fur. I don't know if this will be the same for anyone else however, and also I don't know if the brown version is missing them or not. Overall a great product!", 
    "Just got this tree in the Mocha color, which is a nice dark brown. It does not have paw prints as shown in the picture. It was very simple to put together, despite the brief instructions, and took me about an hour to assemble. Pros: Nice looking tree, covering is soft, many levels, easy assembly, great price, seems sturdy, nicely padded bed at the top Cons: The covering is a furry fabric rather than a carpet, and while soft it is quite thin, there is no padding except on the bed. The tube section hanging from the second shelf is small, I don't think my adult cats will fit. I did have trouble attaching the scratching \"slide\" piece, as there is a post right behind it and I can't get the screw holes to line up on that side...not a big deal. So far I am very happy with it, hopefully my cats will be also once they get used to it.", 
    "Our kittens love this tower. The sisal rope on all of the legs is great. We haven't had to do much to keep them from scratching the furniture. With all the different levels/platforms the girls have lots of room to chase and try to hide from each other. The tower was very easy to assemble. All of the pieces fit perfectly. We used the picture from the website, along with the printed diagram/instructions, which I think made it even easier. Love the color and the fabric. I guess you could say we (and our new kitties) are very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I think that this kitty mansion is a great value. As others have said, it is not covered in carpet but rather a sturdy soft fabric. I haven't had any problems with that, and we have three kittens using it daily. Assembly was fairly simple, I assembled it myself (a 5'2\" woman), just make sure you really identify the parts first - there are several legs very close in height. It seems very sturdy and heavy duty. The ball on ours was torn off too, but it's really not a big deal. The cats like the height and seem to enjoy this tower.", 
    "I was very impressed with the size, quality, appearance, ease of assembly, and packaging. Overall, I am a very happy first-time Overstock.com customer.My only issue was that the base is very small for a structure of this size. It wobbles quite a bit on my carpeted floor. It would probably be better on a hard floor.My cats don't spend any time on it. They have loved other kitty condos in the past. I've had this for a few weeks, and they just don't seem to trust this one.", 
    "The tree was exactly as described. My kitten loves it and my 4yr old cat really likes the top perch. They get hours of exercise from playing on this tree.", 
    "This was very easy to assemble and my kitten absolutely loves it. Very stable and many tiers to keep him entertained. I sprinkles catnip on the shelves and place treats along it for him to find. He goes crazy over the dangle toy.", 
    "Easy to assemble, quick delivery and looks good quality. Theres plenty for the kittens to do on this one.", 
    "Easy to put together, sturdy and my cat loves it. What more could one want?", 
    "Everything screws together. Instructions are fairly easy pictures. As usual, these things shipped from China smell weird. I had to spray it several times with cat nip. After that they loved it!Fairly sturdy and good looking. My kitties love the little toy fur ball. They don't seem interested in the ramp. I'm thinking of removing it as it adds floor room needed.", 
    "My kittens enjoy it so much they don't stay off it!", 
    "I have had my cat tree for 4 years now and I have to say, it held up quite nicely!! The wavy stairs were never used and became a nuisance so I threw that out after awhile. My 3 cats love it to pieces! I'll be purchasing another cat tree soon!", 
    "The felines quite like their mansion! Sturdy and a fine color", 
    "This product exceeded our expectations. Our cats enjoy hanging out and playing on it and one does use the scratching posts that are everywhere on it. The cube area is triangular in shape and small but they do manage to crawl in and sleep from time to time. They never use the circular tube as it's just too small for them (and these are 5-8 lb. cats) but I'll hang toys from it for them to grab out of there. Definitely a good buy for the money. Just plan well on where you'll be placing it -- it's large!!", 
    "Our 3 cats of all sizes love this cat tree! Being so tall, it is impressively sturdy. The posts are all for scratching and has kept our furniture safe.", 
    "Great product! Very sturdy, easy to put together with instructions. My cat is pretty big and she still is able to climb and sleep on it with no rocking.", 
    "The construction of the cat tree was really quite easy once all the parts were laid out. It took about forty-five minutes including a break or two. It is certainly very sturdy and it moves quite easily on our hardwood floors. All in all a very nice piece of cat furniture.", 
    "Easy to put together and the cats LOVE it!. The carpet that is on it is \"cheap\" and tears easily. Otherwise, great buy!", 
    "Easy to assemble. I searched several stores (online and local) and could not find a better deal. Well made and good looking.", 
    "I have no idea if the smell bother them, but even after a year no one will use it.", 
    "My two kittens seem to like this cat tree a lot. We bought the grey version which I'm happy has white paw prints instead of the red you see in the pictures. The only thing that bothers me is that the little ball that is attached is falling apart already and it's only been a few weeks. We will likely have to detach and replace it with something else shortly. Everything else seems to be holding up and it was really easy to put together.", 
    "Purchased this for our two newly adopted kitties and it was easy to put together and seems strongly built. The fur covering is very thin and I wouldn't expect it to last too long. The kitties are not too thrilled with it yet, but are warming up to it. Nice color brown.", 
    "They love it; instructions could be much better, have to use the picture as a guide but within an hour the cats are all over it.", 
    "This was incredibly easy to assemble, and my cats love it, especially that top bed! Great buy, great price!", 
    "Sturdy and easy to assemble. A lot more attractive than anything i saw in the local pet shops.", 
    "Easy assembly, 20 minutes and the things was being used and enjoyed. Only problem I encountered was a little glue was inside the hole for the bolt. But it was removed with little effort and instructions were easy to follow (diagrams).", 
    "Love this tower, did have to burn off spikes from the rope wrapped around the poles, in fear the it would poke my Charlie's eye's.", 
    "Wonderful item, arrived fast, my cats adore it... just know it is more grey than blue.", 
    "None of the four cats sleep on this stand but it is primarily used to sit and look out of the window and even more so as the means to get to the catwalk.", 
    "My cats love to play or just sit and be lazy , this is one of their favorites I have purchased", 
    "The cat tree is very sturdy and made of high quality materials. I have purchased cat trees previously and they are very flimsy and unstable. Especially with the height of this one. I love the color as well, it matches my home decor very well and am very pleased that I purchased it ! I would HIGHLY recommend this product !!", 
    "My cats tore this up within 2 months but they love it", 
    "My two felines LOVE this cat stand. They use this one as much as the larger one. One will sit on the top platform while the other one sleeps in the enclosed compartment below. Ray to assemble and quality materials. I love the color combination. Looks great in my family room.", 
    "This is the first cat condo I have ever bought, so I have little to compare it to; however, it was easy to put together and seems quite sturdy and well made. I am happy with the purchase!", 
    "My two large savannah cats love this cat tree. It came in many prices but I was able to put it together in about 30 minutes. I wasn't sure if it was going to be sturdy enough for my cats who both weigh 18-20 pounds but it is! Except for the fact that the don't get on the very top part, but it's really small up there. For the price I definitely recommend it. Oh and I also discovered that it cleans very well with my furminator...better than my handheld vacuum.", 
    "We bought this for our one cat that we have. She is relatively small so I works great for her. She uses all the different scratching posts, the little cubby and all the platforms. She doesn't use the cylinder lounger thing or the very top bed. The tree is really stable, I just think a small space really high up and it just makes her uncomfortable. She is only 9 months old do maybe she will use it in the future. I put her food bowl on one of the platforms to keep it away from the dogs. Overall, we love it!", 
    "The cat tree arrived in one box and only took about 20 minutes to put together. The unit is very sturdy and is perfect for my three 15-25 lb cats. They use the scratchy posts for scratching (which is a huge plus) and the \"fur\" that covers the rest of the tower is soft and plushy. The color is good too. I would recommend this to anyone with a cat!", 
    "Very easy to put together. My daughter's cat needed some fun. The colors go with the room, cat hair vacuums off easily and it's easily cleaned up with a damp rag as well.Glad I bought it. So is the kitty.", 
    "After buying a cheep flimsy cat tree previous to this tree I did my homework searching for the right tree. I am very happy I bought this tree and my cats love it!", 
    "Our cat seems to love it but it start to fall apart after 2 weeks. the cheap fabric cover the scratching post become undone. When we called the Overstock customer service they gave us a hard time. They told us they could replace a part (the part become undone is at the base!) or they want us to take it apart then send it back. I told them I don't have the box anymore. They then said that I can drive around and look at the dumpster at ******* and find some, they always have big boxes. REALLY?! Anyway, I cut my loss and glue the thing back. I think we are just going to throw it away few month later.", 
    "Very nice cat tree. Went together easily. Be aware this is not carpet but a thin, synthetic \"fur\"; also, the top cat bed does not have rigid sides and the walls flop inward a bit. I'd assumed the walls were like a standard cat tree but they're just padding. Otherwise a good value and the cats like it fine.", 
    "It took a little while to put it together, but it turned out great. My cat uses every part of it. I have seen ones that are half this size for the same price. I liked having the color selection, fits in with my decor colors and blends in rather then sticking out like a sore thumb. First time I have had a cat tree that my cat would use.", 
    "I got this for my great-grand kitty's Christmas. She spends hours playing on it. :)", 
    "I ordered this Sunday night and it arrived Friday afternoon! It came in pieces, but it only took me 30 minutes to assemble. The \"instructions\" were a one-page illustration, but it was fairly easy to understand. Best of all, all of the holes were drilled and in the exact right spots (which seems like a common problem with other self-assembly purchases). The color looked like a dark brown online, but the one I received was quite light. I would have preferred darker, but the sewn on paw prints were tan rather than red, which I prefer. The carpet is the texture of stuffed animal fur. My 9-lb and 6-lb cats were climbing on it and hiding in the house before I even had it fully assembled. It is sturdy and does not wobble when they jump on any level.", 
    "My cats (I have 5 of them) love this tree - enough spots for everyone and they love it. It was larger than I expected, but I also didn't do the due diligence to confirm the height and width so that was my fault but I thankfully have enough room for it... :-)"
