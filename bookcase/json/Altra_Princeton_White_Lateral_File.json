    "This is by far the worst purchase I have ever made. When I opened the box it was a complete mess however I can get over that. What I can't overlook is that the product delivered does not match the pictures provided. Due to the location of some of the pre drilled holes it simply does not make it possible to put together. Now I get to box this piece of crap back up and send it back to Overstock. What a waste of my time.", 
    "Unit was time-consuming to put together, but looks good. Neither the top or bottom drawer close all the way. They close, but slide open a half inch. Not too concerned, does what I needed.", 
    "As for the person that said the cabinet falls over - all file cabinets will topple over if you have the top drawer full and full extended - that's why you never open both drawers at the same time and never have the drawer fully extended unless you have something heavy on top to help hold it down. I've worked many many places and almost all file cabinets do this - cheapies to expensive ones. This item is adequate for it's use. Not fancy but not junk either.", 
    "with files in it you can't even open the bottom drawer without it tipping forward. it absolutely has to be bolted to the wall. looked a bit hard to put together, but since i was 9 months pregnant when i bought it i just watched my mom and baby daddy put it together. it took them a while.", 
    "I built this unit by myself. It took about 3 hours because 2nd step didn't match up with the picture. holes weren't where they should have been as per picture but I turned draw sliders around and drilled them and it worked perfectly. After that step it was a breeze. It works great and looks great.", 
    "Really nice and looks so much better then old school metal", 
    "Since this is a lateral file. I assumed I would be able to put letter sized files across the entire width of each drawer. YOU CANNOT. This is designed to put legal size and letter size BOTH for each drawer. They do not provide enough parts and will not sell enough parts for each drawer. If you do put the files as they design, they will not properly slide because two rows of files are sliding on the same rail. A simple solution would be to provide two additional rails and two additional rail holders. I contacted the company and they WILL NOT sell or provide additional parts. Please be aware of this when you purchase. This now is not functional and will not hold the files it should. Hope this makes sense. It was difficult to describe.", 
    "PerfectEasy to Assemble!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "This item comes unassembled so be prepared for a very complex project. If you are not mechanically inclined, be sure to enlist the assistance of someone who can help. After assembling the entire cabinet, I still needed help to put the drawers in because they are so heavy. The completed unit does look exactly as pictured... if you do it right!", 
    "The cabinet is just what I was looking for and the description was accurate. The assembly instructions, however, are very poor - there were no descriptions, only drawings with arrows and while all the parts were marked, we had a hard time with the perspective of the drawings. At times we didn't know the front edge of a panel from the back and the top from the bottom. Two of us spent about 4-5 hours assembling it. I've assembled numerous pieces of furniture and this by far was the most difficult because of the poor instructions.", 
    "Very difficult to put together due to so many pieces and poor instruction guide. However, once done, it is very pretty and functional. and worth the price. The sides are white but not the brilliant white as the front. II needed a legal letter size file cabinet which was difficult to find in this price range. This one meets my needs and looks great.", 
    "This was the most awful piece of furniture to put together. The packaging was horrible. The parts and equipment were mislabeled. Additionally, the Styrofoam packaging was awful. It was shredded in the box and all of the shredded fibers were statically stuck to the desks and were lodged in the connection holes/screw holes. The panel hinges/slide bar was oozing with oil and shredded styrofoam bits. The page by page instructions were horrible. They should at least put a picture of the completed stage at the end of each section to show the consumer what that phase of assembly should look like. INstead, they offer you a cheap non-sensical video of items that are too specific (such as the cam-lock) as opposed to a beneficial video of the completed phase of assembly! I'm an engineer and this was 100% awful. I guess you get what you pay for, but this wasn't even worth my time. If you have children, you can punish them by making them put this furniture together. It was also damaged during shipping. I'm so disappointed in this furniture, that's not worth the effort repacking and replacing. I'm just counting it as a loss. From the manufacturing, to the distribution, to the assembly, the entire experience is/was a nightmare.", 
    "The item came in damaged and the material of this product looks very cheap. Customer service was great but the item was terrible.", 
    "I love the file but am disappointed that it is advertised for a lower price than the $XXX.XX that I paid. It's too bad the lower price was not offered to me. These things are remembered when ordering again....."
