    "This bench is lovely and was very easy to put together, but the inside dimensions specified in the Q&A were not correct, which was an issue for me since I bought the bench to store specific objects. Kept the bench since it really is a lovely bench, but one of the reasons I bought at overstock.com is because the Q&A was so good about providing dimensions for the inside of storage benches, and it's frustrating to have done so much research to find something that would meet my needs, only to find out... it didn't meet my needs.", 
    "Although this was a beautiful and well constructed storage bench it was definitely mildewed. The outer box was dry as well as the outside of the bag it was enclosed in. As soon as I took it out of the box and bag all I could smell was mildew. I immediately took it out of my house and contacted customer service. It took them 5 minutes to resolve the issue and refund my purchase. It is too bad because it was a perfect bench for my bedroom. I plan to try to buy furniture made in the US. Overstock was great though and I plan to make many more purchases from them!", 
    "The bench was exactly what I was looking for and would be perfect except for the strong musty, moldy smell inside the bench!. I have aired it outside, used baking soda to try to get rid of the smell but no luck. I would return the bench but unfortunately while trying to vacuum it out to see if that would help with the smell, the lining almost shredded - which actually enabled me to see that the wood underneath is moldy, and appears that at sometime the benches were water damaged or something. So, listen to reviews and don't purchase this. Sad, because it really is nice looking.", 
    "Bed bench arrived exactly on time. It came perfectly packaged, but the material had green ink stains on it. The fabric is not the quality pictured, and it was extremely uncomfortable to sit on. I returned it.", 
    "Good bench and looked just like the photo but for some reason the inside smelled really bad...like mildewy.", 
    "I bought this storage bench for my mother's house. The bench is placed in front of her sofa and fits the small place well. The lid is easy for my mother to lift (she's 85 with severe rheumatoid arthritis) and is an idea storage bin for blankets, pillows, etc. Very pleased with this purchase and it is well worth its price.", 
    "I was hesitant to purchase this bench because of all of the complaints of an odor coming from inside. Then I saw a review that said the odor problem had been fixed. This bench works perfectly at the end of my bed and is exactly what I wanted. The color and quality of the material was great and there was no smell coming from the inside; other than the smell of new furniture.", 
    "For those who were concerned about an odor emanating from this piece of furniture, I can attest to overstock.com's statement that the issue has been rectified - no odor at all. This piece is just stunning! It's solid, holds quite a bit, looks beautiful/expensive. (Holds more than I thought it would!) The item looked just as it did on my browser. Was thrilled to receive such a quality piece - and receive it so FAST! The only assembly required is screwing in the legs - which might take all of 60 seconds. An excellent purchase all around!", 
    "This is a great little storage bench. Very multi-purpose and can be used in many places throughout the house (by the front or back door, at the end of a bed, etc). We are using it in front of a picture window. It's not a show-stopper or anchor piece, but for the price and multi-function of it it's a great piece. The quality is great (stitching, tufts, etc.). It's not really comfortable to sit on for extended lengths of time, but it is great for extra seating or to use to slip your shoes on. Love the extra storage inside (great for blankets, extra toys, etc). Color is same but I think blends better with gray's (but would work with also with beige that has gray undertones). Overall happy with the purchase!", 
    "Looks very expensive in person! Also the lid stays open which is a nice feature.", 
    "We use it to store sheets and towels. Also looks great in the room and offers a comfy seat.", 
    "Very nice - looks better than I expected for price.", 
    "Nice size, looks nice, provides storage and seating at end of our bed. Right length and height. Color goes with everything. Strong enough to sit on", 
    "It requires putting the legs on and mine loosened up after a month. I wouldn't buy this for heavy usage. I have it in my entry for mainly putting things on as we walk in the door or a place to put things that people need to put away. I plan to check the legs monthly for loosening.", 
    "This is a handsome piece that works well with a tray for a coffee table. The color is indeed sand and would go well almost anywhere. The construction is sturdy and the fabric seems stain resistant. The piece was shipped promptly and was easily set up.", 
    "This bench is sturdy and holds several blankets. It goes nicely under my low window. With normal wear the cover will last but I wouldn't recommend it in a child's room.", 
    "Beautiful storage bench. The inside as lots of storage and the seating is adequate for 2. It's absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend it.", 
    "Was really pleased with this bench. Needed storage space in our master bedroom for pillows. Great to sit on also. Very high quality.", 
    "I was looking for a pop of vibrant color with the tawny port red bench. It's more purple than red.", 
    "I'm using it as a coffee table. It is a good solid surface to put your feet up on. I ordered the chartreuse and it is way more green than the picture.", 
    "We loved this tufted bench. It is smaller than an arm chair, but seats more people and is the perfect place to store throw blankets (or whatever!) We have it in blue and the color is great too-- it reminds me of a traditional oxford blue. The upholstery is good quality but still stands up to traffic. This review would have been five stars, but after just owning this bench for a month, we had a guest sit on it and the front leg caved in. The piece of wood that the leg screws into somehow came un-attached from the bench and the whole thing tipped over. It was humiliating for our guest (we tried convincing her it wasn't her fault!) and a real bummer to have to fix something when it was brand new.", 
    "Quality product for the price. Delivery was fast and communication was open on item ETA. Very pleased with process.", 
    "This bench was just what I expected. The textured fabric is a versatile neutral. It couldn't have been easier to assemble - all you have to do is screw in the legs. There were a few loose threads to trim off - not a big deal at all.", 
    "High end look. Just beautiful", 
    "Not at all what it looked like from the picture. I was very disappointed! The fabric was completely different from the picture. I ended up returning it.", 
    "This replaced our leather one! A bit smaller than the leather one, but the color worked much better! So far it is holding up to our small dog using it to get on the bed( stepping stone:) it holds more than first appearances... Would be great in a child/teen room as wel!", 
    "Love this bench! Perfect size and style", 
    "This was exactly what I wanted. And as usual, we got for a great price and great delivery time. Love you oVerstock", 
    "I have purchased 3 of these benches!!All 3 were delivered timely and in excellent condition.Great size, very nice oatmeal color, nice seat with plenty of storage!", 
    "This bench looks really nice, but, as you would expect at this price point, it isn't high quality. The cushion is very firm. The bottom of the storage isn't thick (you can push on it and it gives/bows), so you wouldn't be able to store anything very heavy. The color is beige but also has grey fibers. Some other reviews mentioned theirs having mildew, but mine came in just fine. If you are wanting a nice-looking piece that serves light storage, then this piece would work great.", 
    "Bought this for the bedroom and it's a perfect size and nice color. Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "This worked out perfectly in my bedroom. A place to store whatever you need, but a seat to put shoes or boots. When I first received it there was a mildew smell but after being out of the packaging it dissipated quickly. Just love it.", 
    "This is an attractive and functional storage bench. Very thick looking material in an oatmeal color which blends with everything. The bench is a perfect height and holds several pillows or sheets. It keeps my decorative bed pillows up off the floor and out of sight when not in use. Bench is sturdy enough to sit on when tying shoes, etc.", 
    "fits at the end of my bed nicely", 
    "I was looking for a storage ottoman and came across this bench. I read the other reviews regarding stains or smell but I ordered it anyway. Mine was perfect! No smell. No stains. I ordered this based on price and style. I wasn't sure it could withstand the weight of my 230lb husband sitting on it, but it does! We got it to use as a foot rest but it doubles as a bench :-)Very pleased.", 
    "I love the textured fabric on this piece and it does have a decent storage space.", 
    "Love it! We use it to store sheets and comforters. It sits at the end of our bed. Useful for putting on shoes, etc.", 
    "I needed a nice cream colored bench, with nice wood feet and this fit the bill perfectly. Assembly only requires screwing in the feet. Love it", 
    "Great addition at the foot of the bed. It holds all my sheets and a blanket for my king size bed.", 
    "I love this bench! This storage bench is very well made and a great accent piece in my living room. So glad I made the purchase!", 
    "Had a musty odor, had to send back!", 
    "as pictured- not very soft but perfect for keeping blankets, etc", 
    "Really nice bench--goes perfectly in my master bedroom to store/hide all of my husbands piles of junk he tends to accumulate!", 
    "Thus is a great storage bench. Love it very nice", 
    "It look ok. Made ok. Nothing great. Does what it's made for.", 
    "I use it to store my shoes by the front door. Looks great, good quality, well worth the price.", 
    "Great value, detailed tufting lends an expensive look to this reasonable bench. Color s neutral so it goes anywhere.", 
    "This was the best price I could find anywhere for a nice tufted bench. The quality is nice.", 
    "I am very pleased with this bench that was ordered to put at the foot of my poster bed. It's sturdy, well-made, and the upholstery has held up very nicely.", 
    "This storage bench is really cute and fits a ton of blankets inside...but it's not made very well. The fabric is coming unattached on the inside and the material is also pilling outside. It's perfect if you are an adult and no one is going to sit on it etc but if you have kids it may not be the bench for you ;)", 
    "Got to put on the end of our bed so that the little dogs can jump up. It's perfect size, not too heavy to move. Holds extra blankets. I like the linen natural look of the fabric too. Good buy.", 
    "Several of her you said that this was a smelly Ottoman however I do have experience that. The storage was great, size was great, it looks great in my room. One word to describe this\u2026 Great!", 
    "Looks exactly as pictured. All you have to do is simply screw the legs on the bottom. This is a lovely piece and looks perfect in front of my bed!! Perfect space for storage.", 
    "color is a little off, its a little whiter in person, but still a good piece. Large space inside.", 
    "Storage bench is perfect for what I wanted as a bench for the end of the bed. However, it is not soft like I thought it would be. It's hard and not comfortable for sitting", 
    "Looks very high end (like something you'd see in Pottery Barn) but for much less! It' will look great anywhere you put it, style and storage...what more can you ask for, love it:)", 
    "Love it, looks really cute in my room and store all my extra blankets..... color is like the pitcure and fabric is nice and is holding up good so far.", 
    "I don't have a lot of storage in my bedroom and this bench is working perfectly for blankets and sheets. Very roomy on the inside and the detailed stitching give it that extra nice touch. Excellent price. All you have to do is screw the feet on - no tools necessary. Very pleased with this purchased.", 
    "I was skeptical about ordering this ottoman online, in case it was damaged or wasn't good quality. I didn't want to have to ship it back. However, the price was right so I took a chance. I was not disappointed. Assembly was easy, just screwing on the feet. It has beautiful detail, looks expensive & a perfect fit at the end of our queen bed.", 
    "The product was of higher quality than expected. It also was shipped in a expedient manner.", 
    "The color is not so much of a pure cream/beige but has hints of an almost green to it. It's not the worst thing in the world but it definitely doesn't match the rest of my furniture. It's nothing some fabric paint won't fix, as I was thinking about recoloring this in a darker color anyway.It came packaged well enough, no padding but there weren't any huge damages. Two of the legs were missing the little nubs on the bottom. I spoke to overstock and they're shipping me replacement legs, so all is well. The ottoman also smells a bit strong so I'm hoping a few days of airing out will fix it, either that or I'll stick some coffee beans inside to absorb the smell.All in all, definitely a decent buy for the $$$ tag on it.", 
    "I purchased this bench and ended up returning it. The fabric was of very poor quality and it looked much less expensive than the photo shown. Thank goodness Overstock has an excellent return policy.", 
    "I couldn't be happier with this purchase. I bought two of these and placed against the wall of my dining room to create a built in seating look and it was so easy and works perfectly. the extra storage is so convenient and everyone loves the look and ease of use.", 
    "We were looking for a nice bench that looked well-made without being too large for the master bedroom. The fabric on this bench is very nice, the legs screw on easily, and we are very pleased. We love this for our extra blankets and sweaters that we don't wear all the time. Recommend you open it for a few days to air out and put dryer sheets inside to help with the 'new' odor, plus the sheets will keep away mites and silver fish if the bench is not something you use on a daily basis and clean (vacuum out) every couple of days - which we do not. This bench has such a high-quality look and feel! You will not be disappointed.", 
    "I was more than a little disappointed when I opened the box on the day of arrival. It had a very BAD odor! Very musty and it felt damp to the touch. Let it air out for over a week with top opened and still it was BAD! Ended up putting 4 air freshening squares in it and keeping it closed for another 2 weeks! I couldn't brig it in the house until I was able to get the musty damp odor gone. So it say in the garage for close to a month before I brought it in..finally. But I usually have great experiences with O so I won't hold this against them. Oh and the color is more grayish than ivory/off white.", 
    "Surprisingly amazingly. I wasn't expecting to like this ottoman bench as I as I ended up liking it considering is very hard to please. But this is yet another excellent buy from overstock. Wish I could post pictures.", 
    "I'm so disappointed.. The style of this bench is just what I wanted and the quality of it would be great if it weren't for the awful chemical smell. The fabric feels fine but must have been treated with something to give off such a strong odor. This one is going back.", 
    "This is a very nice piece. Sturdy and nice looking. It is light in color so, you may want to take that into account if it will be used in places where it might get dirty fast. Not sure if the material can be cleaned. But, overall, I do like the bench.", 
    "The first bench arrived without one hinge and had to be returned. The replacement arrived in about a week and was perfect. Only the legs had to be attached (very easy) It goes perfectly in my bedroom with the Madison Park comforter set and the ciriaco lamps", 
    "The size and sturdiness of the bench are just what I was looking for, however, the item arrived damp and smelled of mildew. The box did not appear to be wet, but it must have been at one time - soaked. When I unpacked the bench I could immediately smell the mildew. All of the upholstery and padding was damp. Because of the size and hassle involved in returning the item, I decided to clean it myself. There was no visible mold or mildew, just the smell. It has since been thoroughly cleaned, bleached, dried, and Febreezed. I'm hoping that took care of the problem since my extra-large dogter loves the fact that she can use it as a step-up onto the bed, and I love that I can store her heavy Orvis queen-size bed cover in it and out of the way when it's not needed.", 
    "When item arrived, the plastic seemed humid, Ottoman has a terrible humidity smell.", 
    "Love the look and the fabric! Have it at the end of my bed and hold lots of extras!!", 
    "It's built well and looks nice, but it does stain easily. If you don't vacuum it regularly the dust in the air sticks to it like glue and it's super hard to remove which makes it look dirty all the time. I also spilled a little tea (one drop) on it and it is stained forever. I tried everything to get it up but no luck. This would need to go in a place where it is rarely used and doesn't see a whole lot of traffic.", 
    "This ottoman works great with our sectional sofa. I wanted something tufted over a wooden coffee table so I would not have to worry about the kids running into it. They love laying on this while watching TV and it works great for quickly putting away toys.", 
    "We are using our bench to store my kids toys and has plenty of room to store an assortment of toys. It works perfect with the design of our living room. It stays in the up position on it's own & doesn't fall/slam down on the little ones fingers.", 
    "a little short, would've liked it a bit higher. Nice quality though", 
    "Good quality, minimal assembly. Nice and sturdy with lovely fabric. I'm using it for my living room / office area. I rarely use my printer so it's hidden away nicely in there.", 
    "Legs are spindly and do not support anyone sitting on it.", 
    "Love it. Great storage bench", 
    "This product looks great in a living room or bedroom", 
    "Lots of room for storage and looks great.", 
    "Well made and great storage capacity. This is a very nice upscale look in the grey fabric.", 
    "First, when the bench arrived I tried my best to put in the legs but they would not turn, and the paint would scratch away. It turns out that the insert screw was just covered with a plastic capsule that's painted like wood! You'll first have take off the plastic capsule to reveal the screw underneath. Secondly, I ordered the \"sandy\" color which appeared like creamy white onscreen but actually has some shades of grey. Nevertheless, the bench looked nice and I could find a way to still make it match my beddings, so I kept it.", 
    "Love the piece and love the color.", 
    "Received on time and in good condition.", 
    "This bench is very nice, just had to attach the legs, great for added storage, I have it in my walk in closet, I love sitting on it when getting dressed. No smell as some reviews stated", 
    "It's had to find storage benches in just the right size but Overstock had it. The size is perfect, the color is perfect and it totally met the need for what I wanted to use it for. Happy camper here", 
    "small and lightweight but works great for my purposes.", 
    "Purchased for guest room, seam along the front of bench was met in front as opposed to the rear. Not thrilled but hubby said keep it... Overstock has always been good with returns etc but be aware this might happen to you..", 
    "Firm & solid which I liked & plenty of storage room.", 
    "Charcoal color is perfect and did not smell at all but my 13lb dog moves it when jumping up on it. It is very light. Fits one pillow and one small blanket but at this price is fine.", 
    "No problems, no odors, as advertised.", 
    "It is what it is--looks a little cheap, but works", 
    "I ordered the light blue, and it is so pretty. No odor (mentioned in earlier reviews), it holds all our extra blankets, and worked perfectly as extra seating over the holidays. This bench is everything I was looking for.Bonus - the dog loves it, and that frees up space on the sofa.", 
    "Great for the foot of the bed for extra linens and blankets. Perfect match to the bed frame I bought from Overstock two years ago", 
    "First rate storage bench. Great price. Ordered 2. Look great!", 
    "My only beef with this product was the color. In the online pic they showed chartreuse as a more gold/yellow color. When I received it it is sage green. Was going to send it back but it works well in my space and is good quality.", 
    "It came quickly, and I put the legs on in just a minute. My cat has decided it's her spot now, but the cat hair is cleaned easily! Good storage on the inside too.", 
    "I've had it for a couple of weeks, and have received many compliments. It is well made - love the soft close hinges and quality fabric. The storage area is large enough for several throws/blankets and the extra seating comes in handy. I especially loved the fact that you only have to screw in the 4 feet and it's assembled! Highly recommend!", 
    "Lovely bench that has held up well. Enjoy the extra storage space it provides.", 
    "I LOVE this storage bench. It goes really well with my decor. The only problem is that one of my cats rips it apart because it's made out of fabric and it's not the easiest to clean. If you're childless and petless, I'd recommend this.", 
    "The set up could not have been easier. There were NO problems with the musty smell reported by others. It looks beautiful in my bedroom.", 
    "Gorgeous and just the right size for the end of my king size bed. Spacious interior and very sturdy.", 
    "I bought this bench to store/hide toys in the living room. It stays open on its own, which is helpful when you are putting things in it or getting items out (and really helpful for a toddler doing this herself). Not super comfy, but it does the trick to provide addition seating if needed.", 
    "Disappointed. There was a lingering moldy smell. I returned it.", 
    "Love this! Very nice quality and roomy interior", 
    "I purchased this for my grandchildren's bedroom when they come to visit. It does not sit high off the ground, so it is perfect for them to climb up on and read books. Great price.", 
    "It was smaller than what I expected but still very nice! The storage option is roomy and wonderful. I choose the red and it really makes the space in my foyer pop! Nice material....well made.", 
    "Looks great and I love the storage capabilities.", 
    "I love it and so does my dog. She now sits beside me when I work on the computer. I doesn't show dirt like I thought it might.", 
    "This is a lightweight yet sturdy piece of furniture. I love having it in my foyer for storage and for sitting. The color and quality of the fabric is very nice and durable. If I had the space, I'd get one for every room.", 
    "Bought this bench for a master closet and it fits perfectly. Exactly as described just check your measurements because it is on the smaller size. Storage is perfect for my extra linens.", 
    "Odd smell, doesn't hold much. Looks nice", 
    "Fits beautifully under our guest room window, looks good. Strong and useful for guest linens.", 
    "nice piece, looks like pic sturdy.", 
    "The color is not sand or beige but rather a light sage green color. Was a bit surprised at the green tint of color so be aware if you're trying to match with other items in the beige/tan/sand family. It is sturdy and perfect for keeping shoes out of the way as well as providing a comfortable place to take shoes on/off. Very easy to assemble, just screw in the legs.", 
    "Perfect and very similar to the pottery barn more expensive alternative. Has no problems with smell and the storage area is pretty large in my opinion", 
    "Exactly what we wanted! Very satisfied!", 
    "Needed storage badly...it helped fit my needs.", 
    "This stool is perfect for the antique slay bed, well constructed very sturdy.", 
    "This is a great accent piece. Function and form with this storage ottoman!", 
    "I've had this for a short amount of time. I like the look of it and the size is perfect. However the lid won't stay up anymore, some screws came unscrewed so maybe once I screw them back in the problem will be solved, but it's so early for that to have happened. For the price I am happy but it's definitely not high quality. It came completely assembled which was convenient.", 
    "it arrived on time. very easy to assemble. just screw in two legs. big storage.", 
    "So far, so good.... we just got it a couple of weeks ago as we're moving and are going to put it in the bay window area of our master bedroom, but right now it's at the foot of the bed. I partially chose this one due to the fact the fabric should be more durable and less likely to soil than the linen one. We're happy with it, other than the seat is pretty firm and it would be nice if it were a shade softer, but it's not something we'll sit on but a few minutes to put on shoes, etc.", 
    "This piece was exactly as represented. I love the understated look of it. Prior reviews are correct that the inside smells a bit. Would definitely recommend this piece!", 
    "The bench is exactly what I wanted and does the job; a place to sit and put on shoes with added storage. The only complaint I have is the color. It appeared to be more of a beige/sand color, but it is more like light grey.", 
    "I purchased two of these benches for my family room to flank my fireplace, provide additional seating as well as function as toy boxes for my toddler. I am very happy with the quality of this product. They look is very high end and they hold all of my daughter's toys keeping my family room tidy.", 
    "Very sturdy and attractive. Better than I imagined.", 
    "Great for storage, although I found the exact same item at my local Fry's store for half the price and it wasn't on sale", 
    "I was looking for something inexpensive to put in front of a double window (floor lenght window) and also looking for addtional storage. This bench worked well for me for both purposes. The shipping was quick and the set up was very easy..just screw the legs on. The bench had a few loose threads -- but no smell, thank goodness, like other reviews had indicated. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Took some time to be delivered but when it came, it was easy to assemble and the color is neutral. I use it to store books.", 
    "It was what I ordered and is very nice but it does not match my bedroom", 
    "bench seems very small and the fabric was not what I expected", 
    "I bought the bench for the foot of our bed and it was just exactly like what the picture showed and exactly what I wanted. I wish I could post a picture because it looks so great.", 
    "The function of the bench is fine but the color is off. \"Sand\" suggests cream or beige coloring. This is more white undertone with a blue gray hue in the thread. It's a cool tone more than a warm tone. I am returning it.", 
    "This turned out to be a very nice ottoman. The workmanship quality is so much nicer than the other ottoman I had ordered and had to return because of workmanship issues. The fabric has a nice texture that helps the neutral color (off white) not look so plain. The style of the legs gives it a classier look (much nicer than the square blocks that other ottomans have). This is definitely a nice product and I was happy with the price.", 
    "Very good product and good price The delivery also was perfect", 
    "The smell was awful. I left it out of the box for 3 days and couldn't take it anymore. It's going back. Also, check the measurements, it is smaller than others I've seen while shopping.", 
    "The bench is fine, but overall is say it looks/seems \"cheaper\" than I anticipated. The little parts that screw into the feet (not sure what they are called) came with crooked screws so the bench is a little wobbly which is mitigated a bit because we have it on a rug. We are just using it for extra storage at the end of our bed, so it does the trick, but I wouldn't recommend putting anything on it or sitting on it. Also the little things I mentioned before are coated in plastic which was complete chipping and made a huge mess. You don't see them, so again. Not a big deal, but it was a pain to clean up. This was my first purchase from overstock.com and based on quality of product, not sure is make another one.", 
    "Storage Bench is true to description. I knew what color I was getting, but after seeing it in person I wished I got a cream or ivory. But I am going to keep it as it still goes with my bedroom!", 
    "I have to admit that this bench is a little disappointing. In the picture the fabric looks more like linen. It is a darker shade than that in person and has a polyester feel to it. I bought it to use in the master bedroom but it is now in a guest room because the color didn't blend with the decor in the master suite. If I had kept the original packaging I probably would have returned it. However, I must say that the only reason I would have returned it is because of the fabric discrepancies. If you'e looking for a small storage bench - this one is sturdily made and will hold a few blankets nicely.", 
    "Great quality. Overall, nothing to complain about-everything I expected. Looks nice, offers great storage.", 
    "This tufted storage bench looks great. We got it for my grandmother and she loves it. We also bought two decorative linen pillows to go with it.", 
    "The bench is exactly as pictured. It should be fine for the end of the bed, although the material does not seem very sturdy. I wish it was more textured and not so plain. I don't think it would be practical for heavy use.The inside should be fine for bedding material, but not super strong for very heavy items. The buttons and trim are a nice feature.", 
    "The color is different from the one shown in the picture. This was my first ottomon made of clothing stuff It does not close completely and there is a gap left between the lid which looks very odd. I have couple of storage ottomon n they r made of leather and I would never buy another one made of stuff other than leather", 
    "Smaller than expected. Hinges drag. Appearance is o.k., except for a black spot located on the tufted top. I removed that with a cleaning product. The style was nice but, overall I didn't think it was a good value for the price.. I expected a larger bench with a bit more storage.", 
    "For the money, this is a very nice looking piece. The fabric is definitely multi tonal cream and sand, bits of white, too. It looks beautiful against our dark brown woods. We didn't notice the odor others complained about. We have two other storage benches in our home and I always put sachets or scented soaps in them because few benches circulate air enough to avoid mustiness. We are concerned about long term durability. The bench stores blankets but is also to used as extra party seating in our family room. After the first use for that purpose, the fabric is already stretching and sagging a bit. I hope it lasts longer than I suspect it will.", 
    "Wished it had been taller in height but still a great buy!", 
    "Love everything about this bench. Nice storage space. It ties the whole room together. We are actually using it as an ottoman for a love seat and needing something a tad higher than the standard ottoman. Color is a little more beige than pictured. I thing the pic looks cream colored. Exactly what I hoped it would be.", 
    "The item is exactly like the picture no surprises. Came SUPER fast and boxed well. The only thing I had to do was screw in the legs. And the only reason I gave it a good rating is one of the legs goes in a little crooked and is not straight on one corner, but no big deal.", 
    "I purchased this to use as a toy chest in our living room. It's good quality and looks great. It's a nice neutral color and holds more than I expected. There is no odor as was mentioned in other reviews so it appears that issue was resolved.", 
    "Love the storage bench. It's extremely nice looking and sturdy. Great item.", 
    "I bought this to go at the foot of the bed in the guest room. Love the size and style, but it is a little bit gray and doesn't really match the off white/beiges in that room. Oh well!", 
    "Based on some of the earlier reviews I was a bit nervous about a possible chemical smell to the fabric but, there was none! The size is great and allows great storage for all of our winter hats, scarves, gloves and mittens. The material seems durable and is a nice neutral color which,fits anywhere in my home. The only criticism I have is that the hinges to open and close the bench seem a bit flimsy.", 
    "Looks great, smells awful inside. Had to put cedar in it to try and get the smell out", 
    "AMAZING QUALITY!! Comfortable, light weight and very practical for storage. Perfect for your foyer or even use as a coffee table with a tray on it for smaller living room furniture sets. The price is unbelievable.", 
    "Is really what I was looking for, my bedroom looks amazing, great impression to the bed, put it on the bottom of the bed, loved it!!!", 
    "I may have received a lemon but because of the condition I can not recommend this product. Mine smelled of mildew. I think it may have gotten wet or was stored somewhere that was not air conditioned and the moisture got to it. I returned the product for a refund and did not reorder.", 
    "Nice addition to our dressing room / closet. Good quality and height....", 
    "The bench did not look as good as the picture. The fabric was rough looking and looked cheap. I would not buy an bench with fabric again.", 
    "This is a decent bench for the price; I'm using it as an ottoman/coffee table in my living room. My big complaint is that it reeks of mold. It was not damp when I got it, but clearly it was at one point. The stench seems to be concentrated on the inside, so I am scrubbing it down with various concoctions in an attempt to clean it out. Part of me wants to rip out the liner to see what is growing under there, but I'm too frightened. Fingers crossed this works--I really wish Overstock had free returns!", 
    "I have the Chaise from overstock made by EH it is Cream, I had hoped this would match in the same color. It is a great price and product , plan to keep it, I would have rated 5 if it was cream.", 
    "Fit's our need to have something to sit on while putting on shoe's. Again good storage for our needs. The color is more of a grey than cream.", 
    "Easily assembled- just screw on the legs. Nice little bench as promised. My flip flops, slippers, and sneakers have a nice home now.", 
    "Lift clearance is half way . Very pretty neutral fabric. Functional and comfortable.", 
    "This was a nice quality bench for the price. I had to send it back though because the color \"cream\" is not a good description of the product. It is a heathered product... there were strong undertones of beige, brown and green which made it not match my decor so well. But I was satisfied with the quality and sturdiness of the product. It is a very soft material and the storage would give ample space for shoes, blankets, etc... great for a entry way.", 
    "Nice bench.. Used in child's play room for toy storage. Hinges work well and lid closes nice and slowly", 
    "It's a nice piece and has a roomy storage compartment. Neutral color, classy design. Slight blemish (fraying) at the fabric seam on the back of it, but not too noticeable. It's worth the money compared to stuff I've seen in stores", 
    "We have a queen sized mattress in an old double frame, and therefore couldn't get a few larger benches which came in better colors and were of higher quality. This one suits our space just fine--I'm just not crazy about it's white-beige-y color, nor the smaller storage space inside. But we were very pleased with the low price, and it arrived promptly and the set-up was a snap. I felt very happy with overstock.com--it was the first purchase from them and I won't hesitate to buy other products if the need arrises.", 
    "I have 3 kids and this is perfect for them to hang out on. the storage is a added bonus!", 
    "Love this bench, perfect for storing blankets, very sturdy yet sophisticated.", 
    "This bench is perfect if you need some extra storage space at the end of your bed or under a window as a bench. It currently holds a comforter and my extra sheets but is not huge on the inside so it won't fit standard pillows. The color is perfect to go with any decor, and the fabric is linen and seems spot clean-able.", 
    "Love the bench. It is a great bargain for the price. Provides nice storage for light weight blankets or shoes. The bench is just what I was looking for and at a reasonable price.", 
    "Nice product. Got it on sale which is especially nice. Good purchase.", 
    "Nice bench, not too big and not too small. Color was great", 
    "Purchased this bench for my sunroom as extra seating and storage of items that were in an entertainment center that I sold.You can fit a lot into this bench. The lid stays up which is a great detail. I love the stitching on the bench - it really sets it apart from other benches. After I unpacked it, put on the 4 legs, my husband was quite impressed with its good looks. He said I should have ordered two!", 
    "It is just OK. Looks better from a distance but upon inspection the fabric is really cheap looking. The threads are loose and some are dark. I believe cutting them out will cause the fabric to unravel more. It is small but I expected that from the reviews. In it's defense, it was $*** but you can find something better quality at a store like homegoods for less or the same money. I will keep only because I will lose so much money shipping it back.", 
    "Nice bench,good for storage,pretty solid ,can sit on also", 
    "Good product, fit our needs, delivered timely and in excellent shape", 
    "I am very pleased with my purchase. It is very accurated to the picture size and color. I would recommend this", 
    "Sturdy beautifully crafted bench. Looks much more expensive then what I paid. Very sturdy. Only negative....wish it open all the way", 
    "I wanted this for my living room instead of a square infront of my couch I wated this style and was I impressed.", 
    "I'm really glad I got this bench and I'm even considering getting another. It is a great purchase for my 1920s home with no closets. Lots of space inside, and very classy looking. Note: I thought it might be a finer, velvety texture, but it is more coarse than that, and you can totally see the texture if you zoom all the way into the image provided on the product page.", 
    "I love this bench!!! Perfect for storage at the end of my bed! It is sorta hard when you sit on it but it will probably soften as I use it more. Its only 2 days old! Perfect all around bench! My small dogs already love it!", 
    "This bench was absolutely perfect, the right size and color and is well built. Great product for an even greater price!", 
    "The size is small, which is what I wanted. I saw comments about it being small, take the measurement and see how they fit your space", 
    "I love this bench! It is beautiful and comes assembled- all you have to do is screw on the legs, easy. So happy I bought this.", 
    "Bought this for my bedroom, the color is great, maybe even crisper in person than the picture. Tufting looks good, it's the perfect height and storage galore! Great piece ...but perhaps a little overpriced. Either way keeping it, as it looks great in bedroom or living room.", 
    "I like the product very much and must say the return of the damage first one was easy to return and there were no hassles. The spoke person on the phone was very nice and helpful. The return with *** shipping was very helpful. Thanks very much.", 
    "This unit was too small to put in front of my king eastern bed. If there was a much larger size, I would have purchased it.", 
    "This is exactly what I was looking for! The picture is dead-on how the bench looks! This gives me seating for two more people should I need the space. It looks great with a colorful throw and a couple of decorative pillows.", 
    "Wonderful little bench for the price. Arrived quickly with no damage. Fabric is a nice quality. Hinges work well. Fits perfectly at the end of my queen size bed. I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Wish they had this in other colors: I'd buy it for more rooms! This isn't a heavy duty piece but it works well at the foot of the bed and matches the drapes. I am pleased.", 
    "Great buy! Fits perfectly at the foot of the bed. Initially thought it was a bit short, until I sat on it to put my shoes on.....PERFECT!", 
    "Too small for what we needed", 
    "Matches our existing sofa perfectly and looks great! Excellent buy!", 
    "they sent me the wrong bench at first, but quickly resolved the issue and picked up the wrong one from my porch which was convenient. Overall I really like the bench. its perfect for my space and is really sturdy.", 
    "I probably should have looked at the dimensions. It was much smaller than what I wanted and anticipated. I did keep the piece though. I think it is a little over priced for what the product really is"
