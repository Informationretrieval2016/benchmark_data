    "I'm very pleased! First of all, the couch looks exactly as it does in the photo, and it also feels fairly high quality. The roll arm look beautiful, and tufted button are quality too! The thing I like is that the cushion is quite comfortable, and luckily I like to sit on it every day to relax, which is my best enjoy moment I love!", 
    "We were so impressed with our sectional. Very good quality furniture, comfortable, fun to put together. it exceeded my expectations. It was even a little better than I expected for the price. The delivery was smooth and ahead of time. It has firm cushions which I love and the three in our family have so much room to stretch out and relax. I am really happy with my purchase and would love to recommend to a friend!", 
    "Love it! Such an ease to move and set up, looks nice and is comfortable. The fabric is so rich and quality made. It functions and looks great, wonderful idea to put a simple assembly style couch in a transportable box. Soft cushions and moderate height of arm, altogether make it a great deal. No complaints and seating is surprising firm which I prefer.", 
    "I am extremely happy with my purchase. This beautiful sofa looks sheek and very classy. It looks great in my living room.", 
    "First of all this sofa actually looks exactly like the picture. That being said I'm very pleased with the sofa for its price. My boyfriend didn't seem to have any trouble assembling it, it is so easy, I don\u2019t even need to do any help but just hold the piece for a while..., and no any tool necessary! It took him about 20-30 mins I would say. The sofa seems very sturdy so far and the three cushions are firm. Definitely the most comfortable sofa ever, overall I believe this is a good buy. Pros: Easy assembly", 
    "I purchased this sectional based off the high reviews and after sitting on this sofa the last month, my family was unhappy with feel of this item.The overall height is great for short walls, meaning the back cushion stops somewhere in the middle of your back. The PROBLEM is that the top part of the back cushion sticks out more than the bottom half of the back cushion, meaning that the only part of your back that is supported in a 4\" area in the center of your back. On top of that, the foam is very thin on the back cushion and you can easily feel the very hardwood interior frame. All this combined has lead to back aches and neck pain if you even sit in this chair with a slight slouch . Basically, this sectional only works if you sit in a 90degree angle at all times.If you fall asleep with your head on the back cushion (in the slouch position), you are guaranteed soreness.Also, when you assemble this sofa, some areas may not be flushed and it will leave gaps .", 
    "It's very good looking piece of furniture. It's not overly comfortable and it's very narrow, you can't lay two people side by side on it. Other then that it looks great", 
    "This section sofa is fabulous. My husband and I visited numerous furniture stores and couldn't find anything that looked elegant, sophisticated, and a little different. I found this sofa on-line and my husband and I agreed it was just what we were looking for. It doesn't look run of the mill and definitely looks expensive. If you were lucky enough to find this sofa in a high end furniture store you would surely pay double. We are very pleased and recommend it for a living room, bedroom, guest room, but not a family room. The light fabric makes me nervous to recommend this for high traffic family use. Great for adult seating. Very comfortable and great looking!", 
    "This couch is just simply awesome! Totally worth the money as it's comfortable and stylish. It was shipped in less than a week. I was able to assemble it by myself in 30 mins without any tools! My husband was very surprised when he came home that day. Looks like $$$$$ couch. This is a great buy and I recommend it to all!", 
    "Very pleased with the purchase of this sectional sofa! The nature linen and color are so fantastic, comfortable seat, I love this set. It is beautiful and comfy. It is extremely well-made and looks expensive. Easy to assemble them together. This is a beautiful set of furniture and one of the best we have ever purchased!"
