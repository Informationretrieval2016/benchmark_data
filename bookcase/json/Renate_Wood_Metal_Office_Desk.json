    "Needed a smaller desk for my new home , this offered functionality, and love the open shelves. I am using a mix of antique dynamite wooden crates alternately with woven grass storage baskets as file keepers. The look is great. Also, easy to assemble. Beware, this is no sissy piece of furniture. I'm sure it would win in a head on with a Smartcar.", 
    "I'm a jewelry designer and recently remodeled my studio. I needed a strong work bench/desk but insisted on finding something stylish. This desk is perfect. The finish is gorgeous - urban contemporary with the grey wash wood and steel legs. Assembly went quick - I always use a drill to speed things along. Very heavy and sturdy - I move anvils around the surface and hammer frequently. It meets my needs and is flat out gorgeous!", 
    "My uncle put the desk togetere for me and after he finished I was stunned how beautiful this desk was. Very rustic looking, perfect as a desk or work bench I love it!! I may purchase the book shelf to match the desk. Again I ordered thsi product for my home in Bermuda. It wa shipped to my overseas shipper in New Jersy for the voyage to Bermuda. Again, the furniture box was intact, no rips or tears. Very well packaged and protected. Thank you overstock!", 
    "This desk is a terrific bargain. It's solidly built and looks similar to others that cost more in stores. It seemed to be easy to assemble. Or at least that's what my boyfriend said.", 
    "I'm so glad I like this desk! It would have been a bear to send back! It is a well made (high quality) desk and extremely heavy. You would easily pay a lot more money for this desk at another store ( Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, Crate and Barrel). I like how functional it is for both work and play. It gives ample room for my lap top computer and my hobbies (photography and scrapbooking). It has a retro, and yet vintage look, which fits in the decor of my office. My friend, who has assembled many things throughout his life, stated on easy the directions were to follow and simple to put together.", 
    "I purchased this along with the media console. Both fantastic pieces. I'm a huge fan of Restoration Hardware style furniture. I hope this is helpful for anyone trying to decide whether to buy this or not. I say go for it!", 
    "I absolutely love the desk - it looked exactly as it did in the pics. It did take a little bit of time to put together - not difficult, just took some time. But well worth it since there's only a $2.95 shipping charge (compared to other stores that charge over-the-top 10% of purchase price for shipping). The one thing I'd recommend is to make sure when taking the pieces out of the box to assemble, make sure you put them down on blankets or towels or a rug so as not to scratch them up. I placed one of the shelves on top of the other and scratched it slightly - not a big deal but I just should have been more careful. Looks great in our office. Definitely recommend.", 
    "If it was half the price, then this would get 3 1/2 stars from us. Just a bit too wobbly for the price. Not very wobbly, just a bit wobbly, but for nearly five hundred shekels (or more than that at the time of this writing) it should be built dead solid, but it's not. Made with wood, but to my eye does not appear to be solid wood, but a combo of particle board, but mostly (it appears to me) plywood with veneer. When closely inspecting can see joints of the veneer and a small chip in the edge that makes it clear it is a veneer, a veneer that seems somewhat plasticky. Not ugly to me, but not the fully real wood feel and look we were expecting from the description and price. The smell others are mentioning seems to be spray paint. There is a faux dusty white accent color on it that may be part of the spray paint smell (this dusty white color rubs off quickly in areas that get high use), but the whole underside appears spray painted as well. Not a problem to us, just an explanation of what the smell might be.", 
    "I debated between two very different looking pieces, this one and http://gingkofurniture.com/shop/metro_desk/. Design: The area space/depth of this overstock desk is great. I can easily fit my imac, printer, hard drives, accessories, mouse pad and still have it look minimal and clean. Build: The quality is good in that it feels substantial/solid. It's quality is only so/so in that within the first hour I had the table it chipped. It was such a pain to carry and assemble that I'm going to live with this chip and just turn it to the wall. There are some other areas where the finish is starting to scratch off already (1/2 day of use). Luckily the look is a little shabby so it all blends, and I bought the warranty. But I don't think the quality is as fantastic as everyone else raves. But yes, it is indeed solid. Delivery/assembly: The delivery man left this in my apartment building lobby and I (female, 30s) had to carry it up four flights of stairs. I had to open the box in the lobby and take it upstairs in pieces. The main top section is particularly heavy -- I was barely able to maneuver it myself. The assembly took about an hour. It's straightforward and just requires attention but it's not overly complex. I still am not sure where the included screws go, but other than that, the directions are clear. Overall, it's good and i'm keeping it. But I am not as over the moon about it as some other reviewers.", 
    "Great desk! Spacious and stylish. Personally, I hate desks that have drawers that open up for keyboard and mouse so I chose this one for that reason. But let me tell you, this desk is the bees nees out of 9. Assembling it was a walk in the park and the final product is so clean looking. I have gotten a lot of compliments so far and I highly recommend it.", 
    "Love the reclaimed look of this desk! Had to create a home office space for my hubby in our former craft room and wanted a practical piece that doubles as a work table for the kids when the day is done. Appreciate that decent size baskets can be stored on the shelves and the business samples have an adequate home too. Surface requires a writing pad, but the rustic side of it is very forgiving for everyday use. Great addition to an ever evolving space!", 
    "we love this desk, so glad we decided to get it. it is large and sturdy,and has a very pricey look about it, but price from overstock was great!", 
    "This desk is a beautiful addition to my newly remodeled office. It is sturdy, large enough for my MAC and two screens and still plenty of room for other activities. I hope that this line stays in stock, as some day I want to purchase the matching pieces.", 
    "Love, love this desk! Mesh of vintage and modern. Open shelves make great for storage. This product was out of stock and I waited months to see if it would be restocked because I couldn't find another I liked as much. This desk is well worth the wait. The wood is smooth but brings the vintage feel/look with it. It was also fairly simple to assemble.", 
    "I'm not sure there's a lot that I can say that hasn't been said already, but this desk is definitely good looking and the wood / wood composite is heavy & solid (I don't think it's actually solid wood just based on the feel). The metal frames seem a tad on the light side when compared to the wood. It's reasonably easy to assemble although it will take a decent amount of time. The one thing that I never considered, but that I would've liked to have known beforehand is that the desk top is not very smooth. This makes things like writing and even moving a computer mouse less than ideal on the desk w/out a mat or pad. I use a trackball anyways so it's not a big deal for me, but fyi for those who intend to use it that way.", 
    "This desk was exactly as described. The surface area is nice and large to accommodate a computer, keyboard, lamp and papers without any problem. I'm really enjoying it!", 
    "The desk was easy to assemble and very solid. The completed look is much more expensive than the actual price paid. Looks great with some wire baskets from Pier One on the shelves.", 
    "I like my desk but only thanks to my father being able to fix it, otherwise I would have had to send it back. The holes were drilled inaccurately so it would not fit together, my father had to drill new holes in the metal and use different bolts. After 2 trips to the hardware store we were able to get it to work. Not cool for a nearly *** desk! Also shipping was a nightmare with UPS. They would not deliver this for days and I spent an hour on phone with UPS and Overstock customer service trying to sort this out over the span of 4 days. I have never had such a bizarre shipping situation with the UPS repeatedly saying it was out for delivery and then repeatedly leaving it in the facility and not rescheduling. UPS really dropped the ball on this with their inaccurate information and lack of communication. Overstock tried to help but got the same run around I did from UPS. Lastly, the desk smelled so strongly of chemicals coming out of the box it was overwhelming. It took several days of airing this out with all the windows open 24 hours to stop reeking of carcinogens.", 
    "Redoing my home office around these Renate pieces, also picked up the sofa table to use as a work table, with ability to put printers on the bottom shelf. Note on the desk - I removed the upper shelf on one side, as I have a large tower PC. Then I added a set of brackets to the shelf - viola! a matching wall shelf. These peices were simple to assemble and have completely changed the look of my office. As always, O.CO delivers quickly and packages well. I'm a believer!", 
    "I purchased this desk for my smallish home office and it fits in the room just great. Box arrived slightly damaged but no damage to the desk. The wood has a very nice weathered finish and it is also substantial in weight. The metal has a slightly rough texture to it, making it look worn ( but in a good way). Hubby unpacked and put it together in about 40 mins, very easy to follow instructions. Love the shelves for storage. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to others", 
    "My husband assembled this desk as it is very heavy. He ended up using a drill to help speed up the process and make sure all of the screws were secure. It probably took about and hour to finish assembly. Despite a small scuff on one of the shelves, the final product EXCEEDED expectations. This desk is very sturdy and very attractive. The color is a cool brown with brushed bluish gray undertones. Very rustic and modern looking. The desk area is very spacious and the wood is well finished and smooth. Leg room under the desk is more than generous. If you like the picture, you will like the desk.", 
    "Great desk. Assembly was easy. Box is very heavy this arrives in. Materials seem to be very high quality.", 
    "Great product that will last. It appeared that the legs were solid iron, but they are actually powder-coated. None the less, they are very solid and we are looking forward to keeping them around for a long time!", 
    "I NEVER write product reviews. But I\u2019m making an exception for this product. Words can\u2019t express my disappointment with this Renate Office Desk. Bought this large Renate Office Desk along with the Renate Writing Desk and Renate Media Console. Put this large Office Desk together. Noticed black smudges on my clothes and hands. Spent a couple minutes trying to figure out where this was coming from. Figured it must\u2019ve been dust from unpacking the desk. Ran my hand across the top of the desk. And it turned black. Like I had rubbed ashes on my hand. This is not solid wood. It is fiberboard. Whatever artificial, phony wood finish they put on this desk doesn\u2019t even stay on the desk. I tried wiping the surface of the desk off with a wet paper towel. But the phony wood finish just kept on coming off. I contacted Overstock.com and the lady told me that someone else had actually returned this product because of the same problem. The desk was cheap. But I would\u2019ve just kept it if it wasn\u2019t getting black smudges on everything. I couldn\u2019t imagine trying to do my professional work on this desk and mailing paperwork with black smudges all over it. I intially ordered this product thinking it was solid wood. Since it says, \u201cWood/Metal\u201d. But it\u2019s not solid wood. It\u2019s fiber board. And the \u201cMetal\u201d frame is cheap and thin. Immediately sent this desk back along with the other two Renate products I had ordered. What a pain. Hauling these three 75-100 LB boxes back and forth around town. I was so mad. If the finish didn\u2019t rub off of these desks, I would pay around $150 for each piece. However I paid around $400 for this Renate Office Desk. For that price, you can hire an actual craftsmen to build you a similarly-styled real solid wood desk with a strong steel frame. And that is exactly what I did. I got onto Etsy.com and found a real craftsmen. And now my real, solid-wood desk should be arriving to me within the next week or so. I\u2019m hesitant to ever buy another product from Overstock.com again. Oh. I forgot. They even made me pay for return shipping on the Renate Writing Desk. Hahahah. Unbelievable. I didn\u2019t even put up a fight about it because I just wanted to get these products out of my home. Only way that Overstock.com could make this right with me is to pay me around $*** for the time I spent hauling, unpacking, building, crying, taking apart, re-packaging, hauling, and returning these giant packages. Then . . . MAYBE . . . we would probably be even.PS. The customer service rep who helped me to schedule the returns was a sweetheart and was very good at her job. So please do not hold this against her.PS Part 2. Please change the title of this product from \u201cRenate Wood/Metal Office Desk\u201d to \u201cRenate Fiberboard/Cheap Metal + Black Smudge Office Desk\u201c", 
    "The metal supports for the desk are wobbly after very thorough assembly. The metal is also rusty and dirty looking, rather than nicely distressed. The wood is kind of nice I guess, although it is too imperfect and full of cracks and tiny imperfections to write on. I'm generally dissatisfied.", 
    "Beautiful and sophisticated yet simple desk. It has great quality as well. Wood is a brown and ash gray . Amazing purchase!", 
    "It assembled easily and we are going to keep it, but it was missing half of the lock washers (I had to buy more at **** ******) and one of the shelves arrived with big scratches. Disappointed for the money.", 
    "The pricetag may be a little hefty but I'm so glad I splurged and got this desk! Before, I was using a cheap department store desk and a small corner table pushed next to each other so that I could fit my laptop, monitor and printer. Now I'm able to put my printer on one of the side shelves and I'm left with SO much space! I could spread out books to write a research paper, make/decorate a poster or do just about any other arts and crafts with the space this desk provides. This desk is very sturdy and looks absolutely stunning from all angles. I am only 5'0\"/115lbs and i was easily able to put it together by myself in less than a half hour. My only complaints are minor, but worth mentioning. There was a small scratch on the left corner of mine, but due to the \"reclaimed\" look of the desk it's not very noticeable and actually doesn't bother me at all. Also, the wood has a sort of oily feel to it right out of the packaging that leaves a strange residue on clothes and hands--but washes right out. After assembling, I wiped down the entire desk twice with some multi-surface spray and now the oily residue is gone. Lastly, the desk is much darker than appears in the picture, but still looks fantastic. I plan to keep this desk for a VERY long time and I would definitely recommend it to a friend!", 
    "This desk was so striking I had to have it. I love the idea of open shelves, and I love the symmetry of the desk. It is heavy and sturdy and my partner said it was easy to assemble. I can't say how well it holds up over the years as I've only had it a week. I can say it is very pretty and I receive compliments when people visit.This desk is a convincing \"solid wood\" facsimile but as others have pointed out, it is not wood but a pressed veneer. The only thing I'd add is the surface has a faux-rough woodgrain so it isn't a perfectly smooth desk for writing.", 
    "When assembling the desk, not all of the screw holes lined up. We tried switching the shelves because we thought they might side-specific, but that wasn't the case. We had to re-drill some of the holes, which was a huge inconvenience. We didn't think it was worth it to go through the process of packaging the desk, sending it back, and waiting for a new desk. I would think for the price, the quality would be much better.", 
    "This desk is extremely SOLID! Love the distress wood! Because it was reclaimed wood the color was off a little from the image shown. The image shown is lighter with more antique white (distressed look). The product shipped and was a tad bit darker with more hints of gold through out the wood. The gold is very noticeable and In fact, the desk I rec'd was so noticeable, I would recommend double checking that it fits the room decor if you rec'v one similar in color. Putting together this desk was a breeze and anyone could do it alone, which was nice. Once it was put together it wasnt setting level. It teeters a bit. I tried adjusting but it was still little off, so I had to add an additional rubber pad for one leg. All in all its a good buy but it is a little expensive for its downfalls and what is on the market. honestly, I would say its price range should be around 350.00 ish. My friend came over and she loved it. Then she asked if it was more ****. I sighed........", 
    "Product was very easy to assemble. The box weighed 87 pounds and the desk required two people to assemble. Although the screws and bolts are in a sealed package, ours was missing one bolt. Somewhat confusing was the fact that neither the directions nor the parts list made any reference to washers, yet there were plenty included with the bolts. The bolts were fastened with an Allen wrench contained with the parts. The screws require a phillips head screw driver not contained with the kit. This product is made in China. It has a chemical smell to it, so I left the window open in my studio to get rid of the smell and allow the desk to \"outgas\". After a few hours the smell dissipated. The product appears exactly as pictured, close inspection revealed a little rust on the metal frame. I am using the desk as a sewing table and the wood top has a smooth enough finish to handle the job.", 
    "solid desk for a good price. still made out of MDF, but unless you look at the underside of the table, no one will notice.", 
    "A bit of a hassle to assemble, but once it's done you have a very sturdy. large desk that suits my needs for my computer, printer, phone and files.Stylish and sleek lines. Not sure if it's worth the price given comparative computer desks, but it's certainly a good product.", 
    "These desks looked great online and was suprised at how much I liked them in person. They were super easy to assemble and had it together is less than an hour. I purchased a few of these for our office and everyone is really happy with the desk!", 
    "We love this desk. We bought it as a 7th wedding anniversary present (traditional gift is \"desk set\") and have been very happy with it. So far everyone that has come over has complimented it. Very rustic/contemporary look that goes well with pretty much anything. Also, excellent customer service throughout! When our desk was damanged during shipping (fault of UPS, not overstock.com) they sent me another one immediately. I will absolutely buy from overstock.com again.", 
    "This desk is a great solution for the industrial office look. It arrived undamaged in one heavy box with plenty of packaging for protection. It was extremely easy to put together and it is sturdy enough assembled for a person to sit on. Overall, I think this product is an exceptional deal when compared to similar items at Restoration Hardware and the discount furniture sites.", 
    "I loved this desk from the moment we assembled it! While it looks like rustic rough sawn wood, it is made of a composit material that is much tougher than wood. The desk is veyr heavy (which I like) and very sturdy. I think a small child could dance all over this table and it wouldn't move! Love it and expect to have it for a very long time!", 
    "This desk is rustic but still appeals to my modern taste. It is very heavy which lends itself to the solid wood construction. Very pleased!! I am considering another Renate purchase but I don't want to be too matchy-matchy. I love the fact that I don't have to worry about scratching the desk's surface. If I did, however, it would just add to the character of the desk. Love it!", 
    "This is an amazing piece of furniture. Very solid. Easy to assemble with excellent directions. This is a piece that you would buy from Restoration Hardware for a fraction of the price. We just love it!", 
    "We are very pleased with this desk. It is good looking and also functional. It is large enough for our computer and work materials. We are happy with the look and the quality. The shipping was quick and on time. As others have said, it is heavy (>80 lbs). You will need 2 people to carry the box inside.", 
    "Great looking desk - solid wood, excellent value... looks like something you would find at Restoration Hardware or Pottery Barn.", 
    "I ordered this and it shipped in about 4 days to Iowa. The packaging was great. Heavy; 87 lbs. I opened the box outside and brought it in in pieces. There was one small scratch on a corner of one of the shelves, but I placed that against the wall. I installed it in about 15 minutes - I was speeding because I had to run to work and wanted it done to surprise my wife when she got home. I love the desk and I think it should last a lifetime if it is taken care of. I have moved a lot because of the Marine Corps and I see this as a piece that could take a few moves and be fine as long as it is wrapped well. I placed a new all-in-one computer on it and I am buying a 3M slideout keyboard platform to place the keyboard below to allow for more surface work space. There is a 5 inch wide lip on the inside that may make installing it a challenge, but it shouldn't be impossible. Overall good purchase. My other desk is a gargantuan Bush Corsa L-shaped desk that is covered in a printer and other \"stuff\". This Renate desk is going in the living room and I like the skeletal aspect of it to keep it minimal. Thanks, O.", 
    "It's so close to what I wanted. Structurally, the desk is excellent and it is attractive. The color is just not anything like the picture. If you want something that is brown weathered, you will like it. The other thing is get ready for a very strong varnish smell. Ventilate the room for an afternoon of possible.", 
    "Nice looking desk. Easy to assemble. Very strong chemical odor from the stain. I live in a smallish apartment and the odor burns my eyes and throat after a while. I'm trying to find a way to lessen the fumes. If I can't get rid of odor or the off gassing doesn't diminish, I'll need to get rid of it.", 
    "Large 87 lb box arrived on porch. Needed two people to bring in. It was packed well. Stain on wood has strong chemical odor, so ventalate well. Iron legs are not solid, but plenty strong. Its Pottery Barn look, is simple, clean and rustic. Lots of room on desk and shelves. Our handyman took about an hour to assemble, nothing difficult, just takes time.", 
    "Overstock has done it again! Brought an excellent product at an awesome price! Love this desk...so sturdy and beautiful. It has the reclaimed wood/industrial (restoration hardware) look for a fraction of the price! While assembling, however, the holes were on the wrong side on one leg, but if you're a little handy with a drill, so easily remedied. Once assembled, very sturdy. Now i just wished they had same desk in smaller version for a different location. Thanks OVERSTOCK!", 
    "If looking for a good desk, that looks good too, this is the desk for you.", 
    "The desk is really heavy and sturdy. Easy assembly..... Looks better than in the picutres, we love it!", 
    "I am very pleased with this desk. It is well built and easy to put together. I love the look of the wood and steel.", 
    "Highly recommend for the price!! Product as pictured. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.", 
    "Great quality. Super heavy.", 
    "Very sturdy. Somewhat easy to put together for one person. Highly suggest only hand tightening screws until all are in place, then use allen wrench to tight. Also, DO NOT over tighten with allen wrench, you could unsecure the seeded threads if you do. Would recommend this desk for anyone that has iMac and MacBook. Plenty of space. Also, you can find 11\" wide baskets at Michaels or Hobby Lobby to slide into shelved to hold supplies.", 
    "Perfect size for a home office desk. Very solid build quality, and a great semi-distressed industrial look.", 
    "Love this desk in our office. It is a great size, very strong and stable, and has an almost bluish-greyish finish to the wood. It is really pretty. I think it is true to the pictures online re: the color. The open shelves keep it from having an old stuffy heavy desk look, but it is very solid construction.", 
    "Wonderful work space and storage! Great looking as well", 
    "Package arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I've made multiple big purchases through Overstock and never had a problem. The desk was very easy to construct, feels solid, and looks expensive. No, it's not real wood. It says that in the description. On close inspection this becomes obvious, however the finishing on the board looks nice. The metal is dark and textured. Colors are true to the pictures. Price is fair. Overall, it's exactly what they're advertising - nothing more, nothing less. I'm pleased with the purchase.", 
    "A great desk. Easy to assemble. Nice industrial look.", 
    "I've had this for a couple of years and it has held up very well. Seems very solid. Been very useful and the look I wanted.", 
    "This was easy to put together and it is excellent quality!", 
    "Love this desk! Feels substantial- not cheap. Dark wood with some light grayish/blueish highlights in places The open shelving is wide enough and deep enough to actually use and be functional.", 
    "It looks even better in person, great quality, very happy with this purchase!!", 
    "Great reclaimed look with plenty of space :)", 
    "Everyone came to my living room notice this desk first for the great wooden surface.", 
    "solid, I use it for my painting. Baskets on the shelves hold supplies and the top is already covered with paint!", 
    "This desk is very solid and well-made. It was easy to put together, I assembled it by myself in about 30 minutes. It's heavy and awkward to flip over, right-side up, after it's assembled, however- that is more of a two-person job. The photos are accurate and this desk looks great. I would purchase again.", 
    "good quality...love the look...desk wobbles just a bit but other than that it looks great in my home office", 
    "Love this desk. Looks nice and is very sturdy.", 
    "I've been using this desk for over a year now and I absolutely love it. It was easy to put together and is very sturdy. Everyone who comes over loves it!", 
    "nice size desk to work and do crafts, I like the finish", 
    "Great, sturdy desk! I love the distressed look of the wood and it's super easy to put together.", 
    "Love the reclaimed, industrial look of this desk.", 
    "We love this desk. We bought the bigger one and the smaller version for our home office. They coordinate beautifully with all of the rustic pieces in our home. The wood tone is a warmer brownish grey. These desks have survived several moves and held up perfectly.", 
    "Love the desk! It was relatively easy to put together and I have had a lot of compliments from visitors that want to know where I got it, etc. Unfortunately the color of the wood was not what I was expecting and it is extremely grooved so you can't write directly on the surface of it. But these were not deal breakers for me.", 
    "Very happy with this desk. Easy to put together and feels very sturdy.", 
    "Great desk, very stylish, very sturdy. Highly recommend.", 
    "My husband loves it! We are thrilled with this desk", 
    "This desk is great, well made and sturdy. It looks great in my office too.", 
    "Looks great, suits my design objective, and home office needs. I deducted 1 star for a bit of wobbliness when fully assembled. Still adequate and functions fine for my home office.", 
    "This desk is perfect for someone who likes to sprawl out while working. It is also just a beautiful piece of furniture, even my wife lets guests see it! One thing worth noting, it is a bit tough to clean. Since the wood is actually wood, dust settles in the creases since it is not a 100% smooth surface. I use a wood cleaner and soft cloth to clean it about once a month or so and that seems to do the trick.", 
    "High Quality and a great value", 
    "A practical desk with plenty of room. Really a good buy!", 
    "The table looks great. The pictures on Overstock do a good job of accurately representing it. However, the table is lighter in color than the close-up shots depict. I would say the color is about 60/40 gray/brown.The build quality is excellent, and I was able to easily unpack and assemble the table by myself in about 45 minutes. All required materials are included with the exception of the drill I used for six screws.The table was well packaged, but be prepared for a lot of tiny styrofoam pieces to end up on the floor when you unpack. Have your vacuum handy.All in all, I couldn't be happier with the purchase.", 
    "This piece was ordered at the same time as the corner table which I use as my desk and printing table. Looks fabulous and blends in with my eclectic furniture!", 
    "All the reviews on this desk were pretty right on. That's why I went with this and I was not disappointed. Its a solid desk thats beautiful, functionaland adds a presence to the room. I'm already looking at additional pieces.Thanks for your reviews! They go a long way with a purchase.", 
    "I bought this a few months ago and have been extremely happy with the quality of the desk.", 
    "came out just like described/pictured", 
    "I bought this desk because it was stylish and had great reviews. It is very heavy and was delivered in perfect condition. I put it together myself which didn't take too long. Great quality desk for the price!! I would definitely recommend it to everyone. It does not disappoint.", 
    "Sturdy, easy to build, large work surface. Heavy but came apart easily when I had to move.", 
    "looks so expensive, very heavy and sturdy, easy to put together. looks great!", 
    "It's some wood/plastic composite. Meh.", 
    "Great desk and well constructed. We left out one lower shelf and put the computer tower there. Works out perfectly.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for at a great price!", 
    "While it is not reclaimed hardwood, it does a great job looking like it (for the price!) Sturdy. Looks industrial. Lots of desk space. Looks perfect in our newly redecorated office.", 
    "I love a simple, rustic look and this desk delivered. Very thick wooden base, heavy, high quality. I put it together myself and had a very easy time with it. I've shown it off quite a bit. Great buy, especially for the price.", 
    "I have been wanting this desk for awhile and finally got it. I also got the side table that matches. A little darker than the pictures, but still very nice and it has the \"old wood\" character that I like. Super easy to put together. I did it by myself with no problems. I also have a huge gaming computer and was able to take out the top shelf on one side and that is where my computer is now rather than on the desk or under it on the floor. Works perfect!", 
    "I LOVE this desk. Assembly is a little time consuming, but really easy. No problems with holes not lining up or anything. The wood looks really nice and high quality. I have 2 23\" monitors and 1 27\" monitor sitting on it along with my keyboard, mouse, and speakers and still feels roomy. Definitely worth the price.", 
    "This desk is so great it inspired me to write a review. I live in a smaller town and have to order a lot online, which can be tough. I wanted a desk for an office space that is in an open floor plan. I cannot tell you how great this desk is. Quality is really strong and great, looks are perfect, and I get a ton of compliments on it.", 
    "Sturdy desk. Easy to put together. The main wood piece had a couple little flaws in it that they tried to cover up. Also had a problem with one of the shelves screw holes not lining up but they sent me a new shelf right away. Overall I love the new desk! First time to order furniture online and it went pretty well.", 
    "We needed to put our home office in our bedroom and this was a great option. It doesn't take over the comfortable feeling we wanted.", 
    "It went together easily and looks beautiful.", 
    "If this is the style of furniture you want... this is perfect. It seems a bit darker than the picture but everything else is true. solid. easy to put together. quick ship.", 
    "Might be a little overpriced for not being real wood, but nice desk. Easy to put together. It's heavy and solid. Nice finish for plastic wood.", 
    "This fits my style perfectly. Rustic metal & wood. Very nice desk. Large enough for multiple monitors.", 
    "Plain, sturdy, nice desk. Use it as sewing table", 
    "This desk is super unique...a rustic & modern combination. Love it. Also ordered matching bookcase. Overstock has an awesome selection &, as usual, great customer service.", 
    "This desk is great! Was super easy to assemble, is very sturdy and looks great. For those who complained that it isn't a true reclaimed wood it definitely is not, but it tells you that if you read the specs.", 
    "Exactly what the picture shows.... amazing!", 
    "easy to put together. Very solid", 
    "I love this desk for hits sturdiness, color and design. It's like we bought it at Restoration Hardware. Just wonderful. The only thing I have to be concerned about are the natural wood grain on the surface. Makes it a little hard to write with but that's nothing. I use it for my home office desk and couldn't be happier.", 
    "Very easy to put together. I assembled it on top of a large table so that I could flip it over by myself. Box is heavy, but it's fine when you take it out piece by piece. The smell was instantly gone when I used some pledge quickly over the entire surface. I was able to assemble in about 20 to 30 minutes.", 
    "Love this desk. Ideal for a loft or if you want to achieve that industrial modern look. and the quality is excellent", 
    "This was SO easy to set up by myself (and I am not known to be a handy female). Super solid and sturdy. I love that it can be a desk against a wall or in the middle of the room. The quality is top-notch. Highly recommend!", 
    "Love this desk! Using it for my home office. Looks great. Has 4 levels of shelving, does everything I need it to do, and looks really nice in the process.", 
    "I absolutely love this piece", 
    "Needed a desk to stage a children's area. This one was the look I was going for and it was easy to put together.", 
    "Very nice desk. Well made", 
    "Like other reviewers mentioned, the desk is very sturdy and well made. based on the comments of others, I thought the assembly would be a pain. It wasn't-- took me no more than 20 minutes.", 
    "Just like described- no issues", 
    "easy to assemble. I purchased 2 of these.", 
    "Love it! Well made and great style.", 
    "This desk is used in our home office/craft/art studio. We love the look and durability of it. It was easy to assemble, albeit very heavy.", 
    "Very nice. Heavy. Pleasing to look at.", 
    "This desk is very well made and beautiful. It must assemble easily because my husband put it together himself, no complaints. The desk large but it is working in a small room because of of the lightness of the finish.", 
    "This desk is my favorite thing in my lobby. I always get tons of complements on this desk and people always ask where I bought it from. I couldn't be happier with it. Nice solid build, easy to assemble, beautiful colors. It looks very expensive. I am extremely satisfied.", 
    "I love the look and functionality of this desk and am happy with the purchase. It was easy to assemble by myself. The only negative that I didn't consider is the rough texture. If you're resting your elbows on it, even to move the mouse around, the grooves start to dig in a little. Maybe I just have bony elbows. It wouldn't stop me from buying it again, but it's something to consider. I just rest my arm on something or wear long sleeves if it starts to bother me.", 
    "The desk is well constructed and very easy to assemble - the description is correct - love them", 
    "Great desk, I would have given it 5 stars but the wood is a bit rough, if you dragged your arm across it you may get a splinter. Otherwise it is great!", 
    "We have had this desk now for over six months. It is sturdy and really nice in person. It did not take too long to build and it is quite large.", 
    "makes our office look so awesome with the other pieces", 
    "I wanted something for my husband that was sturdy & fit in with our d\u00e9cor. This desk is solid and looks great. It did not take him long to put it together. I like the rugged look of it. I added dark brown baskets for storage. Also, there is plenty of room on top which is what he wanted.", 
    "All of the good things about this desk have been said and they are true! It is terrific and the pictures are an accurate representation of this item. So I will mention the ONLY negative about this desk just in case it is a deal breaker for anybody out there. Due to the texture of the desk, clothing tends to get hung up on the surface. And not in a way that it snags...just enough to feel it slightly catch. Again, I absolutely love this desk and even if I knew about this before I still would have purchased it.", 
    "The only problem with the table is that it does not make a good writing desk. As a computer desk it is great because it has the desk depth needed. Looks Great and would buy again", 
    "Really great purchase! Looks great and expensive, but it's not that much for a desk. Easy to put together. Love the finish. It was for my husband who loves it as well.", 
    "So, so happy with this desk!", 
    "Awesome Desk, easy install, pop in a few baskets in place of drawers and you've got a perfect mix of design styles! GET CREATIVE!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "Very happy with this purchase - and it arrived lickity-split!", 
    "This desk is so cool! Easy to build and is very strong. Love it :)", 
    "Perfect look for my home office :)", 
    "I absolutely love this desk. It is an identical replica to a more expensive brand. It is the perfect size and the side shelves add nice storage space.", 
    "I really wanted a similar desk at ****** or even the one like this at **** *** but I didn't want to spend more than $$$ so when I found this I thought it might be too good to be true. I assure you it is not, the desk is wonderful! It arrived in one big flat box and was very heavy so it required my husband and me to heave it up the stairs. The assembly was very straight forward and took about an hour with one person. The desk is very solid and sturdy and looks exactly as it is pictured. I am very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "Putting furniture together myself is definitely not in my skill set, but this beautiful desk was actually super easy to build. The metal/wood combo is just gorgeous, and it's the perfect size. Absolutely no regrets about this purchase!!", 
    "At first I wasn't sure if I loved the finish, but It's really grown on me. It looks fabulous in my office, and it's sturdy.", 
    "It is exactly how its shown on the web. Very sturdy desk. Not too complicated to put together. Would recommend it to a friend.", 
    "Very heavy sturdy desk. It compliments our rustic decor. We use it at our home office . The wood is absolutely stunning, as picture shown, it's grey. But also has some Browns in it so it goes very well with our brown bookshelf.Would buy again!", 
    "Good thing this already had a rustic look! My only complaint is with the shipping - it was definitely damaged. The box was torn open and a few screws were missing. That said, this is a beast of a desk and is sturdy even without the missing screws! The desk itself had been banged around quite a bit but it would be very difficult to tell now that everything is assembled. We're very happy with it. It has a very masculine, rustic look and matches with just about anything!", 
    "Solid desk, easy to put together and great looking. We bought two for our home office needs and are very satisfied.", 
    "Desk is perfect for my home office. I assembled by myself and love the look of the wood and metal. Shelves are great for storage and the desk it the perfect oversize desk I was looking for.", 
    "I really like the style. It is very sturdy, large, and exactly what I was looking for for my home office.", 
    "Fun, stylish, modern desk-- makes the office! I wish it had a closed drawer or two, but for the look and style, it was worth it.", 
    "Just got via UPS today and put together this evening in a little over an hour. Very straightforward assembly - not too many pieces to put together. I like that the shelves themselves are very thick and sturdy. I plan to use as a craft table. As other reviewers have said, there is a bit of a blue tint mixed in with the gray and brownish tints - I really like it. I think it looks great with traditional AND more modern pieces. I have an old wooden antique sewing machine in the same room as the table and the iron part of the sewing machine matches the metal legs of the table almost perfectly. Highly recommend!", 
    "One of the desk shelves did come with a decent sized scratch in the wood. This is something that would easily be caught if they did a quality check before sending out. I will be reaching out to Ostock to see if they will send me another shelf. The desk was extremely heavy to get inside but puting it together was quick and even easier with help from a friend. Once put together- this desk is solid, very heavy, and a little darker than the picture. The only thing is I question is the price. For being a bare bones desk and made in China, I thought it was a little overpriced, but Im sure you would pay more at a high end store for the same look.", 
    "This is a substantial desk! It was so easy to put together. I dunno how long the wood will hold up to the elements, so I will be coaster-girl from now on. But it's a really nice desk.", 
    "I've had this desk for more than a year now and LOVE IT. It's gorgeous, looks like a much-spendier Restoration Hardware piece, and fits in with my industrial-rustic interior design. I have a few pieces from the Renate line, and all were simple to construct and very stable. I wasn't planning to spend quite as much for my \"budget office,\" but I think the price was more than worth it for a look I couldn't find anywhere else anywhere near this price.", 
    "It arrived in about a week, and was a very heavy box (about 80 pounds.) However, I just dragged it into our foyer with the help of my 11 yr old son, and opened the box there, and carried the pieces into our family room where it was to reside. I put it together myself within 90 minutes, with the allen wrench that was included, and my own cordless screwdriver. It's very sturdy, well made, and exactly the look I wanted. I found seagrass baskets to fit the shelves at the Container Store. I matched it with an upholstered dining room chair from Target, which is the perfect height. I'm thrilled with the final result, and would make the same decision to buy it again. :)", 
    "I love my desk. It was very easy to put together and it is so cool! The perfect combination of rustic and modern.", 
    "Great desk! Exactly as pictured and affords me good top desk space. I suspect if I ever have to move it out of the present room it might need to be taken apart. Hopefully that won't happen or the mover will have a challenge.", 
    "EZ to assemble, good quality and looks, great. Very pleased with this product.", 
    "Very attractive and sturdy. Well built overall. Am now considering matching pieces.", 
    "This desk is beautiful. When we set it up, my husband noticed a flaw and Overstock was great about sending a new shelf. I love their customer service!", 
    "I Bought this desk last year , and it is a VERY VERY Solid desk, the wood is sollid and strong. The metal is also solid .. This is sold heavy great desk.", 
    "I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of this desk overall. It was quite simple to put together and surprise my husband with a new desk. The wood has enough weight to it to feel like properly reclaimed wood, and it certainly looks the part. I was worried it would be too thin and would look kinda flimsy, but it doesn't. The only issue is that it isn't sufficiently sanded down in parts: there are patches still rough enough to scrape one's hands while sitting at the desk (some patches feel *like* sandpaper). It's easy to sand down and still looks deliberate as part of the reclaimed style, but it's a bit annoying that this desk wasn't totally user-ready. Otherwise, we're quite happy.", 
    "This is a great desk for the price. Heavy and sturdy. Easy to assemble. The color of the wood is slightly different than the photo. I would describe my desk as darker wood with very light blueish-white streaks. It actually is a perfect compliment to my new office that has blue-grey walls.", 
    "This desk is even more beautiful in real life, and is solid and heavy. I'm very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "What can I say that the other glowing reviews haven't? It's a great desk, sturdy, stylish and very functional. The only complaint is that it doesn't fit a tower PC very well. You can leave one shelf off which I did but it leaves pre-drilled holes that are visible, probably only to myself but I know they are there.", 
    "Totally impressed! I was looking for a desk similar to one I saw at West Elm. This was perfect. You need to assemble it but I did it myself - wasn't too hard but heavy! Make sure you really tighten the bolts especially where it connects to the desk top. It will keep the wiggling to a minimum.", 
    "I was skeptical before buying the desk, hoping it would be similar to the photos and be sterdy. It looks even better in person and was incredibly easy to assemble. If you're wavering on whether or not to purchase this desk, do it, you'll love it!", 
    "This is a very nice desk; quick and easy to assemble, solid construction, and good looking. I am very pleased with this purchase--I am using it as a workstation desk.", 
    "We purchased the desk and bookshelf together and are happy with the style and function of both pieces. The only negative is that the wood top is not real, distressed wood like the description suggests, but it's a heavily processed pressed wood veneer with a \"distressed\" look. Overall, it's a great size and shape, and is sturdy and functional, and a great alternative to Restoration Hardware, etc. at a can't-beat price.", 
    "I would recommend this desk over and over. It's very rustic and is exactly what I was looking for. The quality of this desk is GREAT and it was easy to put together.", 
    "Beautiful! It is easy to assemble and I have never gotten more compliments on a piece of furniture. Watch this item though, the price changes A LOT.", 
    "The design and assembly for this desk is extraordinary. Great look and function for my new home / office.", 
    "Great sturdy desk. Assembled in minutes. Has that Restoration Hardware look at a fraction of price.", 
    "Was delivered in less than a week. Not hard to put together but needed a second set of hands to get it in the house (it's heavy) and for a couple of assembly steps. Super sturdy desk with a great vintage look. I'm considering getting the book case and/or media table.", 
    "The desk arrived promptly. As others have noted, it is very heavy. It was easy to assemble and is a solid desk, perfect for my studio. There were several spots where the finish was scraped. I easily touched these up with my artist's fluid acrylic paint. The distressed finish was very forgiving. The size, style, and shelf configuration suits my need for a work space with storage perfectly.", 
    "This desk is made well , excellent quality . Looks great and is perfect for our space. Did not take long to put together. Money well spent!", 
    "This is very nice and seems to be high quality! I would recommend and we get a lot of compliments.", 
    "Modern looking desk at a decent price. They only issues I have are: 1. the smell when I opened the box..The dye on the wood has a very strong scent 2. The sturdiness of the desk. Although it is spmewhat heavy (85 lbs I believe) The desk is easily shaken...Meaning when you type or touch anything on the desk it will move. Total time to put together - 1 hour if you're good at building these things...They still use an allen wrench which is very frustrating to use as a construction tool", 
    "It was larger than I expected, but will fit fine where we were planning. The top has tons of space to spread out. The gray washed color goes with a rustic or contemporary decor. I plan to add baskets to the open shelves to add storage. It is very sturdy and was easy to put together. The box is super heavy, so don't expect that you will be able to move it on your own! This just shows that it will have be of solid construction once put together. It'll be a great desk in our office. I like the other items available such as the end table and book shelf, but don't want to get too matchy-matchy either. I feel like this would blend with other items fairly easily.", 
    "After reading the reviews on this desk, we went ahead and purchased it. It is, indeed, very worth the money: well constructed and very expensive looking. Wicker baskets look great on the shelves for small items, and you can stack books upright behind the baskets. Don't hesitate on this one, if you like the looks of it, go for it!", 
    "I watched and wanted this desk for SO long was so glad to finally be able to go ahead and buy it. Shipping was super quick, the desk arrived in good order and the assembly instructions were clear and everything needed was supplied in the parts packet. I did use my power drill to give the last tighten to all the bolts, rather than just hand tightening with the provided allen key. The desk feels super solid and feels as good (if not a little better) than similar desks I've seen for about 4x as much in fancier store (one of which has a name a little like resurrection software). I bought some long metal baskets from another retailer to act as \"drawers\" on the shelves and complete the rustic/industrial look. For those who may be wondering about the weight of the package, it is quite large... flat packed. I wanted this in my office on the second floor and just opened the package downstairs and brought it up piece by piece. The biggest and heaviest piece being the desk top of course. I moved and assembled it all my self, I'm a woman about 5 foot 8 who works out. I wouldn't suggest that anyone who is actually frail try to assemble and move this, but I feel like my mom could do it all by herself if she just careful/moved stuff slowly. Couldn't be more pleased!", 
    "Perfect for my husband's home office. The shelves allow him to store items for easy retrieval. Loves the undustrial look, easy to put togehter. I put it together using a ratchet screwdriver, in about an hour!", 
    "I was hesitant at first to make this purchase because of the references to the blue tones in the applied whitewash. After a couple of wipe downs with a soft cloth it was not too bad. The odor from the staining process or finish is very strong at first but dissipates after a month or so. It is very sturdy and will last a long time. After a long search for the right desk with a stylish look and reasonable pricing I am happy I finally found it!", 
    "I got this as a X-mas present from my fiance, and WOW! If you like the look of industrial/destressed furniture then you're going to like the look of this desk, it looks much nicer in person. It is probably one of the sturdiest desks I have ever used and can shake it, bump it, push it without fearing it will break or slip 'n slider all over the place. That being said, it's harder to move but I can move it myself (i'm 5'2 and have tiny upper body strength). Also, there is a TON of room! I love this desk <3 TIP: You have to assemble it, and that can be a little tricky because of the screws so I will give you an answer that will make sense when you buy it: bolt, lock washer, flat washer - in that order.", 
    "I'm a business owner and am in the process of relocating and redecorating our office. Most of the furnishings for the other owner and staff are more traditional. I'm a marketing person and didn't want to go that route. I have some antique pieces and wanted to find something that would work well with those. I found this desk and it is exactly what I wanted to create an eclectic space. It was extremely easy to assemble. It looks and feels a lot more expensive. I was concerned because you can't always tell from a photo and if it looked cheap, it would stand out as not of the same quality as the rest of the office. I have spent considerably more on the other offices in our new space, but my desk is a standout.", 
    "The perfect size, I feel like I can do anything in my workspace now. This desk is SO gorgeous, it is such a great deal. I would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "Desk arrived promptly as promised. Looks great. Fit the space perfectly. A negative that turned into a positive was the customer service. The desk arrived missing one of the middle shelves. The online chat representative was extremely helpful and had the shelf delivered within days. Very impressed by how quick and easy the process was.", 
    "Beautiful desk, very industrial yet not too much so that it looks rough. Very heavy, sturdy, sleek. Easy to put together.", 
    "We love this desk. We wanted a desk with a large surface space but were flexible on style. This is perfect - masculine for my husband, but which I can also dress up a little. The materials are very solid; it's a sturdy desk, and we love working on it. Beware of the fluctuating price on it, though...", 
    "Rustic, sturdy and high-quality, fits perfectly with our industrial/rustic setting", 
    "Although the desk was extremely heavy, it was easy to assemble and looks stylish and sturdy.", 
    "loved my new desk. wanted my small office to have some funky character and I knew when I saw the desk on Overstock webpage that it was just what I wanted. had a pull-out shelf for keyboard added and it is just perfect! color goes with everything that I already had. Great buy for that \"lift\" to make your office/hobby room special!", 
    "Love this desk. The look is great, very functional, and fairly simple to assemble. Would definitely recommend to a friend.", 
    "I wanted a desk that was not old fashioned....something more contemporary. This desk is hefty, substantial and stylish. There are no drawers, however, so take that in mind when ordering. Easy to assemble. I am pleased with this quality desk!", 
    "Easy to assemble. Very sturdy and well built. Delivery was fast and packaging was in great shape. Heavy, Heavy, Heavy...need 2 people to move it.", 
    "I love this desk. It's very high quality, sturdy and beautiful. I would have no issues recommending this purchase. I assembled it myself, but it would have been easier with two people.", 
    "This is a very large desk. I could fit two 12\"x26\" lamps on both sides of the desk and center each lamp with the desk's two side shelves. You can't remove the middle shelves to fit in your desktop because those shelves are part of the desk's structural frame. As another reviewer pointed out, this desk has a restoration hardware style, looks expensive, and is very beautiful. I'm very happy with the purchase.", 
    "I have gotten many compliments on how good my new desk looks. The one thing I do not like is that, in an apparent effort to save costs, the wood is a half inch thinner across the main portion of the desk--where no legs have to mount to it. This made it impossible to mount a keyboard tray under the desk unless I added another half inch of plywood.", 
    "This is a great desk. Yes, the \"reclaimed wood\" finish is faux, but for the cost what do you expect. It looks fantastic, works well and is solid. To the reviewers who needed new holes cut, etc, this type of assembly is designed to be put together loosely first, then tightened. As you do so, the pieces bend slightly and meet together really tight, making it very sturdy.", 
    "This desk was (is) very heavy so that i was able to receive free freight was a HUGE deal. It arrived without damage and i put it together, by myself, in about 30 - 45 minutes. Clear and concise directions and the desk is assembled in a way that is very intuitive which means a quick glance and you can just put it together pretty quickly. What i love best, though is that the desk itself is made really well. I held out for over a year, working in my home office using an old door set on top of banker's boxes - i was waiting for just THE right desk. Found it. Lots of room on the desktop (i have a mac laptop and two monitors) as well as the shelving on the sides. Very sturdy, no \"wiggle\". Highly recommend.", 
    "Overall a great looking table and well made. The wood grain pattern has a slight generic look to it but other than that great desk for the price!", 
    "The desk arrived very quickly and was a breeze to assemble. It is a beautiful desk and matches the description online. It is perfect for our beach house. The large size makes this a steal!", 
    "This is a great desk. It looks exactly as pictured on the website. I was able to put it together myself using just the allen wrench that came with it (though I did ask my husband to tighten up the screws when he got home, since he's stronger than I am!) Have been using it for 2-3 weeks and am very satisfied with it.", 
    "I had no idea this desk would work as well as it did. The construction is solid and the color schematic was both masculine and subtle enough to integrate well with the rest of the furniture in our second room. The desk is large enough to work off of and the side shelves are perfect for the books and our printer. Great buy!", 
    "If you are after a true vintage look this is not the desk for you. While well built and sturdy the faux weathered finish is not the best I have seen", 
    "Allow me to affirm the review that states the desk would win in a head on with a smart car as I can't improve upon it. This desk is easy to assemble, solid and very stylish - it will work in any decorating scheme. An added plus is that it forces discipline - it won't look good if you are a messy desk person. I just love it! It was cheap to be this happy.", 
    "I am so thrilled with this desk that I bought as a new sewing table. I am very picky about my sewing furniture because I sew every day for hours. This piece was so easy to put together, my six year old and I did it in less than an hour. I'm glad we put it together in the spot where it was going to be because it is very heavy. All of the hardware was included and the screw holes all lined up perfectly. The wood and metal used in this product are quality and match the picture as advertised. This has a very large work area so it makes the perfect sewing table and would also be a great desk. This piece is very sturdy.", 
    "I have order items from overstock and have been very please with the delivery,,packaging and with customer service.Overstock been on my list for over two years now.My experience with the company been share with my friends.Keep up the excellent services and products!!! oh,I have plans to order the bookcase", 
    "Just like many others, my fiance put the desk together. He said it was easy. The desk looks nice- rustic in an urban space. Good quality for a good price. I recommend it.", 
    "I bought this desk to \"clean up\" the look of my office area, which is in our bedroom. The modern rustic design is gorgeous. I was afraid this desk would look too large for the room but it actually made the room look bigger. I use two 15\" laptops on each side and a 27\" monitor in the middle. It all fits on easily and looks great. The shelves are perfect for a printer and other misc things that you need but don't really want to be cluttering up the top of a desk. I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this desk to anyone.", 
    "I bought this for a sewing table and I haven't used it to sew yet. Doesn't seem as stable as I had hoped. It does look exactly like the picture and I like the rustic look.", 
    "I don't find it easy to shop for a nice desk. Ikea has a selection but this time around I did not like the legs on offer. This one seemed a great alternative, very different, with some style despite its sturdiness and without being overwhelming and just too much in a room. My prime reason to buy it were the shelves... I had hoped that I can put binders in there, but thought I will not be able when doing preliminary calculations... So no, binders do not fit in these shelves which I find a pity really, but as I had known it before I cannot really complain. Though I wish they took that into considerations for an upgraded design. Did not notice particular fumes... Maybe they improved in this batch and assembly truly was easy. Great buy,", 
    "Excellent desk. Very stylish. Perfect addition to my workspace.", 
    "My boyfriend has a broken arm so I put this together with minimal help from him and it was super easy. Looks great, definitely looks more expensive than the cost on Overstock, and has plenty of room for books/papers/computers etc. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Second purchase of this line. Very solid, heavy desk with an industrial vibe. Bought it for my son who needed a home office type desk that would be large enough for a gaming computer and many tasks. Good size if you have a lot if room. The side shelves are nice to use baskets or cloth cubbies to store paper and other desk needs. Not difficult to put together a one person job.", 
    "Very hefty piece of furniture. Very easy to put together with my 11 year old. Very study and I get LOADS of compliments on it! Totally **** furnitureish. You won't be sorry you purchased this piece.", 
    "This is a nice sized desk; not too bulky or heavy but plenty of space for computer and printer. Shelves are very handy. Excellent purchase.", 
    "The desk is unique and looks more expensive than it is. It is much easier to assemble with two people and had a bad odor but the odor has since evaporated. It will age well and go with various furnishings. No regrets.", 
    "I was very satisfied with everything. The product arrived in a timely fashion and assembling it was very easy.", 
    "LOVE the desk... so happy it was back in stock so I could buy it. I wish I could buy some more of this manufacturers wood to put up matching shelves in my office. The desk is HUGE and great for working from home. Only slight issue is that the color looks a little lighter/more grey in the picture and its darker in person.", 
    "Great looking desk (bought matching bookcase). Unfortunately for us, we have to have someone assemble as we don't know how to do this.",
