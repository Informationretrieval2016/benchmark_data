    "The bed is pretty nice, somewhat smaller footprint than I imagined (guess I should have measured it out) seems reasonably solid. Took about 45 minutes to build, easy instructions. My son is a maniac, so there are a few pieces I expect him to destroy, sooner or later (ladder side rails). My older son had a similar bed that was all plastic, that was way more durable, but it also cost twice as much... All in all, a pretty decent deal.", 
    "My 2yr old nephew loves his new bed!!!", 
    "Gave my 2 year old grandson this bed for Christmas. Very cute! He loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "We put our son in this bed (his first \"big boy bed\", and he took to it the first night. He is in love with Fire Engines, so this was a natural for him. Great quality and very easy to assemble.", 
    "Not too difficult to put together & really sturdy and nice looking. Great little bed!"
