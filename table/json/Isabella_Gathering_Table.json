    "I don't normally write reviews but I felt an obligation with this large purchase. This table is very well built and sturdy. The craftsmanship is beautiful. I did have to seal the top but that was easy. I ordered the longest one so its a huge statement in the room. There was another retailer that had listed this table for over $$$$. So thank Overstock for the great pricing. This will live in our house for years to come. We have gotten a ton of compliments on it. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!", 
    "Love love love this table fit 14 for family dinner! It was delivered right to my door and was easy to assemble. Not finished, but in a quick 3 coats it was ready to go.", 
    "Th s is an amazing table. I've seen it at other stores - the exact same thing - for $500. Great quality, very sturdy. We get many compliments on this.", 
    "well made, comfortable and stylish -- a great looking table and heavy! Love the simple line design.", 
    "Great rustic look and feel.", 
    "The table arrived promptly, it went together easily, and it is exactly what we needed in a narrow room. We can put ten chairs (ours are swivel) around it for a family get together, or we can take over one corner for a more intimate get together. I finished the tabletop with three coats of Vermont Natural Coatings PolyWhey, one quart is more than enough for that job, and it looks great.", 
    "Beautiful! The top is darker than what the picture shows, but such an awesome piece. Very happy with the purchase. Makes my basement look even more like the man cave look that I was going for.", 
    "We originally bought this for a dinning table in a long dinning room we have. After achieving it we decided we would use it in our garage for a work bench. It is 6 inches too tall for chairs and too thin to place a charger across from each other for a place setting. We stained it with pickled oak to bring out the grey and it looked better but still looked like a picnic table which had been distressed and was better suited in the garage. A real waste of money in my opinion", 
    "I found this very easy to put together. Just lay the the table upside down on the floor, put the legs on, and flip it over!", 
    "This table is the perfect height and width. It's exactly what it's called - a gathering table. Well constructed. Beautiful. We could not be happier with this table!", 
    "High quality! Perfect for our space!", 
    "I bought this table for my family room which is long and narrow. This table fits the space perfect and the stools tuck under it out of the way. I love the reclaimed wood look and the height. I have received many compliments.", 
    "This is the perfect table and absolutely what I was looking for for a long time. I wanted a Tuscan feel while everyone just \"hung\" out. The width is narrower than traditional tables and thats what I wanted. What I didnt notice was the height. Inhappen to come across the same table when looking for chairs before the table arrived and found it $$$ more than what I paid on overstock. That is when I noticed the height, however its an easy fix. When it arrived we cut the bottom of the legs and then I scuffed up the bottoms with a wood file to match the rest of the table. Perfect!! I bought the shorter one because I felf the longer one for my space was just a little too long. I would LOVE to buy the longer one for outside dining but had already bought a set. I can see it under a nice vine with lights up!!", 
    "The table looks and functions great and it feels very sturdy. It includes pre-attached table leg tips to protect floors too. Assembly wasn't that fun. It was difficult to get the pre-drilled holes on the table top to line up with the table legs. It came to the point that my wife was sitting on the floor looking up to screw in the bolts while I was yanking on legs and pushing the table top to get them to line up. Eventually we got it, though! The bolts were some sort of jumbo allen wrench bolts that we tightened by hand because we didn't have an allen wrench that fit them.This was our first nice kitchen table, so maybe it's normal but we weren't aware... The table top isn't sealed. We really like the color and texture and we're worried about changing that with a sealer, so until we decide we want to do that, we're having to be extra careful with what we put on the table top. No big, we just wish we knew about it beforehand.Overall, great table, we really like it, just be aware of the above!"
