    "We have a queen sized mattress, but ordered the headboard in a full size. it fits perfectly. It's snug to the mattress, but we didn't mind that. We ordered it in the light grey and it looks very well made and for the price we thought it was affordable.", 
    "Had this headboard for over a year and it is still in great shape. I bought the light tan color and it is just gorgeous! Doesn't get dirty easily and is a sturdy piece.", 
    "Great headboard, and easy to install. I have a large queen size bed and the full size headboard fits perfectly.", 
    "Love the headboard. It was easy to put together, and it arrived quickly. It looks just like it does in the pictures. I couldn't be more pleased!", 
    "This headboard is a perfect addition to my bedroom.the grey color is not to dark or to light.", 
    "Love the color...love the look...easy to put together! It completely changed the look of our guest bedroom!", 
    "Easy to put together, beautiful piece for a good price.", 
    "I've always wanted one of these headboards, looks absolutely gorgeous in guest bedroom.", 
    "The slots did not align with my universal bed frame so I have it freestanding against the wall. $*** is up there to not have it installed to my bed correctly. It only comes w the headboard and not the sideboards you see in the pictures. Just so you know. Nice headboard I'm just dissapointed w the mechanics of it.", 
    "Great quality, color is just like photo. I needed a full headboard, not full/queen. I think the measurement (width) of 64 inches is the inside measurement, not outside measurement - so this leaves a small space between a full mattress (60 inches wide) and the wings. Fortunately, with the thickness of my comforter, you don't really notice this.", 
    "I purchased the dark grey overall it looks nice for the price. I got it for my guest bedroom. Assembly was basically easy, was able to put together myself, the main issue I had was like others, my standard full size metal frame did not line up with the headboard holes at all. The frame was too low and short in width. I'm going to make two holes to attach. Apparently others have bed frames that line up, if anyone has a specific bed frame that worked please leave in the Q&A section. The one recommended by overstock did not work.", 
    "Very good buy... It is not skimpy and looks great on my bed!!!! Very pleased! :)", 
    "I was looking for a piece that would really give my room a more modern & sophisticated feel, and this piece is perfect. It is a very sturdy headboard and looks just as pictured. Putting together the headboard was relatively easy, however when we got to the very end we discovered that the holes were not lining up on one side. We were able to get the first 2 bolts in, but not the last two. For some reason they seemed to be about a half an inch off. I am assuming this is why it is being sold on Overstock because it's slightly defective. My bed is a true full size - but this could also fit a queen. There is a little room on each side between my mattress and the headboard. Again overall, I really like it. Its just what I wanted.", 
    "Excellent quality . Easy assembly", 
    "I loved my head board it looks great in my room ! It was easy to put together and was shipped fast !", 
    "good looking modern design", 
    "Although I accidently order the wrong size (we made it work though), I love the look this headboard adds to my guest room. It is simple, yet elegant and heightens the d\u00e9cor to a new level. Easy to assemble (and adjust to a bigger mattress with a few 2x4s). Arrived fairly quickly too.", 
    "I bought this on line after reading the online reviews. I love it, the quality is good, it is well made and I had no trouble putting it together by my self, it just took longer. It is just what I wanted and goes well in my room. I would buy from Overstock anytime..", 
    "This was the first headboard I purchased and overstock did not disappoint! A great add to my guest bedroom.", 
    "This item is aesthetically nice, but was somewhat difficult to put together and did not fit a standard full size bedframe.", 
    "The color looks more Black than gray which made it look dated, but I improved it by using more modern gray bed linens and beautiful gray silk curtains and now it works!", 
    "I love this. It took me a minute to figure out which way the sides attach, but then it was easy and looks great. I love the nailhead trim.", 
    "I ordered this headboard in grey for a full-sized bed. The item came on the exact date that was listed without any damages and was very easy to assemble! It is beautiful and fits in perfectly with my decorating theme. The only unexpected side to this was that it was a little too wide. I expected the wings to hug my mattress but it is about 4inches wider on each side. Despite this i still love it and am happy with my purchase.", 
    "I paired this with the Yaletown Black Storage Bed (purchased from Overstock) for my teen and it is stunning. It was a breeze to assemble and the color was just as the picture showed...Dark Grey Linen. The nailheads are silver and make this piece POP! The padding is not so thick but certainly substantial enough to see its a padded headboard...I knew this when deciding. The nailheads and winged sides Swayed us in this direction. I would recommend this product!", 
    "Absolutely love it! It's a must buy and looks exactly what it looks like in the picture. Happy purchase!", 
    "Very easy to put together makes the bed look a lot nicer\u2026good value for the price.", 
    "This headboard is beautiful. It's exactly what I wanted when designing my guest bedroom. It's tall without being overwhelming and the nail heads give it style. Worth it.", 
    "I love my bed, the price its worth. It's just like you see at the pic.", 
    "I assembled this headboard myself in. Y garage and carried it into the house myself, very easy to do. Really pretty, looks expensive! Great price. Happy with my purchase.", 
    "I recently updated my room and this headboard enhanced the look of my bedroom! Love it! It was extremely easy to put together and light enough to move on my own. Very stylish!", 
    "This looks rich and looks just as the picture", 
    "Item arrived quickly and was exactly the color I was hoping for - creamy white/ivory. Very easy to assemble and looks great. I say gives a room a boutique hotel feel without spending a fortune. The fabric appears to have a protective coating which makes sponge cleaning and dusting easy. The only reason I gave the item 4 stars is that 1 bolt on each side failed to line up with the hole. In fact, it was so far off, I left these bolts off. As the unit is structurally sound, there is no need for the additional bolts. Overall very satisfied with this product.",
