    "Looks beautiful. Easy to assemble", 
    "I purchased multiple bookcases for my husband's game collection. The shelves were easy to put together and are very attractive. He likes steampunk and this style went well with the other pieces we have in the family room. In fact, we liked them so much that we ordered another one. Some damage was done to the shelves during transportation but the Overstock customer service was amazing to work with to resolve the issue.", 
    "I was very hesitant when ordering this bookcase. I wanted a bookcase that was made of solid materials. This was an excellent choice. My uncle assembled it in about 30 min. It is sturdy and supports my library of books perfectly well. I would definitely recommend this product.", 
    "Was excited when I saw it. Great price, quality, look, and easy assembly. Plenty of room for storage and display and a unique piece. Resembles very well with pics and would order again.", 
    "Love this! Purchased the smaller one with it and now I want the other piece", 
    "Easy assembly. Very modern and industrial.", 
    "We love this stand but be warned, it is not super sturdy. We had to attach it to the wall and now it's awesome. We use it as an open bar in our dining room and it's beautiful.", 
    "Picture is accurate, love the industrial look. Price was right when purchased.", 
    "Great looking bookcase. Very heavy duty industrial look. The shelves are light weight. My husband assembled it with no problems.", 
    "Assembled easily. Great pipe and wood look. Sturdy. Solid. Love the curves the pipe has. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "excellent quality and easy to put together. very sturdy and REAL WOOD SHELVES!!!", 
    "It'll due but mostly because I don't want to deal with shipping it back. It would be better if the links didn't look so clearly cut in half but it serves its purpose.", 
    "Sturdy shelving unit, serves my intended purpose - mainly used for holding books -", 
    "This bookcase has a great industrial feel. Sturdy, attractive, spacious. And the wood shelves smells amazing, if you like cedar. We bought 2 and on one, one of the rear legs has a dent + bend in the metal but it did not alter the levelness and from the front, it's not noticeable. Highly recommend.", 
    "I'm very happy with the value of this bookshelf. Wood is nice color. Some sharp points on metal to watch out for."
