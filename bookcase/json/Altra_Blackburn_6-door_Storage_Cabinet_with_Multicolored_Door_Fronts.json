    "I just needed some storage options for my apartment, wanted something that looked nice but wasn't too expensive. This piece requires a LOT of assembly, so be prepared. I ordered two, and both had issues. One of them has a door pull that doesn't line up to the holes in the front of the door, so it's only secured on one side. The other was a it worse. The bottom doors are too large for the opening, so I had to remove a few parts to get them to fit. One of them is very wobbly, but luckily, I put our wifi stuff in there so I never have to open it.", 
    "Love this!!!! Perfect for storage and looks beautiful.", 
    "Cabinet was delivered damaged. One place in front at the bottom of cabinet and the piece for the back was cracked in two places. I kept both, because it was on the back. You can see the one on the front, but I really didn't have time to replace the piece. It was easy to put together and looks great besides the little piece in front.", 
    "Great Bookcase.....was easy to put together", 
    "Parts wouldn't fit together. Shelves cracked when trying to assemble. I am a little person and a women, so was not using excessive force. Holes didn't along with dowels. Shelves wouldn't fit snug or align. This unit is being returned.",
