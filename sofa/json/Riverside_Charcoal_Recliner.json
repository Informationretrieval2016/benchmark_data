    "I bought this chair becaue we haven't been happy with the recliners available locally for a similar cost. This chair has so far, exceeded our expectations. The seat is high off the floor and the back is very tall which allows for excellent comfort for 6' tall person. The cushion is very supportive and firm on the seat and there's plenty of cushion on the back of the chair to provide lumbar support and the perfect pillow for your upper back and shoulders. The fabric is soft and seems durable. I definitely recommend Scotchguarding it. The chair didn't smell when we rec'd it so we didn't need to air it out. Assembly was easy and the arms weren't wobbly from shipping. The arms are substantially wider than I thought they would be (around 6 inches or more across?). The stain is a deeper red but not quite mahoghany. The chair has a hefty weight to it (close to 90 lbs.) and it doesn't feel like you would flip over when you fully recline. I have been able to lay almost completely flat in this chair and it's wonderful. This chair (in gray and wood stain) is vesatile and modern enough to use in a masculine or feminine interior - just chane the paint. We have a gold living room with color block rug in gray, black, red and gold and it's a perfect fit. You could go modern, arts & crafts, mission style - it would work in all. If you're not sure, try it. You can return the product to Overstock with a return UPS tag. If I had more room I would buy another one. I give this chair a 100% so far, we'll just have to see how it wears.", 
    "I have just started using this chair so I\u0092m not sure how it will hold up. The chair is very comfortable; I wish the back was A little higher for reclining but that is not a big deal. I\u0092m 6\u0092 200lbs and when I sit in this chair it is a perfect fit. My feet touch the floor just right and the lumbar support is FANTASTIC. The chair arrived in pristine condition they were very careful with the packing and it took more time to get it unpacked than it did to set it up, that\u0092s a good thing. The color is even nicer in person it\u0092s sort of a charcoal green it\u0092s a very nice color and the wooden arms match my d\u00e9cor perfectly. This not a $750.00 Lane chair but for *** bucks you can\u0092t go wrong. This is not one of those overstuffed monsters it does not eat up a whole lot of space and it's very attractive.......... I really like this chair!", 
    "The packaging for this chair is poorly designed and resulted in major damage at the rear of both arms. Overstock sent us another one, but it was packaged the same and damaged in the same way. The damage wasn't as bad as the first one, so we decided to just keep it. Other than that, though, I agree with the other reviewers regarding the comfort and style of the chair. We have it in a guest room along with the Aristo armoire that we also bought from Overstock, and it looks great. The arms of this recliner are not quite as dark as they appear in the picture... They are a little redder, more a dark cherry vs. the espresso of the Aristo furniture, but it looks fine.", 
    "Excellent product... I have seen this in the lane product line.. which was more expensive... this is definately worth the money, comfortable, stable, and looks elegant easy to assemble.. a few nicks upon arrival but nothing worth sending product back for replacement, furniture marker fixed the problem.", 
    "Overall, I like the chair. I don't like the look of most recliners, but I wasn't willing to shell out a ton of money for the high-end \"recliners in disguise.\" This is for a visiting family member with a bad back who has a difficult time sleeping in beds. It's comfortable, and I think it'll work just fine. It's not quite as streamlined as it looks online; if you look closely at the side view photo you can almost get an idea of how puffy the back cushion is. It's definitely got that traditional recliner pouf. But I suppose that's what makes it so comfortable, and it doesn't look terribly out of place -- the rest of the chair balances it out. The seat is more firm than the back, so I don't sink into it. I didn't notice there wasn't a handle until it got here; the seat reclines with body pressure. It's not difficult, but it does take a little oomph (5'6\" average build woman -- might be a little harder for someone smaller or weaker). Once it reclines, it stays (no constantly fighting it trying to slide back up, so far anyway), and was easy to push back into an upright position with my legs. Unfortunately, when reclined, it exposes two screw holes on the top of each arm. I would have at least appreciated some caps to cover those up, although you'll never see them with someone sitting in the chair (and they are stained inside the hole, so they're not as glaringly obvious as they would be otherwise). One reviewer said the arms were huge, 6\" wide -- that's definitely an exaggeration. The arms are 3 1/2\" wide, and a nice espresso finish. Like other reviewers, I wound up with a couple small dings on the arms (nothing that wouldn't have ended up happening in my house within the first year anyway), but I don't know how they could have protected them more -- the arms were wrapped in foam sheeting, then cardboard, then styrofoam. The color isn't charcoal grey, though -- there's definitely some brown in that grey. If your interior is strict blacks, it might stand out (then again, so would the espresso finish on the arms), but otherwise I think it's a color that will blend nicely with a variety of decors. It actually works better with mine, since the hint of brown warms it up a tad. There is an odor, so I'm hoping it off-gasses quickly. It smells like furniture stain, though, not nearly as offensive as some of the put-it-together-yourself stuff I've bought in the past. Assembly was easy; the chair ships in two pieces. The seat, base and arms are already put together; that's the heavy part. The back is very lightweight and has two metal channels inside it. Those channels slip over two metal prongs on the seat base; push down, and voila, your seat is assembled. Oh, and there's a velcro strap keeping the footrest in for shipping; if you don't read the assembly instructions, you might be wondering why it doesn't recline. All in all, I think it's a good deal for the price. One star off for the exposed screw holes at top of the armrests.", 
    "We love this chair. Very easy to put together and comfortable to sit in. My husband is 5'11\" and it is a little short for him but still doesn't stop him from relaxing in it every night.", 
    "I was a bit iffy about the color, but the recliner's actual gray color somehow hints of beige and is perfect with our other furniture. Best thing is, it got my husband off the awful 30+year-old monstrosity he had spent his evenings on. The chair looks more like an armchair than a recliner and this is just fine with me!", 
    "I was so excited to get the chair, but it came just a couple of days ago to us not working properly. We've wracked out brain to get it to recline and sit up right properly, but to no avail, it's ot gonna happen. One a good note, o.co has refunded my money and sent me a UPS ticket to send back. I will still purchase from o.co, I have success with other products.", 
    "I have never owned a product that fell apart so quickly and in so many ways. I have never made a purchase that I regretted as fully as this one. Within six months of purchase the stuffing was crumbling out onto the floor and has continued to do so. The arms are painted (over stain?) and began to chip or rub off almost immediately. I bought cover sticks in a vain attempt to hide the missing chips. All I can say to the manufacturer is shame on you! And Overstock - this chair, so shoddy - set the tone for our \"relationship. Haven't bought from you since. I could have paid very little more and gotten the same chair, much better quality. Lesson learned.", 
    "The chair quality is really poor and you can feel it wont last long. Furthermore, it does not look nice like on the picture. This chair came damaged so I was able to return it", 
    "Looks like a Lane, acts like a Lane. Love the color, very neutral. Purchased this for my father-in-law to sleep in when he visits. We have very different frames and we both find it comfortable. Arrived in good condition with just a small scratch on the arm. Looks great in the room. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars: there was a sticker on the upholstery that took a lot of scrubbing to get off. Looks like something that was done in error. Would buy another if I needed it.", 
    "I was really looking forward to this recliner. Always wanted one for the living room, but didn't want my living room to look like something that belonged in a double-wide trailer with those big old 80's style recliners. This char is by no means perfect, but for the price point, I think it's a very fair value. The materials are typical of cheaper furniture, but looks like it'll hold up fine. The reclining mechanism is appropriately stiff, since it has no handle. If it was too loose, it wouldn't stay up when people wanted to stay up straight. So don't listen to all those people complaining that it's too hard to recline. It either has to be slightly resistant, or really easy but too loose. Obviously the desirable choice is slightly resistant. Color is depicted as a strong gray on the website. In person, it has more of a slight brownish hue, almost like a pewter color. Overall, for the money I spent, I can't complain too much about the chair. For reference, I am 5'10\" and 208lbs, and in the recline position it's fairly comfortable. One thing I wish you could do, is recline the legs but not the back, for a comfortable TV viewing position. Unfortunately the back always reclines with the legs, so you're either sitting up, or laying down. You can just prop a pillow under your head if you need to be higher. At 5'10\", my feet hang off just the end of the bottom. Ideally, the headrest would be slightly taller so my head sat forward more, but like I said, easily remedied with a couch pillow. PACKAGING was HORRIBLE. Or specifically, my chair came damaged like everyone else, but worse. There was a 1.5\" CHUNK of wood completely chipped off the bottom leg. Luckily, it wasn't some place obvious like the arm, and I was able to superglue it back. The arm also had a couple of small chips. It wasn't worth my effort to exchange it for another one though. They really need to wrap these better.", 
    "I wanted to purchase a recliner that was slick and contemporary without being bulky. I wanted a taupe/brownish color but when I read the reviews regarding the tan colored one....the reviewer said it was too light so I took a chance on the charcoal. The color blended in perfectly with my taupe decor, it's comfortable, it's slick and contemporary, the price is reasonable and it's perfect for me. It arrived quickly without any damage and it was easy for me to put together by myself....no tools needed. I absolutely love it.", 
    "We bought this chair for my elderly parents because they needed a space-saving recliner for their bedroom. Although the box was damaged when it arrived, the chair was in good shape. It is very comfortable and was the easiest item we've purchased to put together. We had read the reviews prior to purchasing and felt this chair would be the best solution. Wouldn't hesitate buying this chair for our own home. My parents now take turns sitting in it. It's lightweight and the material is soft. The lumbar pillow is great on the lower back.", 
    "I needed a small scale recliner for my 6'2\" 16 year old son. It had to be tall enough for his head and fit his whole body, but not take up a ton of space in his newly updated bedroom. This is PERFECT! The design is modern and doesnt look at all like a recliner. He loves it, it is so comfortable and has the cool factor he wanted. Added bonus -- when I ordered I didn't realize how practical the arms are - they will never be dirty or worn from teenage hands like fabric would be!!! We scotch guarded the chair and expect it to last (and look good) for a long time. Seems very well constructed, the recliner mechanism is really smooth. It arrived super fast but the box looked really bad, we thought it would be crushed. I guess we were lucky, the chair was fine, but there were some scratches on the back part of the arms. They would be horrible anywhere else, but they are hidden by the top part of chair and face the wall. For the money we paid AND it was delivered, we have no complaints! We were looking at chairs triple the price - AND we like this one better.", 
    "I bought this recliner for my mother as a Christmas gift. It arrived in plenty of time and was easy to assemble. This slim lined recliner replaced a much bulkier style. The color is great (she is a cat lady), easy to recline and the back support is wonderful. She was thrilled with it and so am I!", 
    "Comfortable and sturdy. Easy to put together. My husband loves it. Only downside is that when in the first recline position, it tilts back farther than expected. Could use a pillow behind your head to get to the best TV watching angle. Overall a great chair.", 
    "I love this chair. It is what I was looking for at a great price. I needed it to fit a small place and the other reviews really helped. The color is great and I love the bent wood look of the arms. The chair is sturdy and it was a breeze to put together. I am truly happy with this purchase.", 
    "Bought this chair for my husbands office. He is 6'6\" and 250lb, was concerned after reading the reviews, but we are trilled with this chair. Very comfortable,size was perfect, price even better!", 
    "I have purchased two other recliners and have sold both shortly after purchase. This chair, however, I will keep. It is not only contemporary in design and not some man's muscle chair, it goes with my contemporary design and it is also very comfortable.", 
    "I will never order from overstock again. Terrible customer service! We order this in December and one of the arms was scratch/splitting apart where the wood was glued. I contacted them and they sent us a replacement bottom piece (the chair is in two pieces). When we finally got time to look at it and try to take the chair apart we discovered (which our handyman confirmed) once the two pieces are joined they cannot be separated. I contacted overstock and they informed me they can do nothing about it since too much time has now lapsed. They should know their product and should have sent us both pieces instead of just one.", 
    "Perfect for a study/den or small living room.", 
    "Purchased 2 recliners for the cabin. Excellent chair for a small area. Very pleased with the quality of the chairs, chairs recline easily and create a very comfortable position when fully reclined. Worked well for everyone in our family. High 5 from our family. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase them again.", 
    "We bought 2 of these recliners for the retreat area in our master bedroom. They are surprisingly sturdy and well made for the price. We use them every day and they've held up well in the 4 years we've owned them. They are comfortable but sleek looking. I'm not a fan of the traditional style recliners. These do not have that recliner look at all. In fact unless you knew they reclined, they look like regular chairs.", 
    "This is the perfect recliner for my new \"Mom Cave\". The fabric is soft with low nap and the chair is very comfortable. Arrived quickly in a single box which was quite heavy. Sturdy. I am 5' 5\", and not a larger person. Color of wood is nearly black, not a wine color as described, but that's ok for me. Top marks.", 
    "I purchased these chairs received one and the packing was completely demolished and destroyed call the company and they sent it back. I had originally order the protection insurance because I could see that the delivery of these chairs maybe come problem with the way that they were handled through transport. When I called to return the chair because I leaned back to do the reclining one day and heard a loud crack in the wood so I called up to have it replaced they said I did not have the protection plan do not purchase any furniture without the protection plan. Don't get me wrong I love the style of the chairs I like the look of the chair that does not look like a recliner but is just the quality of the product itself has not been as sturdy as I would like on a $XXX chair.So now I am stuck with two chairs that if they break or tear up I am pretty much out of luck because I have exceeded the return policy date. I will always purchase the protection plan especially when you're having item shipped from warehouse and then ship through UPS which exceeds the amount of weight that there used to lifting.", 
    "I ordered two of these and they look great together. Guests have remarked on the comfort. No negative comments at all. Great value for this purchase. Be careful when assembling - we slid one side off track and it took three of us to wrestle it back in place. Overall very happy with these chairs and appreciated the other reviews in helping me decide.", 
    "We were looking for a more modern look with the function of my husbands old recliner and found this to be exactly what we were looking for. He is 6'6\" and fits comfortably in the chair, his feet do hang off but he says not at an uncomfortable spot on his ankle. My only warning is the the arm rests are not super sturdy therefore move side to side if you push. Because of this I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with children who might goof off & rough-house in the chair as I'm not certain it could stand up to the structural demand. I love the feel when I sit in it and truly hope this lasts several years for us as it looks terrific where it is now!", 
    "I purchased two of these chairs for my office. I wanted something stylish, of sufficient height to be comfortable as guest chairs in front of my desk, and that could double as napping chairs. My first one came in yesterday. We have journaled, worked & napped in the chair already and...high five for the perfect chair! I am incredibly pleased. Note, I rated it average comfort - not that it is just OK, rather, it is not too firm, nor too soft. It's just right. :)", 
    "Awesome chair but overstock needs to find a better way to package as reviews indicate many arrive broken. My box was not damaged so not really sure what the problem is but I love the chair.", 
    "Unfortunately, just received it and it was damaged in shipment, leg broken but there is also a tear in the fabric, fabric not so thick and the bottom cushion is off in the original making of the product. Did like the color and size and look but has to go back. First product I was really disappointed in for overstock. Just was not made well, looked rushed.", 
    "I saw the similar recliner at XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX this quality was better but they also wanted more money but this chair is ok for the money", 
    "My wife and I bought two of these chairs at the exact same time, when they arrived one was solid, opened smoothly, and was very comfortable, the second had a gap, and wiggled when you sat in it. it is a minor annoyance, but one would assume that two identical chairs would be of the same quality and workmanship.", 
    "We've loved this recliner since we laid eyes on it at a furniture store. We waited for other colors to come out because the ones at the store didn't match the rest of our furniture. I was elated when I found this on O so I quickly ordered it. It arrived early from the estimated delivery date which I was happy about until I saw the box. The carton was torn and open in some spots and there were noticeable damage to the frame of the box. I opened it and since the box was already so damaged there was no way to salvage the box in case I wanted to return the recliner. This particular one had damage on the back edges of the arms since it looks like that's where the box was dropped. Since it seemed like too much of a hassle to return we just bought furniture markers to color in the scratched spots and thus far no one has noticed. I love the recliner but I'm slightly turned off by O's shipping and handling.", 
    "The chair is very comfortable. I am sitting in it as I write this. Fabric is very soft. It reclines relatively easily and the angle is just right. It is somewhat bigger and heavier than I expected and the box it came in was very big. It was well packed and easy to assemble - I just had to put the back on, the hardest part was getting the two slots lined up.", 
    "Don't look for impeccable detail, but for the money this is a great chair. Very comfortable. You really sink down into the cushions. I like recliners but don't like the big marshmallow kind, so this one caught my eye because of the modern lines. I bought two, one for me and hubby, and we are in love with these chairs. Went together easily, and you just push back and it responds smoothly. You could sleep in these chairs because the second position is almost horizontal. Once you sit in this chair you won't want to get up.", 
    "I finally gave in and bought a recliner for my husband and one for myself so they looked more like a pair of chairs and not recliners. They came in two big boxes and one box was damaged - looked like it had been re-shipped - and chair inside had cosmetic damage to the legs - the other was in a new box but the finish was rubbed off the arm and it had a 1\" dent in the arm. I called Customer Service and they were great - I didn't want to send them back as I had already gotten rid of my sectional so they gave me a credit for the damaged chairs. I was very happy with that. I saw a chair very similar in the LazyBoy gallery here and this is almost identical for a quarter of the price. They are very comfortable, look modern (for a recliner) and easily assembled - you just slip the back into the seat. My husband is thrilled and we have had them for about a month without a problem. I thought the fabric looked like microfiber but it is really more like a corduroy. Great chair for the price.", 
    "I actually saw the recliner at a friends house. I sat in it. I reclined and then decided I needed to get one or actually 2. It is a great chair at a great price. It was easy to assemble. I just slide the back into the bracket. The fabric is not just a solid charcoal gray. It has a subtle tweed like look. It is very comfortable. I could spend the evening in it and even sleep in it. Delivery was very fast. It arrived within a week of ordering it. There is actually a couch that they recommend to go with it. It just might be my next purchase.", 
    "This is a beautiful and comfortable recliner. Amazing price for such a solid recliner. It is a firm, big enough without being an oversized puffy recliner. It fits in very well with my contemporary living room but would work well in most any space. It was very easy to put together and mine had no scratches or dents. After spending three times as much on another recliner, I think I prefer this one to sit in.", 
    "nice fabric - soft, durable, resists wrinkles and stains. the chair is beautiful, looks exactly as pictured, and comfortable in several positions. both my husband, 6'1\" tall, and I, 5'4\" tall find the chair comfortable. reasonably durable - might not survive long in a household with rambunctious boys jumping on it and tipping it over but seems like it should last a long time with normal household use. very easy to assemble. arrived with a couple slight scratches but no serious damage.", 
    "This chair was purchased for a masterbedroom, and we needed a chair that was both modern and smaller than a regular recliner. This recliner fits our needs perfectly. My wife really loves the color and style of the chair.", 
    "I was looking for a contemporary recliner to match my decor, and this was perfect. It is very comfortable to sit in. I am 5'9\" and it is a little short in the legs for me, but I still love it!!", 
    "This chair seemed initially like a good investment, considering the price. Unfortunately in less than a year the mechanism broke and we could not figure out how to repair it and it remained in a somewhat opened position which made it difficult to get in and out of and we ended up having to get rid of it. It is a nice style but apparently for regular use it is not going to hold up over time. We were quite disappointed and could not recommend this to others.", 
    "The chair was exactly what we'd been looking for since we got our other new furniture in the fall. Unfortunately, it came with severe damage to the wooden arms and actually a crack right where the screws hold it together. Overstock immediately refunded my purchase - no hassle. But after 10 days we are still waiting for UPS to pick up the damaged product. We were told if theydidn't come, we can dispose of it. It's taking up space in our garage, but now we'll call a charity to pick it up. Didn't re--rder for fear of a repeat problem. (I actually think we were shipped the same damaged chair a previous reviewer had returned because the box had obviously been opened and re-taped & stapled!) This will not stop me from buying from Overstock though. Everything else I've ever gotten has been perfect!", 
    "I love this chair! Well made and comfortable. It is also very nice looking. I would definately recommend.", 
    "received our recliner and it looked great, easy to assemble and comfortable to sit in. i am a small man, about 160 lbs, my brother inlaw sat in it, he`s about 50 heavier then me, and the right side of the arm and frame split and the chair collapsed. beware of this chair!!!!", 
    "O.K. chair, for the price. The arms are wooden, and very uncomfortable. I've tried to attach some padding to them with no luck. The chair is very, very short. I'm 5'7\" and the back of the chair only goes up to the bottom of my head. I have to move down in the chair if I want to lay it back, so that my head doesn't hang off the back. Also, the footrest is short. My feet hang off approx. 12\". Also, this chair is not a \"wall hugger\", so it takes up a lot of space. There is no mechanism (handle) on the side of the chair to push the chair back; you have to do this by shear force. Not an easy task either. I have to bounce backwards very hard to get the chair to move into the reclining position. I have the chair in my bedroom, so not a big deal on the comfort. The chair is very well made and matches my room decor. Love the material and the color of the wooden arms. The chair came in perfect condition. No scratches on the wood at all. I would recommend this chair as a decorative piece only. Would not recommend it for comfort, ease of use or space constraints.", 
    "Received quickly, easy to assemble. Will probably order a second one for me~ this one was for my husband. Hard to keep the dog off it - she likes it too!", 
    "Great chair that is not taking as much space as most recliners. Modern design is perfect for any room!", 
    "It is as expected for the price. It is not a lazyboy, but you are not paying for that, either. I wish the 'wood' was not black; it could be much lovelier in a wood tone (but likely more $$$). Really comfortable, but not as much if you happen to directly compare to a high end recliner (which is easy in my house and you can tell the difference.) Again, good for price!", 
    "I purchased 2 of these chairs put the first one together not much to assemble tightened what as available and it was wobblyNot good quality returned both chairs", 
    "For the money- you can't go wrong. I have had it my fill of expensive leather chairs! This chair has padding that is soft and the fabric is comfortable. I did put some Scotchguard on the seat and back just in case. I am 5'-and he is is 6' 2\"and we are both comfortable in this chair.", 
    "after returning 2 other chairs that did not work for me, happily 3rd time worked out. chair color is dark grey and chair arrived well packaged and altho bad weather held up delivery time I am very pleased with the chair. the chair is very solid and the recline mechanism allows you to recline at any angle. also this chair is very comfortable for sitting upright whether reading or watching tv and fully reclined is great for naps! similar chairs in local furniture stores were $$ more so I thought this was a great buy and am awaiting delivery of a 2nd one.", 
    "Purchased 2 of these for the living room area and never fails to get a compliment, pretty comfortable both ways, sitting and reclining. My cats like them too.", 
    "I purchased this chair for my bedroom. It was the perfect size and color. However, the overall comfort was did not meet our expectations.", 
    "when I ordered this, I didn't realize that you have to force it to raise the feet - there's no handle to raise the feet. Once I got used to that, it's a pretty comfortable chair - I had to put a cushion on it so my legs can touch the floor when I'm sitting up. Would purchase again.", 
    "product is what is holding up ok, but the wood arms are showing signs of wearing. the stain is coming off.", 
    "After a few years the mechanism sticks a bit, but very comfortable and has had a lot of use.", 
    "My husband and I ordered two of these chairs for his office. They were easy to assemble and just as pictured. Quality fabric you would find in a furniture store. The arms are a merlot cherry color and there were no marks on them. Pleased with our purchase.", 
    "Very comfortable. Easy assembly.", 
    "I bought this chair for my bedroom, to match my new modern d\u00e9cor. The chair arrived without damage, and was simple enough to put together without the need of any tool. This was a very good buy!", 
    "The color, fabric, comfort, & style are just what we expected. The recliner lays back perfectly to elevate your feet & legs after a long day. The chairs cushioning is right on. The only negative I'd give it is, I feel the arm height is a bit tall. It's the perfect piece for our master bedroom.", 
    "pros: neutral color options, classic design, easy to assemble, wide seat base, high back, easily accommodates larger/taller folks, light enough to maneuvercons: delivery difficult, box too wide for standard doorways", 
    "I made my final decision about the recliner after reading the reviews. They were accurate! Nice grey color, comfortable back support without being an oversized mega-recliner. Arrived on time and a breeze to assemble!", 
    "I bought this recliner because of its color and lumbar support. I like it so much my wife uses it more than I do. First come first serve, so to speak !", 
    "Very Comfortable and attractive chair", 
    "Great recliner - just as comfy as the ugly overstuffed recliners yet way more stylish! I could fall asleep in it!", 
    "Nice recliner. Arms wobble a little too much and one of the legs was missing its plastic part that helps it slide and keeps it from scratching the floor. Other than that it is a great chair", 
    "It looks grey on the picture and it's named charcoal so it would seem like it should be grey. It's just not. It's more of a brown/green color. It's fine for the room I'm using it in but I can't give it five stars. It is comfortable to sit in. I'm only 5'4\" so can't say how it would be for a taller person but I do like sitting in it.", 
    "Not the best made chair. Wouldn't recommend", 
    "I use this chair in a small home office, and it looks very nice, but I need to pull it out from the corner quite a distance to recline fully. It is not the most comfortable recliner, but it's OK for short naps :-)", 
    "Item arrived on time and is as described. Recliner was easy to put together. Recliners cloth seems to be of good material.", 
    "Comfy, easy to assemble. There was a mar in the wood on one of the arms, but was not done in shipping, as it was the same color as the rest of the wood.", 
    "Purchased this 3 years ago and still love it. One of my favorite on-line purchases! Looks good, not old fashioned or bulky like a lot of recliners. High back, easy to put together, very, very comfortable. Nice compromise between the husbands \"big ole favorite chair\" and a women's refusal to have one in the living room/dining areas. Fits with a more traditional/modern d\u00e9cor. Sturdy and just as nice as when I purchased it! I bought charcoal. Highly recommend.", 
    "This chair is so comfy and it looks really nice in my living room. We get compliments on it all the time!", 
    "It is comfy though...just too short for 6'1\". Can't stay in a full lounging position.Oh well", 
    "I ordered 2 of these for my living room. The chairs were easy to put together (just two pieces) but even though they were wrapped and padded BOTH chairs came with nicked and scratched arms out of the box and under the padding. Sending them back seemed like a nightmare and my new house is not in a secure enough location for packages to sit outside for long so I just am keeping them and using a pencil to fill in the nicks and scratches, but it is still pretty obvious that they were damaged. I can deal with it to an extent, but I am sure other people would be quite frustrated by that.That being said, the chairs are actually REALLY comfortable and everyone who has sat in them has remarked on how comfy they are. My husband loves that they can go almost fully horizontal. He has fallen asleep in them no problem.", 
    "I love these chairs classy looking", 
    "Good value, easy to assemble! true color", 
    "This is a very comfy chair while still looks fairly sleek for a recliner. Nice shade of grey and looks more expensive in person. The recliner portion was amazing, however due to my cat wanting to be underneath the recliner (and reading online how lethal the recliners can be for kittens/cats), I had husband zip tie the mechanism so we are not using it as a recliner any more.. even still, comfortable and a good purchase!", 
    "This was so easy to put together and it was the perfect size for our living room. It is very comfy to sit in and reclines perfectly.", 
    "Very bad Recliner. It is no good I bougth two of then., in less then 5 mounth it broke do not buy it .", 
    "It doesn't snap together properly. Then it does not unsnap so that you can try to correct it. The chair is a recliner. To recline you have to get out of the chair, reach under the chair and pull out the foot rest. I would have bought a different chair had I known the problems with this one.", 
    "I've been looking for ages for a recliner that was long enough that my feet didn't hang over the edge. Hurray! Finally found this one. It arrived a day early and was easy to put together (though I couldn't get the box through my front door--I just opened it and hauled the two pieces of the chair inside). The instruction sheet--that's another story. Page one was fine. Page two was incomprehensible. Could I volunteer to test read your instruction sheets before you send them out with the merchandise?There's a spare screw and nut that fell out on the floor, but I can't find where it might be missing from. Maybe it really is a spare? Who knows? The recliner piece was not \"tied\" in place, but the chair was packed so tightly it wouldn't have moved anyway. Final word? Great chair. Good addition to my living room. Very comfortable.", 
    "The chair is super comfy. And even my husband thinks so at 6'2\". It did come damaged on the arm. However, it was an easy process in getting a replacement chair sent out to us. And everyone loves the way they look!", 
    "This recliner came in two parts, which was very good because the doorway to the basement is 30\" w. The back snapped in with ease and the seating is comfortable.", 
    "I admit I purchased this based upon the reviews I read. It was a calculated choice and I am extremely sorry I did. It is not a solid piece of furniture. I realize it was not the most expensive chair but still, the quality is really lacking. It is \"wobbly\". Not well put together. I am disappointed that it is not as sturdy as other reviewers indicated. Would I recommend this???? NO", 
    "amazing comfortable chair and a good value!", 
    "I like this, and might even get another. The design is good for a small space yet the chair is plenty wide. It's good, but just not as good as my old, big brand recliner: a bit too much flex in the frame, and hard to get into and stay in the more reclined option.", 
    "Chair arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Seemed to be well packed (unlike some of the other reviews). Easy to assemble. Very comfortable. I am not convinced it will be super durable, but since it is in a reading nook it will not get a lot of hard wear so I think it will work for us. I love that the arms are wood and thus will not get dirty like upholstered chair arms. It is a perfect reading chair. Does not look like a bulky recliner yet allows you to prop your feet up easily. Since the back is not very high I do not think it would be the kind of recliner you could really nap/sleep in very well unless you were pretty short, but that is not what we wanted it for so it works for us. The seat is quite springy and I fear it will get saggy after a time but for now it looks great and we are very happy with it.", 
    "Love the chair. It fits perfectly in my small livingroom. My husband is 6 ft and still finds it comfortable.", 
    "Easy assembly. Just pop in the back. Color is more a dark taupe brown than charcoal but we love it. Husband could not be happier. Nap tested...husband approved.", 
    "The perfect chair!! My husband HAD to have a recliner and I hate the look of them, but this one was perfect. A very nice look, great design and comfortable!!", 
    "I am mad because every time I sit in this chair I fall asleep", 
    "We ordered this chair for a client. At first, it came chipped and Overstock replaced it right away. However, after just a few months the client let us know that the chair no longer worked properly. Great looking chair but not great quality.", 
    "so comfortable and we love them", 
    "Was looking for a smaller recliner, not the typical \"man-cave\" type of furniture. This fit the requirement. Very pleased with the look, particularly the bentwood arms which matched the style of other furniture in the room. Was a little hesitant to buy on line because of the assembly required, but it was very easy. The back is very lightweight and just slips on to the metal posts in the seat. No problem.", 
    "We like the color and the fabric (and I especially like the arms - won't get dirty like fabric will). However, there was slight damage to one leg during shipping (not enough to hassle with return but we did need to glue some wood \"splinters\" back on) and it's a bit wobbly. This would not be a problem if it could be tightened but since it comes pretty much assembled it's impossible to adjust. Despite this I'm still happy with the purchase. Very comfy! Kids and husband love it.", 
    "I love this chair and the price! It reclines, is comfy and perfect for our bedroom. Not a chair we use every day, but looks great and love the price!", 
    "These chairs look nice enough. They are wobbly though and the padding is squashed and soft already. They were cheap. You get what you pay for. If they last a year I will be surprised.", 
    "Bought for my husband! We didnt want a bulky old fashioned style, we are very pleased at the smaller size, modern look &comfort, especially for the affordable price! We liked it so much we bought another one for our vacation home in the mountains!", 
    "I was very pleased at how quickly it arrived. There were only 2 pieces to put together and it was simple to put together. It is a very nice addition to our living room and has become my favorite chair which I use daily.", 
    "I wanted a recliner that doesn't look like something my dad or grandpa would have in their house & this piece is modern, stylish & functional. I love the color gray but I couldn't find one in any local furniture stores, so I turned to Overstock.com. This was my first online furniture purchase & I was a bit leary because I couldn't try the furniture before purchasing it.There were two pieces (the back & the bottom) that fit together & viola! it was assembled. The only drawback is that I feel there needs to be more substantial cushioning in the seat part. It's comfortable but I'd like it to be a bit more firm. The fabric is the right shade of charcoal gray & has a bit of texture to it. When reclined completely, you are almost lying flat. It's a great chair that doesn't look like a bulky recliner & I believe it will last for many years.", 
    "Purchasing a chair site unseen was kind of scary for us. When the chair was delivered and assembled we were so glad we did. The quality is great, color perfect and easy to assemble. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "Nice sturdy chair for the price. Not as comfy as I would like, but that would make it cost a lot more.", 
    "I purchased 2 charcoal recliners for my husband's man cave. He loves them and so do I. They are really really comfortable and good looking. Delivery was fast and easy.", 
    "Saw a similar chair in a local warehouse store recently. Preferred the more neutral fabric of this chair. Initially concerned about build quality but figured out it is designed to sit on carpet to keep the arms stable. Added non-skid pads since it sits on a hardwood floor and the chair is very stable. I'm 6'2\" and find it very comfortable and supportive either reclined or sitting. As for durability, time will tell.", 
    "Got this for our new room in the basement. Disappointed with the quality of the foam and the fabric. I didn't remove from the box till after the room was completed and didn't realize the front leg was split. Couldn't return since it had been 3 months since purchased. I've decided I probably won't by furniture online in the future.", 
    "Bought this for my mom and she is very happy with it. Arrived packed well and it was easy to put together; only need to put the back on the seat.", 
    "OS customer service was great during return and exchange issues. Chairs look attractive in the room but I do not think the seat will remain reasonably firm with daily use. Otherwise the chair is comfortable.", 
    "My chair arrived in perfect condition, was easy to assemble and has the look I wanted. When reclined to the most extreme position, it tends to ease back up to the seated position. However, this has not been a serious problem and I still love the chair. I would buy another one just like it!", 
    "Great chairs firm but comfffy", 
    "Just as described, very comfortable.", 
    "Great chair for the price", 
    "Great chair for the price", 
    "The best purchase ever made--comfort PLUS, you will never want to leave this chair...both .husband and I around 5'6\", average weight. Immensely comfortable sitting and reclining. Beautiful lines, never guess it was a recliner. Arrived in perfect condition, one step assembly.", 
    "A little darker than viewed - purchased 2 and both colors are the same, fairly easy to recline - Good!", 
    "Chair is really graceful with its sweeping wooden arms. Firm support....great color that flatters the room. Unfortunately it does not \"fit\" my body so is not as comfortable as I had hoped.", 
    "The chair arrived on time and in pretty good shape. Although two of the feet protectors were knocked off in the box with a little ingenuity we were able to attach them back without too much trouble. Very comfortable and are thinking about ordering a second chair because we now have to share it between the both of us!!", 
    "This chair is comfortable and looks great in casual or formal settings. Nice open design wood sidearms and quality fabric covering the cushions.", 
    "Solid chair. Haven't used it enough to see how it \"naps\", but overall good project. Simple to put together (really does take much longer to unwrap the packaging/shipping material than it does to put chair together)", 
    "The chair arrived well-packaged with feet attached. There was no damage. One screw had fallen out but was in the box. My husband tightened all bolts to make sure nothing else was loose. The chair seat is the perfect height for me and I am learning how to manage to manual operation of the recliner. It is far easier that I thought it would be. The seat cushion is quite firm and very comfortable I did not want to rate it as Very Firm because that usually indicates - not comfortable. I am 5'4 and I finally have a recliner which allows me to elevate my swollen ankles to the propert height. I had searched out this style in several furniture stores and had a chance to sit on the style. This delivery actually was more comfortable than any that I had tried out. High Leg Recliners are perfect if you are not ready for a powerlift recliner. Thanks for the offering.", 
    "I really like this recliner. I love the style and color, and it was extremely easy to put together - just slide the back onto the frame. It's not quite as comfy as my old, more padded recliner, but it much more attractive. I may get another one.", 
    "This is a nice quality recliner for the price. I was unable to find anything similar in style or price locally----there were a few dents in the wood handles which I suspect happened in transit--the box was pretty beat up. However, the damage was very minor and does not detract from the overall look. I would definitely buy again and this purchase encouraged me to look at other Overstockitems", 
    "its a very good chair, i have 2 of them. they are great relax in too.", 
    "Outstanding chair, as described via the web site. Very easy no hassle assembly as well.", 
    "I had been looking for a recliner that was similar to one I saw in a hotel room. This fit the bill. After I ordered it it arrived in a timely fashion, the box was very ragged but the chair was fine. It was easy to put together, I did it at 7 months pregnant, and works well. The only thing I would say is that the arms scratch very easy. But for the price it is a great chair and will get a lot of use.", 
    "I wanted a recliner, but something on a smaller scale and this was perfect. I would not recommend this for someone tall but it is perfect for me. I'm only 5'1\" and it is just right. There was some minor assembly...Just a matter of lining up the back and pushing it in. It seems very sturdy and very comfortable. I worried that it might be hard to push the reclining portion in and out but it is not hard at all. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase!", 
    "I purchased this knowing that from previous comments that the chair might come damaged. Well, it did, not only on e, but twice. There were large deep scratches on the rear legs. It was not due to the packaging. It came that way from the manufacturer since the legs were covered in undisturbed plastic wrap, both times. I decided not to try it a third time and got my money back. Poor UPS driver!", 
    "We ordered 2 of these chairs because they don't look like a recliner. They are very comfortable and support your back. However, the wood arms arrived with some little dings/digs in them. We decided to keep the chairs anyway and allow them to get \"rustic\" with life and use. The fabric is nice and doesn't produce lint nor does it appear to collect lint. They were true to color and overall we are pleased with the chairs. I would recommend them to a friend.", 
    "I ordered 2 of these recliners for a sitting area in my bedroom. First chair came, a little damage on the lower front leg but I could live with it. The second chair arrived. It had damage on back corner of right arm and lower front. Called customer service on this one and they sent another chair. Chair #3 arrived. As soon as I saw the box, I knew there would be damage. Damage was on the right leg back and lower front. Call customer service, they sent out another replacement. Chair #4 arrived. The damage on this chair was even worse. The lower front left leg was completely broken off about 1\" of the leg. I called customer service again. During this conversation I expressed although the arms of the chairs were wrapped, etc. I still did not feel that the chair was packaged well enough to endure the shipping from warehouse to NC. I made a request that the replacement chair be inspected before it left the warehouse, more packaging and double-boxed. Overstock honored my request by putting double bubble wrap around the original box and then putting it in another box and marked the box \"fragile\". The chair arrived yesterday and was NOT damaged.:) I really like the style and the fabric. The color was exactly as pictured. Goes well in my bedroom. The bottom is a little hard but I am sure it will soften up with use. The chair is a good value for the money but not a chair that would hold up with an active family with children. Overstock customer service has been excellent. I would give 5 stars for their customer service. I would also recommend if you order these chairs or any chair that has wood that it be double wrapped and doubled boxed before shipping.", 
    "This is a great chair. However it's not A+ quality. It's very solid and works and looks great! I would recommend.", 
    "Nice wide and deep seat, a little higher than other chairs that makes it easier to get out of, good back support", 
    "The Chair is great. My 80 year old dad sits in it all the time. The color and style work great for my living room. Very easy to assemble. It came with a couple of small scratches on the wood arms that were easily covered with marker.The only problem was UPS delivered it and left it in the driveway on a rainy day. Since it takes 2 people to move it my dad pushed into the garage until we could transport it inside.", 
    "I previously purchased the same style of chair by a different manufacturer and must say that this one is the best. They incorporated an improved lumbar support as well as firmed up the seat, which is surprisingly comfy. Overall I am very pleased.", 
    "Nice and soft. Color was nice. fits right in the corner of my bedroom. I would like to see the orange version for accent piece. I'm 6ft 270lbs and its very sturdy", 
    "I am looking for a comfy chair to read and nap in my study. This chair fits the purpose. It came promptly but with some dents and it is extremely difficult to take the backrest out after you put it in. So it was impossible to move it into my study. Luckily, the outstanding Overstock customer service came to the rescue and sent me a replacement. This time I learnt the lesson, I move it in the room before putting the backrest in. Cannot be happier with the purchase. Although it is not the most posh product but it serves the purpose for an unbeatable price. With the diligent follow up from Overstock customer service, I am sure that I will source many more items from this site.", 
    "Excellent for the price,great feel,great looking,arrived without damage,simple to assemble,did it myself ,I'm a girl,hope it last for years to come.not as strong as my high-end furniture,but bought two of these chairs for family room in lower level,just two of us ,no kids ,so maybe they will last a long time I hope so love the style and the price.", 
    "The color and fabric are much better than I expected. While the cushion is firmer than I expected, it is still very comfortable. The size is perfect as I was looking for something modern that does not take up the whole room and it fits perfectly.", 
    "Received the chairs about two weeks ago and are very happy with them. They were easily put together and are very comfortable. Time will tell how they will hold up. We like the color and the feel of the material. It was great shopping online, because there were many choices all in one spot and the reviews help us make a decision. I do believe we will use overstock again.", 
    "The recliner was larger and plusher than I was expecting. The lines of the chair are beautiful. I sold furniture for 20 years and always thought that recliners were ugly. Now in my late 60's, I felt that being able to recline had become a necessity. Very happy with this chair", 
    "It looks like a recliner at one of the expensive brands yet it was inexpensive, so easy to set up and very comfortable. I'm very happy with this purchase from Overstock!", 
    "its a big chair and in shipping the wood arms are not protected enough they came in damage. it would be a big hassle to return i did buy 2 and they very comfrtable", 
    "This chair came well packed. It is easy to assemble - all you have to do is slide the back onto the seat area - no screws. It was heavier than I expected and needed to have a friend help me get the 2 pieces out of the box. It is sturdy and comfortable - soft enough but definitely not squooshy. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is because the back of the arms are not flush with the chair the way it looks in the picture. There are 2 unsightly holes on each side under the rear of the arm rests where screws have been put in to hold the chair pieces together. They aren't visible from the front, but are visible from the side. I will get some black plastic plugs to cover the holes but this is something that should be addressed by quality control at the manufacturer. I like the color but wish it was available in other colors as well.", 
    "Great recliner for people who actually use their furniture and don't buy pieces just for looks. I got two, one for each teenage boy. They wear great and are very comfortable. There were a couple of scratches from shipping but nothing remarkable or worth returning them for.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful and inexpensive. I saw similar chairs in a furniture store locally for twice the price and not as comfortable. The color is very true to the photo. The recliner mechanism to th flat position requires that you wiggle your butt down past the center of gravity or it puts you back up in the seated reclined position. This doesn't bother me because I don't want to lay down in it. The accomodate both me at 5'6\" and my 6'3\" boyfriend as well. I usually hate the style of recliners but these are so stylish. Lots of compliments. Fabric feels very rich. Wood arms scratch easily, but keep a sharpy handy and they are easily covered. Happy with these overstock purchases. Bought two!", 
    "I bought a second chair after trying out my first one. I'm very satisfied with the comfort, style and price of these chairs.", 
    "My whole family loves these recliners. No one wants to sit on the couch anymore. They are very comfortable, firm but not too hard. They were easy to put together and arrived as scheduled, undamaged.", 
    "The chairs came quickly and were very easy to assemble. They came in only two pieces and actually took longer to remove the protective packaging then it did to put them together. They are definitely more poofy than others I had seen, but a great value. I ordered the charcoal and it is almost a corduroy fabric. I would order again if needed!", 
    "LOVED THE CHAIRS BUT THEY DIDN'T COME WITH THE ASSEMBLY KIT. QUITE A HASSLE TO SEND BACK GIVEN THAT ALL I NEEDED WAS THE KIT TO PUT THEM TOGETHER. CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THERE WAS NO KIT, AND THEY COULDN'T HELP ME. THEY LOST A LOT OF MONEY OVER JUST A FEW SCREWS AND A METAL PLATE. VERY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE. HAD TO SEND THEM BACK", 
    "Seemed very firm at first...wasn't to sure it would be that comfortable of a chair. Very happy so say after months of owning them..bought two...they are very comfortable and nothing to complain about. Easy to put together..just slide and click the top on and that is it, ready to recline and enjoy. The fabric is great and so is the quality", 
    "Great recliner !! but the packing sucks chair was damaged.", 
    "Very comfortable chair and avoids the puffy, bloated look of most recliners (though it's not quite as sleek looking as in the photo--the back cushion does give away its recliner roots, but on the upside that's why it's so comfortable). My only small disappointment is that the chair is much more brown-toned than gray. It's a pleasant brownish color, but if you're looking for a pure gray, look elsewhere. I'm fine with the color, I just wish it was more like in the photo.", 
    "I get a lot of sleep in it when I have trouble sleeping in bed dut leg problrms,", 
    "This recliner was purchased as a gift for a person with a lower back problem. A relative who had previously had back surgery purchased the same recliner to have a comfortable chair to possibly even sleep in post surgery. Both have been impressed with the comfort and lumbar support that this chair gives. The mechanics of the chair work well, and it is a chair that is not oversized like many recliners.", 
    "Chairs are comfortable for the whole family. One 6'2\", one 6', and one 5'2\". Arrived faster than I thought .Easy to assemble, and look very cosmopolitan.", 
    "I'm very pleased within this recliner. Years ago I had the same style from **** which cost 3x as much. Loved it but moved and sold it! Found this and for the price nearly identical. Mine is a true charcoal in color and functions well. It's a lovely compact contemporary recliner! Arrived within a week no damage! Easy to assemble .. 5 minutes and alone!", 
    "Purchased 2 of these chairs to flank my fireplace. My husband and sons are 6 feet plus tall. The chairs are comfortable, high enough backs and chair is a perfect height. Modern feel, wooden arms feel and look great - very dark wood just like picture. These compare to many chairs we looked at for twice the money. My husband at 6'3\" - athletic 230lbs LOVES these Chairs!!! \"They feel great on my back\"", 
    "Was packed in box in 2 pieces very well...No damage at all. It took a few minutes to put the back on and mechanism works well,,,No handle required..just lean back. This chair is a bit higher that my other plush recliner bit I like it and am getting use to it.", 
    "If wish my son would get out of it so that I can enjoy it too!! What can I do? I usually when until he goes to the bathroom to sneak a little cozy comfort. It is very comfy and looks great!", 
    "After scouring the internet looking for a recliner that didn't look a seat out of a Winnobago I found this. I was hesitant about this purchase but upon arrival I was actually quite impressed and it fits in very well with my decor. As far as comfort goes, my partner will not stay off it long enough for me to test it out so I assume that it's good.", 
    "It's hard to believe how little this chair cost. Was a cinch to put together, and it's now the favorite chair in the room. The fabric seems sturdy. The stitching is fine. The recliner function operates smoothly. Very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I purchased two of thse recliners. They are an excellent buy and are very comfortable.", 
    "I have been looking at thes chairs for quite some time. I liked that it is not one of those bulky chairs, it reclines and is very comfortable. When I purchased it, I was not sure about the fabric because it looked liked linen weave online, but when I got it, I was very happy to see that the fabric was what I was looking for. I has that fuzzy easy to clean fabric. I really love it. It feels just like the ones at ***. I wish they came in more colors too.", 
    "Again, pretty to look at but the sturdiness of the chair leaves something to be desired.", 
    "I love my new chair! I was a little hesitant because of reports that the chair was small, but since I'm only five two i figured I'd give it a try. Well, I love it! It isn't small at all. In fact, quite the opposite! It's comfortable, beautiful, and very expensive looking. Buy this chair!!", 
    "See above quality. Chair will be returned and I will ask for a replacement or a refund.", 
    "I wanted a recliner that didn't have the \"overstuffed\" look! This recliner is perfect. It looks like a regular chair and reclines comfortably. The price was a great added feature.", 
    "This chair is great, we have had it for a couple of weeks now and it seems very durable. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great chair at a reasonable price.", 
    "We put the back on the chair and then it didn't come off again as it had instructed it would. We had to order a second chair. We now can't get the broken chair out of our house and it's damage but won't fit through the front door. The stitching is coming off the first chair. The replacement chair is perfect and comfortable but the arms on both chairs are not strong and really wobbly. Way too much money for the quality of the product.", 
    "disappointed that chairs were made in China, arm damaged, screw plugs not supplied with chairs , which means that screw heads are exposed", 
    "Very well packaged, arrived damage free! I love this chair. It's comfortable and well made. Well worth the money.", 
    "The recliners are very comfortable and easy to put together. We bought two and it's actually a little bigger than what we had anticipated when it is reclined, but overall the chair is very comfortable and looks great. It's not bulky at all, which I really like. The quality of the chair is also great, looks like it's going to be very durable as well.", 
    "The chair was not well constructed. The chair was larger than expected and quite uncomfortable. There was a lot going on in my life when the chair arrived, and if less happening I would have returned it. The chair is uncomfortable while sitting or reclining. I thought it was much like a chair I had seen and sat in at several furniture stores but it was not.", 
    "The chair has a great color and it is comfortable. Love it!", 
    "This chair is beautiful and very comfy. A nice and petit addition to our living room. It reclines easily and seems well made!", 
    "This is a comfortable and attractive recliner. The fabric color looks very charcoal to me. I don't see the brown tones that some have mentioned, and there is no blue cast to it either. The arms are almost black. The seat is higher from the ground than I expected (I am 5'2\" - feet don't touch the floor) but that hasn't been a problem since the first reclining position is great for reading and tv watching. It was poorly packed for shipping (box was torn and dented, not enough cushioning for the legs) and arrived with a couple of small nicks in the legs, which I covered using a marker. It arrived in 2 pieces which are heavy and bulky -- hard to get out of the box. I am not sure that I could have unpacked it alone. Fortunately, help arrived, and the two of us small females had no problem moving the pieces into the house and through a narrow doorway. Assembly was super easy -- just slide the back on. I have now spent many comfortable hours in this chair.", 
    "I love how comfortable this chair is. I'll spend most evenings watching a little TV or surfing the net on my laptop in this chair. The only downside after several months is that the wooden arms' finish chips easily. It certainly doesn't look new any longer with all of the little dings it has received from daily wear.", 
    "This is a great recliner for the price and works perfect in the space we wanted it for. I also purchased my rug and bedspread set on Overstock and it looks great paired with a more expensive bedroom set where we splurged. I am really happy with this purchase.", 
    "I purchased this recliner about a month ago and I love it. It's one of the most comfortable chairs to sit in. It was shipped in a huge box, comes in 2 pieces, and was EXTREMELY well packaged. It took forever to get the thing out of all the styrofoam, and plastic - but I'm not complaining! There wasn't one scratch, or one thread out of place on this chair. You just pop the back onto the seat of the chair and it's ready to go. There is a velcro strap to keep the foot rest in place, but mine wasn't strapped down. There are 2 reclining positions, one where you are sitting up more, relaxed, and another where you're reclined all the way back, sleeping. I am impressed by how easily and smoothly the chair reclines. The arms are a deep expresso color and the gray fabric does have a slight brownish undertone - but I think the swatch on the website really does represent the color accurately. Overall, very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I needed a smaller, more modern looking recliner for our family room. This chair fit the bill. It was easy to put together and works smoothly. Being as it is smaller in scale, a very tall person might not be comfortable in it. I am 5'6 and my husband is 5'10 and we both are very comfortable in this chair. The nice surprise was how far back the chair goes. You can almost get into a horizontal position. It is not top quality, but is a great alternative to the high priced recliners at furniture stores. I am very happy with it.", 
    "Unlike other reviews, my recliner arrived in perfect condition. Easy to assemble. Color and style exactly as described. I love this recliner and would recommend that you get one too!", 
    "Love the chair!! Looks elegant and expensive! Little assembly required. I still can't believe I got it at this price!", 
    "i love the chair but very dissappointed. the color is way off from my couch i ordered from yall. i tried to match it in the picture and it look good in the picture but not happy at all with this one. really the chair is awesome but color is an issue and im not good at returning things in the mail really, since its this big. i dont know what to do.", 
    "The color was not even close to what I expected. The picture had a blue hue to it...these chairs are more brown. Thankfully I am redoing entire living room and I can accommodate this base color. Now I must leave to nap in my new chair! ;-)", 
    "bought this for my husband who wanted to have his own chair in our living room. It was hard to find recliner that is a bit modern, not too chunky yet can hold a taller/bigger guy. I was thankful for all the other reviews that described the chair. very sturdy, comfortable. not too heavy or chunky for our living room, it doesn't take much space. the only comment I have to say is that the gray/charcoal is a bit darker that the picture.", 
    "The chair arrived quickly. It was packed well and there was no damage. I *really* like the looks of the chair and it fits well with my warm modern decor. My dad is very comfortable in the chair (he fell asleep in recline mode) and he weighs 300 lbs and is 5'11\". Boyfriend who weighs 180 lbs and is 6' also found it comfortable. I like the firmness and comfort. This is a great deal.", 
    "Love this piece. Looks great with any decore. The wooden arms are a bit easy to scratch so be careful when unpacking. Any scratch is easily filled with colored shoe wax.", 
    "Got the chair for my elderly mother. She said it is super comfortable, and easy to recline. Sometimes recliners are difficult to push open, but she has no trouble. Size is great to fit into her bedroom", 
    "This chair is great for the price. I fit in it comfortably (5'6\") my boyfriend who is 6' thinks it is a little small in terms of reclining and being comfortable in it. In general though it is really cute and seems well made. I have had it over a year and have zero complaints!", 
    "chair is bigger than imagined and I cannot get it in and out of my house without dismantling it.", 
    "Nice size for a women. This chair replaced my husband's recliner which was quite large and intended for a large body. I do wish the back was a bit higher as when reclined the head hasn't much support. Overall I really like the looks and feel.", 
    "Love these chairs. Color and description were both excellent. Easy to put together andd clean. I'm 6' and it is quite comfortable. Only downside was that I got two chairs - both came with slight damage to the rear right leg (chips) with the shipping boxes in horrible condition. Got a ($***) refund from O.Co so it almost made up for the annoying hassle of getting a furniture pen to color in the areas. The recline mechanism is smooth, but I don't this this will last more than a few years (which is fine, because I'm sure I'll want to redecorate by then). If you want a chair to last super long time, this is probably not the right chair", 
    "This recliner is a perfect size and style. It goes with most any color scheme and style of other furniture in the room. It is comfortable and high and long enough for a 5'6\" tall person to recline comfortably. The only thing was the packaging as the other reviewers stated. It came slightly damaged but Overstock has very fair customer service and they worked with me. Perfect addition to my living room", 
    "My husband ordered these without my input, so I was a little apprehensive about What we were getting. They are very attractive and good quality. Our 18 year old thought they were really cool. They are good solid chairs and very stylish and comfortable. The arm wood is almost black with a little bit of brown stain at the edges. The fabric is comfortable to sit on and the recliners operate smoothly.", 
    "This chair is quite comfortable and looks sharp. The quality is decent for the price.", 
    "Great chair for our Livingroom, nice dark grey color, and very comfortable. Recommend if you want great chair at a fantastic price.", 
    "After three short months the chair is broken....no heavy use as it is a part time place. Not having too much luck with the products I have purchased.", 
    "The carton was completely ripped when it was delivered. Fortunately, the arms and other wood parts of the chair were wrapped well and didn't get scratched or damaged. The nuts came off the bolts on the underside of the chair and were lost. We still need to find the correct size replacements, which is a hassle. I think the chair is comfortable and small enough to fit in the corner of our bedroom. My husband, however, sat in the chair last night and tried to shift around to get comfortable when the top part of the chair came apart from the bottom. He thought he broke it. Fortunately, I was able to lift the top piece off and re-position it properly. If you are looking for a chair that will be used constantly, I might not recommend this one. But for our purposes, it should work just fine.", 
    "This is a awesome chair! Well made, easy to put together and very comfortable!!", 
    "I was looking for a smaller sized recliner for my living room which has been converted to bedroom/office/den space for my father who has come to live with my family. I wanted a recliner that was compact but still suitable for someone 5\"10\" 180lbs. This chair is the perfect size and very comfortable. The price was more affordable than chairs from local department stores.", 
    "It has been very frustrating in trying to get this recliner into my home. I ordered one, but at 86 lbs., it came completely damaged, with the box torn up and bad scratches on the legs and elsewhere. Overstock.com shipped me another but that too came damaged, not only in the legs but cracks in the arms. It's been 15 days and counting, and the broken chairs are still sitting in my home. I feel like I'm speaking to a recorded message everytime I call Overstock, with each customer care representative offering to replace it. All I want is to get the junk out of my house. And I fear my co-op board will fine me for clogging up the mailroom with heavy packages for weeks on end. All I say to New Yorkers is beware when you order furniture -- it may be too heavy to get shipped properly and you may be sitting there waiting weeks for it to be picked. up.", 
    "I ordered three recliners one had to be sent back for damage. The other two were find. No problems getting a replacement. I am 6 feet 1 inch and find the seat back a little short but it works fine for the TV room.", 
    "Bought it for our home away from home, and there's always somebody sitting it. Might have to get another one.", 
    "comfortable chair, good looking, packed well, easy to put together, a few scratches on one arm but under the finish so done in factory not shipping...packed well..getting lots of compliments on the chairs", 
    "It is an excelent second or occasional chair, one that has he ability to match your own recliner and not eat the room up doing it.I like it so well that I'm puting one in my guest cottage for company to use.", 
    "I would never buy another piece of furniture again of this poor quality. Both chairs were received damaged & one of the replacement chairs was damaged. A MAJOR pain to return. Overstock does not pick up the damaged merchandise. I had to buy oversized shipping materials to return all the damaged merchandise.", 
    "One of the worse purchases I've ever made. The box looked liked it had been thrown from more than one truck when it arrived. As I stated earlier, one of the legs was broken with a missing piece and within a week the paint is wearing off the arms.", 
    "This chair is so comfortable; we love it. It is a great recliner without looking like a big bulky recliner. The fabric is great as well as the color.", 
    "Very easy to assemble and was delivered in three days.", 
    "I received this chair it was easy tp assemble but the bsck legs on the bottom wwere scratch and there were know scratch pads on the back legs and i had the chair about two week and the screws on the leg rest 3 fell out just put them back in..i don't know how long this chr going to last...but I'm big guy and the chair is very comfortable.", 
    "This chair was delivered promptly by UPS. The box would not fit through my front door so the UPS man brought it to my garage and helped me unwrap it. Once it was unwrapped I was able to get it though the kitchen door from the garage. The quality of the chair far exceeds the price. Color was as expected. I bought this for my husband who is still breaking it in. To recline you push back and it still required a lot of effort and strength to do that. My husband is under 6 feet but the foot rest still isn't long enough for him once the chair is reclined. It is a good chair considering how inexpensive it was.", 
    "Exactly what I wanted--a small recliner with firm cushions and wooden arms. The chair is placed in a narrow spot and fits to full recline position. The chair is easy to get up from. I was very concerned because of hip problems I can not get out of soft recliners. The color perfectly blends with my other colors of taupe, purple, black and white. Easy to clean cat fur off.", 
    "Nice Chair. Great color. Very comfortable. Worried about the wood arms poking my sides but not an issue. Wide enough. Reclines easily. Two positions. Legs up and all the way flat almost. Came in two pcs - everything packed well. Came UPS. I love it. Great deal.", 
    "Received 2 of these recliners yesterday, one was a mess in the box (It was fine though). We like them so far, tall seating which is nice. They are NOT wall huggers while using the recliner portion. I will definately be scotch guarding them too. There was no real description of the color of the arms except through reviews, I was hoping they would be a dark stained color but they are in fact black. Very easy to put together, that was nice. Only one problem with one of them so far, when they packaged them (which they did a GOOD job) someone got tape on the underside of the front of an arm, so now I'll have to try and scrub it off without hurting the finish on the wood. Oh and some minor surface scratches on the sides of the arms. I think they will be a nice addition to the family room :)", 
    "In my opinion, this is an outstanding buy! The quality of the chair is excellent, and the comfortable back gives great lumbar support. It took all of two seconds to put the back rest on the chair. There were no defects whatsover even though the shipping box was really beat up. I would recommend this chair to anyone who wants comfortable seating that will take up less space than a dated traditional recliner. You won't be disappointed! Description, color and product information are all accurate.", 
    "This recliner extends fully and has great support. I wanted a recliner that didn't take up a lot of room. It looks nice and isn't bulky-looking. The mechanism works smoothly and I feel I got exceptional value for the price.", 
    "This was a great solution for our living room, a recliner that doesn't look like one!", 
    "This Riverside Charcoal Recliner is my first recliner so I didn't really know what to expect, but so far I'm pleased. The fabric is a kind of brushed corduroy (plan to cover it with something washable if you have pets who shed) which was unexpected\u0097the photo on site doesn't really show the texture--but very nice. Bentwood arms and the legs on this chair are enameled black and smooth textured. Recliner does extend to about 60 inches when pushed back; this chair does not have a lever for reclining, which is a little dicey sometimes (really have to brace yourself and push). It was easy to put together; the top snaps into metal brackets on the bottom. The back has a skirt with a velcro attachment to cover the space where the brackets are. It is very comfy, although when reclined I do notice the edge of the seat through the padding and it presses into your legs if you sit in the same position for too long, which is a drawback. When it folds up, the footrest folds under the seat, and it's compact enough that it folded right past a cat who happened to be sleeping under there at the time without disturbing him. I bought this for a very small office space where I study, so I needed something that was comfy enough to read in for an hour or more but that didn't take up too much room, and this fits the bill. The one major drawback, as others have said, is the packaging; the box was huge and wouldn't fit through the outer door of a sunporch, so I had to strip the box, styrofoam padding, and tape in a hurry in a light rain, and bring in the pieces one at a time. The packaging broke up (styrofoam bits everywhere) and the box was damaged but luckily the chair was fine.", 
    "I hate recliners but I love this one and so do all our visitors. My only regret with this purchase is that I didn't buy 2.", 
    "It's a little too soon to give a true review, but from the looks of the chair and the comfortability of the chair, I'd say this is a very good purchase for the price. Very easy to put together. Nice and comfortable. Maybe I'll buy another one. Thanks,", 
    "Received the 3 chairs yesterday & put one together in 15mns. The arms are attached to seat; that section slides out of the box without any lifting. The back is light weight & slides & snaps into place in one movement. A fabric flap with Velcro covers the lower back of the seat. The last operation is to remove a nicely finished strap that lets you use the reclining functon. I plan on using these as chairs % keeping the reclining feature my little secret! Very,very happy!", 
    "MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE IT!!!!...FABRIC VERY SOFT ANS STAY VEY CLEAN.", 
    "Great chair for under $300! The chair is comfortable and assembly was super easy. Let me not forget, delivered on time! This was my first Overstock furniture purchase and it met my expectations 100%.", 
    "I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I bought two of these recliners for the price of one recliner at most retail stores. They are comfortable and both of the taller boys in my house fit in them with no problems! I wish the back was a little taller, but that is minor. Overall I highly recommend this purchase.", 
    "The seat had a slant higher on right than left,very uncomfortable chair would not stay in recline position", 
    "I was so pleased that the chair came in just two sections. It took all of five minutes to have my chair in place. As I have problems with my lower back I was happy that there was good lumbar support. I have no problem with adjusting the chair to reclining position, or bringing it back to its upright state. The color and fabric are pleasing and sturdy--perfect for TV viewing or reading. It is difficult to keep my husband out of it--but this is MY Chair!", 
    "We love these chairs! They look awesome in our home and they are very comfortable as well. I am very pleased with this purchase and wish I had gotten 4 of these instead mixing these with another 2 we purchased.", 
    "This recliner chair is sleek/modern and very comfortable. I was a little concern for the gray color but it is rich looking with a hue of brown. It was very easy to put together (make sure you align both brackets before pressing down). I have it on a bamboo wooden floor and it does not slide around at all even when reclining. Everyone loves the chair. For the price, this chair deserve a 5 star.", 
    "I have purchased many items from Overstock and been very please each time. This is chair is the best. It is attractive, not bulky and very comfortable. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a medium size recliner which is more attractive then most. Joann R.", 
    "since I've ordered two others in other colors, I'm pleased with the recliner. It's my personal favorite, I'm happy with the scale of the chair. It is not large, it's trim, sturdy, but doesn't look bulky. Ideal for smaller rooms and limited spaces. I recommend it with no reservations.", 
    "I purchased two of these chairs because I already had the same model, purchased elsewhere, in a different fabric. These chairs did not disappoint. They were very well packed, and fit together easily (only two pieces to \"assemble\"). Comfortable, contemporary, and classy.", 
    "This is a great comfy chair! It is easy to recline. The only con was that the wood on the arms of our chair in the back were scratched. Overstock was great! They sent us a new chair. I would buy this chair again!", 
    "Seems to be of good quality. Hopefully, it will hold up well. There were a couple of scratches on the wooden arms, not enough to return it. Sits comfortably.", 
    "I bought 2 and my family and friends love them. They fight over who gets to sit in them.", 
    "We really like this chair, but the back is not tall enough. I'm 5'6\" and my head rests only partially on the back. My husband who is 6'1'' is too tall and his head has no where to rest. The color is a brown grey as described by others. Very easy to put together. One other item to note, when the chair is reclined a piece on the back of the chair comes out and pushes out a flap. Not attractive to look at from the side.", 
    "I was a little concerned about ordering this chair based on some of the reviews citing damage upon arrival. Not the case for me: the box was a bit dinged, but the chair pieces (there are two) were well protected with bubble wrap, cardboard and styrofoam. Assembly was a piece of cake (even for a girl, :)-- the back slides into two brackets on the seat portion and the recliner component is activated by removal of a velcro strap. It took me longer to unpack the chair than it did to assemble! As for as the chair itself: absolutely gorgeous! I bought it to create a sitting area in my bedroom, and it's perfect! It's neutral color and simplicity of design are elegant and the wood arms are substantial without adding bulk. Colorwise, the arms are closer to black than cherry (I was thrilled by that-- perfect with my color scheme). The fabric is soft--almost velour like-- although the swatch presented looks more like denim or canvas. I would highly recommend the chair-- great value for the money and delivery was better than expected (about one week).", 
    "This recliner is very good looking, not overly bulky like most others tend to be. It is a bit difficult to right oneself from the reclining position, not terrible, just a bit difficult. Otherwise, it fits nicely into a room without overpowering it. It appears well built and solid.", 
    "the chair is easy to put together, sturdy and comfortable. the packaging is flimsy but it was delivered very quickly.", 
    "nice chairs and very comfortable.well made and what I like the most they are so easy to get out of.20\" from floor to seat is a great highth for me to get out of. would buy from Overstock again to get the deals.shipping was fast the packing on the chairs was good,although one box had some damage but no harm done to the chair.Had a great experince for first timer.", 
    "We wanted a recliner that was not super stuffed looking. Something stylish and this chair delivered. Very pleased.", 
    "I purchased two chairs and the delivery was quick; within three days. Although I could not put the chairs together myself, my husband was able to put them together within minutes. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and sprayed Scotchguard on the chairs to protect them against stains. The best advice I used. These chairs are very comfortable and fit very well within my sitting room that we watch television in. Very good buy and would recommend to anyone purchasing one or more.", 
    "I replaced a small size recliner with the riverside charcoal recliner. the color perfectly matches my 2 new couches! my husband is very happy with HIS new chair!!! It arrived very quickly,too.", 
    "The chair arrived timely. There was no damage to the shipping container. It is very easy to assemble, just remember to remove the strap under the chair so it will recline. It actually took me longer to get it out of the box and discard the shipping material. I am very happy with the chair", 
    "It's not fancy (made in China of course), but it does what it says. I like the gray \"skin\" and \"tusks\".", 
    "I am so pleased with my recliner. Arrived on schedule and packed to insure no damage to wooden arms..Very well constructed and easy to assemble even for an older person like myself.", 
    "It arrived - I easily put it together - and it has been great. It looks good, is very comfortable, good quality microfiber, and the wood is plainly beautiful. This is a daily used chair, that does not take up a lot of space when reclined, and it took care of all the back pain my husband had from the chair we had. Comfortable, practical, and lovely - all at a reasonable price.", 
    "I ordered this chair based on the product picture/description and the positive reviews by other overstock shoppers. I want to add another great review. This chair is extraordinary for the price and I was relieved that the shipping/packaging was perfect (the chair back is a separate piece, and the entire chair came securely packed in a box with styrofoam and corrogated cardboard). The upholstery is of a very nice quality, and Its compact size and push-back recliner feature is perfect for the bedroom sitting area location in my home.", 
    "This chair is exactly what we were looking for. My father needed a chair that he could put his feet on the floor while sitting in and also when wanting to go to sleep he could lay back and be very comfortable", 
    "Nice small chair that fits my narrow living room pretty well, dark enough gray to hide black dog hair. Does have a blue-to-green undertone, kind of hard to describe, but those are the two main colors in my living room so it works. It has the modern lines I prefer, and the seat is comfortable and soft yet is high enough for me to get up with my bad knees. The solid arms also help with that. I am a big person but I fit in this just fine - a good reading chair for me.", 
    "I love this chair! It is beautiful and very comfortable. It did come with a chipped leg so I gave it 4 stars. Overstock offered a partial refund since this color was already out of stock so I decided to keep it.", 
    "I like the fact that the chair arrived in only 2 pieces. Very easy to assemble. The chair arrived with minor digs on the the arms but nothing so dramatic that it had to be returned. Overall I am very pleased with this chair.", 
    "I love this chair!! I love that it does not look like the traditional recliner. My BF loved it... May have to order another one so I can sit in it", 
    "For the price, you can't beat this. I wanted something that would \"slide\" back instead of the usual lever pull and this fits the bill. I love the design and it doesn't take up as much room as the traditional recliner does. Great for smaller areas.", 
    "This was my first time ordering furniture on line. I'm very pleased with this chair the quality and look. Now I'm looking for an end table from overstocked on line!", 
    "Nice chair for office or family room. Very comfortable for reading.", 
    "The chair seems to be close to what the site said it was. Shipping was quick and the chaie was easy to put together", 
    "I received the chair within a few days. It was simple to set up and really dresses up my bedroom. The seat cushion was a lot cushier than I expected! Very nice to sit in, and the reclining position works well. I'm very glad I got this chair.", 
    "packed securely and padded well...no tools needed to assemble...a foot of space is needed behind the chair in order to fully recline...modern wooden arms are up-to-date...the seat is high enough and comfortable", 
    "Overall, happy with this chair, really needed a recliner. Fair price and great design.", 
    "This chair arrived very quickly in great condition. It is extremely comfortable. I would highly recommend it!", 
    "Very pleased with chairs. They are comfortable and have a very modern look.", 
    "Color fits in with my decorating and the chair is comfortable!", 
    "We liked the chair, but would not have paid this price for something in this condition. Our interaction with customer service started positively, but ended in a fizzle. The interaction with customer service will probably deter us from ordering from Overstock again.", 
    "When this chair came, I started to unpack it in the garage, I opened the top of the box saw the color, and sealed it back up, and returned it. The style of the chair is great, but the color is not!", 
    "The chair arrived really quickly and was very easy to assemble. I did it myself in about 10 minutes. It looks great, much better than the usual clunky recliners. The only complaint I have is that my boyfriend says it's a little too short for him, his head sticks out the back of the recliner. I think this can be fixed by adding a cushion under your head, but it may not be the best for recliner for taller people.", 
    "I needed a smaller recliner since I am short on space and really didn't want a \"recliner\" looking chair. This does the job beautifully. Very comfortable and good looking both.", 
    "Very easy to put together and took me all of 5 minutes. The chair arm had two small dents, which were touched up. Don't even notice anymore. The chair is very solid, material very rich looking and soft, and is incredibly comfortable. My husband, who is 6'1\" found it to be very comfortable, as well. Moves into reclining position very easily. Very nice looking and have it also be a recliner is a bargain.", 
    "Recliner does not have handle to put back and forth. Therefore I believe it is a good chair for adults - but not children", 
    "The chairs were easy to assemble and for recliners, they are very light weight. I found the seats a little hard at first but after sitting in them they are softening up a bit. I like the modern style and they don't take up much space in the small room I have them. I have two chairs sitting next to each other and it takes up less space than the small hide a bed that was in that space. For an inexpensive piece of furniture I think this is well made.", 
    "You will love this chair - it is exactly like the chair at an expensive furniture retailer. When you pay 300 bucks, you cannot compare its quality to the one that costs 5 times more. The color is great, the style is perfect, and it is extremely comfortable. The recliner is such a nice addition to my informal living space. If you have been debating purchasing this, just do it already!", 
    "I saw a similar chair to this at a furniture store and found it to be very comfortable and functional; however, the ones in the store all had ugly patterns that didn't go with anything in my room. I found this one after doing some searching and it fit the bill. Thanks to other reviews, I knew the arms would look black (they are actually a very dark brown) It seems like the cushion and fabric will wear quicker than some higher quality furniture, but for the price, I think it was well worth the money.", 
    "I still have it and when peole comer over to visit they like it is comforble and is made good I would buy another one but room is to small but as soon I have my basement fix I am going to buy more", 
    "Was looking for a recliner for a vacation home but did not want the overstuffed traditional style. This is perfect. It's the chair everyone sits, reclines or naps in. So much so, I have considered buying two more for my personal residence.", 
    "I am very happy with my purchase of this recliner. Fits very well with my modern living room. It's long in the seat which maybe a problem for some, but works for me. If your under 5ft. 6 in. would not be the chair for you. The wide arms are another plus.", 
    "I have advanced osteo arthritis, and it is hard for me to get up from a standard heighth recliner. This reclinre's arm rest are 26\" high and gives me enought extra that I can get up easily. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. I am also well pleased with my dealings with Overstock.com Dave T.", 
    "My old bulky recliner had died and I wanted one to take up less space in my small living room, while still giving me my after-work relaxation. This arrived in two pieces and easily slid into place. When I sat in it, it felt bouncy, comfortable, but different from the old one. I can sit up comfortably in this chair, unlike my old one that always tilted backward sitting up. In fact, many people do not know it is a recliner. But I do! Feels nice relaxing and easily goes up and down. My room is more modern and feels roomier. I do love this chair.", 
    "This recliner is just perfect for me. It has a small profile and footprint, but reclines almost all the way flat. It is extremely comfortable and wears well. I am 100% pleased with this purchase.", 
    "We purchased 2 of these chairs for our living room and they have been great so far. My husband and I are on the taller side and we struggled to find chairs that both fit our budget and our long legs. These fit the bill. They look great in our living room and are the perfect chair to enjoy a cup of coffee and read the newspaper in the morning. Highly recommend.", 
    "very comfortable except the back could be 4\" higher for better head support when fully reclined", 
    "Chair is just as advertised. Very comfortable, firm yet very plush. Also, like that it is wider seat, very roomy. Delivery was very fast and packed very well. Great chair for the value.", 
    "On time delivery and easy set-up. The chair is comfortable and the recliner mechanism is smooth and easy.", 
    "this chair is good for the price, I wish it was not made in china. but the u.s.a. This chair will be used by my 85 year old mother ,and the high wood arms will be helpful to her getting in & out of it. the seat and back give pretty good support. thanks john", 
    "Another great deal from Overstock! I love this recliner, and I love that I got it at a great price. The modern lines work perfectly with my home, and the comfort and quality of that chair are good. When I have more space, I will definitely get another one. If you are looking for a modern, comfortable recliner in grey, this is it.", 
    "The chair was left outside my door. Assembly was very easy. A chunk of wood was damaged on the backside of one of the arms. Since it wasnt noticable from the front, I decided to keep it. The chair is short on the back, so if you want a chair that you can lay your head back on, this is not it. However, its comfortable, and very modern. Its smaller in scale than most recliners so it fits well in a smaller room.", 
    "I noted the seat height of this recliner, and purchased two for elderly parents. They are perfect. Easy to get out of, easy to recline in, and look much more expensive than they were. I purchased on Tuesday, and they were received, assembled and in use by Friday. Would highly recommend.", 
    "Bought this for my cottage. Needed something for a small space and it works perfectly. It does need to be pulled away from the wall to fully recline. It isn't real long-my feet DO hang off the end. (I'm 5'7\"). That being said, it came promptly, well packaged and undamaged. Extremely easy to put together. Solid construction/sturdy. It stays reclined and is actually VERY comfortable in any position. Looks great and will be purchasing another! Can't go wrong at this price.", 
    "I love my new chair. It's very comfortable. The back of it could be a bit higher for when I lay it back completely, but I just slouch down a bit and it's fine. My sister-in-law fell in love with it when she sat in it. I think she might want one now... haha. The shipping was really fast, and the setup was easy. You just have to snap the back on. I really love how soft the fabric feels. It was totally worth the money!", 
    "The reviews indicated \"easy\" to assemble, which is true. The only assembly is to push the back of the chair down onto the main part. However, as of this review I have been unable to accomplish this \"easy\" task. I even took a hammer and pounded and pounded resulting in the back moving down inches at a time. The back is still not fully seated on the main part of the chair, which might be why the chair won't recline when I am seated. If I push down on the back, however, it will recline and is moderately comfortable. I bought the chair to replace my comfy, well-made recliner in my den. However, I have moved it to the guest room where it is best suited. It is not as stylish looking as I hoped and if I could return it I would. My mother always told me not to expect champaign for the price of a beer and this purchase illustrates that advice perfectly!", 
    "We bought this recliner hoping that it would be a compromise between the big fluffy bulky recliner of the 80s and a slim modern club chair. We are very pleased. Most people don't even realize that the chair reclines. My husband has fallen asleep in the chair more times than I can count, so A+ on comfort and I love the way it looks in the room, A+ on style.", 
    "I love this chair. It is unbelievingly comfortable and fits my short stature well. The chair arrived quickly and was out of the box and put together in less than 10 minutes. The arms are deep brown and the charcoal cloth has a brown tint to it. The charcoal color goes well with the rain-washed blues and browns (with pops of orange) in my bedroom. The chair appears to be well made and is heavy enough that it doesn't move when sat in (like so many recliners do).", 
    "I can sit or recline in this chair for three hours and get out of it with my back feeling great. This means much to me as I have had back troubles for many years. Also, being short of stature, the distance of the seat from the floor is just right for my legs.", 
    "The chair arrived quickly and was easy to put together. It is comfortable and we are enjoying it. The only issue is the back staying fully extended when my husband wants to doze. It returns to a less-reclined position. Other than that it has been a great addition to our living room.", 
    "I was looking for a recliner that would fit someone 5ft 2inch and not overpower me. This is it! Love the wood arms and sleek design. Not your Grandma's recliner. Fabric color nice and feels like it will hold up well. This is my second chair purchase from Overstock.com probably not my last!!", 
    "Great value for the price. Color is accurate. Very comfortable, but short....I'm 5'7\" and my feet hang over a bit.", 
    "The perfect chair for my Dad's bedroom. Useful for lounging while watching TV. Comfortable and stylish. Item though shipped in a large box was delivered very quickly without any damage whatsoever.", 
    "This chair is very nice looking, a good value and would look great in a large room. It takes up a lot of room, so I would suggest you check your area for where you will place it, and make sure you check out how large it is. My room is too small for it, wish I had ordered a smaller chair.", 
    "I am very pleased with my recliners and Overstock -- they arrived promptly on the day promised; they were easy to put together and are attractive and functional complementing the overall look of our library. For the price, I think it was an excellent purchase.", 
    "I bought this chair last summer. The first one arrived so damaged that I refused delivery. The second one had a slightly damaged rear leg and I decided to keep it. I originally had it in the living room but moved it into my bedroom when it started to show how poorly made it is. The arms are made of bentwood and are a dark brown. The bentwood strted to separateon the edges and you can see the light yellow color of the wood. It also started to show checking on the top of the arms which are also a pale yellow. Neither the manufacturer or Overstock offers any warranty once you've had the chair for a while. If they did I would send it back. I don't expect it will last very long.", 
    "This chair fits perfectly. I have a small living room and already have a large couch so this recliner works great. It was easy to put together too.", 
    "I ordered two of these recliners, and am mostly pleased with them. It appears to be an exacting import knockoff of a Lane recliner I'd seen in a local furniture store costing hundreds more. Assembly was easy; just a matter of attaching the back piece, which takes only a few minutes once unpacked. The fabric is nice; it appears to be a soft plush durable microfiber. The recliner is easy to get in and out of which is nice; and the mechanism works well, it is quiet and smooth. The wooden arms are a very dark brown, which in some light appears to be black. The color should be easy to touch up when inevitable dings occur. The back has a very nice lumbar support, which friends have commented on loving. It is much easier to get out of this chair vs an upholstered arm, which would be good for an elderly person. I'm a large guy, and the recliner is a good fit for me. The recliner doesn't lock into a reclined position, but rather relies on your body's balanced distribution of weight to keep it in the reclined position, which can on occasion cause you to become upright. I've only had the recliners for a few weeks, so the jury is still out on durability. Everyone loves the look and the comfort so far though!", 
    "The appearance of the chair is great. This chair is quite comfortable and simple to recline. The arms move a bit (side to side). I would prefer a solid feel. But the price was too good to pass up. This chair fits in with my other furniture. The assembly does require two people but it was still a very simple process. I liked it so much, I purchased a second one!", 
    "We ordered two of these chairs... the boxes were quite beat up when they arrived but the chairs were not damaged in shipping. Both of them had very minor scratches on them. The fabric is beautiful and true to the color shown on the screen. The only reason I am giving it a 4 is because one of the chairs was assembled incorrectly at the factory and we had to send it back. This would not have been a problem, but the box is so big it didn't fit in our car so we had to get a friend with a truck to help us take it to the UPS store. Overstock was a great with the return.", 
    "Perfect for my newly remodeled bedroom. Head and footrests are shorter than some other recliners so if you are really tall - probably won't be a good fit. The fabric is really nice and feels and looks durable - Easy to put together and as always no problems with shipping, however, the box is big so it was delivered to an outside door - lucky it wasn't snowing or raining! I had to take the box apart to get this through my doorways - which was fine. Love the chair and makes a nice sitting area in the bedroom - has a more modern look than most recliners I have seen.", 
    "I received this chair over the weekend and was pleased with how easy it was to put together. Looked as I expected - although the material is more of microsuede with a slight corduroy pattern. The only thing I don't like about it is that the back does not support my head. I am 5'3\" and didn't really think this would be a problem. I just put a pillow back there and it's fine. I do agree that for someone any taller than I this chair would be too short in length when you stretch out in it. HOwever if you are taller then when it is in the upright position it would be fine. My feet do not touch the floor when the chair is upright. Thus I need a footstool to rest my feet on if I'm just sitting in it and not reclining. No dings on the wood and feet were already installed.", 
    "Love it. Comfortable, easy to assemble. The color is exactly as presented on the website. No knicks on the wood. Perfect addition to our living room.", 
    "I have been lookng for a recliner for the past 6 months. I looked at this recliner several times, read the reviews, and finally decided to purchase it. I received it within a week and assembly was simple. I am a petite person and the chair is not overwhelming. It is extremely comfortable. I would recommend this chair to anyone.", 
    "Love the chair, love the service. Bought from \"O\" for less than local and no hassle or frustration.", 
    "We ordered 2 of these recliners at the same time. They arrived together after just 5 business days. Both arrived in great condition, with no damage of any kind. The arms are a little different color. One is almost black, and the other is very attractive dark brown. And I don't think I'm complaining. They are bigger than the picture leads you to believe, but we love them. Interestingly enough, one has a firm seat cushion, and the other is quite soft. If you are considering this chair,,,, I'd recommend it!!", 
    "I bought two of these recliners. I noticed in other reviews that the chairs sometimes arrived with damage to the wood arms. Mine arrived in perfect condition. They were very well padded and packaged. The chairs are very comfortable. I really like the color. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that when they are in the reclining position, they are very short; my feet (I'm 5'4\") come to the very edge of the foot rest. My husband\"s feet hang off. Smaller than your average recliner.", 
    "I bought two recliners for my extra room. They are very nice chairs, easy to use and very comfortable. The seat is high and the arms are sturdy, this chair is ideal for people with trouble standing. I work at a retirement community and am aware of furniture construction and design. This chair is a good choice for individuals in need of a minor assist to stand.", 
    "I have been looking for a comfy chair for a long, long time and am very pleased to say that I found it! I have to admit, I was a bit apprehensive about ordering from online without ever touching this chair, but am impressed. I have a suede couch, so texture is important. It seems to be of good quality and sturdy. It came packaged well...despite other reviews to the contrary. I am also a single-girl and was actually able to carry it up to my second floor flat with minimal difficulty all by myself. I live in a duplex that has to be around 100 years old...meaning narrow doorways with steep, hair-pin turn stairs. Assembly was also extremely easy with no tools required. To sum up, this is a great chair and I am quite happy with my purchase. It was exactly what my living room needed!", 
    "I ordered this chair hoping it would be perfect for my husband but ready to return if necessary. This chair is by far the best online purchase I have made. The chair is extremely comfortable and handsome. My husband loves the comfort of this chair!", 
    "The recliner is very attractive and a good buy for the price. I purchased the recliner for my 93 year old mother. One Slight drawback is that the reclining mechanism is engaged by pushing back with your body and my Mom doesn't have the strength to do it on her own.", 
    "Chair arrived in a box that looked beat up. It was fine inside and well protected. Unpacked easily and putting it together was super simple. Love the chair and it is very comfortable. I am tall and had no issue fitting in the chair when reclined or upright. Worth the money!", 
    "this recliner is definitely worth the money. it was extremely easy to put together and is v. comfortable. i am a smallish person and the size is just right for me. there was a piece of wood chipped off one of the legs, but it wasn't worth sending it back for that. other customeres mentioned the same problem, and we think that these recliners, at this low price, are probably slightly damaged seconds. it didn't bother us because the damage is hard to see and could possibly be painted over. i have already recommended this recliner to our friends. it's great value for the money. also looks sleek and fits with modern and traditional decor.", 
    "This is the second version of this style chair I have bought and I admit I love the design. The arms are nicely designed for an older person to get up from. I bought this chair for my father and he raves about it. Only complaint is that it arrived a little damaged on the wood arms. I didn't notice it right away.", 
    "I love the chair, for the money, I would say its great! If its going to be a daily sitter-I wouldn't recommend. It seems to be breaking down quickly, but just gets more comfy. I have had the same experience paying more for a chair at a local furniture store.", 
    "very easy to assemble, very comfortable would buy another one if needed", 
    "This is a really great looking chair for the price. It was really quick to put together and also, arrived quickly. The \"slate gray\" material is slightly darker than the website color. It is not a \"comfy recliner\" like a lazy-boy or similar but it is really nice quality. I like it!", 
    "great chair ...love the color and the price. it was shipped in seven days which seem about right with the small amount of shipping cost.", 
    "I loved this chair so much that I bought it twice. !st time, I bought it for a beach house & had to wait for construction to finish, so I \"stored\" it in my living room, but when it came time to move I missed it so much I had to get another. It's comfy and reclines without looking like so many fat, puffy, recliners. Love the sleek lines and open leg look. Works great in a craftsman style room as well as a contemporary beach bedroom. Overstock sent both on time & they were easy to assemble, just slide the back on to the glide rails. I did a lot of shopping for chairs over a 9 month project and Overstock had the best deals by far.", 
    "This chair looks great and is pretty comfortable. Definately a good deal for the price! A very modern look but still the kind of chair you can watch tv in. Very easy to assemble. The colors are exactly how they appear in the photo.", 
    "I love this recliner . My husband was able to put this recliner in less than half an hour. I am 5'1 and I fit this recliner perfectly. I have chronic back pain and this chair is comfy and supportive of my lower back. I ordered the recliner in a grey color and I find that the color can be match with what ever other colors that you may have in your room.", 
    "This chair was purchased for my mother who is very fussy and has not been happy with any recliner we purchased for her in the past. The major problem is she is getting shorter in stature and starting to become a little frail. This chair suited her just fine. She only wished the arms were cushioned.", 
    "If my husband weren't a handyman, I'd probably send for a replacement. Chair is so pretty. Unfortunately the handles were damaged towards the back curve of the wood (which I wouldn't doubt was during the shipping stage -- it looks like a fresh wound). Removing the screws and using washers to reinsert them to hold down the wood along with a strong adhesive should work and also covering up the damaged stain job. Luckily this area is covered by the back piece of the chair and only I will know it's damaged. Other than that, this thing is very comfortable and I'm sure it's going to get lots of use.", 
    "The chair arrived with a large chunk broken off the back leg. That is the leg that shows the most in the position we have placed the chair in. The fabric color is great, as described in other reviews. My husband falls asleep on it almost every night. It is comfortable and well designed; seems sturdy.", 
    "Nice recliner, however there were a few nicks on the handles that could have been smoothed out instead of sent as is. Comfortable, looks like a Lane.", 
    "The worst part was for 1 person to get this bulky item out of its box. The ordeal was well worth it however because the chair was so easy to assemble and is a gprgeous charcoal color so my black cats' fur will be virtually impossible to see. The best however is how comfy it is. I actually feel asleep in it reading a book. My cats like it too!", 
    "I bought two of these to go on a small upstairs landing that is used as an upstairs den between two bedrooms. The chairs are perfect for the small space. Very comfortable except that the back is not high enough to provide head support for a taller person. Since it sits off the floor and does not have the bulky arm rests, it takes up less visual space. Well worth the price! Had no problem with delivery. Both came with no flaws and within 4 days!", 
    "Very nice! Not one flaw. Fits me perfectly. 5'3\" Just my style. Even hubby likes it.", 
    "Beautiful and sturdy chair - I wanted a recliner but I don't like the standard bulky ones. This fits perfectly in my little den area and I love the wooden arms. Very classy looking. I love it! Took about 5 minutes to put together.", 
    "I love this chair! I am not a fan of traditional recliners and our decor is more contemporary, so this chair was perfect for our home. A couple of things: The seat is a bit long and the back is a bit short and would probably not work as well for a taller person (I'm 5'4\"), as my head reaches the top of the chair when reclining. The padding in the headrest seems softer than the rest of the chair (this reduced my rating). Also, you will need to allow at least a foot between the top of the chair and the wall. I feel like this chair will hold up well in our home. The price was much better than any similar chair I've seen. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "We are so very pleased with our first purchase. It arrived on the day we expected it and looks terrific! We were so pleased that we have made several more purchases and plan on making even more. My husband is a large man and this chair is perfect for him. It was very easy to assemble. If you are considering this chair, don't be afraid to order it.", 
    "I needed a comfortable and attractive reading chair, and wanted a recliner, but hate those huge bulky ones. And I didn't want to pay a premium price. The chair came in a timely fashion, and took no time to assemble. It is as comfortable as the other reviews claimed. Would have preferred another color, but that was a small sacrifice to get the price and sturdiness of this chair. I think the design is lovely, with the bent wood arms, and Iook forward to many cups of tea and novels in that chair!!", 
    "I bought this to use in a bedroom but it was so nice, heavy and sturdy I decided to keep it in my living room. It is very comfortable and the covering is thick and made well. I had to practice g etting it in to recliner position. as I am not too strong, but I made it. I would get another twin if I had room for it. It went together in just a few minutes", 
    "I always read these reviews and the ones on these chairs were right on the money. The chairs are great for my back, they have great lumbar support. My daughter and son-in-law were visiting last week, and noticed the new chairs. I said \"Go on sit in them,\" They both loved the chairs. She loved how they reclined evenly with the height of the chair no higher. I bought two and they are in my nonformal living room. They go with any decor. I love them. It was a great purchase. The quality of craftsmenship surpasses anything I could have imagine for the price. It was a good investment..", 
    "Colour as shown. Great recliners. cloth is soft and very comfortable. great modern addition to furniture.", 
    "This chair is really good quality, perfect size, arrived in perfect condition and easy to assemble. This chair is really comfortable, but I wish it reclined a little further.", 
    "I bought two of these recliners, one at a time. Both deliveries were fast(5 days) and packaged well. The color of the wooden arms was not as brown as in the picture. There is a hint of red in the stain. I really like the fabric and the color of the charcoal cushion. It was very easy to put together. The back just snaps on. There were a few small imperfections in the wooden arms (tiny scratches) But for the cost I think it was worth it and I would order again.", 
    "I am very pleased with the Riverside recliner. It is very comfortable with a great lumbar support. Several people, from 5'4\" to 5'11\" have tried it out, all agree. I would have given it 5 stars but the shipping box was very damaged,resulting in slight damage to one arm.", 
    "I'm excited to tell family and friends where I got this chair and the great price that I paid at Overstock. Family and friends comment on how far back it reclines and how comfortable it is with plenty of support. The color was exactly as pictured, it was easy to slide the back on, it was shipped and I received it in less than five days and it gives me an excellent chair that lets me put my feet up but doesn't take up the whole room. Thank you, Overstock!", 
    "Very nice chair. Fabric is good quality. Fabric has a nice texture which I was pleasantly surprise about. Color is as shown on picture.", 
    "We purchased 2 of these chairs for our newly renovated family room. They were delivered very quickly, in excellent condition and were extremely easy to assemble (literally, minutes). The chairs are incredibly comfortable and look much more expensive then they were. This was a truly great buy!", 
    "It is perfect looks so nice in my living room and so comfy.. It was a great buy", 
    "This was the first time I ever ordered a chair online, so I have to admit I was pretty nervous about what it would really look and feel like in person. I ordered this chair for a seating area in our master bedroom. I was impressed with how nice it is! It is very comfortable and was super easy to assemble. It was such a great deal and I liked it so much that I ordered the polka dot one for our great room!!", 
    "I love this recliner. It's comfortable and stylish. It was very easy to assemble; the back slides right on and latches. That's it. I would definitely recommend this to others.", 
    "I had hoped this would be a replacement for my Lane 'Julia' chair that I bought 7 years ago and needed replacing. It looks like a Julia but has a much lower back. I am 5 feet 7 inches. When I recline, my head has no where to rest. The seat is much more firm and foamy. There is a ton of foam in the seat. It doesn't seem to rely on the springs much. The price is good the chair is fine, I tossed out my old chair, I'm keeping this one. It is not a Lane 'Julia!'", 
    "A little narrower than advertised; which is a good thing. EASY to assemble. A great chair, especially for the price.", 
    "Chair arrived quickly. Easy to assemble. Fabric is beautiful, almost looks like a fine pigskin. Very happy with purchase."
