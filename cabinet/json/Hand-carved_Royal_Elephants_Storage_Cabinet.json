    "I purchased this piece as an accent for my safari themed den. It's much darker than the picture with no contrast. It looks good in the room so I'm satisfied.", 
    "I bought this for my new remodeled bathroom. I needed a piece that was tall and thin. This is perfect. The carving is great and so is the finish.", 
    "This cabinet is exactly what I was looking for. Its high quality wood and hand carved craftsmanship sets it above mass produced furniture by far. Very happy with the product and price.", 
    "The piece itself is quite beautiful, but it is covered in some sort of waxy coating that scratches off VERY easily revealing a completely different color underneath. I've never seen this before.", 
    "Came well packed. Beautiful piece but unfortunately the door was warped. I spoke with customer service. A return slip was sent and I returned the cabinet. Another was sent ASAP and arrived in perfect condition. Very sturdy and interesting. Highly recommended."
