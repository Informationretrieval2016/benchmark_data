    "I like the look of the table, however, the top is basically MDP with vinyl paper glued in it. I was expecting formica.", 
    "It is a great looking table, BUT A NIGHTMARE TO PUT TOGETHER. The holes barely line up, I am in construction and could not believe how hard it was to match up the holes. I almost sent it back until I did a little bending & pulling. If you are not handy this will not be the table for you it will have you pulling your hair out. The bottom line is once it is up, it is what I was looking for. Also it is very light weight.", 
    "I recieved my Retro Dining Table yestaerday , my first order from Overstock I am very pleased it's very cool and stylish didn't need any tools to putting it together and it only took about 30mins. I would recommend this table for anyone looking for style reliability and just plain coolness. Up next the retro dining chairs, looks like I'm finished with going out to the stores, the price was very reasonable...two thumbs up for this table I can't stop looking at it.", 
    "very flimsy table and cheap chairs would not recommend or buy again", 
    "I had a little problem putting the legs together, but finally with patience I did it! When attached the legs to the table top, leave all screws loose to be able to line up the holes, then I finally tightened them, Sturdy and now looking at the retro chairs. I hop I get a discount", 
    "The table was easy to put together and serves well as a kitchen table. The size will allow 4 people to eat but without much else on the table. It's ideal for a couple or single person. It is very well made and was simple to construct even though I would recommend that you open the box outside somewhere because Styrofoam packing gets everywhere. If you have a modern or Retro kitchen and match this with the Retro chairs it makes a great addition to your kitchen.", 
    "It is a great table for the money. I would not recommend it for a household with very young children, but other than that I would recommend it!", 
    "We wanted a table to fit in our new home's breakfast nook and this is the perfect size. The quality is good and will be great when we find the chairs we want. Overstock has become our main shopping place while we are remodeling a home. Customer service has been great when we've had to return items that didn't fit after they got to us. We completely recommend others to shop with Overstock!", 
    "Love this table! I found it easy to assemble. Even told the hubby to back off when he tried to take over! fits beautifully in my retro kitchen!", 
    "Super filmsy. My kids are older and I wouldn't even trust it to survive them, much less younger children. We returned it because I was afraid even my dogs would knock it over. Looks nice. The good points end there. I can't believe someone would think they could charge over *** for this product and get away with it. Robbery!", 
    "nice table, the look is what I was hoping for. Problems I encountered were that food can sometimes stain the tabletop and the screws were awfully difficult to get into the bottom of the table. I still am waiting to borrow a friends screw gun to get the remainder of them in. I'm hoping it will fix the wobbliness of the table once it's more secure. Overall, I'm very happy with the table, it's funky, cool and the perfect size for a smaller kitchen.", 
    "I 'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A ROUND TABLE, AND FOUND THE ONE I WANTED ON OVERSTOCK.COM. THE TABLE WAS PRETTY EASY TO ASSEMBLE AND IT LOOKS GREAT WHEN ITS UP. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE SURFACE WILL STAIN EASILY. I HAD A TABLE CLOTH ON IT AND I HAD A CANDLE BURNING , IT SPILLED OVER A TINY BIT AND LEFT A PINK STAIN ON THE TABLE, IT WOULD NOT COME OFF EVEN WITH BLEACH, SO BE CAREFUL, AND PROTECT IT , OTHERWISE ITS GREAT. IT LOOKS GOOD WITH CAFE CHAIRS.", 
    "Great table, looks exactly like picture.", 
    "Cute but not that sturdy and the top is a funny pebbly plastic, like an industrial cafeteria. Works for our office breakroom.", 
    "Looks nice in kitchen but the top easily stains. Soon will require a tablecloth.", 
    "This is exactly the look I was after. The top however is not anything I could live with. It is an MDF board with a piece of white plastic stretched over it. There were even spots on my that had be patched with \"white-out.\" The construction is misleading. There is no excuse for that in my mind. The price might have given me a clue but I think calling the materials \"chrome, laminate\" is misleading and incomplete.", 
    "Was very easy to put together. When I moved the top got torn, so my grandkids finished taking the white off of it, and I painted it and my grandkids did their art work on it and then I put a clear coat on it and I have it hanging up on the wall. It turned out totally beautiful.", 
    "easy to assemble and very beautiful", 
    "Goes together quickly. Really enjoy the look.", 
    "Very Weak made cheap its out door.", 
    "Guess you get what you pay for. I would skip this and invest in something more sturdy.", 
    "The legs are solid and the chrome plating provides a nice finish. One thing I would like to see improved is the top surface of the table, at first glance it did not seem as well built as the rest of the table. I am sure it will be fine.", 
    "GOOD BUY IF YOU NEED A KITCHEN TABLE.", 
    "I bought this \"Simple Living\" table along with two pair of the \"Simple Living Pima Bentwood\" chairs. It makes a perfect set with the chairs, and is super easy to assemble. It would be best to check the parts carefully. Although well-packaged, the table top had scuffs and a slight dent in the chrome trim. Although the imperfections are minor, I've decided to request a replacement part.", 
    "I liked this style table and wanted to get a matching set of chairs to go with it. Some sets that sell the table and chairs together were priced at $800 for the whole set. By getting the table and chairs separately I saved a ton of money.", 
    "This table looked a little better online than in person. The top looks kind of cheap plastic, not acrylic like we thought. Also a little bigger than we anticipated (36\"), but that's probably our fault for not measuring our space! We just moved, so it's fine until we find something more suitable for us.", 
    "This table is just right for the intended purpose. However, I expected the real retro dining table. I am still looking for chairs to match this table", 
    "The picture online makes the table look nicer than it is. The top is basically a paint on cover that was scratched when I opened the box. A table cloth is one option, but I liked the look of the table as it is online. Second, it's also wobbly even with all the bolts tightened firmly. Not a problem is it's just you at the table, but if you a guest it becomes awkward. Wouldn't purchase it again and wouldn't recommend to anyone.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for and very affordable.", 
    "LOVE the table. It was exceptionally easy to assemble and I'm not very mechanically inclined.", 
    "I have two boys, one 7 and the other 16. This table just wasn't sturdy enough for daily use, however I will be using it outside this summer and as an overflow table.", 
    "Nice looking but not excellent quality table. It is ok. Received on time.", 
    "Great product at a great price! Have consolidated two households and can't bring myself to get rid of it.", 
    "This was a gift for my brother and he loved it. It fit perfectly in his small kitchen. It arrived quickly and in good condition. My son purchased it for his uncle and found the price to be excellent for his budget. Since he is a college student on a fixed income. Thank you we are extremely pleased with the purchase.", 
    "I was concerned based on the price, but the table went together easily, don't wobble and seems like it will do the job well! It may not last 30 years, but will work well for what I need it for.", 
    "Great product, it was exactly what we were looking for. Except we didn't realize just how big 36\" was in relationship to our space, however it worked out great, and wife is very pleased with the table.", 
    "I expected the table top to be hard plastic but it was a texture vinyl coating particle board", 
    "I needed a small table to go in my studio. I love the look of chrome and white - it goes perfectly with my white leather and chrome dining chairs. Table is small for 2 people - 3 max. I have had many compliments on it already.", 
    "great table for the retro 50s diner look with a modern twist. Very different. everyone who sees it asks where i got it and loves it.", 
    "product came damaged i called they sent another have not switched them out as i dropped pasta sauce on table and it stained. so i am back to shopping around for another table do not like it at all was a waste of my money.", 
    "Table came with dents in side of table top, didn't want to hassle with sending it back, but won't purchase anything from OC again.", 
    "The table was put together very quickly. As sturdy as expected (by which I mean that a good nudge will wiggle it enough to spill your juice) but, like I said, as expected. The construction of the legs does not lend itself to solid and immovable but boy is it cute and perfect for a small kitchen or breakfast nook. The top is surfaced in some sort of heavy weight plastic cloth, NOT laminate as I would have preferred. Because of that, it does soak up color easily and can't be scrubbed out because you will ruin the plastic fabric.", 
    "I ordered this table for a small kitchen space and it is perfect. The table was easy to assemble and is solid. The packaging was excellent, no dings or dents, all parts included. The top is white plastic.", 
    "Love the look of this table from across the room, but when you get closer, it just looks cheap. The top has a plastic feel to it and the chrome rim is only about a 1/4 inch thick, so it feels like it will just pull right off if you yank too hard. Not sure how long it will last in my kitchen.", 
    "I expected a heavier table with a real laminate top - it's pretty cheap overall. Seems like lighter aluminum legs and the top (as another review said) is a light-weight mdf with a thin vinyl overlay. It already has a crack/tear spot along one side from assembly. It is otherwise a nice-looking table and fits well in my kitchen/eat-in area.", 
    "GREAT LOOK. Assemble a bit difficult to execute. holes don't line up easily. not sure if it's how tight you get the legs bounded together first. (shrugs) either way...i got it up only using 65% of the screws/ bolts supplied.", 
    "We just love the table. Brings back lots of memories. Service was great!!!!!", 
    "The other reviews were very helpful in putting the set together. We found some items mislabled. We found some holes not punched through, but we were able to fix that easily by bending the metal. If we didn't have other reviews it would have been tough to put together, but with others insights it went together pretty fast. There were no directions for the table, so we've only put the chairs together so far.", 
    "Table top was slightly damaged in shipping. But nothing that can't be hidden.Easy to assemble. Looks good. Design make it's slightly unstable, but that's to be expected, since base is concentrated in the middle.The surface is a weird texture, making it vaguely difficult to clean.Honestly for the price it's fine. If I wanted something better I would have gone shopping. :)"
