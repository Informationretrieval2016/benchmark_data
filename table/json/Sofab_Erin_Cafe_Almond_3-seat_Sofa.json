    "Ordered this couch to replace a 12 year old Broyhill set. I'm an interior decorator, and have ordered on-line for clients, but never for myself. After months of looking, I chose this couch for the value and the color. The first couch arrived with a broken frame. My advice: Do not open any of the vacuumed packed pillow bags until you have thoroughly inspected the frame. Also, the wooden feet pieces for the couch came very banged up and chipped. All the sofa cushions are loose - which I like for wear, but the back cushions were not as full as I expected. The stuffing in the pillows is not contained in a material case, so that makes it messy when you unzip the pillows. I was not planning to use the decorative pillows, so I took the stuffing from those to add to the back cushions. The color is exactly what I expected. Putting the couch together was quick and easy, but I would recommend having another person there to help you with aligning the back piece and stretching the material taught to reach the velcro. Some of the stitching isn't the best quality and there is some puckering. The customer service was WONDERFUL as I was dealing with replacing the original broken order. So far, so good."
