    "I ordered this item as well as the 3-tier shelf (also pictured) on monday and received them on Thursday of the same week.I put them both together myself (took an hour for each) and they look amazing. The smaller one will be used as a shoe-rack at my daughter's closet since it is kind of narrow. However, the bigger one is perefct for her room and I will be ordering a second 4-tier-shelf in a few days.", 
    "I was excited to get this cute shelf for my daughter's room, but was quickly disappointed in the shelf color. They are not white as stated. They are a definite shade of vanilla. So not only will I need to spend the time and money to repaint them, but I am not very happy with the price I paid for the shelf and the value I got. These are only worth half the price at best, in my opinion. My other observation while assembling is that this shelf doesn't really seem suitable for a child's room. I have the feeling my children will ultimately attempt to climb the \"ladder\", and I worry that the anchors are not going to hold. I also regret buying this since it is not safe without anchoring it to the wall, so it doesn't offer any flexibility in rearranging the room. I have to be SURE about where I want to put this shelf before we anchor it to the wall. We are at the point right now where my daughter will be getting a twin bed or possibly bunkbeds very soon since she is outgrowing her toddler bed, so the layout of her room will change. I sort of have to wait until we reach that point before we attach this shelf to the wall. I wish I would have bought something more mobile.", 
    "This 4 tier shelving unit for a kids playroom or bedroom is just perfect. I got it for our grandsons' bedroom. It looks fantastic. I have had several people even ask where did I get such a cute shelf for kids. What I like about it is that you can see right away it is for children the way it is designed. It is sturdy and will hold just about anything. Also the fact that you secure it to the wall makes me feel good because then I know they won't be able to tip it over if they pull on it. I looked on alot of sites for a kids shelf unit and I am so glad I decided on this one!!!!!!", 
    "I have had this for a while and it looks cute, but it is not very sturdy. I have have to repair it on several occasions.", 
    "I ordered these after reading the reviews so I knew what to expect quality wise. Having said that, this was just a bad purchase all around.When I tool them out to put them together, they were scratched and banged up. I figured it didn't matter because they would have books on them and be placed in the playroom for a few years before we tossed them. After putting them together (which was fairly easy), I put them in my daughter's playroom and filled them up. A few days later I noticed a strange and unpleasant odor coming from the playroom. We just moved into the house so I knew it wasn't old food or garbage. Finally, I realized that the odor was the book shelves!!! Not sure if it was the paint or whatever board they used but it was AWFUL. These shelves are in the basement waiting to be picked up and returned.", 
    "From the day I placed my order the shelf arrived in 2 days. I purchased it for a baby girls nursery & its perfect for that. I have the 4 tier pink/White which is actually pink/cream. I've been searching for an ivory shelf & it has been difficult to come across. Even though the description said white I chose to go off the reviews instead which said it was more cream..thank goodness, they were right & it looks perfect. For the price this is a great product & I would buy it again!", 
    "I bought this shelf for my daughter's stuffed animals. After my husband's work of putting pieces together, his comments is: very poor quality and the board cann't even hold the screws. But it is a good looking shelf and functional only with light-weight stuff.", 
    "The shelves actuall sizes are smaller than what I expected from the picture view. The quality is not very good, but the color is nice. My husband didn't like them and wanted me to return, but the kids love the color so we kept them for kids to put their craft projects.", 
    "I purchased this for my daughters room. It was very easy to put together. It looks great in her room and really gives her alot more space. It holds lots of books and other items also. I am thinking of purchasing the smaller one also.", 
    "It's been in the little ones bedroom 5 years and still looks like new", 
    "Awesome It's very nice and easy to put together.", 
    "My son is loved the shelves.", 
    "Screw heads are silver and show after assembly, other than that it looks great.", 
    "assembly was not too easy", 
    "Poorly made. There was a hole in one of the pieces. Very disappointed.", 
    "Very happy with it. Easy to assemble. I bought 2 for my daughter's bedroom.", 
    "The quality is very bad. Scratches easily. While I was assembling it, side panels cracked on top. Disappointed with the purchase.", 
    "Arrived quickly as described.", 
    "This book shelf goes well in my daughter's room. It does require some assembly but is pretty easy. I was able to put it together myself. Just make sure all screws are nice and tight and you are good to go", 
    "It worked well for what I needed it for! Looks pretty! But I needed it to go in corner of room and didn't realize it was a leaning shelf.", 
    "Very cute shelf. Fits perfectly in a small room and hold a lot of my daughter's precious things. She loves it!", 
    "I ordered this book shelf for my nursery. It is not a true white but more of an off white in color. The quality of the book case is average...I'll be interested how it wears and tears. The only thing I will complain about is that it has a very strong odor to it. Once we put it together, we had to put it outside to air out for a couple days. Overall, a decent product for the price.", 
    "Nice book case for the money. Took about an hour to put together by myself. Only drawbacks: There is a bad odor coming from the paint finish. I had to open windows to air out.The finish is not white. It's like an off white or beige color.Recommended to be anchored to the wall so its not totally freestanding.", 
    "If I had gotten this and it was properly described, I would be ok with it. The reason I only gave the product three stars was for two main reasons: 1) I purchased the white shelf, and it was as far from white as one could possibly get. It is a very heavy ivory, almost the color of banana pudding. If you are looking for true white, do NOT order this. 2) I ordered the four tier shelf, and received a three tier shelf. Frankly, once the box was opened and I pulled out the parts, it was not worth the hassle to reload the box and send it back for what I paid. I will keep it (if I can figure out how to put it together) but I'm disappointed that I did not get what I ordered.", 
    "We bought this for our toddler girl room, and we love it! It's darling. I like that I can put things on the top shelf that I don't want my child to reach, but can put books and toys on the bottom shelves so she can help herself to whatever she wants. It's a win-win!", 
    "loved it....looks great in my daughters room...and cleans up the clutter....", 
    "The quality of the finish is awful. Areas on the shelves appear to have little to no paint. It appears to be dirty however it is just lack of paint. Scuff marks and nicks throughout. Easy to put together and sturdy once erected. Missing two screws overall. Grade would be a solid D.", 
    "I do really like this shelf, especially for the price, but it was two screws short :( I'll have to find screws that work at the department store.", 
    "I purchased two of these for my son's nursery and they are so cute. Pretty easy to assemble too. I use them for displaying photos and books, and they are really cute - perfect for a nursery.", 
    "Great mounting wall unit i have all my favorite's Sons staff on it love it", 
    "I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old girls and it fits perfectly in their room. It was easy to put together. However, it is alot shorter than I thought it would be.", 
    "We are happy with it and the color isn't a problem for us (we don't know if we are having a boy or girl), but if you want a sky blue color-- this isn't it!", 
    "I'm very happy with the purchase of the book shelf. So far we haven't had to anchor it to the wall. It's sturdy enough considering the amount of books on it that my daughter pushes back and forth that would shift the weight. The bookshelf is a little more narrow than it appears from the picture to me but I'm very happy with this purchase and my 2/12 year old can get to the items on the bottom 2 shelves easily. The 3rd shelf up, takes a little effort by her and it's nice to be able to put some things out of reach on the top shelf for now. Good buy for the money spent.", 
    "The shelf is really cute... However I spent a lot of wasted time trying to put it together... but the screws would not hold it together (I don't think they were strong enough or long enough and the wood-type material was crumbly and wouldn't hold them in), even the wood glue provided didn't do much. I ordered other ladder shelves from Overstock and had no problem putting them together- they are sturdy and look great. This one was a big mess and quite frustrating and finally I gave up and sent it back.", 
    "I put this together myself in about 40 minutes. It was super easy. There was one screw or screw hole that is stripped, but I just wrapped some good old duck tape around the screw and it tightened right up. I needed something to get the toys off the floor of my playroom / bedroom that I have made up for my grandchildren. You know the farms, castles, doll houses that are too big for the toy box...and finally somewhere to put all the wooden puzzles! I like it so much I have just ordered another one, and after seeing it my daughter got on line and ordered one too. So we are very happy with the shelves.", 
    "Great for my daughters room. Just the right size for her to reach things, and the sides do a nice job of keeping objects in order.", 
    "Assembled were easy to put together, besides the gluing each tier into their holes. Shelf are very narrow/small. Overall it's a cute petite little shelf, happy with purchased.", 
    "Purchased this for child's bedroom after looking at many other children's bookshelves, which were much more expensive. The quality is just OK, but for the price it is fine. Not the sturdiest, but it will do for the next few years for my daughter's books and other display items.", 
    "I said I wouldn't recommend, simply because it's a fairly cheap shelf and a hassle to assemble. However, the self looks good in the playroom. It is the color and style I was looking for. The price is right - and you certainly get what you pay for. The biggest complaint is how much of a pain it is to put together. Every shelf is in 4 pieces and needs to be glued and hammered, etc. Also, look carefully at the dimensions of the shelves - they are narrow and get narrower as they go up. As you'd expect from the pictures. The top ones are pretty small and I've had to be creative with what to put on them.", 
    "The product was very easy to put together. It fits the space in my daughters room. It looks exactly like the picture. The only problem is that I found the product through ****** for $20 cheaper.", 
    "I brought the pink. I love it! The shelf was super easy to put together with the step by step instructions. Look exactly as shown.", 
    "Great shelves! I actually bought 2...This 4-shelf one and the other in the 3-shelf style. Nice little shelves and stores quite a bit but I gotta tell you, for the money I spent on the both of them, I could have really researched and bought the raw material and made the same things myself! The wood is beyond cheap, almost fiber-board. The hardware pretty sad, used my own screws to strenghten the item as a lot of the screws just seemed to spin when I was trying to tighten it down. Overall, if I really wanted to get another one of these, I would get the measurements from the ones I have and buy the material. Totally not worth it!", 
    "There is really nothing good I can say about this shelf. I bought the pink 4-tier version and I very much regret it. The screws do not stay in, so we had to buy bigger screws just to get the shelves to stay together. The only part of the shelf where the included screws actually stayed in is the top where it mounts to the wall, and even though we were using the screws they gave us, both pieces of wood split in several places. Also, this shelf is not white. It is soooo not white that if you have white furniture or accents in the room, this shelf will just look dingy. Plus, it is tiny, although, I'm sure the measurements are on here, so my review isn't even based on that. This is pretty inexpensive, but still way overpriced for such poor quality.", 
    "I ordered this shelf for my daughters nursery. I had orginally ordered the three shelf but then cancled that and went with the 4 shelf. I am glad I did as even the 4 shelf is not very big. The actual shelves are more shallow on the top and deep at the bottom, so if you are looking for a place for books you really only get 2 shelves fro books. My husband put it together pretty quickly and it seems sterdy enough. The think I was most disapointed in is that the color is listed as Pink and White. It is not white. It is a cream color, not a shade of off white, very cream. I kept the shelves as fit in the space I needed well, but I may repaint them so they are actually white.", 
    "Love this bookshelve! It is very cute and useful in my baby girl's room. I had someone tighten the shelves to the wall, to be baby proofed. Baby now holds onto them and has her books and toys on it. The bookshelves fit perfectly in the corner between the windown and the closet doors that would otherwise be a waisted space since it was too narrow. Glad I found this!", 
    "The shelf was just fine but don't think it was worth the money - the 3 teir looks a lot smaller.", 
    "The shelf is great! I am happy with my purchase. The blue shown in the picture is very light. It wasn't suitable for my 5 year old son. We spray painted the blue red and it looks great so we bought two more shelves for my sons bedroom. They look great.", 
    "I purchased this shelf for my new little girl's nursery. The furniture in the nursery is an ivory color and I was worried that the shelf wouldn't look right with it, but it turned out perfectly. The ivory/off-white color matches my furniture exactly and the pink (which is a little off when compared to the typical \"pink\" color usually used in toys and children's bedding) matches some of the pink on my \"baby blocks\" rug. The shelf is darling and petite enough to fit in my nursery without being overwhelming (as there is already a changing table/dresser, rocker/recliner, crib and door chest in the room). The shelves are more narrow than typically seen with leaning bookcases, but understandable as it is a child's shelf. I was able to put it together myself and then carry it upstairs to the nursery. I had all the hardware, but I did have a screw break (half is still in the shelf) when I was attaching the top shelf to the pink leg. I'm not worried about its stability with the broken screw as I used the wood glue and it seems pretty stable. Only one thing really bothers me about the shelf - you can see all the screw holes/screws and they were not all visible in the pictures.", 
    "We ordered this for my adult daughter (who loves pink). My husband assembled it w/out a problem and it works well in her bedroom (the ladder style clears her floor heater nicely). I wouldn't get this for a child who might climb on it, but an older kid who takes care of his/her things might really like it. Great price, rapid delivery.", 
    "I had high hopes for this shelf and was sadly disappointed. Half of the screws were missing and the ones that were there were of horrible quality and snapped in half. Holes were not aligned properly. Turnrd out to be quite rickety and unstable.Not happy with this shelf but used wood glue and bought good screws,that makes it a little better.Not worth the price.", 
    "This shelf is a great solution for a small space. It has enough room for some of my daughters books and her little \"treasures.\" It is not the most sturdy, but we secured it to the wall using the brackets that came with the shelf and it should be fine. I may paint the head of the screws white so they are less noticable. Overall, a good purchase and a good price.", 
    "the shelves look great and were very easy to assemble. they are childrens shelves so they are shorter than expected, overall a nice look piece of furniture.", 
    "Pleasantly surprise at the quality and look of this product. The 5 tier holds lots of items and not too big for a 10 x 10 room.", 
    "Just set this up in my 4 year old daughter's room and it looks great! She has tons of books and they all fit! The shelf is exactly as pictured, didn't take long to put together and is very sturdy. I recommend using the pieces that come with it to attach the shelf to the wall for safety reasons (at least in a kids' room). I am so glad I bought this product!", 
    "I ordered these for my daughter's room and was so pleased with them I ordered another. They look just like the photo, and were easy to assemble. After connecting them to the wall, they are incredibly sturdy and hold all of my daughter's books and toys; great looking storage that doesn't take up a ton of room.", 
    "I got this on a lark for my daughter's room and it's just great. It's shorter than I had anticipated - but that could have been solved if I actually took a ruler and figured out the measurements. Instead, I had seen it in the picture next to the three tier shelf and assumed that it was taller than it is. However, that's not a big deal. My daughter can reach most of the shelves and so it's the perfect scale for her. It went together easily - especially with two people - and it seems to be staying together just fine. We put a few things on it and it really looks very sweet. It's just what I didn't even know I was looking for!!!!", 
    "This shelf is so cute. we purchased the pink one for our daughters nursery. I love the constrast of the pink and white together.", 
    "I was very excited to see the box at our door except when we opened it and found a cream shelve with light blue almost purple looking shelves. The color is not at all what the picture looks like we were very upset.", 
    "This bookshelf was easy and quick (less than an hour) to assemble, it looks good, had a fair price, and arrived on time", 
    "It is best not to put too many books on this shelf and they will tilt a bit but there is a lip on the back of each shelf that keeps things from sliding into the wall which is nice", 
    "I am very satisfied with the kids leaning shelf. It was easy to assemble and looks great in my daughter's room. The only comment I have is that the shelves are not bright white, but more of a creamy white. It was not quite clear from the photo, but the description only says white. I wasn't expecting off-white, but was happy when it arrived as it is a better match to my daughter's other furniture than bright white. For the price it is an excellent value.", 
    "Cute addition to my 2-yr-old\u00bfs room. Needed some more storage space where she would have easy access to shelves, and this is perfect. Collectibles go on top where she can\u00bft reach and books/toys on bottom perfect for her height.", 
    "Good purchase, my first from overstock. Would be easier to put together with two people but I got it done in about an hour. Color is a little off from the room it was going in but works great, very thick and durable shelving."
