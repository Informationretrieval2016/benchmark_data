    "This cabinet looks like one from passport furnishings. Meaning it's not a nice easy to open cabinet. The color is way more faded than the picture shows, it's so weathered it looks like it was dropped a few times and paint has chipped off and I called it a toothpaste cabinet because there's not much else you can fit on the narrow depth of shelf. I wasn't impressed with the fingerprints I could see all over this item either. I don't dare wipe the grease off for fear I'd wipe the chipped paint off. This is a delicate piece of furniture. If I had seen this in the store I would not have bought this.", 
    "The color says Blue finish, but it more of a green. I had to paint it blue to get the right color", 
    "Just not packaged well inside by overstock. There was no external damage, but you would see that the material is particle board, not real wood.", 
    "When I received this shipment, the top of the cabinet was actually OUTSIDE the box it was packed in, causing visible damage to the cabinet. There was very little packing done to insure no damage. Also, one of the doors will not stay closed because the magnets are not installed correctly. This cabinet will not get a lot of use where I will hang it - it's really for looks only. Otherwise, I would return it.", 
    "I absolutely love this cabinet. It is not very deep, but it looks great and is a perfect place for all of our first aid items in our bathroom."
