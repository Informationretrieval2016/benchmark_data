    "This cabinet is built with hardwood fronts, plywood sides and back, separating it in quality from most cheaper cabinets made of MDF and veneer. Over time veneer starts to peel away in a humid environment. Finish is quite smooth. Hinges don't allow the doors to close flush with the frame. I plan to add brown felt pads to the inside corners, so this should even the level and muffle the sound of wood on wood. I withhold the 5th star in my evaluation because 1) you must drill your own holes for the door knobs (as mentioned in the Q&A) and 2) the one shelf inside the cabinet is the board separating the open compartment and closed compartment, so you can stack toilet paper rolls on the inside or put in very tall bottles of lotion, body wash and the like. Since I don't have a true medicine cabinet, just a very large mirror over the sink, I use my toilet topper cabinet for smaller items. I will add two inner shelves using 1\" x 8\" (nominal) mahogany boards with shelf supports.", 
    "Everything I wanted and more. Since I was putting it in a powder room I didn't want anything too big. It was perfect. The quality was excellent", 
    "Pretty good value, the finish could have been better", 
    "You need two people to put it up but it looks so lovely in the Bathroom once it's done. :)"
