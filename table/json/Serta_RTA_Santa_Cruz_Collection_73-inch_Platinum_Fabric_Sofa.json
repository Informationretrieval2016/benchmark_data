  "reviews": [
    "First, this couch came in a box and much assembly was needed. Second, the cushions are not squared on the ends so it looks odd. Third, not a couch you would want in a room you use all the time. I was excited over the brand name and disappointed overall in what was delivered.", 
    "The cushions come vacuum packed and still haven't expanded all of the way (its been three weeks since I've assembled the sofa).", 
    "This sofa was the largest purchase I've done so far with overstock, and to my surprise, it looks amazing in my living room. Simple and easy instructions, and it only took me 10 minutes to put this piece together.Super soft and I love how neutral the color is, and how comfortable the fabric feels when I sit on this lovely sofa.Don't pass this one up!", 
    "This sofa is just amazing :) I love it , it looks so beautiful and it's also comfortable", 
    "Pros: Good for small spaces, nice color, back body strong, nice legs, good pillows, easy to assemble. Cons: Material old fashion (corduroy), back cushions not as strong as bottom ones, bottom body support needs more strength. Overall for the price it's worth it! Comfortable, decent and is better than a futon. With the 5 year warranty, Can't complain!", 
    "This couch was for my guest area upstairs. I had a lot of fun putting it together. Looks nice.", 
    "Easy to assemble, wears well. A good value.", 
    "When the couch arrived the right seat cushion cover was broken. It took an age to get me a new one. Now, the zip has broken on the other seat cushion cover. This is despite very limited use. Absolutely regret buying this couch.", 
    "The cushions are firm and very very comfortable.", 
    "Great couch in a box! Super simple to put together and very comfy! Cushions are vacuum packed and need a day or two to completely inflate. Very easy to put together and really are pretty good quality! Fabric is also super soft and it's nice they include the pillows as well.", 
    "more like a long love seat than a couch, can't stretch out or nap on it. Check the length because they vary. Says only made to withstand <250 lbs each side. I donated it to my son for his apartment and replaced it", 
    "Great couch! Love the style and it's very comfortable. Good quality materials. Looks good in my home. So happy.", 
    "Not very close in color, more like light brown. Assembly required attaching back panel to base with velcro. Trouble was the velcro was on the wrong side along the base. Will have to use upholstery tacks to attach. Fits well with decor: \"early American nuclear test site\"", 
    "Couches Great! Easy assemble. Could do Without the throw pillows. Seem like they are half full of stuffing, but overall very happy with my choice.", 
    "The color is more tan than platinum. I'll keep it for awhile but I'm not completely satisfied with this purchase", 
    "The cushions come vacuum packed, so they are shipped super flat. When you release the bags, the cushions plump up, but they are very wrinkled. Also, the back cushions stay wrinkled for a long time, and they are also very plump, which leaves a little less sitting room than you would think. We keep hoping the back cushions will flatten out a little more so that there is more sitting surface.", 
    "Bad! Very bad! Cheap looking and very uncomfortable for its price\ud83d\ude21", 
    "Not terribly comfortable!", 
    "The cushions are too big. They stick out over the front of the sofa. Very firm and comfortable but does not look good at all.", 
    "Too Short and would be better for kids room", 
    "We are very happy with the purchase would suggest it to anyone looking for good furniture at low prioces", 
    "The color is great. Comfortable. Great value for the price.", 
    "This couch was not what I expected. It was delivered in a box and had to be assembled. The fabric is like a corduroy material. If I could return it I would.", 
    "Couch is much smaller than expected. Legs are not that great on it. Not worth it!!", 
    "I am very happy with the purchase I made. This sofa was put in my new office and I received a lot of compliments on it. Unfortunately, a client infested it with bed bugs, and despite being sprayed inside and out, I am getting rid of it. I will purchase another one though!!"
