    "This product arrived in two enormous boxes. The most complicated step in assembly was getting it out of the packaging. But! It arrived in excellent shape and it wasn't at all difficult to assemble. Took me about 2 hours once it was unpacked. It adds practical storage and great style to my new home office. Love it! Note: It is a bit unstable, so I will be bracing it to the wall.", 
    "Love the look of this bookcase, but it is ridiculously cheap construction. We used it for decorative knick knacks, and it's fine, but I sure wouldn't try to fill its shelves with books.", 
    "Great unit. It was easy to put together and has a cool looking style to it. Lots of room for my things.", 
    "Absolutely beautiful! I love the unique style and ample storage space. Great price for this piece.", 
    "Bent all over the place after 3 month. There were only about 5 books on the shelves.", 
    "I ordered this shelf from Overstock, It came with in a week. The instructions were clear and easy, and the parts were labeled. Looks good. The problem with this self is that it is unstable on carpet. (our whole house is carpeted) Even on a hardwood floor would be careful if you have kids that might lean or bump into it. Would have returned it, but to much trouble to disassemble and ship back. Plan to bracket it to the wall to make it stable.", 
    "This was easy to put together, but flimsy as can be. Not even 6 mo. old and the sides are bowing downward from the unsupported weight, and I don't have anything heavy on them. Very bad veneer, it's pressed wood and just horrible. Wish I hadn't bought it.", 
    "I bought this for my son. He said that it is hard to put together. We would not purchase another.", 
    "Not bad looking...but if you're looking for something that is stable, forget it. Very wobbly. It definitely cannot be in a position where someone might bump into it.", 
    "This is a great shelving system, sturdy, attractive and easy to assemble. However it is NOT 84 inches wide as it says in the description, it is 44\"wide. Even so, I really liked the looks of it so had to order another to fill the space I wanted to fill. If I'd known it wasn't 84\", I might have chosen a different product."
