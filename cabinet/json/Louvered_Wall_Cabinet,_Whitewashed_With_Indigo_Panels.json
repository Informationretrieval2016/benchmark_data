    "Falling apart made of press board. The shelves are to short to put bottles in. I usually like overstock items but was disappointed", 
    "we received this piece and we decided to keep it. we will make it work. It is not the best quality but for the price it is a good purchase. two of the wood hangers were broken off but my husband was able to fix .", 
    "Put in the bathroom above the toilet and it looks cute.Not made very well. Kind of cheap.But does look nice", 
    "Nice piece, but, arrived with slight damage to each bottom corners. I used glue to help fix the damage and some paint to cover the imperfections and decided to keep it in spite of the flaws.", 
    "We actually added this to our pretty modern bathroom that has dark cabinets and blues & grays on walls and countertops. It blends in with it all perfects. Somewhat shallow shelf space unfortunately, but has 3 tiers to spread out in. Also - there are 4 screw hooks on each corner in the back that require you to get an EXACT measure on to hang it properly. Luckily I'm a great measure with a ton of attention to detail, but would be nice if the manufacturer included a template to tape to the wall and screw into/over to get the precision required.", 
    "i put it up in my bedroom and it went perfectly with my decor.", 
    "looks nice, but the bottom of the cabinet arrived damaged. kept it anyway"
