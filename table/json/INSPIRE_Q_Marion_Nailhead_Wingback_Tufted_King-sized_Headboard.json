    "Despite my above ratings, I'm only giving this headboard a '3.' I do think it is a nice quality, good value and it really does look nice.lt foI am giving it a '3' for two reasons. First, the brackets on the headboard do not properly attach to the base of my bed. No matter how my husband and I reconfigured it, you can only bolt it to one side without drilling additional holes. Second, the headboard is not nearly as tall as is pictured. Creative camera angles I guess. Obviously my fault for not measuring - but I do wish it was taller.", 
    "I just received my headboard on Friday, it took almost 2 weeks to deliver. I am pleased with the look, it is much darker in person but its a really nice headboard. I love the nail heads, gives it a modern look. BUT I gave it a 3 because of the quality, this headboard IS BIGGER than my King size bed. My husband had to drill his own holes to make it the wings fit...also could not attach the bed frame to the headboard. The brackets attached are way off. It wasn't a cheap headboard so it was VERY disappointing to see how poorly the brackets and holes were done. The manufacturer NEEDS to look into this issue and correct the problem asap.", 
    "if it wasnt so expensive to ship back we would have. didnt fit the mattress right. the holes didnt match up correctly with a king", 
    "Love this bed, seems to be really great quality and the design is wonderful. I did not purchase the side rails so the headboard seems very wide compared to the metal frame we are using (King size). Would definitely recommend getting the whole set if possible. Would love great.", 
    "I purchased this headboard and loved the look and material. the only drawback was that it's 6\" wider than my king mattress. I was disappointed but still like the headboard and if I don't point it out you can't tell is is much larger than the mattress", 
    "It's nice but it doesn't for the bed frame. I ordered the correct size. So disappointed.", 
    "I ordered this frame because the picture show the whole frame ... the headboard with the sides, etc. To my surprise, when it was delivered, it didn't include the sides and back! Total disappointment!! do not order this bed!!!", 
    "I love this headboard however its been very difficult to find side rails that can go with this. I was so excited to get this only to go on a huge search. They show it with matching side boards however they do not sell them.....", 
    "Arrived, assembly required. Headboard slightly larger then my bed. Would like the platform bed to match but no king in beige linen available. How can I get one.", 
    "Loved the headboard. Shipped quickly. Very satisfied.", 
    "This headboard looks stunning in our room and takes our space to the next level! Easy to assemble and well constructed, it is a great alternative to more expensive versions. It is not quite as tall looking as the picture (can only see two rows of buttons over the pillows), but is an eye catcher nonetheless. We are very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "It's nice. But the nailhead don't seem evenly set as to the depth. It's larger than expected snd the attachment to my bed frame does not line up with my standard frame. It's a nice piece snd we'll probably mount it to the wall. Good price,", 
    "Looks great, but I was shocked when it was too big for my king size bed. We love the look, so my husband had to drill holes in order to attach the headboard to our bed frame.", 
    "I needed to get rid of a huge dark sleigh bed and this look was just right. I priced then everywhere and considered making my own...I love projects. I found this one at a reasonable price. It is well made however is quite wide and did not fit our frame. We decided it was stable enough to simply let it stand free. I ordered white/cream but this is definitely tan but I like it. Bottom line is I love it.", 
    "We really like our headboard. Looks like leather and makes a statement in our master bedroom.", 
    "Love this headboard. Easy to assemble, nice looking and makes a statement. It is not real leather but for the price the quality and sturdy nature of the headboard I'm a happy camper!", 
    "Love it! Perfect for our master. Beautiful!", 
    "The bed frame and headboard is poorly constructed, using wood and very thin linen. The headboard does not secure tightly to the feet supporting it (only 1 bolt on each side and 3 side bolts for a 5' span).", 
    "Love it! Great look and worth the price."
