    "I really love this set, but you will need a power drill driver. The screws don't line up and it requires getting all the screws started and a drill driver to get them in as a lot of them are at bad angles. The cushions are beautiful and rain just beads up and runs off. The table just sets on four suctions cups so we are going to find clips to hold it. I love the way it looks, but assembly was difficult and time consuming.", 
    "Great looking, love the color very convenient looks great and my porch."
