    "I was excited to purchase this filing cabinet because I had a difficult time finding one that locked mulitple drawers and looked like a decent piece of office furniture. I read in the reviews that it was cumbersome to assemble, and I can tell you that my husband's frustration with this fully supports that notion. It took him nearly a day to assemble partly because we received instructions in Spanish, not English. Also, there are multiple parts that do not fit together well. As a result, the drawers needed to be adjusted quite a bit and I don't know if they will ever be perfect. Once I added my regularly-sized files, I had to shim up the front of the cabinet to avoid it trying to tip over when the bottom drawer is open. I am happy with the look and functionality of the cabinet, but at this price point it doesn't weigh out the frustration it takes to put it together and the fact that the parts don't fit together nicely. Two corners on the particle board for the backside were damaged as well, even though you will never see it. I just expected a little more for the amount of money I paid but it will work for a home office. I would hate to have to use it every day! The bottom of the drawers use particle board, and I laid some larger files there because they don't fit in the stand file hangers and the weight is supported just fine.", 
    "All the reviews same the same thing and I should have listened. I experienced the same: 1) the directions are horrible. It did take a while to put together, and the assembly wasn't that difficult - after you figure out on your own what to do. It would be MUCH easier with better directions. 2) the top two drawers align with the frame, but the bottom two (file cabinets) do not. AT ALL. They are about 1-1.5 inches indented from the outer frame. 3) the lock is shoddy. It locks, yes, but when you give locked drawers a tug, the opposite side of the cabinet still tugs open a little. Also, note that the lateral drawers don't hold files laterally. Instead, they hold two rows of files per drawer, perpendicular to the front of the drawer. Sort of a waste of space, as if the files were held laterally, you could get a lot more in each drawer. I should have noticed this in the picture with the drawer slightly open. Overall, it looks nice, but I expected \"espresso\" to be chocolate brown - this is more blackish brown - and doesn't match my espresso desk. For the money, it's not worth the piece of furniture purchased.", 
    "This is one of the most poorly manufactured pieces of furniture that I have ever put together. I'm pretty good at putting furniture together, but this took an entire day because so many pieces didn't actually fit - holes had to be adjusted, pieces had to be forced together to fit, etc. When we finally got it together, it managed to stay together for just a few months before drawers started coming apart and literally falling onto the drawers below. This is the biggest waste of money ever.", 
    "I will never buy the product again and not ever tell anyone to buy it. Cheap lock. every thing about it was way below any thin that should be on the market...", 
    "Product was poorly made. Instructions were terrible and also were wrong. I would never buy any product from this company again. It was a waste of my time and energy.", 
    "This file cabinet arrived with several damaged pieces. I have assembled several furniture products from Overstock and other companies without incident. The directions for assembly and the parts were horrible. Difficult to see parts, not clearly labled, and unable to see the positioning from the directions.", 
    "Summary: \u0095 Drawers do not align \u0095 Cabinet topples forward if one if the file drawers is filled and open \u0095 File drawers may have a design flaw causing them to fall apart I purchased this file cabinet along with some Inval desks on behalf of the office I work for. The desks were as to be expected for the price- meaning they are particle board (standard in this price range), but sturdy and look nice. The cabinet however, looks OK, if you are willing to ignore the fact that the drawers do not align (the top 2 smaller drawers align with the frame, where to bottom large drawers sink in). But the bigger problem is how unstable it is once the drawers are filled with files. The cabinet is not heavy enough in the back, so we have to be careful when opening the drawers as it easily topples forward. In addition, the front of one of the bottom drawers dislodged causing it to fall apart when I was filing.", 
    "The cabinet is entirely too complicated to assemble.", 
    "Product is very nice one assembled. It comes completely disassembled. The directions are a bit confusing and assembly takes some know how. Once assembled its very nice.", 
    "Save yourself 5 hours and a massive headache and skip this one. There are way too many pieces and the directions lack clarity. I had to contact the manufacturer because one of the pieces wasn't in the box. (customer service was great) not worth the price or the time investment.", 
    "Worst assembly project ever. The instructions were some of the worst I've ever seen. Finally managed to put it together and it just looks really flimsy and cheap. Oh well.", 
    "top drawer and locking mechanism is a little flimsy, but the rest of the cabinet is solid.", 
    "This is a nice enough unit for the price , once it is put together. A bit of a challenge to assemble and the directions not the easiest to follow.", 
    "Difficult to put together. Initially put the top drawer lock in backwards but even after it was refitted correctly the drawer still doesn't lock. Doesn't really matter as I didn't plan to use the lock anyway. Deep enough bottom drawer for hanging files to hang properly and the top three drawers are long enough to lay plans flat.", 
    "To all of those who wrote reviews on this item that indicate the instructions are flat out wrong, just a note, I put this thing together in about two hours, ALMOST made a mistake on the placement of the tracks for the lower file drawers. The picture makes it look like the tracks are misaligned. They are not. It's a raised perspective shot that's almost impossible to see, but it's there. Use common sense when reading these poorly-written instructions, and at the end of the day, you will have no problems. The only reason I'm not giving this item five stars is because the drawers wiggle back & forth a little bit (bad tracks, I'm assuming) when they are pulled out fully. Aside from that, it's a pretty solid piece of furniture that looks very nice in my home office.", 
    "I was hesitated in ordering this because of problem reviews. My husband, who is handy said that he would make it work. However, putting it together really presented no problems. The directions are horrible, but it worked well just following the numbered pieces. Some reviews cited drawers that don't fit quite right, but we had no trouble. The back pieces were cracked and from other reviews, I believe that Overstock would have replaced them. However, once they were put in place, the cracks were difficult to see and once the drawers were installed, they couldn't be seen at all, so I decided not to seek replacement. By no means is this a fine piece of furniture, but for the price paid, it is good value. It's in a home office and provides much storage space with two additional drawers which I use for extra printing and office supplies. I also purchased the desk which matches this and it's a nice set.", 
    "This product looks pretty good in the pictures, but the quality is not terrific. I don't believe it would hold the amount of files it's sized for as it is not all that sturdy. It was a little difficult to put together compared to some of the other home assembly furniture we have purchased in the past. My husband ended up adding an additional panel of plywood on the back to give it more rigidity. It looks nice, but I don't imagine it will hold up well and we will would not purchase this name brand product again.", 
    "It's very flimsy and cheaply made...not the quality I expected. It was also missing a part.", 
    "This item is exactly what I wanted to include in my office space for my new business, no other product exists like it, therefore I bought it, knowing the reviews were so bad. Not happy! No directions included, very poor construction. A total nightmare to put together! Now that it is together, quality is very very poor.", 
    "I purchased 3 of these to go wall-to-wall in my office. Lots of drawer space. It's great to have the height and width of these. I paired it with two bookcases on top of each end one and put a TV in the middle. Really made the entire room look spacious and streamlined. Only downside is that the drawers are a bit rickety, but for the price, it's still good.", 
    "Several scratches in the drawers when received. Lock mechanism does not work. Will not line up with holes in the pre fab cuts. Overall is made very cheaply and as I do want another one as needed 2 of them. Do not believe I will order another one.", 
    "Just recieved box, Product arrived damage. Husband had to glue the damage piece in order to work. May take to much time to return the item.", 
    "Normal mid grade cabinet. Works well & looks good. I don't feel it would hold up to heavy duty use, but for a home office we think it's fine. Putting it together takes a while, but is pretty straight forward. Parts were well marked.", 
    "This was a mess. Too many steps to construct, holes were not properly drilled in relation to the instruction guide. The pieces were cheap and poor quality. We boxed it up gave it back.", 
    "I am very good at building furniture, many of the pieces in my corporate apartment are **** and I never had a problem. I could not make this file become square enough to get the drawers to fit. The rails were wider than the drawer and after 10 hours of working on building this I simply gave up. It was flimsy, broken, scratched, and ugly. It was too frustrating to take it part to return it. I threw it away.", 
    "This is a beautifully functional cabinet. I had my 15 year old help me put it together....not too difficult, and went smoothly. The directions are easy to follow.", 
    "very satisfied with the product - would recommend to a friend", 
    "when you first assemble it which was fairly easy as the instructions weren't terrible it seems pretty flimsy. but when we filled the drawers up it seemed much more sturdy. the drawer slides were very good and sturdy. it was worth the price but i wouldn't have paid much more for it.", 
    "I bought this piece as opposed to investing in a much more expensive one. Once assembled, it isn't a bad looking storage/file cabinet and it serves my purposes. I don't expect this piece of furniture to last a long time because of the materials. The biggest complain I have is that the assembly instructions were a NIGHTMARE.", 
    "Easy to put together and has great storage space. Very sturdy piece!", 
    "I am looking at the cabinet right now and shaking my head. I am not sure how much the cabinet is at fault or if all the blame falls directly on my husband. I was so excited when I went to purchase it. It was modern, not bulky looking at all and came with additional storage. It was packaged extremely well which is a good thing since it is very heavy. All of the hardware parts were put together in one plastic bag and there are a lot of individual pieces that needed to be separated. I was not there when my husband assembled the cabinet but I know that he did not go in order and skipped ahead to save some time since this was a long ordeal. DO NOT SKIP AHEAD. He caused himself grief as well as damage to my beautiful cabinet. DO NOT POUND IN THE HARDWARE. Tap lightly. The bottom cabinet is grotesque looking. There are no less then three areas that are damaged because he did not follow the directions exactly. It looks like someone took a chisel and dug out the areas. The file drawer above the damaged one does not close right at all. I do not know if that is a different issue or not. This cabinet caused a lot of stress and I had to promise my husband never to purchase another item online that needed assembly. That being said if he had followed the directions exactly things may have turned out differently.", 
    "This product blew me away!! Very high quality and really heavy-duty!! I had ton's of files which I transferred from a large commercial lateral file cabinet that I replaced with this Inval file cabinet and this cabinet held it all, with room to spare. Definitely more appealing than some metal commercial unit and decor-friendly to be used in my home, matching other espresso furniture I have throughout my house. My home office is also a spare bedroom and my kid's friends & our guests use it when they visit. I have peace of mind knowing that these files & drawers are locked up tight and safely stored securely. I bought the bookcase/hutch to match this and it fits perfectly atop this unit which saved me a tome of space in this bedroom. Very happy with it & would recommend these products to everyone! Can't beat the price on anything comparable either!!"
