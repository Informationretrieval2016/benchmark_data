    "Great storage capacity and reasonable to put together!", 
    "We just assembled our trunk and we're loving it. It is just as pictured and sturdy enough for our purposes. Someone asked if the file storage goes all the way across and someone else answered that it only goes half way. This is inaccurate. The files storage goes the whole length of the bench and the storage compartment lies above it.", 
    "Cute and has heft. We are using as a \"hope chest\" for teenager. She loves it. Doesn't seem cheaply made. It needs a pneumatic slow close so no one splashes a finger but it doesn't have that feature.", 
    "It's nice, not as sturdy as I had anticipate but definitely adequate for my purposes."
