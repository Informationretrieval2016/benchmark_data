    "I am normally a crate & barrel or pottery barn purchaser for home items, but for my 10 year old daughters room, was a little leary about ivory cloth headboard being ruined. For the price and quality - this will not disappoint and my daughter LOVED it!", 
    "I bought two of these for my daughters and couldnt have been more happier with the color and the fabric. Very easy to install and my girls love it.", 
    "Perfect headboard for our guest room. Ordered a matching pair of twins and they are just what I wanted. Shipped in sturdy boxes and were easy to attach to the bed frames.", 
    "Not very sturdy. Attached to a sleep number bed for my mother. It's very wobbly. Otherwise it looks nice.", 
    "Very nice fabric. Well made. I am very pleased.", 
    "This looks like a custom made headboard for very affordable price.", 
    "I bought two and they are beautiful! THANKS", 
    "I am totally happy with my headboard and the price.", 
    "great price and looks great in my guest room", 
    "I love the look, beautiful, warm, classic. Looks perfect with all the other furnishings.", 
    "I purchased this for my daughter's twin bed. Quality, nice color, and makes the room so lovely. My daughter was so happy. She just loves it!", 
    "Fabric is beautiful, frame is durable, but you need very good hardware for the headboard to stop shaking. One came with corners and I am hoping to finally attach them. The other didn't and so finding them would be a challenge or expense. If you know what to do, that's great, otherwise the bed will shake.", 
    "These are beautiful. Exceeded expectation. Easily assembled and attached to bed frame. LOVE THE LOOK!"
