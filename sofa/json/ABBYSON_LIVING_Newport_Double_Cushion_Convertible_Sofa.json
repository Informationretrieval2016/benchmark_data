    "If your a college kid and need something sturdy, easy to easy, nice quality and affordable in price. Of all the sofabed I've searched online for this definitely the right style, size and price. Although I expected shipping to be closer to the 6 weeks, it came in around 2 weeks. Its perfect for a small room, its 72 inches so still long enough to fit someone who is up to 6 feet comfortable. Even though I use this daily and have a comforter over the futon, you dont really need it because this thing has an extra layer of cushion which is nice. You can get a cheap comforter though if you need, but again you dont need it. I love my sofabed, saved alot of time ordering this online and it paid off. This is great and I reccomend for all frat kids, sorority kids, dorm kids, or even anybody that needs a sofa convertbible bed for their home.", 
    "Very nice looking sofa sleeper but definitely can't fit two, even thin people. Was a little difficult to work the mechanism. I still don't think I have it down since we don't use it that often, could have done with some instructions. Overall good quality for the price.", 
    "I bought this futon for my second bedroom/loft/office type room. I live in a 2BR urban condo and the 2nd bedroom needs to serve multiple functions. The futon is a definite firm seating and wen folded open the futon is not the most comfortable sofa bed type option I've ever slept on but for infrequent guests it's fine. It would be tough to spend more than 2 nights on it. It fits for 1 person easily, for 2 they will be sleeping very close! ITA with the reviewer- it is slightly narower than a full size bed. Delivery was exceptionally fast! 1 week. Oversize delivery process was as expected and hassle free. I set it up in minutes. It took me longer to haul the boxes to the dumpster than to \"assemble it\" or rather screw on the legs. At this price point- it feels and looks like a pricier couch.", 
    "I purchased this for an office because it matches some of the other chairs that I have. I have received complements on how it looks and it seems very comfortable although i have not used it as a sofabed.", 
    "got this for my son's college apt - the guys love it. it sits very comfortably. is comfortable for 1 person to sleep on. The \"leather\" is soft and comfortable and has held up very well (2 yrs so far). I would recommend this for college age kids - it gets the job done.", 
    "I must say that this sofa is more comfortable than I thought it would be, and it really looks good in my small living room. I needed an armless, smaller sofa to not overwhelm this space, yet it has enough room on it to seat 3 people. I also needed a durable material - faux leather, for my dogs, who can easily destroy any other fabric, including micro-fiber. This looks like real leather, but stands up to a great deal of punishment from my furry family. I can easily wipe it clean, or vacuum off dirt and fur. I imagine it would be good for children too. The added plus is the clean, modern design... just a great purchase. By the way, the delivery service not only unboxed it, they assembled it - just putting on the legs, but I was amazed by their help, and very pleased!", 
    "The product looks great, seats three people comfortably, sleeps one large person or two small peeps with relative comfort. But one would think the manufacturer would pay more attention to the frame & legs during the engineering process. The rear leg brackets were cock-eyed (not seated properly, the triangular piece poorly glued to the frame. Two wood screws for leg brackets were completely stripped. I had to to re-seat the brackets (barely enough room to re-seat effectively.) But knowing what a nightmare the return process was, I managed to stabilize the rear legs. Crossing my fingers that it will hold under normal use. You'd think I would have learned my lesson by now buying furniture online. Just another example of being too much in a hurry to shop.", 
    "The sofa arrived and we put it together, it was so poorly made and were very disappointed. I returned the $371 dollar sofa and had to pay $257 shipping to do so despite pleas to customer service. Buyer beware.", 
    "very nice and comfortable, light, was assembled in 5 min recommend for the dorm room.", 
    "Love this futon. My kittens tore the first one up so I bought another one for upstairs. Price is right. Looks great. Might not be the most comfortable bed but makes a great office couch.", 
    "I looked and looked for the perfect futon for our extra bedroom. This one is perfect! It's very, very comfortable, the fabric is soft, and it looks awesome! It came sooner than expected, and was put together in about 1 minute. If you are looking for something that looks great, AND is comfortable, this is it.", 
    "The size and price of this item was on spot for me. I needed something small and my son sleeps on it every night since we got it while we wait to move back his bed. It's attractive and saw others much more expensive. I'm glad I went with this choice. It was not too bad putting it together either. No complaints whatsoever, and it's holding up very well.", 
    "I have only had this couch for 4 months with limited use in my office and the seem on the bottom has already ripped. It is unsightly and I'm trying to figure out if I can fix it, but still don't know how to do it. The quality is very poor and I would not recommend anyone purchasing this! You will get better quality for a lower price at XXXX.", 
    "Really disappointed with this couch/futon! We were looking for a decent couch for a good price, this isn't it. We were going to return it right we we got it but decided we would wait a week and see if we could find a better couch for about the same price. We didn't so we decided to keep it and unfortunately we really don't like this couch/futon. We are trying to sell it now because we did find much better quality furniture at the new *** that opened near by. We would like to return it but we have already had it for a month. When you rest on the back of the couch it makes a clicking sound each time because of the way it's designed to recline and lay flat. Not comfortable to sit on either, and defiantly not \"cozy\" to relax on!", 
    "It does come in a big box, and just a few bolts to twist for assembly. The faux leather material is very soft and quite comfortable; this is firm enough to provide support for sitting but the covering is soft enough for quick naps. I don't fold it down so I don't know how well the mechanism will hold up, but for an inexpensive but functional piece of furniture, I am very happy with this purchase", 
    "I bought this hoping to keep it in my office, and use as a guest room as well. The couch opens up and lays \"flat,\" but there is a valley through the middle .......very uncomfortable for sleeping. It is a little thinner than I expected too. Works pretty well as a couch, but you would need another mattress pad or egg crate to make it sleep worthy. After this experience, I do not recommend buying a couch or bed online - returning oversize items is a huge pain!", 
    "Really good item - very comfortable, easy to use functions, space saver, sturdy construction! what more can i ask for. I am very pleased.", 
    "this step seems repetative to the questions asked before. i find this part unnessisary. i like it, it works for me and serves it's purpose.", 
    "It's exactly what I wanted. I'm very happy with it. Plus, the delivery service was beyond superb - they scheduled the delivery on a convenient time for me, brought it up the stairs and assembled it.", 
    "Nicely made and easy to open. Comfortable for short term sleeping.", 
    "Leather futon with extra cushioning, very comfortable, soft & elegant looking.", 
    "This sofa adds a lot of style to the living room. It's also practical as it turns into a full bed when we have people over.Gave it 4 stars instead of 5, as we just purchased it and we have yet to see how it rates in terms of product lifetime.", 
    "At first it was very hard to get this couch to open to a bed, but after receiving help from Overstock customer service it worked great. Love the color. My pets love to sit on the back behind me.", 
    "It's a nice futon, good quality. Feels a little light-weight which makes it easy for one person to setup but also feels kind of flimsy when used as a couch. It's somewhat comfortable and a cheap alternative to a sofabed, however overall I would probably have opted for a sofa instead had I tested this out in person considering how small and light-weight it feels overall.", 
    "This looks great but is hard on your bones. I got it for my kids basement to watch tv. They prefer to sit on beanbags on the floor. The back is very low and just not comfy. Would be a good waiting room sofa. Not some place to hang out for a long time. Would have returned it if I could have. Wish I hadn't bought it.", 
    "Very easy assembly, very comfortable, reasonable price, good ordering delivery experience and a perfect fit my new apartment! Two thumbs up!! Would not hesitate to recommend to my friends and coworkers! I am one happy consumer !", 
    "I needed a couch for a rarely used bedroom/office. I wanted to be able to sleep guests there on occasion. It was perfect for this. I also had a stairway that restricted the size of couch I could put upstairs.The couch is pretty comfortable, but I wouldn't want to spend hours watching TV on it. It's better for something that is used occasionally. I'm a \"handy\" 60 year old widow lady andI was able to assemble it by myself. this is my third purchase of furniture from OS. I've always been happy with the results.", 
    "I have made over 5 large purchases from overstock, mostly based on the reviews. For the most part I've been satisfied with the quality. This sofa I bought for a city apartment that I use during the week while I am working. I wanted leather, I am still not sure the \"pc\" leather is leather. I have 4 leather sofas in my ranch home and this one just isn't the same. I planned on using this sofa for a guest bed, but it is very uncomfortable to sleep on unless you stick to one side. My daughter refuses to sleep on it. When anyone sits on it , it squeaks and the back feels a bit floppy. It is not comfortable to sit on for more than about 30 minutes. I don't think it is worth the price, maybe $$$-$$$. The sofa does look nice from the front, but flimsy from the back. I am very disappointed with this purchase.", 
    "Decent for the price, does not take up too much space", 
    "This couch looks very nice, especially for staging a small mid-century modern space. I bought it in white. It is very uncomfortable to sleep on. I tried. Ugh.", 
    "Very doable for a 1 or 2 night stay. Easy to clean, and very sharp looking as a sofa in the den. Price point well... worth the money spent. Delievery was a cinch, and we are very pleased~ Thank you Overstock!", 
    "I used this for my grand kids on holiday. Perfect for the room and I can use it as a couch later. Very convenient. The delivery man even unpack and move it upstairs for me.", 
    "So sweet, I'm getting another.", 
    "This is a good looking sturdy futon. Nice to sit on it (not for too long) I could just take a nap if on it as is without turning it into a bed. Once flat the surface is uneven and can be discomforting. I am 5'9\" and my feet slightly go over . As a temporary solution this is fine.", 
    "i bought it 1 week ago and was sitting always in the same place and now this place toooo soft and feels like you sitting lower then it was . and also when you spread out the bed 2 part of it higher then main part of couch super uncomfortable to sleep . DONT waste your money on it !!! better pay twice more and get reallly nice couch then this ******** ; )", 
    "the best product thanks you", 
    "Very poor quality! The wooden par where legs were attached got broken in less then 3 months. If you want to pay ***$ for nothing, good luck! The customer service cannot do anything with it. No refund, no replacement! Very disappointed.", 
    "Bought this sofa for our Sons' fraternity house room and he loves it.", 
    "Small, sleek and functional. Looks exactly like the picture, no surprises. Easy to make into bed. Looks and feels high quality even though not real leather. Delivery men were polite and professional.", 
    "I'm happy with this purchase and feel that it is as described. The sofa is nice to look at, easy to clean and I paid a very reasonable price for it. The material feels comfortable to the touch, but the sofa is definitely for those who prefer an extra-firm mattress for sleeping.", 
    "I got this in White for my son's college apartment for a retro look, very cute and comfy although not quite sure how it would also be used as a bed, as it is a short couch", 
    "Difficult to sleep for two skinny adults. It's also hard and not comfortable at all. I need to add pillow pads for guest to survive the night.", 
    "Quick Shipping, Easy Assembly, Good Looking and Comfortable !!", 
    "Moved into new place and needed a couch for the moment that could serve as a spare bed when/if needed. Took about 4 weeks to arrive from ordering. The box was relatively big, but two relatively lazy people were able to move it up a flight of stairs, no problem. Easy set up (look for the legs in a hidden pocket under the seat), looks great, feels comfy (so far), pretty easy to fold up or down if you grab it from the middle of the seat back. Would recommend!", 
    "I was sent the wrong color at first. it is a nice futon", 
    "good quality product. not quite as long as I thought but my grandson liked it when he visited and he is hard to please.", 
    "this sofa is IMPOSSIBLE to schedule a delivery for!! i went out of town and tried to schedule my delivery numerous times and was not able to do so. i just want this sofa and can't get it delivered to my house. THEN overstock charged me delete my order completely so now i still have no sofa!! i am furious with the customer support/service at overstock & also the 3rd party delivery service that DOES NOT DELIVER. will never come back to overstock again.", 
    "this is perfect for my husband's small office. My husband thought he would not like it. He said if it is not comfortable we were sending it back! He takes a nap on it every day so he does like it very much. have not tried it company so don't know how well the convertible option works.", 
    "WOW the sofa looks really great!! After reading some reviews I had second thoughts about this sofa because of the price. I'm so glad I went with this one, the style, look and feel looks better than expected for the price.", 
    "After looking for months, I bought this futon for our cottage. I was hoping for comfortable seating that doubled as extra bedding. This is exactly what I got. Unlike other futons, this cushion is very thick. It is a comfortable to hang out on, and to sleep on. I liked this so much, I ended up buying a second one for the same room. We gets tons of compliments on it. The white is very bright, so it is great to show off fun accent pillows. Love this purchase.", 
    "Very attractive and chic couch - we actually purchase two aand are very pleased with our purchase.", 
    "Great product! Nice and soft cushions. The faux leather is pretty nice too. And another thing I love is that it is superrrr easy to use and turn into a bed ... I'm very happy!! I would buy another one if I had a space for it.", 
    "I would definitely recommend this item to anyone sending their kid off to college! Perfect size for even a studio size place. I am impressed at the sturdiness and comfort that this sofa holds. Really great!", 
    "This sofa bed is perfect item for your college kid. I was amazed at the quality of the sofa and the foam cushioning adds for extra comfort. For the price you can't do better than this. O.co is a great site.", 
    "The couch itself is very nice looking, and the mattress double cushion is comfortable. However, the left front leg broke off within the first 15 minutes we sat on the couch. The iron plate the leg attached to that is screwed into the frame is where the item broken with 3 screws breaking clean-off into the frame and two that are untouched. This could be a fluke, but then again maybe two adults under 175 each is to close to the weight it can support.", 
    "This futon was a great price. The quality is quite good and the leather is very soft. Great for lounging. I would highly recommend the futon!", 
    "The Newport Double Cushion Leather Convertible Sofa arrived 3 weeks after I ordered it. My feedback is that for the price you pay, this is a great buy! The quality is good and the design worked with my decor. I had one of my guest use it and they love it.", 
    "My wife bought this sofabed for my office so it could be used as seating or a relax area when I wanted to rest. What a great item, I love it. The black is so clean and modern loooking, completely turned around my office. It is awesome!", 
    "I just received my couch, shipping went very easy and the delivery company was great! It's a really nice looking couch and actually very comfortable. I live in a good size studio but it doesn't take up too much room and looks really modern in here.", 
    "Don't think this is worth the price. The quality is pretty shoddy. In less than a month the leg was pulling off and the fabric on the bottom was coming off. The folding mechanism to flatten the bed is clumsy and not easy to do. Keep looking is my advice.", 
    "Got my sofa bed yesterday and I am happy with my purchase. I'm a loyal shopper of Overstock since 2005 and I have to say only once in a while that I would not like an item...well, I am glad to say that this is on my favorite list. Seating cushion fits just right. Especially with kids around the house, I don't want a sofa that will break in a few months. This seem to hold up very well right now against my 2 kids so far. I love the extra functionalities with the back cushion. When I position it flat for my kids to lay on there to play it helps support the whole sofa very sturdy. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend it for family use.", 
    "Love the look. It fit perfectly in my office. Would recommend this item......it looks exactly like the picture online. JB", 
    "Nice design, beautiful leather and the quality is well made. We recommend the Newport!", 
    "I absolutely love this product! It has given life to my living room and actually it is the hot topic whenever guest visit my home. And i say \"I got it from Overstock.com\" and eyes pop! :) Love the brown so much, bought the black too!", 
    "This is a great futon for a small space. Slightly smaller than full, but provides a great place to sit and a nice extra space for a guest. Looks terrific and way more expensive than it's price. My only complaint is that it is not marked anywhere that the legs and hardware are inside the the bottom of the futon. I was looking for over 30 minutes trying to find the legs. I thought they were missing but then saw a zipper pouch underneath the sofa and they were there with instructions. Then it only took 10 minutes. So CHECK THE BOTTOM! Overall, I love it and would but it again!", 
    "I thought this was a great deal for a futon that doesn't look like other futons out there. It is more funky and modern. I was worried the PU-Coated leather wouldn't look nice but it actually looks very nice. I would recommend this!", 
    "Fast delivery and excellent product. Arrives in a big strong cardboard box packaged very well. I eagerly started to unwrapp and took the legs from the bottom of the futon and installed the metal legs. I bought the brown one but I really want to get the black for my bedroom to match my black leather bed. I just love it. Everyone that comes in the house loves it to. Hard to believe this is a futon.Thank you so much Overstock. Great buy.", 
    "It would have been a perfect sofa-sleeper, modern, compact, attractive, but it will accomodate someone no taller than 5'10\". Too bad! A sleeper should be practical as well! Why could it not be a foot and a half longer? As it it tall visitors will sleep with their feet dangling in the air.....", 
    "Very easy to assemble and looks extremely nice for the price. The cushions are a bit firm but comfortable and overall, I'm happy with this purchase!", 
    "I love this double cushion convertible sofa. It really is sleek and modern design. It does everything I need, act as a sofa for my guest room, turn into a bed when needed, and provides taste to the room itself. Really pleased with this and highly reccommend.", 
    "This is really nice sofabed and pretty satisfied with Overstock.com and their service. It came in a box packaged very well and required us to assemble the metal legs. Assembly took 10 minutes and were pleased with the final result. Looks pretty expensive and worth the price!", 
    "This product is a futon. Nothing more and nothing (much) less. The material is \"PU leather\"- this does not seem anything like real leather to me. While this is probably acceptable for a futon, don't plan on putting it any any place where you think it will make the place feel modern or upscale.", 
    "Nice looking,easy to convert into bed,great for a small room. Does not look like a cheap futon. Very modern. I had chosen the white leather. Leather looks great. . I would recommend this sofa if you are looking for a peice of furniture to be place in a office or guess area", 
    "This is a great futon! It exceeded my expectations. The modern looking metal legs and durable and sleek leather is attractive. The sitting and resting area itself is very comfortable. Nice back support too. The mattress cover has a very neat and crisp look. My son assembled the futon legs with my assistance in no time.", 
    "I purchased the black leather futon and we really like it. We just finish the assembly which was very easy process. We are now sitting on it and enjoying the piece. It was delivered by two delivery men which was really cool. I'm a single woman but it was easy to assemble (just putting legs at the bottom) by myself. It is very comfortable to sit and the quality is very excellent. I had been searching the sofa for a long and finally purchased this. I did the right thing and am very satisfied with this order.I orginally wanted a white one, but the black color is more neutral for our room. I can go for the mordern style living room with this sofa as well. This was a fantastic purchase. Thanks, overstock!!", 
    "I received my sofa, and I really liked the way it looked, but within ONE week, the stitching started coming loose on a part of the seating. This makes me really angry, because it will be hard to stitch, at least for me. I know when I try to repair the sofa, let will show, ruining the looks, for as long as I have it.", 
    "Narrow as a sofa, not so comfy or thick..Easy to put and use..", 
    "I would love to rate the product but I have not received it yet. It will be 1 month tomorrow since we ordered it.We are a motel and need it for our business. Any suggestions on a closer supplier to us for an equivelant product", 
    "Great futon and price from Overstock. Pretty satisfied. I wouldnt given 5 stars if Overstock had the sofabed brought into my home and assembled the legs. I just thought that was a normal thing with online furniture ordering. Other than that, real happy with the sofabed.", 
    "Thank you OS.com for prompting this review. I like your customer service very much. Do I like my couch? Yes, very much however I am not happy with the lack of ease in which it folds down or back up into the sofa couch/bed. The mechanism makes a strange clanking clicking sound,and it is difficult to catch the right position without some quirky patience. My friend who is also a handyman said its fine, just gotta fuss with it a bit. All this brings up my experience receiving it from the delivery guys. Three fellows arrived and seemed to be struggling with keeping my item upright without it dropping, they almost dropped it in front of me a few times. It didn't drop but the box was a bit banged up in a certain area. Nevertheless I escorted them to my apt with the box. The guy wanted me to (hurry up and sign) for delivery of the goods although he was patient anyway. I guessed they had a schedule they had to keep. This particular process caused me concern because I remember the CSR on the phone saying with this special delivery arrangement it was best that I take the item out of the box first before signing otherwise I might have to pay for shipping to return. Well that meant another 15 minutes and somehow it seemed unrealistic when all this guy wanted to do was get me to sign the papers and leave. I said to the guy well it looks a bit banged up I hope the couch is ok and we looked through an opening in the box near the banged up part and decided it didn't look like the couch had visible damage. I signed and he left. I put N/A on many of the statements I was to sign off on. When I opened it there was no visible damage. We assembled it easily but when it came time for me to practice collapsing it into a bed and back up to sofa position I noticed the mechanism was acting strangely. I couldn't help remembering the delivery events and wondering if in fact something had happened. It seemed too complicated returning it very complicated so I didn't call or say anything to OS. All I wanted was for it to be an easy process converting into sofa and back. I'm just disappointed it doesn't open and close smoothly. I won't be using it that way much anyway. It'll mostly be in sofa position. I'll live with it, I like the looks of it and the material quality is good. I just won't buy furniture online anymore. I'll buy other types of things perhaps. I do want another couch that OS advertises but its too much risk and I wish returning stuff like this were easier even though its offered as an option it isn't an easy option with the delivery deal I ended up with.", 
    "no complaints other than it took forever to receive this ; about 5 weeks", 
    "I wanted to give this as a gift as a gift to my wife. NOW I CANT!!!!!"
