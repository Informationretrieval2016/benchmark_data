    "I got the black leather full-sized headboard. It looks exactly like it did online, I love it -- but be prepared for about 30-40 minutes of set up.", 
    "I really like the headboard, we did get the parts in a Ziploc bag so it had obviously been returned prior. There was a part missing and they didn't have them anymore so they gave us options. We took a discount and my husband made the missing brace with wood.", 
    "This is the second tufted headboard I have ordered from this company. Both have been for guest bedrooms, and I have been very happy with both of them. They are well constructed, nicely covered, workmanship is great. This one seems to have a strip of nailheads applied but are not hand applied individually. I ordered a full-size gray headboard and it is a slight bit darker than what I anticipated, but I am happy with it. I would call it light medium gray . Overall, I would order this again.", 
    "Very pretty especially for my teen daughter's room. But was very difficult to attach to a bed frame and once it was attached, it was very wobbly and squeaky.", 
    "Purchased the cream and love it! Received so many wonderful compliments.", 
    "and at a great price. Looks even better in person.", 
    "I really liked this headboard. I thought the quality was very good, easy to assemble and was exactly as shown on the website. Unfortunately my daughter didn't feel the same so I had to return it. Returning it was very easy which is greatly appreciated. I will continue to order for Overstock because I've never been disappointed.", 
    "We ordered the grey linen headboard. It looks exactly like the pictures show and we were happy with the look. When we went to put it together the directions were not super clear but we managed to figure it out pretty quickly. Unfortunately one of the predrilled holes for the bolt that attaches the bed frame to the headboard was drilled at an angle and it made it impossible to bolt. We ended up just bolting three (instead of four) points of contact. Not ideal but not worth the hassle of exchanging it. Overstock gave us a small refund for the hassle and inconvenience. I'd prefer that it had attached properly but didn't feel like dealing with an exchange on such a large and unwieldy item.", 
    "This is a beautiful piece to add to your bedroom! Unfortunately it did not match my bed frame but my dad was able to figure it out.", 
    "I bought this headboard for my teenage son and he loves it. It's masculine and classy plus of great quality. I am very pleased!", 
    "I ordered the light gray headboard. Will use it for my guest room. Very nice"
