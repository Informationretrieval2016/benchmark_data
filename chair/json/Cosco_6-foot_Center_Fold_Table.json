    "This table is not super lightweight and I, as a 71 year old woman, had a little bit of difficulty putting it up by myself at first. Then, I discovered the handle, which is vinyl and heavy fabric. When you first take the table out of the box, the handle is hidden inside the folded table. Once I opened the table and found the handle, the table was very easy to lift and manipulate. The table is super sturdy and should hold quite a lot of weight. The only thing I don't like is that once folded out, the middle seam is not completely flat, or perhaps one side of the table is just a tiny bit higher than the other side. Anything placed right on the seam will wobble just a little (like my computer keyboard) but I just move things a bit to the right or left and it works fine.) I just like the fact that the table is attractive for the type of table it is (I got the black finish), is very sturdy, nice and long, and yet folds up nicely to go under my bed when not needed. I will have many uses for this table including cutting out sewing patterns, quilting, and sewing, art projects and as a spare dining table and extra computer desk as well. So it's ALL GOOD and I would definitely recommend this item.", 
    "These tables are extremely nice and easy to open and close. I ordered two of them and was initially concerned over the ease of opening based on another review. Nothing to be concerned over for me, as they opened easily and are made of quality. I highly recommend this product to others!", 
    "Great table for extra working or serving space. Easy to store, just slid it in the hall closet. Locks keep table rigid. Always check to make sure locks are in place, don't get in a hurry like I did, I didn't check it and had to make two dozen extra cupcakes. So easy to fold out or fold down to put away. Easy clean, side strap for carrying. I'm 60+ years old, set it up and break it down by myself. No help needed.", 
    "Easy to move around. A bit bulky but it is 6 feet long once extended -- so understand. I purchased quite a few for art. Work terrific.", 
    "Great quality overall~ having it fold in half and be able to be toted with a handle is a major design benefit.", 
    "Good sturdy tables. Bought 4", 
    "This table is made of a heavy duty resin plastic. The legs are sturdy. The table folds in half and is compact for storace. It comes with a carrying handle and the table is not heavy at all. You can easily carry it with one had. It's perfect for BBQ's and house party's. The price and speed of delivery were excellent!", 
    "Tables arrived in excellent shape, were exactly as advertised, and came in a timely manner. Thanks for the great service.", 
    "This table fits my needs. It is sturdy, yet light weight enough to move and set up myself. I really like the way it folds up and the handle is strong enough to use to carry the table.", 
    "I bought this as an extension for my dining table to use for the holidays. It worked perfectly and stores easily.", 
    "I gave four stars because at the center of the table there is a little uneven gap. Besides that it is sturdy and a great solution for extra sittings in my dinning room.", 
    "Very spacious table. Seats six guests comfortably.", 
    "Great quality. Easy to carry. I had white tables and they keep disappearing at product fairs/parties. Now my tables will stand out from everyone else's so there can be no confusion. Plus they look nice enough where you don't need to put table clothes on them. The black is perfect for my sons graduation party, my husbands over the hill party and of course Halloween.", 
    "Excellent and so convenient to store. Easy setup and take down.", 
    "Was what we needed, lite weight, folds, and stores easily.", 
    "I ordered the black version to use for a cocktails table in my house for larger parties. I like this table! It stores well, and the black model actually looked pretty stylish without any cloth, in a sort of \"technical\"/minimalist way. (I had ordered the \"folding table indoor/outdoor tablecloth\" with it, and was very disappointed with that item -- very cheaply made and tacky-looking). I put a runner on it. Seems sturdy, stores very compactly, and I'm very happy with the purchase. Just consider whether you really want the table cloth -- costs $* to return.", 
    "I needed a stable not too large not too small table to use for neighborhood gatherings and overflow house parties and to take to the beach (not on beach but at beach house) -so I wanted it to fit in the car easily. This is it! It folds down to the size of a card table yet folds out to seat 6. We actually used it for our thanksgiving dinner on the deck at the beach. The handle is great and you just fold and carry. It stores in a closet just right at the door - close and takes up no space you are otherwise using - but is there at your fingertips. We got it in black and it just goes away when you don't use a tablecloth. Great investment and I am sure you will find uses for it you never thought of when it is right there to be used at any time.", 
    "Sturdy, lightweight table. Comfortably seats 8.", 
    "Easy to set up.. Lightweight. Carry handle is very convenient. Very strong and sturdy table. Use it all the time.",

    "Nice tables, sturdy and light weight.",

    "Great table, folds up nicely", 
    "Just used 2 of these tables for Thanksgiving. They were easy to unfold and fairly easy to set up. The table was sturdy and fit 3 people on each side. At the end of the day, it was just as easy to fold up and store away for the next function. Just what I was looking for. The carry handle is helpful too.", 
    "This table will work out great for our large Thanksgiving dinner crowd. The table is very stable and locks in place so it will not collapse.",

    "This product performs exactly as stated. It's light enough to move around, easy to open and close and strong enough to support whatever I need. Highly recommend", 
    "Is not the greatest table out there since it's not super sturdy but it does the trick. I like that it isn't heavy and of course the best feature is that it's fordable. Worth the price!", 
    "These are great tables, large hold a lot and not to heavy to carry and set up.",

    "no complaints, fast shipping",

    "great fold away table easy to storeused for outdoors and yard sales", 
    "I love how this table folds up and has a handle for carry. It is nice and sturdy too!", 
    "Only wish they still had white in stock", 
    "The build of the table seems pretty solid. The legs fold out properly and lock into place with no issues. The disappointing part is the table top. The plastic top isn't flat and level all the way through and doesn't evenly line up in the middle.", 
    "This is a gem - store it with your folding chairs and it easily adds table space when needed - it's also light weight, folds in half, and the handle makes it so easy to move around. Easy to travel with also, for camping or anywhere you need a tabs (which is just about everywhere). Overstock has the best price for this too.",

    "I little heavy but has a nice handle to make it easier to carry. Sturdy. I just use for occasional buffets.",

    "Fast shipper, received table sooner than expectedOooooooooooo", 
    "I ordered three tables. Two of the tables were just what I expected but the three was put together wrong in production. Seems to me the manufacturer needs to look at improving their quality assurance program. If you get tables that are produced correctly then you are fine. If not be prepared to deal with a return or exchange.",
