    "Excellent product. Easy to put together.", 
    "great heavy duty quality a good value", 
    "these book shelves are pretty and good quality for the price. but as very heavy. So if you like to rearrange your living space often, this are a hassel to move. you may need a good set muscles around to help move them.", 
    "Two of us put together 2 of the units for our family room. It took some time and patience but the bookcases look nice with one on each side of a gray fireplace. They are very sturdy.", 
    "This is the 2nd purchase of this item. The first was the shorter 4 shelf. This was sufficient except it was damaged during rearranging of furniture in my room. I decided to order the taller more slender shelf. This fits even better in my nook space in my bedroom.", 
    "I just love my bookcases...and they go perfect in my home..thank you", 
    "My son is a big book lover and this bookshelf was a great way to display them in his room. Super easy to put together - good and solid, too. Can't beat the price!"
