    "I got the deep red color which looked very nice in my therapy office. The look is that of a more expensive chair. The comfort isn't amazing but not terrible. I am hoping it will \"break in.\" The legs are not very sturdy. When my patients move around in the chairs, the legs shake a little. If necessary, I will take the legs off. It also fit through the doorway easily and the legs which weren't attached just had to be screwed in. The screw was already in the leg so no tools necessary. Overall, it is a great price. (apparently, good chairs are $$).", 
    "These are attractive, comfortable. The only difficulty we had we get the legs on properly. It would help if the manufacturer included markings to position legs.", 
    "Chairs feel and look great and wonderful to sit in gray chairs.", 
    "This is a great chair!!! Looks great and got it at a great price!!! Oh! Thanks Overstock for the fast delivery too!!!", 
    "Perfect size for area.Sturdy enough for my back and a good color.I am happy with this product.I received it within 3 days which was wonderful .too", 
    "Very classic looking, easy to move if necessary. I bought the red; it goes with everything.", 
    "Nice atractive chair for the price A little narrow and needs to have at least the two fromt legs on some kind of carpeting to keep the chair from sliding. Looks good, just very light weight", 
    "This chair is as described, seems to be made well, and looks like leather. Will look nice in my seating area .", 
    "Like the product, cozy size for the bedroom, but easily moved into the living room when more seating is needed. Color is good, leather has not defects. Firm to sit in, light and easy to move.", 
    "Love this chair! Great chair for the price. Fits nicely in a small space.", 
    "So I have done a lot of searching for red leather-like \"club\" chairs for my new office to add color and style to the decor. I didn't want to spend a fortune, as the chairs would be in a small lobby, but I also didn't want anything that looked or felt cheap either. After looking at 100's of red leather (or leather-like) chairs, I came across these and felt the color, style, size and price were right for what I need. After I opened the box, I was happy to see that the chairs were decently made and the legs were super easy to screw on. The color is an interesting red in that its not exactly a solid red...rather, it has a bit of texture to the leather that shows some darker red in the tiny creases, which are all over. I'm probably not describing it perfectly, but just know the vividness of the red is not a solid red, like a matte red lipstick is. There's a sheen to the leather too. Comfort is ok, as the seat pad is still really stiff, but I'm not too worried as my customers are only using these in the lobby area. Overall, the chairs are decorative but I can see why they aren't very expensive. One of the chairs has a minor flaw in the arm front, with a tiny tear in the material, but because of the color variation, it's not super noticeable. I'm not about to ship it back at this point as my office was in desperate need to be completed with furniture. Now if these were going in my own home, I may consider sending back for a better chair. I'm happy with my purchase, except for the flaw. The two chairs do make a fun statement in my office, which is why I went for the red color in the first place :)", 
    "We bought 2 of these chairs, in red, and get a ton of complements on them! We use them along with our couch and it makes a nice living room set. They seem to be well made and sturdy!", 
    "Looks like real leather and is surprisingly comfortable. I wouldn't lounge in it to watch a movie but it's great low profile fits in well in my small living room and appears to be sturdy. Good for seating when you have company. Looks stylish and fits in well with my d\u00e9cor.", 
    "Nice, sturdy chair. One leg didn't settle well, but it's still usable. Other than that, no problem. I like it.", 
    "Stylish and solid. A little hard to sit in at first, but seems to be wearing in. I bought 2 of the red and could not be more pleased, especially for the price.", 
    "These chairs are absolutely beautiful and comfortable.", 
    "Worth the price.not the best.", 
    "This chair is a perfect addition to our living room - right size, great quality, right color - exactly what we needed!"
