    "Should have been less than half the price I paid for it! I had been looking at this table for several weeks and thought it would look good with some other distressed pieces in my living room. I was very disappointed... very cheap looking and if it weren't such a hassle I would send it back. I am usually very satisfied with my orders from Overstock.", 
    "I spent a couple months staring at this awesome coffee table online, and finally purchased it, waiting impatiently for it to arrive. And arrive it did: last night, we opened the giant box, lifted the table out, and... discovered all four legs broken, snapped, and detached from the table top. It appears as though each leg was attached by the manufacturer with two tiny (and I mean pin-sized) nails. Really, really cheap quality. Do not recommend.", 
    "The texture, weight, and color add the perfect rustic touch"
