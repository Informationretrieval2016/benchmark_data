    "I have the original size Panton chair and this looks like the perfect replica child size. It looks great and we love it. I have a 2 and 3yr old and the only issue is that it often falls over if they sit on it sideways. This isn't a product flaw, it's just due to the design and that kids will try to sit on it sideways. Also my kids are on the small size for the chair and I don't think it would be a problem as they get taller as I think they'll have an easier time manipulating how they sit on it. Even with the falling though we like it. I'm happy to have kid chairs in my living room that don't make it feel like a kid s playroom.", 
    "They are super cute and match other grown-up furniture in our mid-century home. I bought two for my kids playroom. Fit my 2-yr-old and 5-yr-old perfectly. The kiddos love the chairs, and even said they are comfy. Great price to me. Just my husband comment once - 'they are pretentious'! Whatever, I love them!"
