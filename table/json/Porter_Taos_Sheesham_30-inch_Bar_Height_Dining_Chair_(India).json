  "description": "Add unique, individual style to your home with this Porter Taos Dining Chair. Made of wood, this dining chair has a tan coloring that will work with any home style. The Taos Sheesham 30 -inch Bar Height Dining Chair is beautifully handcrafted, and its distinctive sheesham grain makes every chair unique, perfect to match with the Bar Height Taos Dining Table or use as standalone bar height chairs. Sheesham is an eco-friendly, fair trade wood grown on government plantations in India. Handmade by artisans using old world techniques, the furniture is crafted from both the darker grained heart wood and lighter colored sap wood of the tree. Because it made from an entirely natural product, knots, grain detailing, mineral deposits and minor imperfections may sometimes occur. This makes each piece unique, and adds to the joy in owning a truly one-of-a-kind piece.
