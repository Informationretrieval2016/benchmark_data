    "I love the style of this bench and the rustic look. But the finish is really shabby. I think they tried to give it a vintage look but did a bum job of it. In order for this to be presentable I will have to cover the seating area with a pillow. Not what I intended but the shipping cost to send this back is more than the cost of the pillows.", 
    "I love this bench. It is better than I expected and comfortable", 
    "Using at a kitchen table without the back. It is perfect for kids with messy hands. Just wipe off and it is ready.", 
    "I ended up returning the first bench I ordered because the finish was coming off. The second one I ordered was better but still not perfect. The finish was rough and not smooth in areas, but it wasn't as bad as the first bench I received. I ended up keeping the bench even tho it was not perfect because it was the right size for the space.", 
    "We were looking for some chairs to complement a concrete top dining table we purchased. We originally purchased the Tabouret vintage stacking chairs and loved them so much we bought the bench too. The metal was the perfect mix against the concrete and wood. Very comfortable too. Absolutely love this bench!", 
    "I love this bench! It is perfect and comfortable. It's exactly like the picture and even better in real life! It's amazing and I couldn't be happier! It came fast and was easy to assemble! Love it!", 
    "After I got the bench together I like the look, but it was a challenge for one person to put together. Very few of the hole lined up and I had to keep putting a screwdriver in the hole to align. It is comfortable but I will probably by a seat cushion.", 
    "nice but hard to put together, back piece was rough", 
    "We purchased this as a \"window seat\" for our dog. He can't chew it since it's metal & it matches our other industrial furniture pieces perfectly!", 
    "Stylish and functional entry bench and incredibly easy to put together.", 
    "Uneven color. One bolt stripped easily- still have'nt fixed; somewhat difficult to put back on.", 
    "Beautiful good quality :) very happy with my purchase", 
    "We've purchased the Tabouret bench, chairs and counter stools and ALL have been exceptional quality for a fraction of what retailers charge. Love them.", 
    "I purchased this bench for our porch. I added a couple of pillows and it looks great! Has held up nicely through spring and summer. Love it!", 
    "I bought this bench to use outdoors (as displayed) and it rusted very soon after we purchased it. It should have been sealed so that would not have happened. Very disappointed.", 
    "Easy to assemble, great looking piece. I'm looking for a place in my house that could use another one.", 
    "Got it today. It comes in two parts and they forgot the screws. Called the number and they were already closed at 3:30 PST. The seat has already gotten scratched. Not sure if I am going to keep it.", 
    "Arrived wrapped in foam for protection, in perfect condition without a scratch. Took some simple assembly, and PERFECT in our entry.", 
    "Used this in an entry & have been pleased w/ it. Well made for the price & great finish.", 
    "I truly am so pleased with the structure of this bench, well made and such a decorative touch to my home. It is a statement and conversationpiece.", 
    "Very sturdy bench with a great industrial feel. It's a great compliment to my country/industrial feel I was going for.", 
    "My seats kinda warped on one side overstock offered to replace it but didn't want to go thru the hassle. Looks good, but probably a bit over priced. Would like to see it selling for half of what it is.", 
    "Highly satisfied with this bench. I bought it to complement the set of 4 for a table that seats 6. My kids are concerned about the metal being cold in the winter but they can use seat cushions...", 
    "Loved the bench. I bought this with the matching stacking chairs and they complimented my modern farm table perfectly! Lightweight but sturdy, Color was true to what is shown in the picture. I get compliments all the time. You do have to assemble the bench but I was able to do it myself. Would highly recommend.", 
    "We were a little disappointed in this bench. It seemed flimsy and was too primitive looking compared to my expectation and not conducive to topping with seat pillows.", 
    "Awesome bench! Get the chairs too - they're great!", 
    "This piece had holes that didn't exactly match up perfectly, but I was still able to get it together. It feels solid enough, now after a year it's still holding up well.", 
    "The bench was a little smaller in person than what I expected, but it's perfect nonetheless. I never checked the dimensions before purchasing so that's my fault. But we love the bench!", 
    "They are making me say 50 words and I don't have the time, so look at the review title. It says it all."
