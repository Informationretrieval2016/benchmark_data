    "This wine rack is gorgeous on my dining room wall. I receive compliments on it from guests and a few have purchased this item for their homes. It is great quality especially for the price.", 
    "Unique design and the center of attention. It's the first thing that people notice. Great price and quick delivery.", 
    "I like the wine rack, but I am a bit disappointed, there are missing leaves and only one hole in the branch to mount it to the wall. I love that it is unique, just a bit disappointed in the quality for the price.", 
    "Great item!!!! Love it.!!!!!", 
    "Love it, but have to send it back....bummer. One of the wine bottles does not stay in the holder and one of the leaves had fallen off during shipment. Going to reorder and try again", 
    "Easy to hang, and lightweight. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "What an interesting piece! Everyone will ask where you found it. Be aware of the dimensions because it will need a large wall space. I would advise that you be sure to hang it securely into studs in the wall. Replaced the screws that came with it to longer ones for that purpose & then used a black marker to 'paint' the screw heads after it was hung to be sure they matched this dark metal. Glad I bought it. I love anything that can serve a purpose & be art at the same time.", 
    "I really like this piece. It's simple and sturdy, yet classy. Very well built.", 
    "Very sturdy. Came with all of the items necessary for mounting and super pretty. It would be even prettier if it were just a little larger, it makes the bottles seem a little out of proportion. Overall really like this piece."
