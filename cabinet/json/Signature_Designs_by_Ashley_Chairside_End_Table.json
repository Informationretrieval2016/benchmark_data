    "This small end table was just the size I needed and arrived in good shape and was much easier to assemble than expected; the drawer unit is already intact, so all the buyer has to do is bolt on the legs in the correct places and alingment and the lower shelf. All materials are supplied except you will need a phillips screwdriver to remove the bracing blocks that protect the top corners while packed and shipped. The nuts and washers are even pre-placed on the bolts in the proper order and they're lightly oiled for easier work. The wood is mostly solid, or plywood, not particle board like some cheaper pieces are. Touches like this convince me that Vietnamese-made products like this are better value and of more dependable quality than many Chinese-made products.", 
    "Really is well made. Easy to assemble and just the right size with storage drawers.", 
    "Very nice, sturdy table. Easy to assemble. Looks great!", 
    "I love this table and have since purchased two more. Unfortunately for you, both way fair and menards had prices more than 20 percent less. I must say, I'm wondering if this is typical.", 
    "Excellent side table. Doesn't take up too much room between chairs and you know where those pesky remotes are!", 
    "It is nice and good quality it is just very red which I was looking for a browner color", 
    "I had hopes that these would fit with the current furniture that we have. Not only do they fit, but the quality of the tables is much better than the picture shows.", 
    "We ordered two of these table for our condo. Perfectly compact and the right height for our chairs. Very easy to assemble and has a nice finish!"
