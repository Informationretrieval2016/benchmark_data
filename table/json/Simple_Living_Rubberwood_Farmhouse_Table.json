    "I am very happy with this purchase. We decided it was time to replace a less-than-ideal square table in our kitchen nook with something more appropriate for the setting. Being that the room is small, it is much easier to walk around this round table than our former table which had corners. It is constructed solidly...it is a substantial piece and will require two people if it needs to be moved. The removable leaf is a real plus...the table is a nice compact size without the leaf, and there's ample space for guests when it is in place. And, the feet are adjustable to remove any wobble in case the underlying floor is uneven - a good feature. The one thing I was surprised about (and this is because their is not a clear image of the table top in the listing) was that the table surface is comprised of short pieces of wood spliced together with \"finger joints\"...(look up images of \"finger joint\" on Google). At first I wasn't sure what to make of it - because I've never seen furniture displaying this feature so prominently. But, on second glance I had no issue with it. I knew from the photo that the table top was going to be comprised of short pieces of wood abutting in some way, and this type of jointing actually adds additional texture and character to an already nice table. It is is not without flaws; I discovered a few little cracks in some of the wood that make up the pedestal. But they do not detract from the soundness of the unit, nor it's appeal. And, I did not buy this as a showpiece; but rather as an attractive, functional table for a breakfast nook. And that is exactly what I got...for a very good price.", 
    "I've been looking for a modern expandable table for a while now, but I never considered this one because the name \"Rubberwood Farmhouse\" led me to believe it wouldn't fit my loft. Took a chance anyway bc I saw a similar, yet more expensive model, in a store and I. love. it! The chunky, sturdy white base and the light wood tabletop really complement and brighten up my surrounding decor. This table looks great against hardwood floors, and it's so nice to have a versatile solution for when you need more/less space.", 
    "This was exactly what I was looking for! I have had a \"farmhouse\" kitchen table as my main dining place for years. One son is married and the other engaged-so squeezing us all together at my small table was getting uncomfortable. I do not have a huge amount of space to work with either-so the fact that this table has a removable leaf was the main selling point for me. It matched my chairs I already had beautifully-so not having the added cost of replacing chairs was another \"selling\" point. My son put it together in about an hour and I love it. If you are looking for a nicely made inexpensive piece of furniture I would say go for it. It sure beats paying $700 or $800 for a whole new dining set!", 
    "I am very pleased with the quality of my farmhouse table. I would have given it 5 stars but we had a little problem when installing the extra leaf. Due to things not being aligned exactly my husband had to sand down a protruding corner before the table top and leaf would meet snugly enough....without doing this there would have been a crack between the two pieces. Overall I am very happy with my purchase!", 
    "So, I looked all over for a table like this. I knew exactly what I wanted - something smallish for my apartment, round, in a light wood and that could extend into something bigger with a leaf. This table met all of my desires and I was really happy to find it. It arrived quickly and was easy to put together. I was nervous b/c another reviewer said you need two people to put the top on but found it easy to assemble myself. It looks like putting the leaf in and taking it out will also be a cinch. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is there was a ding on it when it arrived - a scratched area on the side of the table top that was about an inch in diameter where the finish has been scratched off. A friend says it gives the table some character so I am not really worrying about it, but it was the first thing I saw when I opened the box.", 
    "I was so excited when I saw this table on overstock. I couldnt wait to use it with my corner nook. The pedestal piece is just too big so you're always hitting your foot or leg on it. The top portion came with unfinished parts, so it's rough in patches and needs to be re finished. Our floor was just installed and it's level, but there doesnt seem to be any leveling on this table. It wobbles no matter what we do.I guess sometimes a deal really is too good to be true. This table is not worth it unless its not going to be used much", 
    "Great table! We don't have any complaints about the table. Other reviews let us know it may need extra coats of lacquer/varnish or whatever but we didn't do that. That would be a Summer time project for another day for us. The table was super easy to put together and has been just fine for us. We have a messy four year old and 18 moth old so the table gets pretty abused. The only thing we have noticed are a couple long 'dents' in the table top. They are not scratches in the wood but look like something, a butter knife or spoon, may have been harshly dragged across the top of the table creating these 2-6 inch long 'dents'. They aren't very noticeable and our house anything but fancy so we just cover them place mats and guests never see them :). One nice thing about this table is it is long and skinny. So if you have a small, narrow space it fits very well!! We have a 12 foot wide area which has a pantry door on one side and a sliding glass door on the opposite. The pantry side is also the walkway between the living room and kitchen. This table leaves us space to walk to the kitchen and to go out the sliding door! Our three other table choices before this one did not give us this flexibility in this house. This table was a nice fit in this type of space. Oh, and it fits six people easy unlike our other four seaters which took up more room. Adding more chairs or people and it is way too crowded. If you choose this table we hope you enjoy it as much as we have.", 
    "We had made do with a special order glass-topped/4-leg metal frame table for our breakfast nook for over 10 years but had admitted early-on that the table was not exactly user-friendly for the location for which it was made. So the search was on for a pedestal table that would permit ease of access to the horse-shoe shaped nook. The first pedestal table we tried was too small and is now serving as a very nice end-table elsewhere in our house. The second one we tried was too wide and is now serving as a desk elsewhere in our house. We swore off buying anything else for quite some time but continued the search, finding table after table that was either out of our price range or not otherwise suited for our kitchen. After years of searching, we came across this table at Overstock and decided we had nothing to lose as the price was quite affordable in case this one also did not work out. It turned out to be a perfect fit for our breakfast nook. Shipping was quick, the items were well-packaged, and the table was easy to assemble. Thanks, Overstock!", 
    "Just what I wanted. It fits 2-3 people and then can be expanded to fit 6. Looks like a more expensive table. Easy to put together and overall I am very happy with it.", 
    "I've had this table for several years now. It's a great breakfast room dining table. It has held up well to many meals with little kids.", 
    "Item showed up in 3 boxes. Easy to assemble in short amount of time. all pieces in the boxes. packing was excellent and no damages. Nicest thing about this table is that it was easy to adjust table so it wouldn't wobble. the adjusting foot pegs are great. Highly recommended if you like this style of table. Good quality wood.", 
    "Great hardwood table, assembled easily. Was smaller than I expected but actually works better in the space I have. Cleans easily. Partnered with the Country Cottage Dining Chairs, (I bought two pairs) It looks very nice and homey in my small kitchen. Made in Malaysia.", 
    "The paint on the table legs is bubbly, and the top is not varnished to a smooth finish...BUT...I LOVE THE LOOK of the table and I'll probably add more varnish to the top for a smoother finish.", 
    "We are using the table everyday in our kitchen, we are a family of 4. It is big enough with all breakfast things etc... We are using it with the leaf in all the time. I am taking a star away as the table top moves when you are at either ends of the table not as steady as I would like it to be.The quality is not amazing but it looks ok!", 
    "Three years later and still perfect.we have 3 wild kids.", 
    "This was exactly what I needed for my eating area -- perfect (and unusual) size, plus it has a leaf to make room for grandchildren. Table is solid and was easy enough to assemble that my 11-year-old granddaughter did most of it. See other comments about the appearance of the wooden top. I rather like it myself, and it seems to me to be a higher quality joinder than most.", 
    "The table was definitely a \"second\"! It was taller than a standard dining table, and made for awkward and uncomfortable eating and seating!", 
    "The leaves don't fit tight. There is a little part that was not put on properly, but my husband fixed it. Other then that I love the table", 
    "This is a very nice table, easy to take in and out extension, very attractive and well made, Wood top is a very nice color.", 
    "I needed to down size my table but wanted something that gave me an option of going larger, this table fit the bill. I read feed back about additional bracing needed, we did not see the need for this. It is traditional with a rustic twist which I love", 
    "THE CENTER LEAF DOES NOT FIT VERY WELL, AND IT HAS CHIP ON ONE CORNER. THE MAIN TABLE END HAS BLACK SPOTS IN THE WOOD.", 
    "This table is very nice and I like the way that slides open and close to accommodate the leaf. The construction overall is good. The big negative is the way the table top is screwed to the base. It is suppose to be held with screws but the screws are not holding so I had to put some \"L\" brackets to make sure that the table top could be moved and most importantly, would not fall on someone. It probably wouldn't happen but I like to be sure with something that heavy. Customer service was great on this product. The first shipment contained a cracked base. In less than a week, I had a new one.", 
    "Great Table for the Price!", 
    "This is a nice breakfast nook table. It was very easy to put together, but once again, this is the second item we received with a missing part that we had to request to send. We received the missing part in about 3 days after calling. We are enjoying our table.", 
    "This is a very solid table, and very easy to put together. I have a handicap, and I put it together in an hour. It extends to a nice size table if you need that. Plus it doesn't take up a lot of room when it's small.", 
    "we updated our table, and this just looks much nicer, we love that it's wood. It looks great in the corner of our kitchen", 
    "a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it works just fine for what we wanted it for", 
    "ordered this table for my cottage. it's perfect, even better than we had hoped. went together easily (needed help to lift the top onto the base, but other than that, a 1 person job). it's very sturdy, but does not appear bulky. the painted finish is not perfect, but the irregularities are minimal and does not affect the overall look. the proportions are great, so that we decided to leave the leaf in. i love love love it.", 
    "I searched and searched for the right table for my kitchen. I do not have a separate dining room, so the table I needed had to look appropriate, as well as be expandable. I got exactly what I wanted. In a smaller kitchen, this works great as a round. When the family comes over, I can expand it to accommodate everybody. It goes great with my white cabinetry, and is extremely sturdy and well made. I shopped around and this was the best price i found. It was also very simple to assemble. My 9 year old niece helped Auntie and Uncle put it together. I would highly recommend it.", 
    "I have a small kitchen but needed to seat 6 people......this is perfect!!!!!", 
    "I needed a light wood round table that can expand for more seating if needed and this table was it. It was easy to put together. It is solid and well constructed. It easily slides open for the extra leaf and sits 6 people comfortably. Great table at a great price.", 
    "Had a small crack in the underside white part of the leaf. Decided to keep it anyway. A good value for the money.", 
    "This table is beautiful....my husband liked the fact that it was easy to put together!! We are very happy with it!!", 
    "The table came more quickly than promised or anticipated. It was very well packaged so there were no damages. It was quite easy to assemble and it looks great in our kitchen. I'm very glad to have found it on Overstock.", 
    "I scoured the internet looking for a small diameter farmhouse table with a natural top and white bottom. All were VERY expensive or larger diameter. When I found this one, I was very excited. I t was even better than I thought it would be. Well made, heavy and easy to assemble. Fits in my small breakfast nook perfectly. A very pleasant surprise :)", 
    "After our kitchen was remodeled using white cabinets and country sink we wanted a small dining set and this worked very well. It is not flimsy and fit well in the space", 
    "Received table today and my son assembled it (without a hitch). It is a lovely table, sturdy and a real good product for the price! I was especially happy with the looks of the \"rubber wood\" top. I researched \"rubber wood\" before I purchased the table and found out that it was as strong as \"\"\"oak\"! Thank you for a real good buy and I am sure I will be just as happy with the chairs when they arrive!", 
    "The table was delivered broken. Instead of sending it back my husband fixed it. The piece of wood under the tabletop that the pedestal connects to was split. My husband had to cut another piece of wood and drill holes to fit the pedestal. What a pain!", 
    "I got the table and there was a chunk out of the top of the table and the pedestal was cracked all the way down. I am waiting for them to come back in stock to get another one", 
    "It is just like the picture. And it was easy to put together", 
    "Excellent price for such a sturdy table. Very nice design and classic wood look. I like the pedestal design for easy seating. The small circle size is a bit too small for my family of four to eat dinner on, but with the leaf it is perfect. I had planned to get a glass table top, but with the leaf it is not a standar size for this, so we'll use table cloths instead.", 
    "We love this table, the bottom half is very sturdy and heavy duty. There was a half inch dent in the top of the table that I REALLY wish weren't there but I just didn't think it was worth packing the table all back up into it's 3 big boxes and returning it to get another one that might have a similar dent. Since I had read reviews from other people saying theirs had dents in it too. It was packed up very nicely so the dent would have happened in the warehouse and not during shipping. Oh well! Other than that it is great. A bit smaller than I was expecting but it'll work!", 
    "Love the table - looks just like the picture. It seems like good quality. It was a good fit for me.", 
    "I wasn't quite sure about this table at the beginning. My wife really liked it and we bought it. When the table arrived (very quickly by the way) the boxes were in good condition (three boxes) One for the pedestal, one for the leaf, one for the table itself. The boxes were very well packaged with foam and plastic to protect the table. My only minor complaint about the table is that the finish could be a little nicer. Maybe it is intended but it just doesn't 'feel' like it has a secure finish/seal on it. The table went together VERY VERY easily. I probably had the entire table un-boxed, together AND leveled in about 30 minutes. So far, the paint has been holding up well to our two wild kids also. The table feels very solid and don't expect any issues down the line with its structural integrity. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would buy it again and recommend it for anyone that is wanting a table that can easily sit 6 people but fit in a somewhat smaller space. This table is NOT super wide (as seen in the dimensions) but comfortably will fit 6 people and a medium sized meal. Just don't go expecting to sit 8 with an entire turkey dinner!", 
    "This product is well built and was assembled very easily. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a table to fit a smaller area while sevicing up to 6 people comfortably.", 
    "I love this table. I put it together by myself. The only thing is the table top is made of what I believe is fingerlings and where the wood planks meet it is a little different looking almost like a puzzle. But I don't mind it at all. It works perfectly in my house. I have the same color floors. I also bought the chairs and I love them. I put them together by myself also.", 
    "I like this table. Very convenient as a breakfast nook table and made out of solid wood. I also like that you can extend it if needed for 6 people by using insert. One complain is that the legs height made adjustable, which is good, but it is not locker to lock them in desired position/height. As result it becomes wobbly and require leveling quite frequently.", 
    "Needed a table for a new 3 season sunroom I just completed on my house. This table is perfect because of the leaf. When it's just my hubbie and me the size is perfect for 2 or 3 , but with the leaf it extends to accommodate 6 people. Nice heavy base with a beautiful wood top. Very sturdy. Easy to assemble but you need two people when it comes time to place the top on the pedestal. A lot of value for the money. I looked at similar tables in retail stores here in Paramus NJ and they were 3x as much and notr half as nice. Once again Overstock comes thru with high quality merchandise.", 
    "overall construction very good easy to assemble very satisfied", 
    "The table arrived in one piece and was easy to assemble. It met our expectations, the color was just as we had expected and thequality was very good.", 
    "This is a nice table. If feels solid and looks good. My only complaint is that I wish they put another coat of polyurethane on the the table top. Assembly was fairly easy, but you'll need a second person to bolt the table top on to the base.", 
    "Extremely happy with this purchase. Size, color and construction was exactly what I wanted. Very well made. The color of table top was as pictured and matches perfectly with my existing chairs. Delivery was very fast (received item in a few days) and packaging was excellent. No damage to any of the parts. Easy to assemble. Would definitely recommend Overstock.com to friends and family. If ever in the need for further items, will search Overstock.com first. Price and quality of product was perfect.", 
    "For the price, the quality is good, There is a slight gap when the leaf is in and a small crack in the base that doesn't show or compromise the use of the table. Assembly was quick and easy. It was shipped timely and the tracking information accurate.", 
    "Great table, perfect size for a small space. Took 30 minutes to put together and is very sturdy. The leaf is easy to put in and take out and looks great. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "great table for a small area but expandable for the holiday rush, Excellent!", 
    "The table was assembled with no problem. Fits in the space intended with and without the leaf. I was amazed how wide the extra leaf is. I have received numerous compliments on the table. I had done some shopping and I am glad I ordered the table from you. Prompt delivery also.", 
    "I love the way this looks in my kitchen with the accompanying chairs! I was originally planning to leave it up most of the time without the leaf, but it fits very nicely with the leaf in it, and at the same time does fit the six matching chairs comfortably. I have not had the problem one reviewer mentioned about my legs hitting up against the pedestal - maybe because I have the leaf in? The thing that keeps me from rating this as excellent quality is that, as many reviewers have noted, the gaps between each side of the leaf and the rest of the table is uneven. At first, I thought that people who mentioned a \"gap\" were alluding to the space that I find is pretty common when a leaf is inserted in a table, and I would have had not problem with that. However, the gap is noticeably uneven on each side - on one side it's flush and on the other side it fans out about 1/8\". It is noticeable. At the same time, the overall look of it is lovely, and everyone who sees it for the first time compliments me on it. Overall, I am quite pleased with this purchase. I have seen nothing in a similar price range that is nearly as attractive. It is just what I wanted.", 
    "Very nice table, we like it alot ;-) well spend money !", 
    "Delivered sooner than expected; easy to put together--took me about 30 minutes. Only issue was adding the table top to the base--the holes were just a little off--had to work with it. But all in all, not hard to put together. The table looks great in my dining area--and exactly what I wanted.", 
    "I probably would not have bought this if I had know how much was wrong with the construction of the leaf rails. they were glued together so we had about a two hour job trying to get the leaf in the table, Still can't figure out why it was glued together, oh well it is together now and I do like it.", 
    "The table base is fine, but the wooden top is rather poor, in that there are a couple of areas of separation. It was easy enough to put together, but upon close inspection the separations are more than obvious. This is not a quality product. For the price though, I can live with it for now.", 
    "I love this pedestal table. It is attractive and fits well in my dining space. It has a nice leaf so it can seat 6 people too.", 
    "It took two of us about 20 minutes to assemble. The table is sturdy and immediately brightened our kitchen. It looks very nice and has charming accents in the pedestal. A welcome addition; we are very pleased.", 
    "Fits in an L-shaped breakfast nook perfectly (8'X5') with a little space on the end in case you just want to sit down without a table right in your face. If you lean on one of the ends while the leaf is in it feels a bit unstable but I don't stand on my furniture (not the kitchen table anyway ;-) ) so it suits me fine.", 
    "As another noted, the \"seam\" where the 2 halves meet in the middle has a small, uneven gap. This seems to vary a bit as the table is used and the wood and hardware settle into position. I think I will also need to smooth out where the 2 halves meet so they are more flush to each other. The center leaf fits well, and tends to minimize the uneven gap between the table halves, but we don't plan to use the leaf much for just the 2 of us. One correction to a different reviewer: the top is not actually a laminate, but it is a pieced together slab of wood. This is very common with rubberwood furniture from Asia. Try to picture the end of a board cut into the shape of spread fingers with gaps matching the fingers of the next piece of wood. It's very solid and likely more stable (less prone to warping) than a single sheet of wood. This is a soft wood, similar to American pine, so take care not to drop heavy, hard objects on it, and make sure you give it a coat of oil and/or polish routinely to prevent staining. Maybe a coat of varnish or polyurethane if that's more to your liking. I anticipated what I was buying so I wasn't surprised with any of the characteristics noted above. Still, a good buy that fits our needs.", 
    "This table is exactly what I wanted and hoped for when I bought it. It was very easy to put together. I don't have a very big kitchen and it fits perfect with or without the leaf. Very satisfied!", 
    "i was very pleased with this table an i feel it was a good buy. it was also very easy to assemble", 
    "very good product discription online and apon arrival to home.rubberwood farmhouse table", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this table.", 
    "the only negative that I can identify would be that I can't latch one of the 4 latches on the extension leaf b/c it is off a bit. I read about another customer's husband sanding it down but I think I will just leave it. It's just 1 latch and it almost closes perfectly, just off about 1/16\". If the latch was more forgiving/large it would work perfectly.", 
    "Very nice table for the price. Not too big and not too small.", 
    "This looks great in my kitchen and matched the chairs I have perfectly. The leaf is much bigger than expected, and the large pedestal leg looks great.", 
    "We have had this table in our gated community clubhouse for some time now. It has held up to massive use and still looks great.", 
    "arrived promptly in easy to manage well packed cartons. all parts were well packaged and easy to find as per the instruction sheet that was enclosed. from start to finish and using the tool included it took about 30 minutes to put the entire table together. I had help but could have easily been done by one person. very pleased with the end result in all aspects considered prior to purchase. good size, color and over all design, but most important, easy of assembly.", 
    "Assembled base--easy. Sturdy construction. Top and leaf appear to be a good quality. Not used yet since we are moving soon--so not completely assembled.", 
    "I love this table!!! IT looks exactly like the picture. It arrived very quickly was so easy to put together. We are very impressed that it is so strong and sturdy. The leaf drops in like a charm! We are keeping the leaf out as we just wanted a small round table to seat 4. However with the leaf in seating 6 would be great; seating 8 would be cozy. We bought the Country Cottage Dining Chairs to go with this and they look fantastic together. I LOVE the chairs.. but I did get mixed up and ordered 4 sets or 2 and meant to only order 2 sets of 2 .. so I had to return two sets... the return was CRAZY EASY.. I printed out a UPS Label,, dropped off the boxes at a UPS site and they credited my account in a few days.. I was amazed!! I'm so happy with this purchase.. Highly recommend this if you are looking for a casual kitchen table with a little bit of a cottage feel!", 
    "I would buy from Overstock.com again. Everything came right on time and was as good or better then it looked online. This table is a nice size and good quality.", 
    "As described, but there were several surface imperfections on table top. Mainly, several areas missing finish or rough spots-but still passable. Simple to put together. I like the leveling feet and leaf to expand it. Good deal for price-just wish table top had a better finish.", 
    "Im highly dissapointed in this table and wish I didnt get rid of my first one..I purchased and stored this table until we moved..and its poorly made, very weak and the seams show terribly where the leaf is. It is even leans down. My small child puts his hands on it and the whole table moves. MAJOR regrets", 
    "This was the first time I purchased from Overstock.com and I am very pleased. My husband assembled the table and was very impressed with the sturdiness. First rate!", 
    "This table is VERY good quality. I am so happy I bought this item, it is so beautiful and sturdy. You will love it!", 
    "This table is outstanding in both durability and design. The size is perfect for any kitchen with or without the leaf in,and each time I walk into mine I smile. Sweet Monkeys I love it! Thank you Overstock for such prompt delivery. A very pleasant surprise.", 
    "I purchased this table to replace a larger table in my small NYC apartment and it hasn't disappointed. It was easy to assemble (did require two people) and fits nicely in my modest-sized living/dining room. The extension leaf is quite large (fits in the back of a closet) so the round table is perfect for two. The pedestal base is solid and provides good support. I highly recommend this table!", 
    "This table is just what I have been looking for the past 7 months. It was shipped and delivered very quickly. Very charming, easy to assemble, and very reasonably priced.", 
    "I looked many places for a small round table with a leaf in the cottage style. This was perfect for my needs and the price was right. It was packaged well and the parts were in good condition. Very easy to assemble too. I am very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "arrived just in time for thanksgiving ,put together in a snap! ,smooth-action,,sweet-looking, width,kinda edgey,,,overall,nice for price!", 
    "The table is just the size I needed. It was very easy for me to assemble myself. The only thing I needed assistance with was sitting the tabletop onto the pedestal to make sure I had everything lined up correctly.All the hardware was there and I didn't need any other tools. I did use WD-40 to make the ease of fittings a little easier. I'm very happy with the new table and I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.", 
    "Arrived quickly......easy to assemble.....looks great in my kitchen corner....price was right.......thanks", 
    "It looks good and fits into a small dining room. It can fit up to 6 people, which is a plus. It shipped quickly and was easy to assemble. I'm happy with it and plan on using it for years.", 
    "I am very happy with this table. It is the perfect size and color for my needs. It was easy to assemble and the gears that open/close for the leaf are smooth and attractive. It is exactly what I was looking for. I had no trouble getting it level. The bottom is a bit smooth so I put a rug beneath it to prevent it from sliding on the floor.It's pretty perfect.", 
    "I was more than impressed with the quality of this table. It is perfect! That's all I can say. Assembly was so easy any one can put it together! It is great for a small area/or large with extension. Delivery before est. date of arrival, packed securely to prevent damage. Skip the 5 star rating..I call it a 10 star! You won't be disappointed!", 
    "I ordered this Farmhouse table and was pretty skeptical! It is very nice and my husband said it was easy to assemble. I only wish they had a China Cabinet or Hutch to go with it.", 
    "Lovely table, very easy to assemble. Good looking. Arrived 2 days before original tracking delivery date. The contrast between table top and pedestal is pleasing. Really dresses up the dining area.", 
    "THIS TABLE IS THE WORST CONSTRUCTION POSSIBLE, IT ROCKS BACK AND FORTH. WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING TO MAKE IT MORE STEADY , BUT NOTHING WORKS, AND MOST OF THE 6 CHAIRS ARE NOT PAINTED COMPLETELY.", 
    "My table came with a dent on the top. I would have returned it if I purchased this from a retail store. You get what you paid for. Keep your expectation low."
