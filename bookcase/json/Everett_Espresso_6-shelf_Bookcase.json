    "Purschaed the TALL bookcase. Arrived in 2 boxes (bottom and top pieces). Put the bottom part together first. Then when I started reading direction to put the top piece together the instructions stated \"DISREGARD INSTRUCTIONS FROM PREVIOUS BOX\". WHAT?? I was so mad! Wood is cheap, chipped pieces off while tryng to put it together. Instructions are terrible!! If I hadn't messed up on putting the bottom part together first, I NEVER would have known how to put the top part together. Very disappointed!", 
    "This bookshelf would look great if it was not so poorly constructed. It uses a latch and dowel system like most unassembled furniture, but most unassembled furniture does not use plastic dowels to hold the front rails on. This one does. And they break off inside the particle board when you try to assemble it. Forget trying to get them out to install replacement ones because any attempt will simply break off chunks of the particle board rendering the bookshelf even more useless than it was before you tried. Further, they give you a single anchor to anchor it to the wall. The screw they give you is not even long enough to make it through the drywall, let alone into the studs like they tell you to. Then they give you a zip-tie to hold it to the wall, but of course that is so lightweight that it would not hold a 5lb picture to the wall, let alone a 70lb poorly constructed wobbly book shelf. If you plan to actually put books on the BOOK shelf, think again. The flimsy plastic shelf holders started to crack as soon as I started inserting a couple books. Do yourself a favor. Do not order this bookshelf. Spend the extra couple hundred dollars and get one made out of real wood and screws.", 
    "Was a little disappointed in the quality - it assembled just fine and is now filled with books because we needed somewhere to put them. Didn't match the caliber of the shelf we picked up at *****, next time we will just go there!", 
    "It took longer than expected to arrive the bookcase was not as easy to install as it looked like at first. It was easy to mix the parts. that created some dents in the finished bookcase. The backing is uneven and flimsy But all said and done it looks good for the price paid and I got to do it all by myself!!!! I am proud of the result and now I can display all my memorabilia in style", 
    "This bookcase is a piece of trash that now resides in the shed holding junk. I thought I would never place an order at O.com but I forgive and am partly to blame for not shipping it back. But who wants to put a bookcase back in the box and return it.", 
    "I ordered this bookcase for my grandson's room. At first the assembly was intimidating, but my son was able to put it together without help and it is a nice piece of furniture for the money. A few mars that he was able to go over with crayon. Sturdy.", 
    "I bought these bookshelves a few years back and if I had more room I would buy more. I never had good luck finding a decent bookshelf but these are great.", 
    "A two-person assembly job. For best results correctly assemble. Anchoring the back for appropriate weight distribution is a must. Adjustable shelves provide lots of book-space.", 
    "I would recommend this product to a friend. It was easy to assemble as long as there are two people. The color is beautiful.", 
    "Shopped for what seemed to be forever for a tall bookcase that looked nice and was easy on the budget. This met all my needs and didn't break the bank.", 
    "Let's face it. Having furniture delivered is one of the huge advantages of ordering online. With that in mind, this is an excellent product. In places it might bend and bow a bit under the weight of really heavy books, but it's not going to fall apart, and you will be the only one to notice. It is a really nice design, attractive, easy to assemble. I don't know that it would hold up through a move or two, but for a while it definitely does the trick.", 
    "Had some minor damage from shipping. That seems to be a chronic problem when furniture is shipped. Pleased with the bookcase. Finished product looks very nice.", 
    "This bookcase is what I needed and wanted. The directions were difficult to figure out.", 
    "Not easy to put together, didn't line up right. Took about 2 hours.", 
    "Nice piece of furniture that looks even better with books inside. Want to order another.", 
    "Exactly as shown. Great workmanship and a great product for the money. I buy often from overstock because they always come thru.", 
    "Easy to set up, looks beautiful.", 
    "Just what I wanted. 5 shelf bookcase.", 
    "We've had this for a few years now and it still looks good, is sturdy, and was easy to assemble. I'd recommend it.", 
    "Complex assembly and poor quality", 
    "size fits just right in the small space I picked.", 
    "lots of space for shelving, very easy to build", 
    "Loved the units I had 2 delivered and they work well. Good product", 
    "Shelves can't take any weight without warping, the finish is paper on flakeboard. Appearance is OK if you don't look to close. The assembly is typical for mail order.", 
    "The bookshelf might seem a little flimsy when you are putting it together. However, when you put it all together and tighten all the screws, it is quite study. The overall look is good.", 
    "Easy to install, product looks great. Only problem I had was that it came with a broken part (kicker at the bottom). It came last week, so I called the number in the box the next day and they said they were sending one right away. It's been exactly one week and I still haven't receive the part. It's probably because last week was Thanksgiving week, so I'm hoping it will arrive at my door in the next couple of days.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for in a cheap bookcase. I have two. Note that the height of the second shelf from the bottom is not adjustable.", 
    "I purchased this bookcase for our library. My husband loves it. It's just what he was looking for. 77\" Height is perfect. Design and color is elegant looking. Now my husband wants to replace the other two bookcases we already have with another one just like this bookcase. I am just waiting for 10% or 20% discount to be offered before I can purchase another one. I highly recommend this.", 
    "The pieces in the small box actually make their own self-contained, short bookshelf, and tell you to do so in the directions that are part of this set. Don't follow them. Follow the directions in the big box, and you won't put the top piece on the small bookshelf and then wonder why the tall pieces don't fit on top like the directions show. Ok, just trust me, ignore the directions on box one, hunt for the ones in box 2 and follow those. And it'll look great!", 
    "The product arrived and was relatively easy to assemble. I was glad that I'd already read a number of product reviews which warned that the assembly directions in the smaller box should be disregarded. It would be nice if this was made more clear to the consumer so that those who don't peruse product reviews don't make the mistake of following the wrong directions. The product looks great and is relatively sturdy. I have noticed bowing in one of the shelves which I actually filled with books (it is a bookshelf after all). I feel that given the price of the product, the shelves could have been a bit sturdier. All of the other shelves (which are filled half with books and half with knick-nacks) look great. All the bowing is a bit irritating, I would still consider myself to be satisfied with this product. Overall I think this is a decent product. A bit expensive for the quality, but I'd buy another if given the chance.", 
    "The product arrives in 2 boxes. One box contains a 29\" unit that can be assembled to stand alone or when following instuctions from the second (larger) box it can become a lower portion for the 77\" unit with slight modification. I didn't realize that at first and was confused as to how I was going to conect the upper unit with the lower. I ended up redoing part of the assembly on the lower unit. Should you order a 77\" unit, follow the instructions from the larger box ONLY.", 
    "This was a Christmas present for one of my sons and his wife. They are just now putting their first home together. They love the bookcase. It is classic and roomy. They can see it in any number of rooms in a home. The shelves are an appropiate size for lots of books and collections.", 
    "I'm not a very handy woman, and I live by myself, so the fact that I was able to assemble this bookshelf on my own was great. The instructions are easy to follow. It took me about an hour to assemble, but that's because home improvements/handy work is not my strength.", 
    "We needed bookcases for display of pictures in small space. It was a bit tricky to put them together, but husband and wife were successful. We keep the heavy things on the bottom, photgraphs on the upper selves and the bookcases held up just fine in the earthquake we had in August.", 
    "It was cheap quality for the price and I would not buy it again.", 
    "Great product. Not difficult to assemble as other mentioned. Make sure you open the 2 boxes before installing as you will need to use the bigger box instructions.", 
    "Very cheap - chip easily, difficult to assemble. Would definitely not recommend to anyone.", 
    "Like with any DIY project, the biggest hinderance will be the instructions. Be sure to open ALL boxes and read ALL instructions before starting. After that, you'll end up with a BEAUTIFUL bookcase! A little deeper than I realized, but that's my only complaint. I'd buy 100 of these, if I needed them.", 
    "The bookcases I ordered are gorgeous and exactly what I was looking for. After assembly, they are solid and sturdy. I purchased two. The problem I had was in receiving the proper tool kit to assemble the bookcase. After delivery, I had to call the manufacturing company twice to get the correct screws and pieces to assemble. Now that I have them assembled, I am very happy with my purchase and will probably purchase two more.", 
    "This product was simple to put together and is solid and strong. The description on the website was accurate. There were no scratches or problems with the wood. It looks beautiful in our living room too!", 
    "We like our new bookcase. It holds our dictionaries and law books with adjustable shelves so that taller books can be accomodated. It requires assembly, but it's easily accomplished by reading the directions. It looks very nice in our living room.", 
    "pretty but harder to put together than some. Need 3 pair of arms. But looks good", 
    "I think I got a little taken away with the photograph of this and didn't look at the fine print too well. This is basically an expensive piece of pressboard furniture, like the kind of shelf middle management would get in their office. It is easy to assemble, miraculously enough as I have poor spatial relations; but I managed to put a dowel right through one of the side moldings because I was tapping in the little plastic thing with the molding resting upon my thighs. So I have e-mailed the company to send another molding. Their website is quite easy to use for damaged or missing parts. We shall see how effective they are at resolution. There was some minor scratching upon the top decorative shelf, but I figure with some colored Old English, it'll be gone. I am also disappointed that the shelfs are held up with the plastic L-shaped shelf-holders and not metal ones (like at Target). I have a lot of books and wanted something solid. I am wondering if I should have went to Target for this. I am split down the middle because I should have read the information more closely. So if you are going to order this, I am going to say caveat emptor. It is just pricey enough that you may want to get a scratch and dent piece at a furniture store or go to an unfinished warehouse. If I move out of my apartment, I may even consider leaving it behind for the next tenant of putting it in my mother's basement. However, I do feel my ulitmate disappointment is with myself as I should have looked at this a little more and perhaps shopped around. overstock.com is a great site and I have purchased a lot of items and have been satisfied with their prices, shipping, and return policy, so I can't say this was misrepresented.", 
    "The bookshelf looks good once it is put together, but I wish it was a better quality product. It holds alot of books and I give it a fair for quality.", 
    "I love this bookcase, I needed something to get between my fireplace and wall and this was perfect! I love the color and the height gives you lots of space for your books, pictures, candles and decorations. My brother put it together when I wasn't home, so I am not sure how it was to assemble, but it was done when I got home and I love it.", 
    "This bookcase became the focal-point of the room. It's the tallest item of furniture and makes a nice demarcation between the dining area and livingroom. I topped it with an antique soup toureen and put porcelein items on the top shelf, with heavy encyclopedias and dictionaries on the bottom shelf and smaller books inbetween. This handsone bookcase became a combination book- and display case. It is much admired.", 
    "The shelf is beautiful and was relatively easy to assemble, but it came slightly damaged. One corner of the top piece had been slightly crushed during shipment (I assume). It still looks very good and is quite sturdy. The shelf has plenty of room for books and knicknacks. We like it a lot."
