    "The quality of the table is exceptional. It is very well made and looks like it could have cost much more. Assembly is required but the directions are easy to follow. I was so pleased with the table I purchased a second one.", 
    "This table is the perfect size and love the storage.", 
    "I am so pleased with this table. Thinking of ordering another. Was worried about finding scratches, yet there weren't any. Love it.", 
    "Beautiful. Quite happy with it. I did notice that there was some spacing around the shelves,once they were in place. I guess that makes for easier installation. But of course, not noticeable from the outside. Otherwise a solid piece. Looking forward to purchasing another soon.", 
    "I purchased two of these end tables and was excited with the workman ship and the quality. The tables were very easy to put together and the directions were clear and easy to follow. The tables fit well in a small room and really look great. I received them when promised and I am happy with them, also ordered the small console table that matches and all three really look great in my living room.", 
    "I needed a narrow bedside table and this fits the bill. It was easy to assemble and fit the space perfectly. There is one shelf. I keep meaning to attach some clips for my phone charger, but haven't.",

    "Fits the small space I had designated for my printer in the computer room. Attractive table, had to be constructed. Had a small nick when it was opened but it was toward the back.", 
    "This is my second Favorite Finds end table, I loved the first so much we decided to rearrange some furniture and add a second, beautiful finish, lovely color, love the storage, the long narrow shape makes it easy to work into condo style living rooms. The assembly was a piece of cake. I did it by myself!", 
    "We needed a narrow cabinet with storage and this cabinet seemed perfect for the spot. It fit in the location great and It has a nice interior shelf and door with a snap shut clip so it stays closed even when our curious daughter tugs on It. It is made of solid wood and has a durable quality finish. Regarding the shelf it is solid and will hold some weight without drooping. The big surprise was how fast and easily it went together ,granted I'm pretty good at this stuff but even for amateur I think it would be easy to assemble. Great cabinet I would highly recommend.", 
    "This cabinet is very high quality. The assembly is simple and the instructions are clear.", 
    "I purchased 2 of these tables and I very happy with the quality and workmanship it was easy to put together perfect for a small space one of them came with dent in one corner but I am sure that it happened during delivery called customer service they send replacement part right away excellent customer service."
