    "I bought 2 sets of 4 of these chairs on 3/30/15, it is now 9/8/2015 and the clear coat on all 8 chairs has failed and they're rusting.Overstock says there is no warranty and they can not return or exchange them after 30 days. They have offered a partial refund of $*** on the $*** purchase. This only helps me so much since I still have 8 rusty chairs. If I had known they would rust I would have bought the rust colored ones to hide it. These just look like the finish has failed, which it has.I'm now out $*** so my guests can soil their clothes on rusty chairs, rather than $***. Woop.", 
    "We weren't sure what kind of quality to expect with these chairs but we were pleasantly surprised. We are using them in a cafe setting and they seem to be pretty sturdy and well-made for the price. The color is slightly darker than in the picture but is just what we had hoped for, truly a gunmetal, brushed-steel color. They go perfectly with the Tabouret Gunmetal Dining Tables that we purchased as well. They are finished with a clear coating that makes them slick and somewhat shiny, but still very industrial looking. The chairs are comfortable and slide almost all the way under the table, blocked just slightly by the arm rests. All in all we are very pleased with our purchase and will be order more soon.", 
    "great buy , strong design, HD chairs", 
    "I purchased these chairs with the matching side chairs and stools for my dining table and kitchen island and I am very pleased.True to color and won't damage the floor.", 
    "We bought these chairs to go with our reclaimed wood table and they are perfect! Exactly the look we were going for. They are also surprisingly comfortable! A few of the chairs came damaged with rust colored spots, but overstock quickly sent replacements.", 
    "The price does not reflect the quality . I could not be happier about these chairs. Great delivery service too", 
    "They are beautiful and very comfortable.", 
    "We recently bought a house with an open concept throughout the kitchen, dining area, and living area. The kitchen features all stainless appliances with grey -black cabinetry. Our dining set was a dark black-brown, so we really needed something to balance out the space. These chairs were the perfect thing! Not only does the gunmetal finish compliment the stainless steel appliances, they have such a unique industrial loft quality about them that we love. They are very sturdy chairs that stand up to our active four year old son and that's a huge win for us as well. They are very comfortable to sit in, especially how they caress your back. Some of the reviews I read mentioned rust stains, but if you look closely, it's almost a patina effect they added not rust itself because it's all under the finish of the chair and it's so minimal you have to get right on top of it to see it. We think it looks more authentic and adds interest. These are just the best chairs EVER! So glad we went with them.", 
    "nice chairs, fully assembled ready to go", 
    "If your doing the industrial look for your dining room, these chairs are perfect. They are well designed, have a sleek shiny quality, and they are made well. All four legs stay solidly in the ground. They look much more expensive than they were. I find them comfortable to sit but at some point I might have thin cushions made. I love them.", 
    "Love these chairs. They're actually quite comfortable, stack easily. I like the rough gunmetal finish and all the small imperfections in the finish. Great vintage industrial style.", 
    "Looks great. The seat on this chair is larger than other metal chairs I've seen- so they can comfortably hold a larger man. Paired it with the Tabouret dining table.", 
    "The chairs arrived with 3 out of 4 having what looks like rust in a number of spots. The \"rust\" has been glazed over with the finish. I will be calling customer service to replace the chairs. If not for those imperfections, I love the chairs and finish and will update this review after receiving replacements.", 
    "Simple, sleek and you don't have to put them together which is a plus! Goes well with the Tabouret Dining table.", 
    "I was looking for additional seating for a contemporary kitchen. Had cushions made. Stackable as described. Arrived quickly and in good condition.", 
    "Perfect and sturdy!!! Well worth the price.", 
    "They are a bit on the small side, but exactly the look were going for.", 
    "I absolutely love my chairs!!!they are very well made and sturdy. I just bought a large cherry wood harvest table and the gun metal against the wood make a gorgeous contrast. I am very happy with this purchase!", 
    "After trying to match table wood color I decided to go metal with my wood and glass table. Perfect accompaniment to my diningroom and comfortable too. I put a thin chair pad on each to soften the look.", 
    "Better than I expected , and comfortable", 
    "These chairs are better quality that I thought. Very heavy and sturdy, also pretty comfortable.", 
    "I ordered 8 of these chairs total. Of those, 7 had some level of corrosion/rusting in the seams, along the legs or on the edges of the seat. There is a sticker on the underside of the seat which says to avoid using outdoors or in a humid climate. I'm wondering if these were stored/shipped in a humid climate. I called the manufacturer and was told that rust was not part of the intended finish (which is otherwise quite polished/glossy.) I have returned these and was sent a replacement set.", 
    "Very sturdy and beautiful! The finish is perfect with my black wood table. Holds up to my four kids. Wipes away very easy and clean!", 
    "Chairs are sturdy with great finish and modern industrial styling.", 
    "perfect for our limited space. comfortable and easy to clean around", 
    "The gunmetal color is natural clear-coated steel, not shiny metallic paint. These are nice chairs, and look just as pictured.", 
    "These chairs are pretty, and great if you were furnishing a doll house! They are really too small for almost any adult. Customers be aware that whenyou get something shipped as a multiple in one boxthat may make them \" oversized \" and expensiveto return if you don't like them, unless they are defective.", 
    "Love my new chairs....they look great in my newly renovated kitchen.", 
    "I was torn between the gunmetal finish and dull silver finish with seat padding. We went for the look instead, and we are very happy with the choice.", 
    "We received these chairs yesterday and they are absolutely gorgeous! Very heavy and sturdy with such a beautiful finish. Could not be happier!", 
    "Very sturdy, perfect height", 
    "these chairs look like they came out of an expensive gallery in SoHoComfortable, light weight, sturdy, beautiful", 
    "These chairs look as pictured and are exactly the look I was going for. Industrial chairs paired with my modern wood dining table are a perfect fit. My boyfriend is not so crazy about them comparing them to patio chairs (what does he know) but even he had to admit they are surprisingly comfortable. They are cold, obviously being metal but overall I am very happy. Also quick shipping, packaged well, no assembly req. and very sturdy.", 
    "Stackable, nice finish, sturdy but not too heavy.", 
    "We just received 8 (two sets) of these chairs yesterday...in the gunmetal finish. We could not be happier. They were packaged well, yet easy to open, with minimal waste and no messy styrafoam, which was a plus. I was surprised at how well the four chairs stacked. The finish on the gunmetal looks like true metal, not a paint, which we love. (Although I believe it is painted). It is shiny, but not too shiny, and has a glaze over it that lseems very easy to clean. The chairs seem sturdy and were already assembled. They do not seem too small, as others have mentioned, and they look great with our dark espresso table (Ikea). We plan to put in a coffered ceiling and install a spectacular Pottery Barn (Bella) crystal rectangular chandelier above the table, with a similar finish to the chairs. I think the look of the chairs can compliment almost any style, especially our blended, contemporary-glam, yet classic decor! I have seen other similar chairs for much more $$$$! Love, love, love these chairs! Only wish I could post a picture!", 
    "these chairs are beautiful, sturdy and comfortable. i know comfort wouldn't be the first thing that comes to mind from metal chairs, but i sat doing some work in them for over 2 hours and wasn't uncomfortable once! They look great too...a shiny metallic silver, and they were packaged great so there was no damage in shipping. Definitely a great deal and a great buy!", 
    "They're comfy, sturdy and look great!", 
    "Great quality, strong, ultra modern and chic chairs. I love them. This is amazing deal :-)", 
    "LOVE LOVE LOVE these chairs the perfect mix to my \"Comfy\" industrial look to my new office!!! Great buy!", 
    "I absolutely love these chairs. I have been wanting ***** style metal cafe chairs for some time. My husband just built us a gorgeous modern farm table that I knew this style of chair would accent perfectly. I looked at numerous competitors but was always put off by the ridiculous prices or smaller size of the chairs. I stumbled upon these on Overstock and am thrilled I took the plunge by ordering online.The chairs arrived in less than a week and were packed immaculately. They arrived in perfect condition. The color is exactly what I envisioned. I do think that \"gunmetal\" is the best term to describe it. They are not a shiny silver or a brown/bronze but rather the perfect shade of metallic grey. They coordinate fine with my stainless steel appliances and brushed nickel light fixture. They are very solid and well built and include rubber stoppers which protects my floors and keeps my 2yr old from shoving them all over the place. They also clean very easily. The first thing my husband said was that they were much comfier than he expected for a metal chair, and I agree. I really could not be any happier with these chairs and am considering purchasing another set for overflow seating when we have company. Highly highly recommend if you love this style of chair as much as I do!",
