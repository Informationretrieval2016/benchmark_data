    "As advertised but not the best built bookcase. I'd pay a little more and get a better unit.", 
    "Used it in a windowed wall and did not add the back panels. While removal of the back took away some stability, it made it visually interesting with light coming from the rear.", 
    "This piece of furniture was very difficult for us to put together.", 
    "I bought two of these with a third on its way. I didn't give this bookcase 5 stars because I wouldn't call this a top-of-the-line piece of furniture, but for an affordable bookcase, it looks pretty good and sets up fairly easy. One had miss cut back panels, but I was able to still mount them with no visual mistakes. It's a substantial piece of furniture and doesn't feel or look cheap. Color was consistent with pictures and finish was even and nice. Overall, pretty darn good.", 
    "It is a quality piece of furniture. Very Easy to put together. All shelves fit good. Real wood on sides and frame. Shelves are not real wood. Color is a perfect brown.", 
    "this was made of actual wood, it went together exactly as they said it would and it looks lovely.", 
    "Fairly easy to assemble. Nice looking piece of furniture. Perfect size for my home office."
