    "Using as a toy chest for my grandchildren's toys. Well made. Soft open and close.", 
    "Love this item. Was looking for something that could be multi-functional (ottoman/coffee table/storage) and didn't want to spend a lot. After reading the reviews and considering Overstocks return policy I figured I had nothing to loose. I am a very particular (some say not-picking) shopper and I am willing to pay more for quality merchandise. So I was scepticle about the quality for the price. Within a few days of placing my order the box arrived and I was very very pleased with what arrived. Solid, sturdy, good quality fabric the color a beautiful navy as pictured and the tufting is perfect! Best of all the price was 1/3 what I was looking at at furniture retailers. Love it!", 
    "After looking for an ottoman that wouldn't be too blah or overpowering I ran into this guy that's brings just enough personality and plays we'll with the rest of my living room furniture and more importantly it's super functional and great quality. Worth ever penny!"
