    "Awesome price for Mid-century Modern looking chairs. They are a little flexy unlike the models they are based on, but they do the job and are fairly comfortable for having no padding.", 
    "You can see the indentations in the plastic seat where the hardware fittings are. Otherwise, great price for what you're getting. I'd buy again.", 
    "I had read reviews of these kinds of chairs on several websites so I feel like I was prepared for a couple of things--like, they ARE a little on the small side and wouldn't be appropriate for a big person. They ARE NOT the finest quality in the land but I didn't want to PAY for the the finest quality in the land and so I didn't expect it. They were easy for me to put together and that is saying something. And they are as comfortable as EXPECTED. So yes I would recommend them because they are a good value and, as I've already said, AS EXPECTED.", 
    "These are good quality, and pretty solid, but not fit for anyone over 6'1 ..", 
    "For the price they're fine. Please note that the legs are NATURAL which is a very light wood, not a standard mid-tone. The chairs feel sturdy enough to me - a lightweight person; although, they do creak when I stand up. However, my husband feels like they could break under his weight. I was on the fence about returning them, but decided to keep them.", 
    "We love these chairs! They look great and have held up well. Easy to clean, especially with little kids. They are very light weight which is nice, but don't let your kids stand on them because they easily can fall over. A great buy!", 
    "I bought these for a tiny house that we will be renting out. They are very durable, and easy to assemble. Looks great with the mid century modern look of the dining nook. Can't beat the price. Highly recommend these!", 
    "So far, they seem to be well-made. They were easy to put together. We get lots of compliments on them!", 
    "these are perfect.. exactly how I thought they would be!", 
    "I bought these for my dining table and they look great! they are actually quite comfy... could not be happier with the look and quality.", 
    "These chairs are excellent quality for the value. Surfaces are durable and washable, and the style is timeless. I would recommend to anyone over more expensive repros!", 
    "Not nearly as good looking as in the photos but they serve their purpose.", 
    "Good design at a fabulous price. I have always wanted these style of chair but could never afford the originals. I am glad I found these on Overstock! Happy customer here!", 
    "A bit lower than I thought, but VERY nice. Surprisingly comfortable for a plastic chair."
