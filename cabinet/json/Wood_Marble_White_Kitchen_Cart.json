    "Not a marble top but still pretty dang nice for the price, easy to assemble and perfect to hold my toaster oven and plastic ware, a drawer for my kitchen crap and some shelves to dispaly a few nick knacks. Very pleased! Great buy and fast shipping!", 
    "This was not near as sturdy as I was hoping and I am worried about putting my smaller microwave on the top. I have it supported in a corner and am hoping that will suffice. The connectors did not want to fit correctly and all in all I am disappointed in the quality.", 
    "Shipping was really fast (item arrived 2 weeks prior to estimated delivery date), but I've encountered several issues during assembly:- Several cam locks (5) broke and caused damage to the wood- Pilot holes are misaligned and caused the drawer to not line up. I had to sand down about 1/8\" on one side so it fits.When it's finally put together with my cam locks and some sanding, it looks good for what we need it for. But like others have mentioned, I have my doubts about its durability since the materials used are really cheap.", 
    "Easy enough to assemble except a lot of the cam locks were not holding, so of course after it was all assembled I rolled it 6 feet it collapsed as in all of it stripping out the hole where the screws go so I ended up throwing it all away it was all garbage. The little drawer however was perfect but couldn't use it for anything", 
    "This is a solid kitchen cart! It was fairly easy to put together. The only downside is that the drawer is a little tricky to open and close. It could use a proper track for the drawer.", 
    "This is a nice, sturdy little cart. It's the perfect size for my kitchen. One drawback is that the top is supposed to be marble, and it's definitely not. Probably some kind of laminate, but still nice for my purposes. For the price, it's very nice.", 
    "It's definitely on the small side but its functional and it looks nice", 
    "Shipping was incredibly fast and we received 2 days after placing the order. Directions were fine and my 12 year old daughter and I put together in about an hour. I should have read the description of materials a bit closer as I didn't realize the top was laminate. This is a VERY tiny cart and would work well in a bathroom as well.", 
    "This whole unit is junk. It barely stays together and I would throw it out if my cat didn't use it.", 
    "Looks great. Very rich looking.", 
    "Love this for my small kitchen!!!", 
    "This item works perfect for a small coffee pot, cups, and pods. Looks good despite the average quality", 
    "bought this to use as a coffee station in my kitchen. it went together fairly easy but there was a problem with the screw locks? two of them broke and left visible scars on the shelf. Other than that it is perfect for what I was looking for.", 
    "The item arrived fast but had some issues with assembly - 2 cam locks broke (luckily I have spares at home); screw almost went through the wood. Finished product looked good but not sure about the cart's durability due to the materials used. Furthermore, the countertop is not marble but laminate/wood.", 
    "I really like this cart. Especially the stainless top. It was very simple to assemble and looks like a cart work double the amount.", 
    "The doors do not align and close just right so I didn't give it 5 stars. However it was easy to assemble and is a sturdy cart for the price.", 
    "Love this kitchen cart. The marble top looks great and it matches the kitchen perfect. Great storage area and I love that It's portable and I can move it around easily.", 
    "Shipped incredibly fast and was easy to put together. Give yourself 2 hours but when's it's done you'll be pleased. It's beautiful. Bought this for my 11 year old daughter who loves to bake. She has her basic tools and mixing bowls in the cart. She can prepare on the cart or display which she likes to do. Cannot beat the price and it is fantastic. I'm really impressed, great purchase.", 
    "This cart fit perfectly and looks nice. Gave us a good place to hide dog-related items. Easy to assemble.", 
    "This cart was easy to assemble. It is a great \"extra\" in a very confined space. It holds our table ironing board so it can remain up at all times. The only reason I didn't give it five stars, is the odor which is faintly still there when I open the doors a month later. I am sure it will subside, but how toxic are the fumes?", 
    "it is a great piece for my bathroom....love it,happy I bought this", 
    "I love it. It is very useful and it takes little space. My kitchen is small so this one was perfect. Easy to assemble. It is exactly as you see it in the picture.", 
    "WAS A GREAT ADDITIONAL TO MY SMALL KITCHEN", 
    "I really liked this product for my kitchen. I ordered it a month ago and there were some damaged pieces when I received it. This has been a process because when they shipped me the new pieces they were also damaged. I am now waiting on a whole new kitchen cart to be delivered If this one is damaged I am giving up on this item and sending it back. I hope this works out because I really like the look of this item and is the perfect size for my kitchen"
