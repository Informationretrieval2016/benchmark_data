    "Had an opening under my long counter top in my laundry room where I had an older wicker laundry hamper. I replaced it with this piece and a white wooden hamper from Overstock. This piece assembled easily and is good for all my miscellaneous small items I had stuffed in the cupboards. For the other person that asked, when one is assembling this, there is one shelf that goes in that is set permanently, then there is one shelf that can be adjustable. The permant shelf is right below or almost even with the glass on the door. The adjustable one is in the lower part from the glass to the bottom. Plus, since it sits off the ground there is always the bottom to use as a shelf. So, there are actually three different levels for storage with one adjustable.", 
    "This is an attractive cabinet with several interior shelves. The edges are a bit sharp and we'll need to be careful about not banging into them and scratching the wall behind the cabinet or ourselves. I plan to put some felt along the back edge to protect the wall. Other than than this issue, I think that this is a nice cabinet that we'll use in the bathroom to store toilet paper and other lavatory and personal supplies.", 
    "There was a strong chemical smell that took a long time to dissipate - I put baking soda in the cabinet, aired it out outdoors, and wiped it down multiple times. It was easy to assemble though and four years later still looks and works great. I keep it in a humid bathroom and I haven't noticed any warping or discoloration.", 
    "Has more room than I thought. Fits nicely in my bathroom. Was very easy to assemble. Looks very nice. I get compliments on it.", 
    "goes in my bathroom with a larger one... i just love!!! love!!! them and so does everone else", 
    "Matches the Virgo Space Saver and looks great", 
    "Well packaged & well protected from dents/dings/scratches. Fairly easy to assemble with simple directions. Ordered 2 more larger models from same Mfgr; and they too were well packaged & easy to assemble. Not flimsey, and painted well.", 
    "I bought this for my main bathroom and I am very pleased with it. The cabinet was easy to put together and the directions were awesome not like some things I have bought in the past. I highly recommend this item.", 
    "To assemble the unit required many glued joints with dowels. While all are provided, without a set of clamps the parts won't line up as well as they should. The finish materials gave off a lot of volatile, organic compounds and a month later there are still residual odors. Having said that, the cabinet does look good in an area requiring a small cabinet, and I am happy that I purchased it.", 
    "For something that you put together, it is pretty sturdy. However, I had a very difficult time putting the front door on (screws were very shallow and pulled out easily). Had to go buy some wider screws and it worked okay, but the front door is a bit crooked.", 
    "I like the finished product. Looks very upscale. I had to put it together myself which was not bad. Took me 2 tries but finally figured out that the ridges belong in the back and the door opens from the left. I am not too handy !! All the holes are already started making it easy to use just a screw driver. All in all. Very nice piece", 
    "I got both this and the 2 door cabinet to add some extra storage space in my kitchen. These cabinets are sturdy, attractive and was easy to assemble.", 
    "Assembly was pretty quick and easy. The hardware is really exceptionally cheap pot metal. Don't do much more than snug everything down as the metal just shears off. Looks ok. I would not buy this again.", 
    "Great cabinet for a small space. Wish I could fit more bath towels in it, but its great for toiletries, face clothes, hand towels, etc. it's sturdy and easy to put together.", 
    "Very nice piece for a small bathroom", 
    "pretty little neat cabinet to store unsightlees. my bathroom is too small to change your mind so every little storage space helps.", 
    "Reading the other reviews, I felt like this piece was a good purchase for my bathroom. We have 2 pedestal sinks and I needed some kind of cabinet to stand in between them and store a few bathroom items. This was the perfect size. Easy to assemble. Would recommend.", 
    "This cabinet is an excellent deal for the price. We considered buying from a competitor, but based on the price difference and our previous positive experience with Overstock.com we decided to purchase this item. We had delivery problems that had nothing to do with Overstock. UPS held the merchandise for five days without notifying us that it had been received, then they sent it back to the shipper telling me there was nothing they could do. I called Overstock.com and they could not have been more pleasant, understanding or easier to deal with. They promptly shipped another cabinet before even receiving the first return, and the cabinet was delivered in two business days. It was easy to assemble -- in fact, my 10 and 12 year old sons put it together on their own. It looks beautiful and fits perfectly in the bathroom. I would recommend this product to anyone interested, and I look forward to ordering again from Overstock.com in the future. Their customer service is among the best I have ever experienced.", 
    "My only wish for the designers of this product - and any similar - is to actually fold up a bath towel and or a sheet set, and create and 'inside shelf depth' that easily accommodates these items. Have had to come up with a type of folding on mentioned items, so that all would fit.", 
    "This is a durable little cabinet. Great for use in a bathroom. It is exactly what you expect.", 
    "would be nice if it were a little wider and/or deeper.", 
    "Bought these and matching wall cabinet for master bathroom. They are fairly sturdy, came well-packaged, and were easy to assemble. It is a two-person job to put the door on the front.", 
    "Really nice little cabinet. The instructions are very easy to read and the cabinet goes together with ease. I highly recommend this product. It is a cute addition to my laundry room!", 
    "Bought this cabinet to complement the double and wall cabs. Kitchen looks great", 
    "The cabinet has about 100 pieces that need to be glued/screwed. By the time we figured out that the parts were defective (magnet does not keep the door closed) and screws were missing the cabinet was almost all together. The shelves were dinged up including the top of the cabinet itself which is visible when its in the bathroom.", 
    "We like it very much. It is just what we needed. It is sturdy,well designed, and durable.", 
    "This small cabinet is a perfect fit for our newly renovated 3/4 bathroom. Space is limited so we had to have something small but it has enough storage room for the bath towels, hand towels and wash cloths. It was quite easy to assemble, too. The only problem we have is the magnet on the door does not catch but since the door stays closed, it has not become an issue. We consider this cabinet a great purchase.", 
    "I have assembled quite a few different pieces such as this in the past and found that they were not well made, instructions were hard to understand, etc. But with this cabinet, I found the instructions very easy to understand, the pictures matched what you were being told to do, the quality of the piece was not flimsy or cheaply made, and I was well satisfied. The screws were not only provided but glue and pegs were as well. So it should last a long time. It is just what I needed for my bathroom. There was only one problem, it did not have the inner magnet for the catch and it was not shown on the parts list either. The small metal plate was on the top of the door, but the magnet for inside was not available. Luckily we had one to use. It was not part of the parts list and it was not shown in the directions either. But you do need something to keep the door closed. Other than that, I love my cabinet.", 
    "This is a very cute storage unit for small spaces. My only complaint is that the door has warped and in a very short time too It looks very pretty and inside space with shelves is good.. looks nice..many compliments. I hope the door does not warp further because then I will have to discard it", 
    "Nice cabinet. Great storage, and easy to assemble.Attractive design.", 
    "I was looking for a good bathroom cabinet for awhile - it had to be a certain size to fit in my powder room. This was exactly the size I needed - and it looks good too. I didn't have any trouble putting it together by myself; the quality is okay for a cabinet you need to assemble. I was pleasantly surprised. Now I can store toilet paper and towels in the bathroom and its right next to sink so I can put hand towels conveniently on top.", 
    "My son and I assembled this cabinet in about 30 minutes, with excellent, clear picture instructions. The components are well made and result in a very nice looking end product for a reasonable price. Size is accurate to the description, and it is the perfect compliment to the Virgo wall cabinet, which we also purchased for our bathroom. My only warning would be that there is a chemical smell that needs to dissipate (common for this type of compressed/laquered wood product). My husband was skeptical about the purchase but is impressed with the end result, so that sums it up pretty well.", 
    "I am very pleased with this purchase. I have a small bathroom and needed to add storage space, the cabinet was a great addition to my bathroom. I find the glass windows, carved doors and \"glass-like\" door nobs to add to the attractiveness of the cabinet. The cabinet is sturdy, not at all flimsy. We didn't use the second shelf, because I'm using the cabinet as a towel cabinet. I have 8 medium to large bath towels at the bottom and on the top shelf can hold about 20 face towels (to help you understand how many towels the cabinet can hold). It took my husband about 45 mins to put the cabinet together. He had no real complaints about the assembly instructions other than at times it can be a bit vague. Great buy!", 
    "Bought this for extra storage and counter top space for small bathroom in finished basement. Took about 45 mins. to assemble, but had no problems all by myself - didn't need my husband's assistance. Cheap materials, but I fully expected that. It came as described on site. No parts were missing and everything fit together just right. Just the right size for some towel and toilet paper storage. It's a cute little cabinet.", 
    "Very happy with the caibinet. Quality was unbelievable for the price.", 
    "It's a cute unit and perfect for my bathroom. I don't love the window part at the top, sort of feels ilke a waste of a shelf because it has to be presentable, but with 2 other shelves it's worth it. It's sturdy, didn't take too long to put together (exactly what you'd expect.) Definitely a good item for the price!! very happy!", 
    "Oh, it's always so fun to put together furniture :) This was actually pretty easy, the directions were pretty straight forward but my only beef was that there was missing holes where they should have been. It worked anyways, but you could see that in order for the back piece to fit up top...there should have been holes on the bottom to stick nails through, and it was on the same side as the other holes for screws. Also, the cabinet has a funky \"plastic/paint\" smell that I am hoping fades with time....", 
    "Have been hunting for something like this, reasonably priced. Nice quality, and fits the space perfectly. One of the glass pieces was chipped, but was easily replaced.", 
    "cute little cabinet- fits in room perfectly and has plenty of storage capacity.", 
    "This cabinet is very well made and the price is very competitive.", 
    "This cabinet was exactly what I needed for a small space in a small bathroom. The quality of the construction is very good. Each piece is put together with a dowel and glue first, then the screw. This thing is not falling apart anytime soon! It looks very nice and stylish in my bathroom and provides the perfect amount of storage I required. The adjustable shelf is a nice option to accommodate oversized containers.", 
    "We are getting a lot of use out of this cabinet already. Needed additional storage in the kids' bath due to a recent remodel and switch to pedestal sink. Since we lost the under sink storage, this works great. So far, it is holding up well to daily slamming and rough handling. Know it won't last forever, but we're pleased with our purchase. Purchased some wood/veneer bath furniture from a department store, and it was only a few weeks before it started absorbing moisture and the stain started peeling. In this case, this cabinet is handling the bathroom environment much better. I had it assembled in 24 minutes by myself. Happy customer.", 
    "I bought this as a Christmas Present for my daughter, she loved it.", 
    "Perfect price, perfect size, perfect for our daughter's first apartment! Delivery was quick and the cabinet went together easily. Good furniture for the price.", 
    "Looks great in my bathroom with the matching cabinet above the toilet. Holds fair amt of towels.", 
    "Looking for a couple small cabinets for side tables in my girls small bedroom. Work great! VERY easy to put together did it with the help of my 3 yr. old son! :) Everything well marked and all there! Wish the back was wood, but not a deal breaker! More competitive in price than anywhere else! Thanks O.co !", 
    "This cabinet looks great in my bathroom and is really lovely. Having put together a fair amount of furniture, I think the fact that there were so many little bags of screws and joinings is a good sign that it is a well made cabinet. It did take me a couple of hours to put it together; probably wouldn't take as long if you had someone to help. It's solid and lovely with the window and glass knob. The magnet holding the door closed is strong, as well. I'm very satisfied with this cabinet. Now I can get the bathroom countertops cleaned off!", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for a small bathroom in our remodeled house, it fits perfect and is the perfect size to place extra towels and other toiletries, etc in the tight space that it needed to fit into.", 
    "We bought this for and extra cabinet in our bathroom. The measurements were very acurate so it fit the area we were needing it for perfectly. The instruction on how to put it together and the way you put it together had my husband frustrated during the process but once it was together we loved it.", 
    "Instructions were relatively easy to follow. Took about an hour to put together. Could have used an extra set of hands in 1st 2 steps, but it worked out OK. Very happy with the quality of the piece.", 
    "The product arrived quickly, was easier than expected to assemble and fits perfectly in my small bath, providing some extra storage.", 
    "Relatively easy to put together (besides putting the bottom on the top initially). Only needed help attaching the door. Looks great. Serves as cute storage and much needed counter for our powder room.", 
    "Everything fit correctly and pretty easy to assemble, once you figure out what to do next. The instructions are incomplete so it took twice as long to put it together. I am still giving it a five star because it looks great and is pretty solid piece.", 
    "I can't tell from the description whether there are shelves in this cabinet. It is very cute and will fit well in my space but I'm in a TINY apartment and need storage. Thanks.", 
    "I love our new cabinet! Very easy to put together and super cute!", 
    "I was very pleased with this product. Very easy to assemble by myself and no parts were missing or damaged. It looks great in my bathroom and has plenty of room inside. I highly recommend this floor cabinet to any one who is looking for extra space.", 
    "I really like this cabinet, and it fits perfectly in my small bathroom. However, it was really difficult to assemble because the instructions were so sketchy. We had to call for help. We eventually got a video that showed clearer directions and replacement hardware for those broken in our original attempt at assembly.", 
    "Nice piece for the price and it was fairly easy to put together.", 
    "I purchased the virgo wall cabinet first. I was so pleased with the look and quality that I purchased this matching floor cabinet. Assembly was easy. Price was good and it looks great. Thanks Overstock.", 
    "Sorry the cabinet didn't fit in the space Disappointed", 
    "if i could - i would send it back. its in the bathroom so i am not worried that to many people will see it and see that it isn't made properly; for now it serves its purpose.", 
    "This product is not very sturdy. When I put it together without the top it completely fell apart on me - REALLY. Even when complete it still wiggles/wobbles. You will need to have two people to hold it together and to help with putting the door hinges onto the main cabinet. It does stink, but I am putting up with it until the smell goes away since I purchased the double cabinet. I do like how it looks the door pull is plastic."
