  "reviews": [
    "The packaging seemed small when it arrived and I was worried about building it but it was easy. Instructions included and finished in less then 15 mins. Comfortable and stylish. I'd recommend it, we are very happy with purchase! :-)", 
    "Love this as extra seating. Very modern style. Easy to assemble and switch from sofa to bed. However, a bit small compared to a full size mattress. An average adult's feet hang off the end. Very firm.", 
    "Nice space filler, easy to assemble. A little short though.", 
    "I ordered this for a lounge area in my salon......but when it came, it looked cheaply made and I had to send it back. It would suit a college dorm well, but not what I expected", 
    "Perfect for playroom for the grandkids. Easy assembly.....love it!"
