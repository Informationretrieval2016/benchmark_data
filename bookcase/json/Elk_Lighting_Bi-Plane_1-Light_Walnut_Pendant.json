    "This light looks great in our kids rooms", 
    "Our first shipment arrived with the glass body of the plane broken. I sent an email to Overstock asking for a replacement and received it within a week. (Excellent customer service!)I purchased this light for my soon to be baby boy's nursery. The light is very unique and I couldn't be happier with it. It is definitely a statement piece.My husband did complain that it was difficult to assemble, but after two days, and a couple deep breaths, the fixture is up and it looks great!", 
    "Very pleased with this light! Looks fabulous in our cupola. Best price around!", 
    "Such a fun light pendant hanging from our stairwell. easy to set up and install!"
