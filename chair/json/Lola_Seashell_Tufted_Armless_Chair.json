    "This chair is a steal at under $200. It looked gray on my screen, but I was pleased to find that it is more tan in person. It's really a pretty chair, and pretty comfortable, too. Very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I purchased these for a dedicated meeting room in our home where we could meet with our photography clients and due to the room's size, smaller scale furniture was preferred The size of these chairs is perfect in that aspect, and they had the look I was going for. The price seemed reasonable compared to other chairs of a similar make and fabric, so I gave them a shot. Shipping was fast, they were well packaged, and leg assembly was easy. I definitely love the look and feel of the fabric. Upon first trying them out, I thought the chairs were pretty comfortable. But after sitting on them for about 40 minutes each through 3 meetings, I can feel the hard edge of the wood frame of the chair around the seat. I'll need to replace these in the near future with chairs of higher quality. These would be perfect for staging, or for rooms where an accent chair with little to no use is needed. But, even just for occasional use, I would not deem these appropriate for company to sit upon. Too bad, because otherwise they'd be a great value!", 
    "Like others mentioned the color is a bit different from the picture but I was hoping the color was closer to reviewer comments (oatmeal color---very neutral) and it was! whew! Was very easy to assemble. At first I thought the legs were missing but the bottom of the chair had a velcro cover (which I thought was neat -- guess I don't get out much) and they were in there. Didn't need any additional tools. Everything I needed to assemble was included. Would recommend twisting the screws into the holes before placing in the legs to do it as the threading wasn't very smooth. Nothing defective but just was smoother to do when the screw & washer was in the leg. Was worried about item being wobbly but it was nice and solid. It's not going to be the chair everyone fights over to sit in to watch a football game but it's an armless chair and serves a purpose in a small area. May buy another! Thanks Overstock!", 
    "The chair was absolutely stunning. I put this chair in my guest bedroom and it is a huge hit with my guests. I've been asked where I purchased the chair. I wish that there would have been two available when I prchased the chair but there was only one left in stock. It is definately conversation piece for my guests when they stay in our guest bedroom.", 
    "Very impressed with the look of the chair, so much better than I expected. It is smaller scale than a typical lounge chair but I ordered it for my master bathroom and it's perfect for taking shoes off/on, etc. Very easy to assemble, just attach legs! Would definitely recommend, you won't be disappointed.", 
    "I looked at hundreds of chairs at all different price points, and these (I purchased two) are a phenomenal value. The materials themselves may be standard grade, but the workmanship is excellent. All of the seams are straight. All of the buttons are in perfect alignment. The padding is even (no lumps or bumps). I'm quite picky and not the easiest to please, but these truly exceeded my expectations. Even the way they were packed was perfection! Assembly (legs only) took just a few minutes and was completely painless. I, too, will chime in about the color. It is in no way gray or green. The best way to describe it is as a burlap/cream tweed. I took the other reviews into consideration when purchasing, and am so glad I did. For me, it was exactly what I wanted.", 
    "I love this chair. One word of advice...remove the Velcro lining under the chair to locate the legs and tools :-)", 
    "I bought 2 of these chairs for a bedroom and they fit great into a small space. I was pleasantly suprised with the quality of the chairs they are much nicer in person.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised at how lovely this chair is - perfect for in my bedroom. So simple to assemble the feet, I did it one-handed as I have a broken thumb! It otherwise came completely assembled. Wish I would've bought two!", 
    "Chair is comfortable, fabric looks durable and as other reviewers have said, the color is neutral and will go with almost anything. This is a smaller chair that goes well in smaller spaces, it would make a great accent chair in a bedroom or den. The tufting is well done and fabric creases are straight. The frame is made of wood (pine with some plywood members) and the legs have helicoil inserts so they tighten up well. The chair was very well packaged with no shipping damage. I did not find anything comparable in this price range at our local furniture stores so I am happy with this purchase.", 
    "This is a beautiful accent chair I bought to put in my living room. It is big enough for my boyfriend to sit in, and he even agrees that it is comfy. The color does match the photo, and since I changed my living room colors to gray and cream, this chair blends in perfectly! I really had been looking for a month going to stores, and searching online for the right chair, and believe me this one, you cannot beat the price plus free shipping! If you go to a regualr furniture store, your going to end up paying more than $XXX for a similar chair. Also, the set up was quick and easy, All the parts are located underneath the chair inside the velcro portion. I've had the chair for over a month now and I am still getting compliments and thanking myself I made this purchase!", 
    "This chair is very comfortable. Another reviewer mentioned you can feel the framing, you cannot. The color is oatmeal, but looks more Grey in the photo as mentioned in other reviews. The tufting is uniform, as is all of the upholstery. I am thrilled with this product!", 
    "My first impression of this chair was that the fabric seemed cheap. Then I remembered what I paid for them. I didn't think that assembling the legs on the chair was that tricky but after I assembled them, I noticed that the legs are slightly askew. I'm not sure if that is my fault or the small child in China who probably handcrafted the legs. I think the chair is comfortable though. However, I would recommend spending a little more money and buying a better made chair with a richer fabric. I would have sent these back but I ordered four & I didn't want the hassle of having to return them.", 
    "I really like how this looks. The fabric is not quite as nice as it looks online, but it will hold up well to kids. When I first put in the front legs and sat on it for the first time I noticed that it wasn't even. Over the next few days I realized that it had \"solved\" its own problem. With sitting on it a few more times, one of the legs went crooked to compensate them not being even. Now it looks a little scary to sit on and I don't know how stable it is. I haven't had a chance to try and \"reinstall\" the leg to try and fix it and hope it's still not crooked.", 
    "This chair looks much more expensive than the price. Not for heavy duty use, but the perfect accent chair for many areas.", 
    "I like the chair but it was really low to the floor and the chair back was really short. This would work well with a make-up/vanity table. Quality was pretty good.", 
    "Use this chair in corner of my living room for one more spot to sit. Small but attractive. Use it all the time.", 
    "Looks great and is comfortable.", 
    "Love it - just the perfect size for bedroom corner?", 
    "Easy assemble and a great buy", 
    "This chair looks better than pictured. For the price it looks more expensive, however it's not as comfortable if you plan on sitting in it for a long period of time.", 
    "looks nice for smaller spaces", 
    "Ordered two of these chairs, loved them so much I ordered two more. Very comfortable perfect size in ever formation,", 
    "The chair is beautiful. The color is true to the picture. I am not so sure how sturdy the legs would be if the chairs were used often. One of the legs arrived bent where it screws in, but so far it has not gotten worse. The chairs are heavy and sit lower to the ground than I imagined. I am happy with the purchase. BTW, I have had these chairs for close to two years now and they still look great and the legs are holding up.", 
    "Purchased this chair over 2 years ago and it still looks amazing. Definitely recommend!", 
    "This chair arrived in two days and was so easy to assemble! It looks gorgeous in my daughters room.", 
    "I gave it only 5 because if you were to use this as a regular living room chair I think they would be too small for most people. For me it's a side chair next to my bed that probably only a cat will sleep on now and then so it's perfect. Fabric is nice and I put the legs on easily by myself with the tool provided. Lightweight though really comfy to sit on, just may not be that sturdy for someone heavier. For my needs however it's perfection for the price.", 
    "This chair is great at our small desk in our bedroom.It provides support for my husband and my back, it looks really nice as a neutral addition to our existing color scheme, and I think it will hold up for the demands of both of us sitting in it. However, it is light weight and cannot take a lot of abuse, nor can you twist too hard when putting the legs on least you twist too tight. One leg splintered down the side when my husband was tightening it upon assembly. We did request a new leg and were given all 4 new legs. It was shipped quickly and we were pleased with the correspondence from Overstock.", 
    "I purchased one of these for my small living area. I was a little hesitant as it was so cheap compared to others I'd seen. Well, I was very impressed when I received it! It not only looks amazing (color is fairly similar to what's shown) and the fabric looks quite expensive to me. It was easy to assemble, and best of all it is quite comfortable!", 
    "I have these chairs in my modern living room. Great buy! My husband is a cardiologist and we entertain some big wigs, and they all comment how cool my living room is.", 
    "Just perfect! This chair was exactly what we needed for extra seating in our living room. The previous reviews helped us with our purchase. Assembly was easy and took 5 minutes.", 
    "The chairs look nice but smaller than I expected. They are a tan color not grey. I am using them in my bedroom underneath some windows and the backs of them sit perfectly under the sill so they do not block the view.", 
    "Beautiful chairs, great price", 
    "I love the chairs. The chairs are beautiful. I purchased two and they were exactly as the appeared on the site. The price point is great. Priced similar chairs and they were several hundred dollars more in price.", 
    "Perfect accent to small guest bedroom, color is neutral so fits in anywhere.", 
    "My husband and I purchased 2 of these as accent chairs in our living room. They looks fantastic, we love the tufting. Comfort level is medium, but they don't used that often. The color is an oatmeal which compliments any color scheme. Great buy for the money!", 
    "THIS CHAIR IS SMALLER THAN THE PICTURE.. IT LOOKS LIKE ITS THE SIZE OF A CHAIR FOR A TEENAGER. DEF. NOT HAPPY. THE BACK IS WAY TOO LOW", 
    "The legs and upholstery are much better quality than I expected for the price. It is an adorable and comfortable bedroom chair. I would order it again!", 
    "This was a great chair for the value. I worried about the quality given how inexpensive it was but it looks fantastic. Great purchase. I bought two.", 
    "BOUGHT THESE CHAIR FEW DAYS AGO AND IT CAME IN MY DOOR TODAY FAST SHIPPING, OPEN IT JUST TO CHECK AND I LOVE IT WE ARE MOVING TO OUR NEW HOUSE NEXT WEEK AND I AM EXCITED TO ASSEMBLE IT AND DESIGN IT IN MY NEW HOUSE.", 
    "This chair is the perfect accent to give my bedroom a high-end look. The tufting is beautiful and the legs are elegant. I had shopped around both in-stores and on-line and was coming across the same cheap arm-less chairs (almost bought one and planned on recovering it) but so lucky I came across this chair on overstock. I spray-painted the legs a metallic bronze and took them from being \"granny-ish brown\" to sexy! Disagree with customer who said color did not match the picture. If you zoom in to the Overstock image, what you see, is what you get, a great neutral oatmeal. This is definitely a great buy with great looks. Nothing else even came close to the price ans style.", 
    "I received my order very quickly, which was wonderful. Assembly was super easy! The look of the chair is awesome. This purchase was a complete steal! I could've easily paid $100 more in any local furniture store. I am totally pleased with this purchase! Thanks Overstock!", 
    "The only part in assembling was adding the legs which can be found strapped under the bottom of the seat. I have had the chairs for a fw months and they look more elegant as time goes by. I have also had more women ask me to decorate their homes when they found my overtstock finds, I wish there was a referral bonus!", 
    "Great chair for small space. Really comfortable and sturdy. It was really easy to put together, and it is made from solid wood and great upholstery fabric.", 
    "I read and re-read the reviews on this chair and was so worried about the color. This chair is EXACTLY what I wanted and fit into my decorating idea for our beach house!", 
    "Very nice chair I bought to and they look great together is a sitting room. Easy to put together and very fast shipping.", 
    "I was attracted to this chair because of its neutral color and affordable price. It has great style with the trendy tufts and fits well tucked into a corner in my living room. I was concerned that the polyester fabric would look cheap, but it doesn't. This chair looks much more expensive than it actually is. What you see in the photo is what you get! I was pleasantly surprised at how easy assembly was - I simply screwed in the bolts to attach the legs.", 
    "Love the chairs, especially the fabric. And they're incredibly spacious. I don't love that you can see the bottom lining but that's very minor. All around they fit perfectly.", 
    "Very easy to put together and comfortable. They are a little low to the ground and smaller than I thought.", 
    "i got two chairs. they are very comfortable &compact.they fit perfectly in the small room .i like that they are not too deep.", 
    "I was looking for a side chair next to my fireplace with a neutral color and this chair is so perfect. It was delivered quickly and just needed the legs to be installed, which was very easy to do. This chair is so comfortable and makes an excellent addition for any room.", 
    "Perfect slipper chair for a small area where I dress. I needed something neutral and nice looking for a small spot to put on shoes. This slipper chair is nice looking, and neutral and doesnt grab any other colors away from a room. It does what it should and the fabric is easy to brush clean after my kittycat. I recommend this chair for the look and the price!", 
    "The chair looks great and the color is very pleasing.", 
    "I orderd another chair and it was not comfortable at all so I checked out the measurements very carefully before ordering these. I got them for a small spot in my living room by the fireplace. These chairs look low to the floor but I really like them. Not sure who came up with the name for the color because seashell does not tell the buyer anything about a color. They are light brown or tan and the fabric is a type of tweed but not too heavy. I would recommend them for any small space for an accent but if you need something to fll up your space you would want to consder somethng else. I am very happy with them.", 
    "This chair is absolutely beautiful! After shopping through many furniture stores in the past month, I've seen my fair share of chairs I wouldn't put in my home for free. This chair got here within days, was packaged perfectly and even had a protective sleeve over the chair. The legs were really simple to screw in and the chair is really beautiful and comfortable! If I ever need another one I can save myself drudging through furniture stores and come straight back to this brand!", 
    "I ordered 2 of these chairs, they are petite but comfortable. I love the fabric, it is not a solid color but heathered with cream and tan which looks great. The fabric reminds me of canvas which I think updates the classic design, giving it a \"now and wow\" factor. Construction is good not great, one chair has a leg that is shorter than the other 3, I put a felt sticky thing on the bottom of it and it's even. Overall I love these chairs...and overstock.com", 
    "This chair looks great in our living room as an accent chair. The color is great and the design is both modern and classic. It was very easy to put together (fyi it's RTA-ready to assemble). It's not the best quality made chair, but it serves its purpose as an accent chair. I would not use it for an everyday sitting chair.", 
    "This is a lovely chair, but it's really small! I bought it for my master bedroom, but it looks like it belongs in a child's room. I'm returning it for a bigger size chair.", 
    "I love this chair. The style, fabric and legs are beautiful. My only complaint is that the chair itself is very low to the floor and small although when you sit on it, it is very comfortable and you do not feel that it is small. Other than its size, I would have no complaints. For the price, it is good.", 
    "At first I could not find the legs. Then my neighbor discovered them under the seat of velcro covering the bottom of the chair. They look great in my family room. The chair has nice design and a quality look to it.", 
    "When I ordered this chair it was for a bedroom that I had plans to paint. After receiving it I moved it into the master bedroom because it just fit better. It is adorable and it came perfectly. Overstock has it packaged over and above and it was easy to put the legs on. The color and the chair are very good quality and I do not think you will be disappointed. Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "Easy to put together. Love that the bottom cover is attached via Velcro. Redoing my living room. I love the textures and the size of this seat. Not sure how I will fell in mid summer as this fabric is more winter weight. Looks great, fits my room well. I have 20ft ceiling. So looked small out of the box. Decided to give chair a chance as matched the loveseat I bought brilliantly. Love it now. Recommend for anyone looking for a chair to compliment room without becoming the centerpiece.", 
    "I highly recommend this chair. I ordered two because of the aesthetic and price, and was overjoyed not only with those two elements, but with the actual quality. We have two in our living room to help with overflow from our couches when we have guests, and I love them. Comfortable and durable (even for my 6'3\" 200+ lb husband). If you think you will like these, I assure you, you will.", 
    "The product came on time and is very good quality! For the price, this product is a steal! This was my first purchase from Overstock.com, and I will definitely be back! Couldn't be happier!", 
    "I really LOVE this chair. I moved into a new house and needed a chair for the living room. It's a small space and the chair fits perfectly. It's sturdy and the color and texture of the fabric is lovely. Overall a great bargain!", 
    "These chairs just arrived today. The packaging was nice and they would've been easy to put together had I actually liked them. They material was a cheap, rough feel - not something that I thought would enrich the look of my home at all. They are being sent back immediately.", 
    "Love this chair. But it's very light so it slides easy on my wooden floor which I don't like. It's a great look!", 
    "The size of this chair is perfect for a small sitting area. The color is neutral and blends with any decor. Very easy to assemble. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase.", 
    "This chair is a perfect accent piece in my living room. It is classy looking, comfortable and just beautiful! I'd buy more if I had the space for more!", 
    "This chair is very yellowish beige and is very low to the ground. It was very easy to assemble and seems to be made well but it is too small to be used. I am a very standard sized woman at 5'6 and 110 lbs and it is too small and uncomfortable to be used. However; at a $$$ return shipping fee plus the time and cost of taking it apart, buying boxes and returning it I am pretty much stuck with it and will have to put it in the garage!", 
    "These chairs are very nice as accent pieces. They are a little smaller than I was hoping. The color was a little off but I can work with it. When buying a chair, next time I will pay closer attention to the dimensions.", 
    "Great chair for the money. It works well in the quest bedroom", 
    "This is my computer chair for my ladder desk (also bought on overstock) which I can use in my tv room, dining room and bedroom so i really like having a chair so diversatile. Now i do not suggest this chair for someone tall. I am 5 foot 5 inches and this works for me.", 
    "great price for great item! lovely accent chair for my bedroom. adds a cosiness to my room. Love it! thanks overstock!", 
    "These chairs are small & very plain looking. I wish I sent them back.", 
    "Love the chair, it got to me very quickly and was incredibly simple to assemble. I got this for my bedroom and it looks really nice and is very comfortable and cushioned. The back is a little shorter than envisioned so it looks a little funny near my high bed, but I still love it!", 
    "Love this chair, easy to assemble - legs only. Color is nice neutral and easy to use with tans or grays. I would not plan to use it next to tall chairs or sofa as the back is low as described. The wide seat is very comfortable.", 
    "I bought this chair for one of our guest rooms. It is the perfect size and is a very lovely piece of furniture. My only issue is with alignment of the holes on the chair legs - they did not line up correctly, but my husband was able to fix. Other than that a very good purchase and you cannot beat the price for this type of chair.", 
    "Overall, I am very pleased with the product (especially for the price). The chair is very neutral and would match furniture and decor of just about every room in my house. Very satisfied with the purchase.", 
    "I love these chairs - they're the perfect pieces for our library. The chairs are comfortable and sturdy. I found the color to be a little less gray than I was hoping for, but that's okay. Great buy for the price, and they look a lot more expensive than they actually are. Very elegant chairs.", 
    "chairs arrived quickly and packed well. Just need to put legs on (they are hidden inside bottom of chair.) One leg alittle off, but he was able to make it fit. They are small which fits in our small living room perfectly and proportions so much better than wing chairs I had before. May use them in a bedroom when we move. Buying online...which I do often can be tricky, but these are a great addition", 
    "This is a perfect small boudoir chair. I had a small corner of my bedroom that needed a little something. I put this chair and a floor lamp and I couldn't be more pleased! I love the tufted buttons and size of the chair. The dimensions listed are spot on.", 
    "one of the chair leg had the paint chipped off. I didn't bother calling overstock for damage because I just used color paint to cover it BUT overstock should thoroughly inspect their product before shipping it out to their customer"
