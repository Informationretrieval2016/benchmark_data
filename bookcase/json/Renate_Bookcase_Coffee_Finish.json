    "Bought this whole collection for my son's loft and he was delighted with every single piece. Good looking, functional, and sturdy.", 
    "good quality. sturdy and attractive. takes some time and effort to put together, but worth it.", 
    "I am so impressed with this piece. As other reviewer's mentioned, the buyers are not one continuous ride that hold the shelves together. Instead, they screwed together easily to give the appearance of one long rod. The roughhewn finish is very attractive, and the shelves are extremely sturdy. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "We kept the shelving unit because it seemed easier than the alternative. It is an attractive unit when you don't look too closely at the details. My husband and I weren't all that impressed with the quality. It looks fine in our home office but if I had to to it over again I would have passed for what we spent on it.", 
    "It's very casual looking and sturdy, just what I was looking for.", 
    "This bookcase is quite deep-- I guess I didn't realize it was that deep when I ordered it. It works for my room which is pretty large but might look funny in a smaller space. I was somewhat disappointed in the quality, the shelves look kind of cheap, more what I would expect of something half the price. In the end I decided to keep it because it is mostly covered in books but I would not purchase again.", 
    "ok so I ordered this thinking it would be really rustic/industrial looking. wrong. while the wood is real and beautiful, the frame that makes up the entire piece is fake and ugly...not only that but it arrived completely damaged. the \"iron frame\" of the unit is actually cheap metal spray painted to look like a brushed iron texture. it had chipped off before we even got it out of the box (which was stomped on - size 13 boot prints all over the outside of the box!). upon attempting to assemble the unit, the rods in between the shelves were completely bent, producing a Tim Burton-esque appearance to the unit once it was set-up...i.e. completely crooked. The rods are a heavy metal, so they unfortunately cannot be bent back into shape whatsoever. They were clearly produced that way in manufacturing (in China, surprise), rendering the unit unsalvagable. Overstock was very good about the claim. They asked me if I wanted a replacement but honestly, I'm going to keep looking. The quality was extremely poor for $*** bookshelves. It is more of what I would expect from ****** for $***. Hope this helps anyone considering purchasing this piece!", 
    "This bookcase is a great value! It is well made and makes organizing easy. I'm happy."
