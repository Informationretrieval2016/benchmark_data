    "As nice as I thought it would be, and it is right on for what I was hoping for. It arrived before I expected. It was easy to put together. I am very happy.", 
    "loved the quality of table base and glass until.....we were away for several weeks and when we returned the table was shattered and all over the kitchen and other rooms. No one was living in the house at the time. I believe something was defective in the glass that made this happen. I had a contract set up through Overstock but with Guardsman Company. I filed a claim with pics, waited a very long time for an answer and discovered that breakage is not covered. They only repair and since it was in tiny pieces, it could not be repaired. What a joke. The contract is not worth it and I would not have purchased a glass table top without some sort of insurance. Overstock has been giving me wrong information by phone and on the chat line. I want to purchase only a replacement table top not the whole thing. No one has been able to give me any info as to whether this is possible. Greyson Living, who makes the table, is unreachable. Be careful about purchasing glass top tables without a replacement policy.", 
    "Love the look & quality of this table! We also purchased 6 side chairs (Furniture-of-America-Saldi-Acacia-and-Black-Finish-Side-Chair) that compliment the table beautifully. The 48\" table top and recessed legs, easily accommodates all of the chairs and seats six adults comfortably.", 
    "I love the table although I used my current smoked glass top instead of the glass that came with the table. It came with strange metal rings that the glass was supposed to rest on. I didn't trust them to be stable so I used sticky pads instead so the glass wouldn't slide.", 
    "Was very skeptical about purchasing furniture from Overstock.com till I purchased this table. Was shipped quickly, and when it came down to setup it was very easy! Product is great quality and looks stunning in my dinning room. VERY HAPPY!", 
    "Don't think this is a cheap glass table (we've had those over the years). This table top is thick(!) and won't move like cheaper versions. The base is artfully designed. Love it!", 
    "Great customer service, first table top came with a huge chip from shipping. It was immediately replaced with no hassle. Table looks nice but I've noticed the glass easily scratches", 
    "I received my table before the eat amateur delivery date which was perfect because I had guest at my home, however whenever I arrived home the box was delivered and left outside my apt door which I was a little bothered by because someone could have easily taken, thank God I leave in a decent complex. There was a whole that a screw was supposed to be placed but the opening was not drilled threw properly, my husband and I didn't see a huge problem when assembly the rest of the table without it. Overall the table is nice and is exactly what I expected.", 
    "I received the table and love it but it had some scratches on the legs.", 
    "Great dining table; my only complaint was that it was delivered with a big scratch in one of the legs. Luckily, I was able to cover it up with a marker. Also important to know is that this table is almost 2 inches taller than most dining tables, so your chairs need to have the seat 20 inches from the floor, rather than 18.", 
    "I like this item - really like the looks, except the chrome ring isn't really well shaped, so doesn't sit flush at all against the sloped edges of those legs. That's alright though, it doesn't really detract that much from the look of things, at least not as much as the bolts you can see through the glass do. I would've preferred a slotted outer edge, and a bolt that didn't go THROUGH the chrome ring, but rather a slot on the outer edge that let this ring slide DOWN that bolt. That way it would've been totally hidden. As it is, you see two bolts on each of the legs where they hold the ring to the legs.But the really annoying part is that you can't level the glass. The good news is that I had wondered how the glass is held on - the chrome knobs you see are glued to the glass, and extend slightly underneath the glass. There are \"cups\" that go on top of the four points of the base, so these feet slide right into the cups. That holds the glass solidly, keeps it from sliding or rotating. But the legs are uneven, those cups the glass's feet slide into are uneven, so it rocks. I have about a third of an inch up and down in one direction. I'll play around to try to figure out how I can stop that, maybe by sticking something to \"fill\" the space inside the one hole so the glass's foot can sit on top of it, compress it, and help keep things from rocking. But the better design would've been for these \"cups\" to be adjustable by rotating them, just like the feet under appliances or something, to raise and lower them to keep the glass level, prevent rocking.So other than these issues, it's a good table, looks nice. And the glass is very solid.", 
    "Easy to assemble and very expensive looking once it is assembled.", 
    "a great addition for my house", 
    "I have had constant compliments on this table. It makes an interesting statement without being overdone. The size is perfect for 4 and you could fit 6, if needed. The look is quality and the details are numerous. The chrome ring under the glass adds glamor as do the chrome tabs on which the glass seems to float. Very sturdy and substantial with zero wobbling. The glass is thick with polished edges and no blemishes. Excellent purchase for our rather small space. \"Espresso\" wood is very dark and almost black. Looks much more black than brown, which is perfect for us. High quality table with precision fittings.", 
    "love it , love it, LOVE IT plus easy assembly", 
    "Great table. Will go with any look. Especially modern. Looks very expensive.", 
    "Sturdy beautiful & easy to put together. Love it!!!", 
    "Excellent quality and on time delivery!", 
    "Beautiful sturdy and works well with me decor. I'm an overstock fan now and will continue to shop with them. LOVE LOVE\ud83d\ude0d", 
    "Bought the first one for my daughter...I loved it so much, I bought a second one for me! The table is so modern, it goes with just about any chair. The glass is nice and thick. I like the chrome accents too. I couldn't be more satisfied. Oh and it's nice and sturdy. Looks expensive...", 
    "Lovely in my small dining room. Matched well with the Contemporary Leather Chairs...looks great!", 
    "Perfect in my small sassy but elegant apartment. Easy to put together on my own and paired perfect w/my Varia upholstered chairs also purchased on overstock.com", 
    "Just purchased it and i am happy with my purchase. It looks beautiful and price beats all the items of same price available in the market.", 
    "The table arrived in 2 boxes, one extremely heavy (70 lbs.) that held the table top. From the box with all the pieces, assembly was fairly straightforward EXCEPT for the four bumpers that were referred to as \"iron\" in the instructions that were to fit inside the chrome leg tops that held the table top. We spent a couple hours at the local Home Depot trying to find some kind of bumpers to fit inside the 1-inch-diameter tips that the glass sits on, with no luck. It wasn't until we opened the 70-lb. box that we found the tips were stainless steel pegs that are built into the heavy glass top, not separate pieces of \"iron,\" as the instructions detailed. We finally put it together and it is gorgeous, though about an inch higher than a normal table, and the chairs we ordered, The Baxton Studio Wishbone Black Wood Dining Chairs, are about an inch shorter than normal. Fortunately my husband is handy and will put dowels in the chair legs to bring them up to the right height.", 
    "Love this table. Would recommend it highly. Very sturdy. Easy to assemble. You need 2 people for the glass top. Beautiful and classy.", 
    "beautiful table .. we like it .happy with purchase.. . was easy to assemble .. would like to have harder wood .. but it's nicely engineered .. arrived at correct time and in good shape .. no mishaps .. :)", 
    "Ordered this table for our eat-in kitchen - quality and look exceeded my expectations!", 
    "\"Get so many compliments on this table, it is awesome. Very sturdy! \"", 
    "This table looks elegant and makes a room appear larger b/c of the glass top. I'm pleased by this purchase and I put it together myself. It was tricky getting the heavy glass top on there without help so you may want someone to help with that.", 
    "This dining table is beautiful. This glass top and base very substantial. A beautiful table for a small apartment dining area.", 
    "Love it a little big but looks great", 
    "Quality table that is sturdy and has a nice contemporary look. Was not difficult to put together. I'm definitely pleased with the purchase.", 
    "nice!!! it look great I'm happy with it", 
    "I am very pleased with my purchase. My neighbor had no troubles at all putting it together. I really means I went out of the room came back in 15 minutes it was done. I very happy once again.", 
    "The table was very easy to put together, I had called for directions for none came in the box. Just taking my time is was very simple. It also go great in my black and white kitchen. I am pleased.", 
    "I was worried the glass would break but it was double boxed with foam and wrapping.......pain in the behind to get out of there but worth it!. The glass has a beveled edge very thick and the legs are solid with a nice tone to them.", 
    "This table is perfect in my kitchen dinette area. Very sturdy, not difficult to put together.", 
    "Elegant looking and the glass is really thick. The only draw back is on carpet its a little wobbly. Over all I love it!", 
    "I have to give credit-the glass on this table is really thick and strong. Putting it together was reasonably easy, but it definitely takes two people to pick up the glass and put it together. Once it was together I noticed that it's a bit wobbly. Very slightly, so it wasn't a big deal to put a little inch by inch piece of cardboard under the one leg, but it's still irritating to have an issue like that immediately. It looks nice generally, but if I'm being honest I don't think I'd buy it again. It's a pain to windex it all the time, and putting a table cloth on a glass table kind of defeats the purpose."
