    "Leg's are difficult too attach because the screw holes are not even with the brackets. This isn't a table you would host a dinner party at; however, its fine for a breakfast nook.", 
    "Looks great in house we just staged. Only down side is 4 screw holes didn't line up so isn't as sturdy as I would like. Works for what we are using it for.", 
    "Perfect size for kitchen nook. We purchased with the set of 4 chairs and end up eating at this table more than in the dining room!", 
    "I just built this and it's looks awesome in my home!", 
    "This table looks nice but the quality is not great. It is very hard to clean the surface and I would not recommend as a kitchen/dining table unless you plan to use a tablecloth.", 
    "Table is uneven. It is made from sturdy material but slightly wobbly.", 
    "table was easy to assemble and looks great.", 
    "Table top was pretty but one of the table legs was about an inch shorter than the other three so it wobbled. Easy to put together but screwed stripped easily. Very light, easily knocked over.", 
    "This is a great table at a great price."
