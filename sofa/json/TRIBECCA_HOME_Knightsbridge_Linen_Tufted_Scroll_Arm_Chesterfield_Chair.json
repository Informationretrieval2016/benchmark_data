    "Great Price - Color is darker then it looksIt was nice to read reviews on this collections so I will add my own.Color is darker then it appears and has a blue hue to it. Shipped so fast and easy to assemble. Firm but that comes with the style.", 
    "Good looking, solid, sturdy chair. Easy to put together, but definitely takes two people to do it. The back is very hard/firm and I have to use a throw pillow for it to be comfortable to sit in very long. The bottom cushion is firm but comfortable. Seems like it will hold up over time. It's a little oversized so easy to curl up in.", 
    "I really do like this chair, but it looks better in the picture. It is wide, but not very tall so make sure to note the dimensions before you order. I purchased the red chair and it is more of a cranberry than a true red. Also, the linen fabric is more distinguishable in person.", 
    "Beautiful color. goes very well with my accent wall and the light grey color is beautiful.", 
    "If you are going to purchase this chair in purple, please beware because it is a much darker tone than they are advertising. It was pretty easy to assemble, but we decided to return it because of the color.", 
    "It is very BLUE/grey. With any other grey in the room, these will look blue.", 
    "Very easy to assemble. Looks so rich and is very comfortable.", 
    "Love it perfect color a little tough to put together alone but great buy", 
    "We love the look of these. Surprisingly comfortable. They are large (that's what we wanted) so make sure it's not too big for your space.", 
    "It's more like a grey/blue. Fits perfectly within my tan/beige and brown living room.", 
    "These looks great! I ordered two couches and two chairs. One chair arrived damaged. I called Overstock and they immediately sent out a new one! Good experience with customer service. The couches are firm but I like that!", 
    "Love these chairs, we get so many compliments!", 
    "Red! Beautiful! Took only a short time to put together. The people who made this were geniuses.", 
    "I loved the chair so much that I ordered another one it goes great with my Chesterfield black leather couch that I ordered on overstock. The chair came in two boxes was easy to assemble and is well-made.", 
    "The chair looks great but is too firm. Not comfortable to sit on..", 
    "It is a very nice chair, I received it in less than a week after purchase. I did have a hard time putting it together though because the instructions is not very detailed.", 
    "love this chair. was shipped well and easy to put together. Simply beautiful", 
    "I ordered this chair and loveseat in \"Grey\". I was promised by someone on chat that this would be dark grey and not the lighter grey. This was not the case... what a headache. Be careful when ordering these couches that you are getting the color you want!",
