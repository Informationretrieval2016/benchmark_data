    "AESTHETICSWhile this happens to be a beautiful couch, in person, it looks like denim, which isn't at all an issue for me. It's rather lovely. :)ISSUEMy biggest gripe was that the pillows were actually smaller than the size they show in the images .now I contacted overstock, and they're attempting to rectify the situation by sending me the correct ones. They believe they may have sent me pillows from the loveseat version of this sofa, but I do not think so. I believe it's just a manufacture defect or false advertisement. SOFT VS FIRMThe couch was very firm as well. I did however get my daily workout as me and two other friends spent the day jumping on the couch . They still didn't loosen up as much as I wanted, but I understand that's not an overnight thing. SETUPSetup literally only took me five minutes after I took the pieces out of the boxes and plastic. It was me and a friend who put it together. No need to assemble with tools as everything only requires you to slide pieces into plates attached to the sofa pieces. So that was a breeze. RATINGI did not review lower on this item because of my pillow issue that can be \"rectified.\" The sofa is very firm. I don't think my family would be very happy to sit here.", 
    "I bought this couch for a more formal sitting area and for that it looks great! I will say that the cushions are VERY firm when they first arrive. I found that by jumping around on them before putting them on the couch did loosen them up a bit. But if you're looking for a couch that you can just sink into this isn't it. Fast shipping, great price, and easy to put together.", 
    "Sofa is of good quality and easy to put together. Yet, it is on the firm side and isn't a lounging sofa.", 
    "Great color and shape. Used in an office.", 
    "Has a very low profile as opposed to an overstuffed couch. Looks great with the side chair", 
    "This sofa looks nice enough, but I had it for less than 2 weeks before I found a large hole forming in the seam of one of the seat cushions. Also, the cushions will break in quickly but not necessarily evenly. My cushions don't feel the same. One of my cushions sits higher on the outer half than the inner half. If it was possible to return, I would have. But it comes in 2 large boxes that were taking up most of the spare space in my apartment, so I discarded the boxes before realizing the quality was not to my satisfaction.", 
    "I bought this sofa to use for staging purposes. It looks fantastic in the space and seems well constructed for the price. Not the most comfy, but I only need it for looks. It was immensely easy to assemble and required no tools.", 
    "Yes the cushions are a bit firm, but they should soften up in time. Easy set up, but I do recommend two people put this together. Great material.", 
    "Looks great in the living but not comfortable", 
    "Very hard cuchions and pillow backs remove and are not large. No throw pillos with it but style is beautiful and very easy to put together. How ever is smaller than originally thought. I am only 5'2 and think its on the small size. Proabbaly should be priced around 300.00 to make a great deal. No chairs are avialable in this dark grey either.", 
    "Stylish appearance, nice feel to the fabric, easy to assemble. Only downside is that it is very firm, however it has softened with use. Overall a good purchase.", 
    "Bought it with a love seat by the same manufacturer. Both pieces are too hard in terms of cushion comfort. I'm a big fan of hard and firm cushions. If I say they are hard, better be prepared. Don't know if it's possible to break it in. In the meantime, use it as a surprise for ur in-laws or to punish your teenagers who love to \"jump\" on the sofa.", 
    "Great looking couch! Assemble in 3 minutes, yep, I hate assembly furniture and this is sooooo easy. It's pretty hard, thinking about jumping on the cushions but realize it will need some filler if you do. Looks great in my small studio apartment and completely worth the $$$$. Would suggest getting some soft back pillows instead and they are a little small.", 
    "It fit visually what I wanted but when I got it home and put it together, it was very uncomfortable."
