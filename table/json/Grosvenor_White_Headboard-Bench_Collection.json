    "We love the headboard but thought it had been shipped without any mounting hardware only to find out after contacting Overstock that there is a secret panel on the back of the headboard, sealed by a panel of fabric held on by Velcro. Inside the \"secret panel\" is the installation instructions which tells you that you can find the instructions behind the hidden panel. Wait... What?", 
    "Wanted just a clean look in a guest room, this white nail head is perfect and the adjustable height was easy to adjust... Fabric is nice quality.", 
    "Beautiful and easy to assemble... I mounted mine on the wall to add even more height.", 
    "We looked at this combo for a couple of weeks, and kept going back to it. So we decided to try it since I trust Overstock. We received it in two packages. Easy to put together also. Interesting that the headboard can be adjusted to fit what you need, there were 3 options of height. You will not be disappointed. Thank you Overstock", 
    "Picture does not do this headboard justice. Very nice quality. Easy directions and fit my Cal-king just right. Three different heights of adjustment to finish off your decor. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "We are very happy with the headboard and bench. Well-made and it looks very classy. Leaves a lot of options for redecorating. Pretty easy to put together. The shipping was very fast. The headboard for a California king fits perfect.", 
    "It's almost a blueish white. Was not useful for me, but if you want super bleached duck, it's great. Very heavy and well made. Nailheads are nice!", 
    "This headboard is beautiful. It didn't attach to our bedframe as well as we were hoping so it isn't terribly sturdy for leaning against but otherwise is exactly what we were hoping for.", 
    "I am very pleased with this headboard! It is exactly like the description and easy to assemble!Thank you!", 
    "Great size headboard. Was worried when I saw the box that it would be smaller than I anticipated, but it turned out perfect!", 
    "Very nice- bench is great too! I love the adjustable height", 
    "Easy to put together. Very sturdy and very attractive in Bedrm.", 
    "Overstock delivers once again!!! I'm very pleased with the quality of this item and delivery was excellent..... I don't think you would be disappointed. Gave me the Classic Country feel I was going for!", 
    "Have not yet opened the headboard but LOVE the bench that comes with it. Having room painted so been waiting to get that done before installing headboard. Hopefully, it will work! For the price, a good buy", 
    "It looks great, very elegant, and the adjustable height is perfect. We have a tall bed, but we actually took the shorter height, so if you have a very high bed, you will still be ok.", 
    "Awesome bed...my daughter loves it!!!", 
    "This is well made and looks absolutely beautiful in my room! Very easy to attach to bed frame, too.", 
    "This bed is everything I dreamed of and more. The bench complements it perfectly.", 
    "Came quickly by UPS and was packaged nicely. Nail-heads are spaced nicely and it looks expensive! The bench came with a little bit of dirt on the fabric, but with a little bit of warm water and a microfiber cloth it came right out. Used two cans of Scotchgard before assembling, so hopefully it will resist any potential dirt or stains in the future. Assembly went easily and we LOVE that the headboard has three different height adjustments. It looks great and we couldn't be happier with our purchase.", 
    "I bought 2 of these...1 queen size and one king size and they are both lovely, but the smaller one had a small hole right in the middle of the front of it. Luckily, because one is going in a feminine guest room, I was able to cover it with a bit of bling all over it and it looks really pretty.", 
    "Love this head board for my daughters room.. Very beutiful", 
    "I was about to buy a Restoration Hardware bed and frame but the delivery of the item was delayed for months so I cancelled my order and decided to order this head board which got to my house in a few days and it looks amazing for 1/10 th of the price. It looks rich and makes the room look very classic. I would order this item again and highly recommend everyone to do the same.", 
    "I love my new headboard!! Perfect size and good quality for the price. TIP: use a lint roller to keep the bench and headboard clean and spray them with Scotchguard when u first get it to keep it white over the years!!", 
    "We have been searching for a truly white headboard with the silver nailhead trim for months and finally came across this. We are so happy with this purchase. It is beautiful and seems to be really good quality. We ordered it and scotch guarded it with no issues. Would highly recommend!"
