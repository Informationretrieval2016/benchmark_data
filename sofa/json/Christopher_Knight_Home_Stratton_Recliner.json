    "I was looking for a recliner that would fit in my RV. It had to be narrow due to the slide-outs. This one fits perfectly. It is comfortable and appears well made for the price. Probably a little small for sleeping on unless your 5'2\" but am 6'0\" and it reclines perfect for watching TV.", 
    "This is a stylish solution for small spaces. It's firm and compact, has two different recline positions and is exactly what we were looking for. The bonded leather is nice and thick, unlike some products that feel thin to the touch. Two drawbacks so far... 1) there's no handle for raising/lowering the footrest/backrest, so it's all dependent on your ability to shift your body weight forward and backward - no big deal for us but some might find it troublesome - 2) When fully reclined, the backrest shifts forward/up a bit, making staying fully reclined a bit of a challenge - we're hoping this second problem resolves itself once the chair's \"broken in\" since we've only been using it a few days. Overall, a solid product at a great price.", 
    "Perfect size for my RV. Beautiful leather and design. Price was un believable. Fast shipment. Great modern look.", 
    "We bought two of these recliners for our RV. They fit perfectly and are comfortable and stylish. Lightweight and easy to assemble. Also easy to move when ready to pull in our sliders. So glad we found these to replace our worn and bulky recliners.", 
    "This recliner is a great size for my rv and is comfortable in the first reclining with footrest position. However when I try to recline fully it won't stay in position....keeps popping back up unless I hold with my body stiff which defeats the idea of relaxing in a recliner. Any suggestions? Is there some sort of adjustment for keeping it in the full recline position without heavy body pressure?", 
    "The good - This recliner is super comfortable, the bonded leather looks great (I cannot comment on the durability since I have not had it long) and it fits well in more limited spaces.The bad - the reclining feature does not allow you to lock into the reclined position (unless I am missing something). As such, when you attempt to fully recline, the chair does not remain in the reclining position unless you strategically position you body weight such that it effectively \"balances\" the chair in the reclined position. The chair was inexpensive, so my expectation should be in line with the price, but if the reclining function works only marginally well, then what's the point. Any refinement that would allow the user to lock the chair into the reclining position would be a great design addition.", 
    "Fits nice is a small area. Only issue is its difficult to fully recline, if you move it goes back to lower reclining position", 
    "I returned this chair because it was to small. It's beautiful and if it was bigger I would have gotten two.", 
    "Arrived with back zipper broken. We had already put it together and found one side of the back went in nicely, the other wouldn't. Now have no way to send it back as it won't fit into the original box. Also, for small, lightweight people---not much leg room. My fault for ordering something so big on line....... The color was lovely and looks nice in a room", 
    "This chair is used in a small medical office space. It is nicer than expected for the price. Good quality. Works perfectly. Easy to assemble.", 
    "I bought this for my master bedroom that has limited space but I wanted a place to sit while I watched tv other than the bed. This is perfect! Small but surprising (for the really small price) fairly comfortable and the leather (I got the brown) is quite nice---not cheap looking at all. The side pocket is a nice and convenient touch.", 
    "Work great for our elderly at worship. Just screw on legs and slide top onto bottom. Unpackaged and assembled 3 in 20 minutes. One had a scratch at bottom, customer service was great.", 
    "It would be a really great chair for the price, if the manufacturer had better quality control. When reclined, the leg rest on mine is off center and leans a bit to the right. When I inspected it underneath, I could see that one of the bolts and a screw was missing and the thing had been haphazardly screwed to the reclining mechanism. I took the other screws out, removed the wood piece (fairly easily done because there is a zipper underneath), and saw that two of the metal pieces which hold the bolts had fallen off of the board (they have prongs which stick into the wood). So I hammered the bolt holders back into the wood, and put the thing back together again. The leg rest is still leaning to the right a bit, and of course, it is still missing a bolt and a screw, but it's now firmly attached. Also, as another customer mentioned, the zipper in the back is not well-sewn--it was a sloppy job, but at least mine isn't broken. I'd return it if I could be sure that I would get one that is well-constructed, but I can't be sure of that, so it might be more trouble...Otherwise, the seat cushion is firm which is fine for me. The chair is pretty comfortable, and it's a good size for me and my tiny apartment. I never really intended to recline all of the way back, so as other customers have mentioned, it only partially reclines, but this doesn't bother me. It's good for putting your feet up and sitting back a bit. I use my TV as my computer monitor, so I bought this chair for doing homework and programming. It works well for that, because the armrests are low. I just hope it holds together for the next couple of years. Too bad the manufacturer doesn't take QC seriously.", 
    "Especially for the money ($$$), this is an excellent leather chair for a short to medium-height person who has to fit it into a tight space such as an RV or apartment.The leather is very nice quality (I wish it came in a Camel color but the color was designated as Hazelnut, a medium brown and it is as indicated).It reclines only as much as the photo indicates, making it excellent for reading or movie/TV viewing. Two things to be aware of:* It takes some strength to push the chair into reclining position (perhaps more than an elderly person could do).* It only reclines as the picture indicates, it will not lock in a further reclined position. On balance, I am very pleased with this chair -- and I was able to put it together myself in no time -- (screw on the legs and slide the back into the bottom till it locks -- piece of cake) and it has gliders too which make moving it around on a hard wood floor easy.Can you tell that I highly recommend this recliner???", 
    "We don't like that this chair doesn't stay in the second reclining position! It will recline all the way back, then pop back or slide into the first reclining position. Maybe it wasn't meant to recline all the way back? Very disappointing. Definitely sized for a woman or smaller man,which we expected. Comfortable and good looking.", 
    "We purchased two chairs which replaced a couch in our RV. We were looking for something on the smaller side and they fit perfectly. The chair is comfortable and for people on the shorter side. I think taller folks would find this chair difficult as their feet would hang over. The chair does recline, but not all the way back in a laying position. We used these chairs daily on our last trip that lasted 9 days. They seem to hold up to kids, adults and dogs. :) I'm not sure how long they would last in a normal household setting as they feel not as durable as a typical **** *** However, it is very nice looking and it was extremely easy to put together. It may be beneficial to have two sets of hands to remove the chair from the box and to help guide the back into the slots.", 
    "This chair is very small and I could not wait to return it. It was out of the box for two minutes and at UPS within the hour. The photo is deceiving, this is a very small recliner and low to the ground, not made for adults at all!", 
    "Reasonable price. Exactly as described. Can be operated by the elderly.", 
    "Great for a small room! Very easy to put together! Great chair!!", 
    "I purchased this recliner for my 83 year old, 4'6\", 116 lb mom, and it's perfect for her. It's slick, tiny and compact, just like her. That said, she needs me to recline her (although she can handle the \"dismount\" on her own); and we haven't attempted to recline her fully because we simply don't have the space in her room.", 
    "Very inexpensive but comfortable recliner chair. Came in two pieces plea the legs. Very simple to put together. Uses slight back pressure to set recliner in aft position. Not overly bulky or large. Good size for normal healthy person. Very pleased with its appearance and functionality.", 
    "I needed a chair for a small space. This is perfect! Comfortable with a look of quality. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Love the color I think it is called Hazelnut really nice and rich color, people complained about cheaply made, but I think it cant be beet for price, wouldBuy again", 
    "I love the quality of this chair. The leather is great! The chair is compact in size and easily fits into any small corner. The only thing I did not like was the arms. They are too short and I felt I had to slouch in the chair in order for my arms to relax on the arm rest.", 
    "even though christopher knight looks like a tall guy, my guy's feet hang way off. Also the back does not stay reclined. sent it back", 
    "This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He was in need of a chair for his home office. It had to be one that would fit into a small space. This one meets our needs. It is comfortable enough to sit in for an hour or two, is good-looking, and and the price was right. He said the assembly was a piece of cake. I think he put it together in 15-20 minutes. He was surprised and delighted by this chair. I give it 5 stars.", 
    "I was looking for a recliner that did not take up a lot of space and this was the perfect choice. It is sturdy, yet light weight and the leather is very nice. It might not be as comfortable for those over 6 feet tall, but it is working out very well for me. Also, the cost was phenomenal and with free shipping, what more could I ask for?!", 
    "Great for small spaces, very nice looking", 
    "I needed some extra seating for my home office for when I wanted to get away from the desk. This fits the bill. Look great and easy to put together and very comfortable. Light enough to shift around for TV watching.", 
    "The chair looks nice, but it does not recline all the way. It reclines fine mid-way which is all I really need it for anyway. It was easy to assemble, and my cat loves it.", 
    "Love it, comfortable, looks great in the bedroom......love it", 
    "The chair is small but very comfortable and durable it fits perfectly in my bedroom", 
    "These recliners look nice and are comfortable. Wish you could lock it back in full recline, that would make them perfect.", 
    "Great look for the money. Needed small footprint . Great Value.", 
    "Love this chair..perfect size..However, you must know that the chestnut color is truly chestnut and not that yellowy color shown.. Much nicer. Easy to put together and comfortable at a really good price", 
    "After reading previous reviews, I was worried that I had gone too small. All 3men in my house are 6'1\" to 6'5\" and they are the main 3 to use them...most reviews said too small, too narrow, but I needed *accent chairs that reclined....but would be used regularly. These recliners are PERFECT, in used all the time by my guys, don't crowd the room like other massive recliners, easy two piece assembly (btw my guys are not Xtra skinny, more right sized for height AND still sit comfortably EVERYDAY)", 
    "The price, the color and the comfort can't be beat. I love my new recliner. The hazelnut color is perfect in my living room, and the chair is wonderful for reading and napping. I've never seen a leather recliner this affordable before!", 
    "Wow because I got this soooo quick. Chair is just as appears and it is small. Just as I expected and wanted. Maybe a bit darker. Love the size , seems to work well. Put this together alone in 15 minutes. I rolled it over in the box to get it inside. I am 5 feet tall and had no problems putting this together by myself. VERY satisfied with Overstock.", 
    "Sleek look. Comfortable but not cozy. All in all a good purchase at a reasonable price.", 
    "Perfect for the RV! They are very comfortable and fit inside our fifth wheel beautifully. There is not a handle to recline, but are easy enough to push back to recline. Love them!", 
    "If you are looking for a sleeker and more streamline looking recliner and one that is not over stuffed and bulky, then this one is for you. mom and dad had to old recliners in their family room that seemed to overpower the room. We replaced them with two of these for Christmas and they are so much more elegant then the old style recliners. Mom and dad R average sized and not overweight. However, if you are a husky ur build or want a chair to fall asleep in, then you might not consider this one. this chair is perfect for watching television and reading. It is perfect for a bedroom or smaller room. the leather is beautiful and the chairs are easily assembled.", 
    "Good quality, just short.", 
    "GETTING USED TO THEATER SEATING..DIFFERENT WITH NO HANDLE TO LET YOU RECLINE, BUT LIKING IT MORE AND MORE.COLOR HAZELNUT IS AWESOME !", 
    "Bought if for my husband and he never sits in it. But it looks nice for the priceA recliner that doesn't look like an old man recliner.", 
    "I bought this chair for my small living room because I needed a compact, yet stylish chair! My family of 4 loves it so far! (We've had it about a month.) The leather material is very durable and the chair is sturdy. Speedy shipping right to my front door! It was also super easy for me to assemble by myself. All I had to do was screw on the legs and insert the back of the chair to the base. (It literally took under 10 minutes!) I highly recommend this chair!", 
    "I cannot believe the quality and look of this recliner!! Not to mention that it took me less than 5 minutes to assemble it- all you have to do is screw in the legs and put the back into the metal channels on the base and WA LA!!!- you have a great recliner!!! It was a birthday surprise for my hubby, so he has a comfy chair in his den. He loves it !! You will not be sorry if you purchase this Christopher Knight chair. What a spectacular price. This is the second piece of furniture I have purchased on Overstock.com and have been please with both item. I see more order in the future :+ )", 
    "It is a best value for the price. It fits the room better without being bulky.It was easy to assemble as well."
