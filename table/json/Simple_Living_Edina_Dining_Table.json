    "When I first saw this table, I was truly intrigued. The table was a perfect size for my kitchen, but the materials definitely caught my eye. For one thing, much of the table support uses rubber wood, an environmentally sustainable resource. In addition, the faux marble used for the table interested me. I did some research on faux marble and I learned that one of the BIG advantages of faux marble was that it weighs a lot lighter than real marble. After a fast delivery and assembly, I immediately realized that a real marble table would have been too heavy to move! Sitting back, I truly appreciate this table in my home as it satisfies my eye and my conscious.", 
    "This table lives up to its reviews. Gorgeous marble top, nice wood, and super easy to assemble! Absolutely love it!", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised this table was so nice, especially for the price!! I was not expecting this of a nice dining table since it was so reasonably priced. It was packaged really secure and it was super easy to assemble. Took me all of 20 minutes to put it together!!I assembled it and delivered it to my daughter-in-law for Valentine's day! She was thrilled and said it was the BEST Valentine's day gift she every received! Thanks for making me the hero again Overstock!!", 
    "This table looks far more expensive than it actually is. I love the rubber wood legs, they have a gorgeous slight wood grain and the color is a light walnut. The top looks like marble. This table is so pretty in my space!",
