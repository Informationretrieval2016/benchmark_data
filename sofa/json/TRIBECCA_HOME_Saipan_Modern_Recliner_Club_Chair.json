    "As others said the movement is a little stiff, but I am sure it will loosen up in time. The chair is definitely on the firm side but again I would assume it will soften a little. Also I think they have some pretty serious lighting on these chairs in the photo, we got the dark grey and it look more like a carbon black to me. It is about as close to black as you can get and still consider it to be grey, we are returning for the light grey. Now that those points are out of the way I will say the construction of these chairs seems top notch. Yeah the movement is a little firm but that is much better than being loose or sloppy. The chair is firm but that is much better to me than being too soft. The stiching and upholstery in general seems very tight. I am a bit of a perfectionist, I do plenty of my own upholstering and furniture building so I know what to look for or where to expect corners to be cut. These pass my test. They do recline very nicely in two positions I am 5'8\" and find it very comfortable. Most of these smaller compact recliners don't have enough head or leg support, I like these because they do but are still compact. They also look nice because the back is the same height as most couch backs... they fit in well in a room with couches. These are exactly what we are looking for now we just have to hope that the lighter grey goes better with our room. I will report back once we receive them.", 
    "I got the dark grey , looks like the photos. I'm 5 5 tall fits me perfect. Could accommodate someone a bit taller. A little bit hard to open and close the leg rest. Would buy it again....", 
    "Chair sits very firm, but you can get comfortable; good for naping.Reclining mechanism takes some getting used to. Color is gray in the sunlight (which we haven't had much of in the Chicago area), but darker blue-ish most overcast days.", 
    "This was smaller than I thought it would be, but it ended up being the perfect size. It doesn't take a lot of space but gives plenty of comfort", 
    "Nice chair. Firm with attractive fabric. Comfy to sit in.", 
    "Finding a small scale recliner that looks more like a club chair than a recliner is difficult. The form and function rule doesn't seem to apply to recliners in general. I visited several furniture stores but couldn't find a decent looking recliner. Then as a last ditch effort I searched online and decided to take a chance on this recliner. At one tenth the price of my last recliner it was worth the gamble. It was! I'm very pleased with the recliner. I'm a person of small stature and the chair is very comfortable for me. It has a very neat appearance and isn't a pink elephant in the room. It is well engineered with a steel mechanism that integrates the stretcher supports. It's very stable and was easy to put together. The fabric is a bit drab in that it doesn't have any identity other than \"neutral\" but it would work in many different color schemes. The true test was that I slept for two hours in the chair the day after arrival. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.", 
    "Very good quality for the price! I needed small recliner for our guest bedroom and this worked perfectly.", 
    "We were so surprise how wonderful and comfortable these are. We purchases 2 and could not believe what we got for the price. Love the color and comfort, great deal and so easy to put together. We are both over 65 and had no trouble putting together and the relaxing in them. We bought these for our winter villa in Florida.", 
    "The chair arrived quickly, packed in box as 2 pieces. Very easy to put together, the back rest just slides on to connector arms. The feet were easy for me to screw on too, which was the only part I was worried about from reading other reviews. The chair looks and works as expected. It's slim which is exactly what i needed for my small nyc apartment. Its also comfortable and functions well. I'm 5 foot 9 and fit in it, my feet hang off the edge when reclined. Good reading and napping chair", 
    "These totally went beyond my expectations. I needed something smaller then what was currently in my living room. Already wanting to replace the large bulky recliner in my room I didn't want to purchase another of those but didn't want to get rid of my reclining feature. These fit the bill. I was unsure about the comfort of them buying them online but they are extremely comfortable, sitting, reclined and even lays practically all the way down. I'm 5'8 and it's very comfortable for me. The fabric is perfect for clean up and pet hair removal also. The two things that I would of wanted to know before. 1. At least one leg of every chair(bought 2 chairs) had a threading issue. Both were extremely hard to get in. The 2nd chair I was afraid I was going to have to return it because the leg wouldn't tighten. Got it eventually though, husband did some magic.2. The dark gray chair can go either between dark grey or blue. It has some blue tints to it. One thing that I was worried about was the dark grey not matching but having navy blue accents in my house they ended up working even better. I personally see more dark dark navy blue then grey. Overall, they seem great. Don't think they'll hold of for 5+ years but for the price I'm OK with that.", 
    "Wood piece covered in velcro to hold back material was broken upon arrival, but didn't affect function. A little awkward to recline and return to upright, but it's comfortable and looks good.", 
    "I live in a studio apartment, so a standard size recliner was not an option. This recliner is a perfect size, the color and fabric match the description match the manufacturers completely. It is quite comfortable - I have fallen asleep in it. Once reclined it stays reclined. The fabric doesn't attract stains, which is a big plus for me.The only drawback was attaching the legs, this took quite a while to get them into the screw holes.", 
    "I purchased the gray linen version of this chair. It looks great, not like the normal clunky recliners. However, my son is 5'6\" and he fits snugly but the top of his head goes over the top of the chair. I would highly recommend this recliner if it is the style you want. But I would only recommend it if the user will be 5'6\" or under.", 
    "This is a very small recliner; not made for a larger person. I'm 5'2\" so I fit. If you have a small space then buy it, otherwise it will look out of place with large/medium sized furniture in the room.", 
    "This is a very comfortable, small recliner. It reclines quite far back, almost to lying down. It is compact so fits into many spaces. The fabric is not the highest quality, it pulls easily. Overall, a great chair for the money. You will not be disappointed.", 
    "These are a terrific value. They look just like the photo. Compact and very comfortable. Fabric color is same as photo & good quality. Would highly recommend!", 
    "Wanted to buy a recliner for myself for a while and although I had purchased 2 other recliners for family members from Overstock and was pleased with them, they were no longer available. This was the closest one available so went with this one. It was poorly packed, and I was surprised that it was not damaged due to the condition of the flimsly box it came in. I assembled it and found it is very cheaply constructed. It has a \"loose\" feeling to it and is not as comfortable as my office desk chair. The footrest is not adjustable when you raise it, all the way up or all the way down are the only settings. The footrest itself is way too short and although I am only 5'7\" tall, my feet and half my calves hang off the end. This would be a good starter chair for a teen or child, but don't think they would have the leg strength to make it recline as it is pure body motion that makes it recline. I suggest doing yourself a favor and spending a bit more on a different model.", 
    "I can vouch for what the others have said about fast shipping and this chair being a snap (literally) to put together. It takes longer to screw in the four plastic \"feet\" for the chair than any other part of the process. As for the look, I bought the tan linen, and it looks just as clean and classy as in the picture. It's a fantastic choice if you want a recliner that doesn't look like a recliner. But, you better be a small person if you want to fit in this chair. It fits me perfectly, but I'm only 5'3\" and weigh about 130. This chair isn't much wider than I am (though I don't feel constrained at all by it). The head rest is slightly taller than my head, and the foot rest comes to about my ankles. It's perfect for me, but if you're much taller or have more mass, you'll want to go a different route. I am completely pleased with my new recliner!", 
    "Comfortable, but did not hold up. The fabric is too fragile for my life.", 
    "Excellent value. If you are looking for a sleek addition to your space, this is a great chair. We don't use it heavily, but it's a great alternate seat and the perfect size for our compact space. Quality of fabric is good.Very easy assembly. Reclining feature works well. Really happy with the chair. Considering getting a second one.", 
    "This is the second recliner I bought on O. Very stylish. The color and the fabric are great. It's comfortable and I like that the modern design fits in while still being comfortable. Fall asleep all the time in it!", 
    "Wanted a small recliner. It is small and only fits I would say a person 5'4 and under. If your looking for sturdy for everyone don't purchase. As an accent chair it works. Nice looking just not heavy uses area.", 
    "Very easy to assemble and very comfortable. Loving it!", 
    "Comfortable recliner chair", 
    "I've waited so long long for a small recliner like this one, if fits perfectly in my bedroom without the clutter. The style is thin, not bulky and so comfortable that I've taken many naps. My friend loved it so much that she has me watching for the next sale .", 
    "This chair is smaller than I expected. I'm 5'6\" and sit in it comfortably but it is not a soft plush comfrey recliner. But the price was right and it serves the purpose. Also, my cats are drawn to scratching it. Most furniture they don't bother.", 
    "Good price but you get what you pay for. It will go in the playroom for the kids when we get a better one.", 
    "We got this for my 87yr old father-in-law who can barely move. His core muscles are so weak that he slips off a regular sofa chair. The sturdy armrests provide rigid stability for him to push off of. It seemed small when we put it together, but it is perfect for his 5'7\", 160lb stature. We chose it versus automatic so he doesn't accidentally press something that'll surprise him or throw him off. Manual seat changes are better for him.", 
    "This is a small chair. I am 5'4\" and 135 pounds and this chair is perfect for me. It is not made for my 6' 230 pound husband. It is pretty comfortable as well.", 
    "My hip started giving me major problems and I realized that my sofa and loveseat was too soft and lacked support. My hips felt so much better after sitting in this chair for 30 minutes. And the reclining angle is perfect. Now my husband constantly fight to get this chair. Will have to order one for him soon. Can beat the price and the easy assembly.", 
    "The recliner is as it looks in it's picture. It is a slim chair and fits into smaller spaces. It is nice looking with tight stitching. The seat is hard and there is no getting around that, The back is comfortable as is the reclining position. It leaves both my husband and my feet hanging off the end in the fully reclined position, we are both 5'8\" and of average size, wt. BUT after sitting in it for even an hour we have to change rooms to watch t.v., it's just to hard, really skimpy on the seat cushion.", 
    "These recliners are perfect. I was looking for something small and comfortable. I think the price was also great.", 
    "Small, not very comfortable, but the price is right.", 
    "Small size is perfect for my small condo. Real comfortable too", 
    "These are cute chairs, but they are small. I purchased them for my kitchen hearth area and they looked dwarfed. I decided to keep them because the pricing was so cheap and give them to my little boys for their room (ages 7 and 9). When adults sit in them, you look silly. Maybe a woman 5'2\" or less. But definitely not a man or taller woman. In fact, they are perfect size for my little boys. Also, we've had them for 60 days and the fabric ripped at the seam. They are still under manufacturers warranty, but I'm having problems with Overstock and the manufacturer. They've acknowledged they are under warranty, but nobody wants to replace it. Very frustrating. I wouldn't purchase again.", 
    "OMG, this is so darn fabulous!!! It looks so good in my livingroom. It matches perfectly with my new ******* * **** Linen Daybed with Trundle (Dark Grey). It's not big and bulky... We love it!", 
    "I love this chair. I bought 2 for my bedroom and is the perfect size.", 
    "Bought two of these chairs in dark grey linen for a room that didn't have a lot of space. I grouped them together on one side of the room and they look great. Modern and sleek with the bonus of being super comfortable. I'm 5'7\" and have had others up to 6' sit in them and be comfortable. They might be a little on the small side for anyone bigger, but work great for us. Our guests have asked where we got them and want some too!", 
    "I weight 175 and am 5'10\". This chair is comfy and is a great size to fit in a small area... but, it is pretty much worth what you pay. After only a few weeks of using it, I feel worried each time it recline it that it might be its last time! Also the stuffing inside the footrest has shifted and looks lumpy. Wish the overall quality was a bit better.", 
    "Perfect smallish apartment size and color for my decor (Dark Gray Linen). I live in a studio and it has a great footprint for a small space. Would not be good for someone over 5'5\" I think.That's my height and my feet do hang over but not uncomfortably. Very stiff opening action, takes a good grip and push to open it. Good though as I doubt it will ever slip. Wonderful that there are two positions, slightly reclined with feet up and fully horizontal. Perfect easy nap chair, just a throw blanket needed to nod off with a good book. I have yet to make it through a whole movie late at night if I watch from the recliner! lol Easy set up too. Luckily the *** fellow left it right outside my door. No trouble pushing it into my space. Assembly=Just screw the four legs into the seat base then click the back into the seat base and Voila! A huge screw did fall out of the seat base but I couldn't see where one was missing and nothing has collapsed so I have to assume it was just a factory mistake/extra!?! Cushy too. Seat foam is firm enough that it should last a good while. Back cushions are very soft & comfy. My only complaint is that the seat is very low, which is tough on my bad knees, but the chair arms and an extra seat cushion I've added help with that. All in all I highly recommend it, especially at it's extremely affordable price.", 
    "We've only had these for a couple weeks, but they are so comfortable. I'm 5'4\" and my partner 5'10\". He likes a little back pillow to get just the right comfort level. For me, these are perfect as is. They're small, but we only had a small space. They don't get daily use, maybe 3 times per week. They seem sturdy, so for the price, seem like a great deal. We had considered the ********** ****** recliners, but saw too many reviews of those ones falling apart after a couple months of use. Hopefully these will live up to their sturdy feel. We did need to off gas these chairs with the windows open. There's an odor to them, although we also got a TV around the same time, which also smelled. Something still gives me a headache if I'm in the room after two weeks, but my partner didn't smell the odor after the first evening with the window open. It will eventually dissipate, and probably only the most sensitive will notice the initial smell. I just mention for people who have difficulty with toxic smells from things like new carpet, new appliances, etc. These aren't excessive, but they do off gas a bit. Still a five star rating because so many things do these days. At least they didn't have a fake odor, and for the price, you really can't beat this style and comfort!", 
    "Easy to assemble. Feels like recliners that are three times the price.", 
    "Love..Love this chair..a little difficult to recline but reclines to the perfect position..Firm sleek design.", 
    "Cute little recliner and easy to handle at only 80lbs.", 
    "Beautiful addition. Very easy to assemble and comfortable too. definitely recommend.", 
    "This is exactly what I was looking for. A sleek but comfortable recliner chair. I'm 5'6 and it fits me perfectly. My boyfriend is 5'10 and he can fit comfortably as well. His feet hang off the foot rest a little but the back is tall enough that he can still rest his head on it. Only thing that's a little weird is I ordered the light gray fabric color and what I got is a very light tan/beige fabric. Not really how anyone could ever write this off as gray at all, but luckily I like the tan color anyway so I just kept it. If you're looking for an actual gray maybe shoot for the dark gray?", 
    "small but a good firm chair. looks good in the corner of the bedroom. love the color!", 
    "Clean Lines and fairly narrow--not like so many of the big bulky recliners for sale. It was easy to connect the two pieces (seat and back). It sits by my desk as a place to relax and doesn't take up a lot of space.", 
    "The chair is quite comfortable. Like the other reviews state it is quite stiff to recline and close. I'm unsure why everyone is stating that the chair is too small for someone 5'6\". Being 5'10\" the chair is very comfortable and when reclined supports my legs just fine. My issue thus far is I have had the recliner only two weeks or so, sat in it only a handful of times, and the back cushion of the chair looks saggy already. I got the tan linen, the color is exactly as pictured. It's lovely for the price. I had been looking for some time for a smaller recliner...most were either very overpriced or too big for the space I need. I would not have anyone over 200 pounds sit in this chair. It is definitely constructed for a woman and not a larger man. That being said I'm quite happy with the purchase.", 
    "This chair is very comfortable. But definitely not for very tall and very large framed people. It fits me perfectly. The color is as reviews said very dark gray, looks like black denim. Now i have to think about a color for a sofa that would match. It was very easy to put together. One, two and three steps and it was done.", 
    "These are cheap, assemble yourself chairs. They work, my kids love them and they are compact enough to fit in our small space. I would like them more if they had more stuffing, offering low back support, and if the fabric was thicker. I'm still glad that I bought them. On the budget that I'm on, I would probably but them again.", 
    "Love it. Small in size, but comfortable. Matches the colors in my bedroom.", 
    "My husband love it!! I'm going to get another for me", 
    "Exactly what we were looking for. Chair is compact but not too small! Comfortable!", 
    "Very comfortable, easy to assemble. I recommend it", 
    "Not too big. Mechanisms work smoothly. Be careful if you get the linen material though as it is not quite as durable. Comfortable.", 
    "I highly recommend this recliner for it is easy to put together and its nice neutral color and comfort. This chair is especially nice if you need something for a small space or guest room. I like the height for the head rest , its been good for my taller or petite visitors.", 
    "3 of my friends have bought one since they saw it! Need I say more?! Impossible to get such a great looking recliner for this price. Bit narrow, but very comfortable.", 
    "I am 6'2\" so the chair feels a little small and it is narrow, but overall an OK chair. Color is spot on but due to size and lack of \"overstuffing\" it just looks a little cheaper than the look I was going for.", 
    "This is a small recliner for a small area and a short person. I'm only 5'2\" and it fits just right. I would suggest if you are over 5'6\" you look for something larger.", 
    "I received my two recliners a week later than the expected date. But I was truly happy with my purchase. I order the gray fabric. It's a real light gray so which match beautiful in my bedroom. The chairs are real study and the fabric is good quality. Recommend this product.", 
    "This chair is maid very well / BUT is VERY VERY SMALL !! Is very good looking .", 
    "I gave this recliner 5 stars because it looks exactly as pictured and well made. The design is great and I'm happy I found a recliner that didn't look like your typical, floppy, grandad recliner. I ordered the dark grey linen and it does not appear \"black\" in our home, as stated in other reviews. However, we do live in a loft with floor-to-ceiling windows, bringing about a lot of natural light on the recliner's true color. The entire chair reclines out fully and while the seat is firm, the back cushion is very comfortable - a nice combination. For the price, I feel this is one of my best purchases on Overstock.", 
    "This elegant recliner was a great buy and easy to assemble. I will purchase another one!", 
    "Definitely a small and firm recliner but comfortable.", 
    "The chair was okay, not for anyone over 5'5, it was a nice material and good quality otherwise. We returned it and purchased something else.", 
    "I purchased the dark gray linen. It was very easy to assemble, and matches the love seat I purchased from Overstock beautifully. It's comfortable, and sturdy. Very happy with this product.", 
    "I am adding my two cents because the good reviews were what encouraged me to try out this chair. It's a hard thing to buy without trying it out first. I wanted a comfortable chair for my living room that looked a little more formal than a traditional Lazy Boy type recliner. This was a good deal, arrived quickly (with free shipping!) and is very comfortable. I was a little nervous when it first arrived because the box and tag say \"InspireQ\", not \"Tribecca Home\", but it's definitely the right chair. My only real warning would be this: I am 5'8\" tall and I think if you are much taller than that, you won't necessarily get great neck/head support. All in all a great chair, and I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "I ordered this chair not fully knowing what to expect and it is even nicer than described.Easy to assemble -- I did it myself!", 
    "Very disappointed in the fabric. It began to pill is just over a month. I wouldn't recommend this because the fabric is clearly of a very poor quality."
