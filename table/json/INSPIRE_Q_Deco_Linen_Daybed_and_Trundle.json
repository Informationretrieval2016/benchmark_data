    "I ordered the trundle version after reading previous reviews. It arrives in three boxes. I put this product together myself in less than two hours. I had my husband tighten all joints with a drill afterwards. I bought a XXX mattress from Mattress Firm that dropped right in the top bed. Because of previous reviews, I thought fitting the bottom mattress would be a challenge so I didn't buy one for the bottom YET. The mattress I bought for the top dropped right into the bottom slot with no problem. The only issue is, it is ten 1/2 inches thick and I must lift the couch slightly to slide the bottom back with this thick mattress. I'm a sixty-year old woman and it was no problem. I planned to buy a thinner mattress for the bottom but my husband said no. He feels the slight inconvenience of lifting the couch 1\" off the floor to pull the trundle in and out is worth it to have our guests (who come two week a year) comfortable. (A 9\" mattress would slide easily) My only complaint about this product is the linen had a couple of snags. DON'T CUT THEM OFF. I used a small needle and poked them back into the stitching. They are now invisible. I searched the city of Albuquerque and all the daybed trundles were either metal or wood. This had the modern look I was seeking. I have no regrets on purchasing this product.", 
    "Bigger than I thought and need to get a bigger mattress than I ordered. It looks like a couch , but really roomy as a bed. Very happy", 
    "Once assembled, all the exterior parts look great. Very comfortable and the color is nice and unassuming that goes with almost anything. The trundle can fit a mattress or just extra storage. Some of the construction materials are a little \"thrifty\" but they are fine where it counts. It's an excellent product for the price point, and nice to find a daybed that gives the warmth of cloth.", 
    "I purchased this daybed to use in our guest room which is small and this bed is HUGE!! It's a beautiful piece though. A couple of things to note though, a normal twin is too small. There are several inches on the end of the mattress. You need at least a 10 in thick mattress to cover the gap in the back. With an 8\" mattress, a child would fall through. Pillows will hide the gap, but it's not safe for sleeping - I recommend putting children on the trundle. The trundle slides easily even on carpet and slides completely away from the top bed. It can be placed on the other side of the room. When pushed under the bed, it fits perfectly. So far, we love it!", 
    "I love this daybed! I bought it to furnish a studio apartment addition to our house- I was able to assemble it in about an hour- very simple. I bought 9-inch mattresses that fit perfect, but it would easily support thicker. It's sturdy, but light-weight for easy moving. It's big, but looks very elegant. Love it!!", 
    "It is a good day bed for the price, the assembly was very easy. However note, that it is not intended for everyday heavy use. The planks for mattress support are flimsy and if you plan on using this bed a lot I would recommend adding a layer of plywood to support the mattress.It works for us because we bought it for a nursery room to have an extra sleeping space in case someone has to sleep with the baby. It is also very tall, taller than I expected because of the rolling trundle underneath. It is a good option to have a trundle and having an option to place another mattress there and use as a second extra sleeping space, but for now we are using it as a storage and it works great, because it gives you tons of storage under the bed. We got this bed in a grey color and it actually looks very nice and true to picture. I would say that the fabric is a little thin though and you can feel the soft padding underneath. The material is also stretched a little at the spots where it is attached to the frame by metal stapler clips.Overall I would recommend this product if you are not looking for something fancy-looking-every-day-use kind of thing. It does it's job, but will not last for long time.", 
    "I bought this daybed as an extra bed for my condo. I love the look and the trundle rolls nicely and fits well. I read the reviews and noted that others said the last 2 screws for the back panel were hard to put in. It took my daughter and I about 1 hour to assemble it. I bought 10\" thick mattresses and they fit fine. My only regret is that the back panel is not finishes on the back side. It is covered with a thin, black fabric similar to what is on the bottom of couches and chairs. Because of this, it always has to back up to a wall, whereas I would like to have it caddy corner or in the middle of a room. Other than that it gets 4 stars!", 
    "Several people have commented on how nice my tween's bed is. I thought it was a little flimsy - the back is like a cheap headboard but the price is so great I figured I would deal with it or like most tween furniture I would get sick of it about the time it would be falling apart. It is holding up great and I'm decorating her whole room around it. It is very tall bc of trundle and design so it looks bigger than it is", 
    "This daybed is really great because you can put a normal mattress on the top and bottom. We have it in our guest room/office and love that it has more of a couch look but can be used as a bed. It was not hard to put together, I did it with my mom in about an hour and we aren't the most handy people. Great look, great quality. Love it.", 
    "The bed looks beautiful and much more expensive than it actually is. The only downfall was the fact that the directions for assembly were missing. Thankfully we were able to figure it out without them.", 
    "Really nice! Love the fabric, which is a very subtle, medium gray linen. Relatively easy to assemble, and looks more like an oversized sofa than a regular daybed. There are some small gaps, as others have mentioned, but a row of large accent pillows adds to the beauty & resolves the issue. Purchased primarily as guest room sofa & guest bed for 2 young boys. Very nice for the price!", 
    "... but fine overall.The first problem I encountered was some damage on the package that got to one of the pieces. Luckily, it was the back of the trundle so the hole cannot be seen unless you pull it all outside, but I will still send a message to see if they can send a new piece. The second issue is related with the size of the mattress used. It says it is ok for 7-10\" twin mattresses but the truth is that a 7-8\" will not be high enough to reach the lower side of the back piece leaving an ugly gap (and dangerous, a kid's arm could get stuck there). Even with covers. We are looking to buy a 10\". On the other hand, the trundle does not open and close easily with a 9-10\" mattress, you would need to lift the whole thing to get it in/out. So a 7-8\" mattress is recommended here. Lengthwise, there is another gap on the upper since the structure is around 77\" and twin mattresses are 75\"... The trundle is a bit smaller so it is fine. By the way, no way to fit a twin XL on either. The last con is about the height of the upper bed, do not even think about being able to sit on it like you would on a sofa unless your are 7' tall. 5'6\" here has to leap awkwardly just to sit on the edge and we still have an 8\" on top, once we have the 10\" to cover the gap with the back piece, it is going to be funny. But, even with these turndowns, we do like the daybed and it works for what we want (an alternative to a bunk bed that kids can use to sit and read too). The price is very competitive and Overstock often offers extra discounts, I have seen lower quality ones for much more. The fabric color is surprisingly accurate to the pictures, which is nice for huge items bought online (we got the beige). I hope it helps!", 
    "I'm not sure of other negative reviews but my boys are enjoying this piece. It was easy to assemble & seems to be holding up quite well. Happy about my purchase & so are my boys.", 
    "I loved the linen grey color. It was fairly easy to put together with my neighbor and his battery powered screwdriver.", 
    "Perfect eXtra couch and place to sleep.", 
    "Received on time and in good condition. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Really nice! Love the fabric, relatively easy to assemble, and looks more like an oversized sofa than a regular daybed. Very nice for the price!", 
    "We looked and looked and settled on this daybed with trundle due to price and reviews. It was not hard to put together and most of the work could be done with one person, a second person needed to help align the angles on the bed and trundle.", 
    "Super nice. The back is flimsy, but great piece.", 
    "Great Item Fits perfect to my space", 
    "This was a present for my husband's man cave. We were on vacation so he just recently opened the boxes. One of the legs had been broken and glued back together only to rebreak when it arrived at our house. The slats are not thick or made of a strong wood so we are concerned that they won't support the weight of a 200+ pound man.", 
    "Shopped around and Overstock had the best deal for the exact same daybed. Arrived pretty quick in two big boxes. The instructions that come with the bed aren't the easiest to understand (mostly pictures) but putting it together wasn't very hard. You need two people for the assembly, but there's not a lot of heavy lifting involved so it was me and one of my kids that put it together. Took us about 45 minutes. The bed looks much nicer in \"person\" than in the pictures. Very happy with the purchase and my daughter loves her new bed!", 
    "We needed a daybed for a spare room and found this one. It was so easy to put together even though it said it required 2 people I was able to do it myself and I and a 5'2\" 50+ female. The quality was better than expected and it looks great on the room. I would recommend this purchase to anyone.", 
    "Wonderful buy..made well!", 
    "Feels like good quality . Only regret, not related to the product, was to have not specified an official UPS warehouse for delivery. I'll never have anything else shipped to my home address . As a result of UPS leaving packages outside my door all day and not alerting me that they were delivered , my residence was broken into and I was robbed right before Christmas. The daybed cost me dearly in the end", 
    "The daybed is larger than I thought it would be, but it's great looking and of good quality. I'm a 70 year old woman, experienced in putting \"things together\" and I managed to put this daybed together by myself, however, if you have someone to help it would go faster. It took me about 3 hours total. I purchased an 11 inch mattress for the top (a 12 inch mattress would work) and a 9 inch mattress for the trundle. I think this daybed is a great value and I'm happy that I purchased it.", 
    "Perfect size for 3rd bdrm to be used as den yet can accommodate overnight guests. Be sure to measure space as this is a fairly large bed. Easy to assemble. My daughter and I put up in less than an hour. Sturdy. I recommend a 10' mattress as I purchased. Reg not XL. We love it!", 
    "The picture fails to show that even with an 11 inch mattress, their will be a gap between the top of the mattress and the bottom of the back panel of the bed. Disappointed about the look of it because we purchased to put in our formal living room to convert the room into a guest bed room for my mother so that she would not have to try and go up and down stairs while visiting. We picked this daybed because it looked more like a sofa than a bed. Blah.", 
    "the bed looks fantastic and the dark grey color is great. The only thing we added was plywood to strengthen the wooden slats.", 
    "To help you decide if this daybed is for you, all I can say is how elegant and high end it looks and feels. A solid piece. Very much worth the money and less than hour to assemble. We purchased in dark grey and 100% satisfied. I spray painted old dressers metallic silver, put glass knobs on them and my daughter's room is transformed. Unbelievably classy and gorgeous. Thank you, overstock!", 
    "Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful piece of furniture, and the measurements given on the website are accurate. The issue is more that proportionately speaking, it's dwarfing the room I have it in, which is an issue with all furniture made these days, especially when it's put in a house that was built before 1990. My only other complaint is that the backrest could use some reinforcement, as it is only attached to the armrests, with no extra bracing, which makes is too flexible, with a tendency toward bowing.", 
    "We love it! It matches my TRIBECCA HOME Saipan Modern Recliner Club Chair (Dark Grey). So far, I am sleeping on it everyday and it is so comfortable......", 
    "We bought this for our 2 y/o son. We wanted to skip the toddler bed altogether, and this works great! We let him sleep on the trundle bed, as it is low to the floor. And then when not in use, it simply slides under the daybed. Looks so much nicer than a toddler bed, and we know we won't have to upgrade again for years to come! Added bonus - he can have friends sleep over when he is older and we already have a place for them to sleep! Would highly recommend!", 
    "My husband and I put it together in about an hour. Very pleased with the quality for the price. We put 10\" mattresses in both places and they work great. As others have mentioned, It would have been better if the back of the sofa extended further down but once you put a bedspread and throw pillows on, it's fine.", 
    "Looks amazing however even though in the description the dimensions read that the trundle bed comes up to the height of the regular bed, it don't. That's my only disappointment.", 
    "The day bed is great!, the top would fit a twin XL, but a regular twin fits great! Very sturdy!", 
    "I loved the price and the look online but when it arrived I was disappointed. My friend put it together for me, so i can't comment on that part but as I said in the title, it's just okay. I wish the back panel came down all the way, looks fine if you have tons of pillows. Purchased for my guest room, so it doesn't get a lot of use.", 
    "This Deco Gray Linen Daybed with Trundle was the perfect solution for our new Florida home. Although we downsized, we still needed an office since we are not completely retired. Didn't want to waste space with twin beds that would only be used periodically.", 
    "Well built, easy to assemble, as advertised. Good Value", 
    "Purchased this for guest bedroom/office. Was a little leery purchasing since previous reviewers mentioned issues to look for - denim looking fabric, missing pieces, fabric covering the holes, etc... My husband put this together and had zero problems. Maybe the manufacturer read the reviews and made the changes! One can hope. :)Per another reviewer, we did buy a 9in mattress for the trundle and you do have to lift up the daybed a bit to pull it out BUT it's only a bit of inconvenience to make sure guests are comfortable. Very happy with this product! Recommended already to a few others and they were bummed this was no longer being offered.", 
    "I like the linen fabric. Just wish the back came with some fabric to fill the space between the top part of the backboard and the back of the trundle bed. As it stands, you need to have enough pillows to make sure that gap does not show.", 
    "I love it! It was easy to assemble and is beautiful to look at!", 
    "perfect neutral color daybed that looks like a piece of furniture (couch). It is perfect in my sons room as an extra bed for sleepovers. I find him lounging on it studying as well.", 
    "We placed this daybed in our office to provide a sitting area and an extra bed for guests. It is wonderful! The color is more of brown/gray, but we were pleasantly surprised and happy with that since our wall color is beige. Great daybed!", 
    "This bed is a great value. Excellent price, super sturdy, and good quality for what you are paying. I would have given it 5 stars, but it lost a star because my very capable builder husband said it was overly complicated to assemble. He said none of the holes for the bolts aligned well, which he had to fudge here and there, and his exact words were, \"There are more instructions on a package of Pop Tarts than on how to assemble this bed.\" He wasn't happy, but totally figured it all out. My daughter and I are thrilled with the result. She is quite tall and it fits her well, and she loves the modern clean look. Very grown-up looking.", 
    "This daybed is gorgeous, everyone loves it, so much better than the wood and metal versions. Highly recommend.", 
    "This was everything I wanted and then some for my home office!!! I had been looking for months trying to find just the right daybed for my home office that would work for a sofa as well as a spare bedroom for company. Cant not begin to tell you how well this looks in my office. I have very picky friends, and they all would like to purchase this daybed!!! I do wish that the back would have come all the way down though. That would have made it much more comfortable to sit as a sofa. Nevertheless i still consider it a great buy for the price.", 
    "For our spare room, this bed was perfect. It was easy to assemble. Upon close inspection it's clear it's not the highest quality bed. There's a gap in the back which I don't love and I'm sure one of the reason's it's priced the way it is. I would have preferred the entire back upholstered.However, for the price and how rarely we use it. It's worth what we paid. It gives the room a nice look too.", 
    "I like the look of the bed but is not very well made, the material look cheap and not very sturdy. None of my family member weigh more than 130, but I still put a extra piece of plywood just to feel safe, I guess is okay since is for a guest bedroom.", 
    "I think it's very nice for a daybed. There is a review that states that the material has a denim look to it which is accurate. Compared to other day beds, this one actually would look more like a couch when not used (which is what I wanted). Really easy to put together (the instructions are a bit lacking but I figured it out on my own)", 
    "I was very dissapointed to receive this product as the color looked nothing like the picture. We couldn't return it because the return shipping charges were too high. This looked like a cheap denim grey color. Very dissapointed in this purchase.", 
    "works well in a small room,great contemporary look.", 
    "I will preface by saying my daughter does love her bed, however having taken almost 2 weeks to receive the missing hardware from overstock makes this a one star review for me."
