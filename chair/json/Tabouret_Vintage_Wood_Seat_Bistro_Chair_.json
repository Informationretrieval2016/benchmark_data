    "the seats on these chairs is a cheap stained plywood, not at all what it should be for the price, it should have been a nice hard wood, in a natural color", 
    "These chairs are very nice, but don't expect large/tall chairs. They are petite and shorter than your average dining chair. They shipped quickly and arrived packaged securely. They work ok with my vintage oak round pedestal table in my eat in kitchen, but are shorter/lower than my old chairs. I plan to add a 1-2 inch cushion to give them some padding and a little needed height. I like the wooden seat-some other reviews have said the metal seated chairs have a tiny, almost child sized seat-this is NOT the case with these chairs. The seat is fine for average sized adults. These chairs are understated and blend in nicely with my rubbed bronze and old copper accents. I am going for a vintage look and they suffice!", 
    "Chairs have a short back and small seat. Nice looking and good build quality, but others I've tried (like restoration hardware) feel much more substantial and comfortable.", 
    "Love this chair but not crazy about the wooden seat. We ended up ordering the original Tabouret chairs without the wood. Great style, comfortable, well made...just didn't need the wood.", 
    "I am surprised how comfortable the seats are. I really didn't want to buy and seat toppers since it would take the industrial look away.", 
    "We like the chairs, overall. The seats do not look like real wood.", 
    "Looks exactly like the one in the picture. I bought 4 of these and very happy with them. One chair was slightly wobbly so I pushed on the the legs inside and it fixed it.", 
    "yes they're short but that wasn't the issue. I sat in one for ten minutes and got up with a very achy back. Not a seat meant for long term comfort.", 
    "We searched high and low for the perfect cafe chairs to go with the truss table that we just built for our kitchen. We ordered 4 of these, and they did not disappoint! The wood on the seats goes perfectly with the wood on our barstools, and is smooth enough that it does not snag clothing. I will say that the vintage metal color is slightly more brown than it looks in the photos, but it could just be the light in our kitchen too. The chairs were the perfect height for us, and about 4-5\" taller than our table. We have already had a few dinner parties, and these seat children and adults alike with ease. In our first shipment, we receive one chair that was a little wobbly, but Overstock sent us a replacement chair right away, without requiring us to send back the wobbly one at all. I have a feeling that these chairs will be around for a long time :)", 
    "They are on the small side, but they are great chairs. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "I ordered this chair for our dining table. The chairs are short (a fact I overlooked when searching) and quite compact for a dining chair. They are good looking chairs, however, they are more on the \"apartment furniture\" side of the scale. The wood is not a good fake job either, also being dark it didn't bother me.", 
    "These chairs are great! They are short backed and fairly small compared to my previous chairs, but they have much personality. They are comfortable and sturdy. I would definitely buy again.", 
    "Chairs are in good quality, metal is a nice color, not fake antique color. The wood has a bit of a manufactured feel to it, but that is expected at this price. Feels like it will hold up for quite some time. Very happy.", 
    "people always comment on how cool these are. They are my favorite", 
    "Mod seating for small spaces. Works perfectly in our apartment! The size makes them flexible and adaptable to a variety of uses.", 
    "We ordered 4 of these chairs for our new kitchen that is not yet complete, so we haven't started using them. The in-person color of the finish is much more bronze than the pewter that is pictured online. Not exactly what we expected, but I'm unsure if we could find exactly the color we want, so these will work ok. The chairs seem sturdy, and they do have a nice sort of retro appeal--they're not something that you run into in a big box store, but more the higher end, specialty furniture stores.", 
    "These worked, price was right & scale perfect for the eat in kitchen of the apt. On chair needed the wood seat attached when we opened the box, no big deal.", 
    "I have a dining room table that I love that has a rustic industrial feel. I had a really difficult time finding chairs that I loved. When I saw these on overstock I knew they would be perfect. They look great and I get so many compliments on them!", 
    "Love theses chairs! They are the perfect addition to our custom made farmhouse table. Light and comfortable.", 
    "Perfect height for a desk, good seat for your bottom, just really dark, darker then we thought but Overstock was great, sent a return label, then will refund my account, ordered same chairs in a different color, can't wait to receive them!", 
    "These are well made & designed metal/wood chairs. I like the industrial look, that perfectly match my new Niketa crank table. The size is just perfect.", 
    "Nice rustic look. I paired with an industrial dining bench and rustic wood table. Cute.", 
    "Great chairs, go wonderful with industrial type table purchased here too"
