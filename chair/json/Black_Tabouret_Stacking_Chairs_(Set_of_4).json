    "I have 12 of these awesome chairs. I started with one set to make sure I liked them, then quickly ordered 2 more. They're really very comfortable chairs. They're wide enough to accommodate a larger adult, and the arm rests are very comfortable. I am a little afraid that they are going to show scratches quickly, but so far (about a month) it hasn't been an issue. What they do show are FINGERPRINTS. I have little kids, so this is an issue all the time, but I have to wipe the chairs down after every meal. They're also too heavy for my 6 year old to move once she's sitting down, so she has to kind of crawl in through the arms, which she loves, but could be slightly inconvenient. I really like they stack, so I can keep 4 in the closet for when I have a dinner party. Everyone notices and compliments these chairs when they come over, and I'm really glad I bought them. I can get 6 seated in these chairs around a 60\" table. And 14 around my fully extended 140\" dining table.", 
    "These chairs are better than pictured. Sturdy and comfortable, especially for a metal chair. The staff at Overstock.com were a pleasure to do business with. The best retail experience I've had in a long time. Thanks!", 
    "You may want to use these outside. If so, just use spray on clear lacquer. We use them outside and could not be more happy. Four chairs for less than the price of one of the French type. Sorry, France, but you get my money when I buy your wine!", 
    "Love the chairs .I plan to use them with a glass table .I also plan to place pillows in the seats . They stack well and really look rich .They are a good buy !", 
    "I bought these chairs to use inside/outside. They came in perfect shape and are sturdy and comfortable. Some have bee left in the rain and no damage or anything. I love them and can't wait to purchase the kids version to complete my set!", 
    "These chairs fit my round tulip table perfectly. The color is a chic glossy black, just as I was hoping. The rubber feet seem very protective and provide a nice grip on the floor. The stackability makes them easy to maneuver for cleaning the floor. Since they are black, they do highlight any dust or crumbs that may have settled on the seat, but they are easily wiped clean, making this a non-issue. Very sturdy, amazing quality, especially for the price.", 
    "I ordered the black tabouret chairs. These chairs are heavy, sturdy and well made. They are a good value. They look great. My only caution: be sure to check the item dimensions before ordering. When I first unpacked the chairs, I was a little taken aback because they are smaller than I expected. It's my fault, since I didn't carefully check the dimensions before ordering. If I had checked the dimensions first, I probably would not have ordered the chairs. I wanted something that would make a slightly more dramatic statement (I'm using these as my dining chairs). They are stylish and modern, but the effect is dampened due to their small size. I'm keeping them since they're a great price and it would have been way too much trouble to ship them back.", 
    "I like the look of therse chairs, the smaller size and the fact that they stack. What isn't stated it that they are for indoor use only. I wanted then for a patio. I hope the good paint job will protect them from the elements for a few years, at best. I wish it was stated \"indoor only\", then I would have made another selection .", 
    "Kid, pet, budget friendly solution to high-style decor. Great solution for even compact homes because they do stack and they are very light weight. They do not slide all the way under the table though, but it's alright. Ours is paired with a rustic farm table and a black chandelier.", 
    "These chairs are great and stack so easy. I didn't take inconsideration though that if my hips get any bigger I will not fit. :0/ and they're not THAT big. My husband fits snug but over all they are comfortable. Only down side for those that live in a small apt, you cannot reach over the arm and down to pick anything up and to get up and out, you have to push the chairs farther back. As you can see I am not use to sitting with chairs with arms but they are nice to rest on after a meal. PS I don't believe they gave a weight requirement like the other chairs but this holds perfectly a 240 lb man. :)", 
    "I really love the style of the chairs and the quality is good but they are small unless you are \"average\" size. I fit okay (5'6\" 145#) but my 6'6\" 250# husband did not. The height of the seat is okay but the it is very narrow where the arm curves around and attaches at the seat. Also the top of the seat back hits in an uncomfortable spot. Sadly, I needed to return them because I am the small one in the family.", 
    "Love my new chairs! I have a somewhat large dining table and wanted something to tone it down a little. The chairs are perfect and just the right height. They add a modern touch to my vintage style apartment. They came packaged well and with no imperfections. Wish I had space to put other chairs of this style in my place.", 
    "I love these chairs! They stack, can be moved easily from room to room and then outside for extra seating. They are very fashionable used with a modern table all the way to a huge wooden farm table.", 
    "Fit perfect for what I intended for them. Other than declawing the cat, this appeared to be my only option for dining chairs and they are working great!", 
    "Love the chairs. I like how they look. With three little ones they need cleaned often and it's an easy wipe down. The children can't tip them and it keeps busy toddlers in one place. Functional and nice to look at!", 
    "These chairs came stacked and fully assemeled. They fit perfectly in my informal dining room. Easy to clean.", 
    "Perfect, classic dining chairs. We got them as temporary chairs because the ones we initially ordered were backordered but we liked these so much we may even end up ordering the other ones after all", 
    "The chairs are comfortable and sturdy. Great addition to our kitchen.", 
    "These chairs are very good! quality is great, they do stack top one a little tight. Very happy with this purchase. Outstanding value.", 
    "These chairs are very comfy and strong...I get a lot of compliments on them. Great Buy!", 
    "Chairs fit well with small table on my covered patio! I'll Add some chair pads for a little more comfort.", 
    "I absolutely love this set of chairs ! Not only was the price amazing but the quality for what you pay was way better than I honestly expected .", 
    "I have had these chairs in the lobby at my office for a few years. They are still in great condition and look new.", 
    "Sturdy and elegant. Can be used with multiple tables. The only downside is that they cannot be used by people over a certain body size.", 
    "They're stylish, well-constructed, comfortable, and hopefully will be durable. The shipment arrived quickly and was well-packaged with no damage. I have 2 of the stool in the same glossy finish and like them all. They do attract fingerprints and show dust and dirt easily, but nothing a little light, regular cleaning can't take care of.", 
    "These chairs are durable and ready to use.", 
    "I received this chairs in excellent condition. Like how well packed they came. They are very sturdy and feel expensive. Great addition to my dining room.Now if you are or one of your family members on the bigger side these might not be the chairs for you.", 
    "Comfortable but much better with a cushion on the seat. Like the style and love that they're stackable. Purchased for a cafe.", 
    "love these chairs! exactly what i expected.", 
    "I bought two sets of these chairs and now I'm thinking if buying a third! They are extremely comfortable even for my tall husky husband and they are so sturdy and easy to clean. The rubber feet keep my hardwood floors looking great and they are perfect for entertaining which we do often! Fantastic value and worth every penny!", 
    "My kitchen chairs were way too big and these a a perfect size and they look great!", 
    "These chairs look great. Very sleek and modern and are surprisingly comfortable for being metal. I did notice on a couple of the chairs some sharp metal or paint drips that can scratch you if you brush against it suddenly. Not worrisome enough to send them back though. I also like that they stack so if I don't need them all, they don't take up too much space.", 
    "Love the look of these chairs. Liked them even better after they arrived. Can't beat them for the price.", 
    "These chairs are attractive and comfortable and stack away when not in use. Great for special occasions, when you have extra dinner guest.", 
    "Much sturdier than I expected. Great choice for the price.", 
    "Great quality for the price--our only concern was that they would look inexpensive but they have that authentic rustic metal material with a finish that adds polish", 
    "I have no complaints about the chairs.They are very sturdy!", 
    "I wanted something very simple for a very modern room and they fit the bill for sure. I paired with a round black glass table from Copenhagen and a sleek grey ultra modern leather sofa in the living part of the open room. Because of the minimal color I was able to have a very unusual colorful center piece for the table. All worked very well. I have had them one year and they still in perfect condition. I did not find them to be very comfortable if working at the table or on the computer for extended time. I got cushions from Ikea and they worked well but still not comfortable enough for me. I am now selling them on craigslist, want to find something more comfortable. They were great for me then as this was what I could afford.", 
    "I've had these for a year now, and they've held up well. No complaints! Also, no scratches or dings :)", 
    "I was very excited about these chairs. When they arrived, they were poorly wrapped and were all damaged. One was vary dented, which does not such about their strength. Overstock credited me with no problem, though", 
    "Durable, high quality for the price...actually turned out to be nicer than I expected.", 
    "I love these chairs! I was worried that they would be too low but they are perfect, sturdy, and look great with my table. Would buy them again!", 
    "Love these chairs. They are not overly comfortable but they are comfortable enough and very practical.", 
    "The chairs are as described. Decent quality, nice and sturdy. The seat's a bit hard after a while, so I bought some cushions which help. The sides where the bars wrap around are a bit narrow. It's not a problem for anyone in my household, but some heavier guests have been uncomfortable since the bars dig into their sides/thighs.", 
    "I LOVE the chairs! I was very hesitant as I was worried they would not look stylish in our new condo. But they fit perfect with the table/desk I bought and I'm getting so many compliments! Highly recommend!", 
    "They are very sturdy and high quality. Look great in our kitchen. We liked them so much we bought twice.", 
    "You get what you pay for. These are stylish and sturdy, they are a bit short but just what I needed!", 
    "If you, or anyone you plan on having over to sit in these chairs, is of a larger size, DO NOT BUY! The arms on these chairs are very narrow and make it extremely uncomfortable for larger sized folks. I am 5'7' and a women's size 18... I have plenty of extra cushion, and these chairs hurt my rump, and hip area. I am super sad, because the look and quality of them are awesome! Buyer Beware... I don't think any \"plus-sized\" person was intended to sit in these...", 
    "Definately need deep pads to sit comfortably. One other issue is after purchasing the chair pads, where the arms join the chair is not where they put the strings to tie the pad onto the chair seat. Problem solved by cutting off the cords that came with it and purchasing matching ribbon to tie onto the sides myself. Looks very cute.", 
    "What great quality and good looking chairs. They really are a great value.", 
    "These chairs are great using them in the dining room and love them", 
    "Nice chairs there wide so normal size people can feel comfortable in them. I love the look and nice shine. Only complaint I have is that one of the chairs was a little rocky. But other than that I love them.", 
    "Form and function together can be hard to find and these chairs are wonderful, stylish and very comfortable. Perfect for our outside dining table. Ordered and received 3 days later. Overstock...you are amazing!", 
    "These chairs are exactly what I was looking for. Love that they come fully assembled in a pack of 4. Very durable and comfortable. We get lots of compliments on them! Much better price than I found anywhere else.", 
    "nice quality and good construction, easy to put together", 
    "I love these chairs more every day. Fantastic find, great price, and sturdy, attractive chairs. Would buy again in a heartbeat!", 
    "The chairs are so nice that I actually ordered more! They came perfectly packaged, no scrappy boxes! We plan to use these commercially.", 
    "My kids need the chairs in thier room. Just right (and stylish). With the selection of colors we chose black. We are happy with the prompt delivery and quality of the merchandise. (at a fair price) Thanks for the good work.", 
    "These chairs are really well made, with the gloss blackness , they make a statement. Put them with a painted yellow Queen Anne table and black buffet. We sold the house we had them in within a month. Great chairs for the money. Will be buying more of them. Good deal.....", 
    "Love these chairs. They were just what I was looking for. They arrived promptly, were very well packed, and the photo and description of them on the web site was spot on.", 
    "I ordered 8 of these chairs for my dining room. I wanted an eclectic/modern/industrial look and these chairs are a perfect fit! They are lightweight, yet surprisingly sturdy. I plan to throw some lamb skins over the back to complete the look and add a bit more cushion for lingering conversations at the table. I was looking at lots of other places and even their sale prices don't compare to the Overstock price. Also, I ordered them and got them in less than a week with free shipping. Great experience.", 
    "Love them! Great quality, looks great! High quality paint job (got mine in black), no imperfections of scratches. Thick rubber covering on the legs so i can drag and move them without noise or scratching. Exceded my expectations, esp for the price. Use mine in my kitchen breakfast nook and they fit perfectly. The back of hte chairs are not high, so i wouldnt want them for a formal dining room.", 
    "Great chairs. Comfy and good quality too. Beware the box they are delivered in is really heavy as they are packed between wooden sticks.", 
    "I just received my chairs today and absolutely love them. They are perfect for the black wrought iron/glass table that I have. Added cushions to add some color and for a little more comfort when sitting. The reviews were right on and I'm glad I ordered the set.", 
    "These are great! I bought 8 for a weathered table and they are perfect - like a restoration type look. They are actually quite comfortable and just the right size.", 
    "These chairs are perfect for a small kitchen table. I was looking at these chairs on a more expensive website and was thrilled to find them on Overstock.com. The Black Tabouret Stacking Chairs go great with my oak table. Very nice look. Overstock.com never fails me...I always find what I'm looking for and I am always pleased with the quality and the fast delivery.", 
    "I love these chairs. Got a great deal with my membership. They are comfortable and very sturdy. This style is seen everywhere as the industrial look is hot, hot, hot! Thank you.", 
    "Arrived the next day after ordering online. The chairs are exactly what I thought they would be like and actually comfortable for metal chairs. One did come with a bent back but Customer Service got the issue resolved quickly.", 
    "These are very sturdy and perfect any where. I am using them as an alternate at my dining table because I cannot leave out my nice cloth chairs because of cats. I got some nice seat cushions for them and they are perfect and stack them when not using. I have seen them used at some restaurants where they want a mixed modern look, I think they wanted them because they are easy to wipe off and are durable, but also have a good look to them.", 
    "We received our chairs in great condition, as they were packed well. A nice modern addition to our kitchen!!", 
    "These chairs are truly great. They are lightweight, stackable, attractive, comfortable, sturdy, and reasonably priced. They were packed securely (the packing alone should cost more than the chairs!). My only qualm is that I purchased them with the intention of spray painting them another color (the chairs were only available in black when I ordered them, and I wanted them in bright red). If you purchase these and plan to keep them as-is, I would give them five stars. When I spray painted them, it was a nightmare. For some reason, the spray paint (high quality Krylon made for metal items) would go on then immediately corrode. The corrosion spread to a large area quickly. I am not sure why there was this caustic reaction, and the guys at the paint store did not know either. I used the same spray paint on different items without the problem, and it occurred with all four spray paint cans I used. I had wiped down the chairs before spraying them and this still happened. I assume it is something in the black/factory paint that caused this. Also, it took about one can of spray paint per chair which was more than I expected. The chairs did end up okay (if you didn't look too closely, because they were covered with crackled patches). Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and first purchase with Overstock.com. Thanks!", 
    "These chairs were purchased for a downtown retail space with an urban design. The store has not opened yet, so I can not say how well they will hold up. I also saw these at a coffee kiosk in a mall, someone else had the same idea as me. I am very excited to see how the space comes together, I think these chairs will look perfect!", 
    "I was looking for some chairs to go along with my patio table out on the veranda. Although, reading the other product reviews before purchasing these chairs....and learning that these chairs are not to be used outside....I'm using them outside any ways. Actually, I can't imagine anyone using these chairs inside. Someone in one of the reviews said they were using them in their dining room. They're metal, and heavy.... definitely not a dining room chair. I'm not completely sure why the manufacturer doesn't want them to be used outside other than the fact that they are metal and they probably well rust. Nothing that a little Rustoleum can't take care of though! =)", 
    "Very happy with my purchase. Wish they went a bit further under the table but they still look great", 
    "I ordered these chairs to use with our new stainless steel table. I wanted something that looked good, was durable and easy to clean. I definitely got that - and at a great price! They seem to be holding up well, and they are used daily by kids!", 
    "I'm very pleased with these chairs. I have been looking at similar chairs for twice as much. These are sturdy and good looking, and the price is definitely right. I am going to buy 4 more.", 
    "Does great with my eclictic style. Durable yet not to heavy. Surprisingly comfortable. It was a great purchase.", 
    "I needed extra chairs and these are stackable. The quailty is wonderful for the price. The shape is very modern.", 
    "I received 8 of these chairs a couple of weeks ago and am thrilled with my purchase. I like a mix of contemporary and traditional furnishings in my home, and was looking for just the right contemporary/industrial chairs to complement my traditional dining room table...these were perfect! They arrived very well packaged and in perfect condition, and are substantial, glossy and unique. The only caveat is that they scratch rather easily, but that doesn't bother me. Obviously the price is fantastic, too. I like them so much that I also ordered the black Tabouret counter stools for my kitchen island. Great purchase!", 
    "The chairs are well made, not wobbly, and pretty comfortable. Online these look exactly like the Tolix Marais chairs. I own 2 of the original Tolix chairs. There are 3 main differences between these and the original. (1) The seat is not as comfortable -- the originals have a contoured seat. These chairs have a very flat seat. (2) These are meant for indoor use only. I was disappointed to find that these are not meant for outdoor use. The product description said nothing about indoor use only. There were about 4 different paper inserts in the package warning not to use outdoors. (3) The paint on these chairs does scratch fairly easily. Mine already have a few scratches just from removing the packaging. I'm using them outdoors despite the warning. Hopefully they last awhile.", 
    "The price cant be beat. While they don't have the character of the topic chairs. At 1/5 the cost these are great.", 
    "These chairs are great. I got them for my dining room and look awesome. I know they are typically outdoor chairs, but they look good inside as well. I would recommend them, especially for the price. The packaging was very thorough. My set arrived in pristine condition. I just wish I could post pictures on here so you all could see the cuteness they add to, in context.", 
    "I really like these chairs for their solid build and relaxed look.", 
    "Really like these chairs, especially in black. Even with the arms, you can fit a lot more together around a table, which is great for apartment/condo size areas, but that comes at a cost of the size of the seating area as it's definitely smaller than \"normal.\". Also, this is picky but the seat bottom is flat, no curve or indent, so not sure how these would be. Very similar Chairs on the front cover of March issue of Architectural digest.", 
    "Very small, not for wide/large people. We are using them as dining side chairs, with rustic table, stools on ends. Looks really eclectic. Could use seat cushion, seat is flat and cold, but, do not want to have country look.", 
    "Shipping was super fast, but the chairs are just so so. The quality seems to be good and they stack easily, however, the base looks like a cheap square lawn chair. I was a little disappointed in the design, but you still can't beat the price.", 
    "These chairs arrived quickly, just as described. I agree with other reviewers they would not be great for a very large person, but that other than that they are perfect for our needs. They appear to be sturdy and well made and are not too heavy. Even with the little arms, they fit almost all the way under my table. I did have one chair arrive damaged but it was no problem at all to have it replaced. The customer service and return service was fantastic! I highly recommend!", 
    "I purchased these chairs to do something totally unexpected! I paired them with a mid century drop leaf mahogany 72 in long table! The results are fantastic! Lots of compliments. I purchased some cushions on O after reading another review on these chairs and was glad I did. I got the non slip in black. Very comfy and looks great!", 
    "I love these chairs! they came quickly and although one had a bent leg overstock sent me a replacement chair within the week and it was in perfect condition. they don't scratch, they are so easy to clean and look wonderful with our rustic farm table. I can't imagine why anyone would spend the money on a more expensive set when these chairs are so great.", 
    "These chairs are super stylish for the price. It was hard for me to get a good idea of the material, but if you've ever owned metal folding chairs (like card table chairs), that's what they're like. Very solid, sturdy and a good weight. They look great at the table. My one and only complaint would be that they are not super-comfortable to sit in for a long time, but I just put thin seat pads on them and they are fine. And they require NO assembly! They were packed very well for shipping, stacked with styrofoam padding between them. Beware, the box they come in is large and HEAVY!", 
    "These chairs were the perfect fit for my farmhouse table. Great buy for the money!", 
    "These chairs .seem very well made. I need extra chairs and the way they stack made them a good choice, I can stack eight chairs in the space of one. The price was excellent. Boxes arrived damaged but chairs were well packed and had no damage, color and finish were as described. Would recommend.", 
    "These are great chairs. I use them on my covered porch around the dining table. They are metal so I would not use them in the sun. The only reason I gave them 4 stars rather than 5 stars is because the seat is short. They work great for children and smaller adults. Since I am a larger adult the seat is too short and a little tight on the sides, I can still sit in them but not ideal. The next time I buy chairs from Overstock, yes I will purchase from Overstock again and again I will pay more attention to the dimensions. There are plenty of chairs on overstock that are larger and deeper, I will just be more careful in the future.", 
    "I have received so many compliments on these chairs; I have 8 of them placed at a long harvest table in our beach house. I glimpsed them in the NYT Sunday edition last week in a photograph of a coffee shop in Spain! They are comfy (I have thin chair pads on them) although not suitable for very heavy people due to the angle and width of the arms.", 
    "These are a stylish take on average metal chairs. I'm using them in my dining room, which is very casually decorated. They are not exactly what I was looking for but I am still very pleased with them. I like that they are stackable and they are durable enough to withstand my 3 cats.", 
    "What you see is exactly what you will get with these chairs. The quality is really great, and perhaps even better than other similar chairs I sat in at other stores. They have secure black rubber at the bottom of the legs which protect our floors. I was concerned that they'd be too lightweight & even tip over when my 21 month old daughter would try to climb on them but they are sturdy and the rubber footing helps, too. The sloping arms allow you to push the chair under the table just enough so they don't protrude out too much (but take note that they don't push under completely). For us this was important because our space is somewhat limited. I was also concerned that the seat of the chair would be too flimsy but all of our chairs are secure & feel very sturdy. We have a 30 in. table and the chairs come up above the table about 4 inches if that makes sense - just so you can get an idea of the look. Overall, I can't believe that we got 4 chairs for the price of one (when you compare to similar, almost exact chairs at other stores). The chairs came in perfect condition fully assembled - no dents or scratches - and in just a few days after ordering.", 
    "Very nice, small-scale, metal chairs. Used in lobby/office of factory business.", 
    "These chairs are awesome and more comfortable than I originally expected given the price and material.", 
    "Great chairs!! They were even better than I had hoped for. Perfect for extra chairs, they also stack well.", 
    "I ordered a set of these chairs to go around our glass dining room table. Our dining room is very shabby chic - in a color pallet of dark brown, black with accents of crystal and glass. These chairs arrived and I could not be more happier! They are metal and sitting for long periods can be kind of tough - but I figured they would be based on the product description. These chairs are durable enough to take outside for a party and fancy enough to leave in the house for a holiday dinner around the family table.", 
    "I bought these to use for large dinner parties and mix with three other styles of chairs. They are perfect and very comfortable. I might buy another set if Overstock gets some more in, or maybe a different color. They're great because they stack for storage when not in use.", 
    "I love mid-century modern, and I bought these for my son, for his new apartment. They are AWESOME, and very dramatic! i have seen them on many decorating shows since i purchased them!", 
    "I got my chairs today and I am sooooo pleased. I have never reveiwed anything online before but these are too great not to. These chairs are great quality, especially for the price. I have lusted over the Tolix but couldn't bring myself to pay *** for a set. These brought the look and quality I wanted for a fraction of the cost. Mine are at a medium tone wood farmhouse table. They are paired with white upholstered Parsons chairs that have black legs. Now if I could only find a rug.", 
    "Everything about this purchase was excellent. The description and picture were completely accurate. I found these exact chairs at *** and they were $109 for each chair. I will always look at overstock first!!! I have made several purchases and have yet to be disappointed.", 
    "While the style of these chairs is very nice, and the construction is outstanding, I'm sorry to say that the seat is way too small and the back pushes a person forward in the chair. I'm just 5'5' and weight 115, and I'm not comfortable in this chair. I'm really suprised that not one reviewer mentioned how small these chairs are for grown-ups. I should have paid more attention to the seat measurement of 15x15 inches. If you have kids, this would be the most perfect chair. Nice, style, sturdy and now worries for cleanup. Not an adult chair.", 
    "Fantastic chair for an even more fantastic price. I bought 8 of them to put around a large river rock table outside. It looks like a million dollars", 
    "My first order at overstock and it won't be my last. Exceptionallly fine chairs - modern and well-made. The shipping was A+. Fast and packaged with care. Loving the chairs. (Did need to add cushions however...but it only makes them cuter!)", 
    "Great looking chairs, really glad that I ordered them. Very well packaged and the two sets (8 chairs) arrived in perfect condition.", 
    "The chairs were shipped from Salt Lake City, Utah, and arrived in Georgia within four days. While they'll never take the place of Tolix, they're one of the best buys ever, hands down. Sure, they're a little too shiny (black), but I don't care. I would have preferred a natural steel finish, but again -- I don't care. I love the chairs. They're sturdy, comfortable, and look great with my primitive oak table. Protective non-skid \"feet\" are a plus.", 
    "The stacking chairs are perfect for our yogurt shop. We mainly use thme outside but they are so nicelooking we don't mind using them inside when we need to. They stack easily and are easy to move around.", 
    "We just re-modeled our kitchen and needed new chairs to go with our table. I have black/tan granite counter-tops and these chairs go very nicely. I just ordered new cushions from overstock because being metal you do need some padding. The width of the legs are narrower than my previous chairs that went with the table and that was a nice surprise because I can actually push the end chairs part way under the table giving me more room. My husband likes them because they are metal and he thinks wood is good for burning but not for chairs. I also previously bought the stools 2 that matchand have one under my peninsula for extra seating and one for the desk area . I didn't want a stool with a back and these fit nicely under the countertop out of the way . The stools also have hand holds so you can pick them up easily.", 
    "These shiny black finished steel chairs are stylish and modern. They're substantial-weighing but not so heavy you can't move them easily. I'm using them as dining room chairs in a modern house and they look great. The price was incredible - I've shopped in stores and online - and can't be beat. High quality, sleek and delivered on time in perfect condition. Overstock never disappoints.", 
    "I was so excited to find these chairs, and when they arrived I was not disappointed. Sturdy, comfortable, stack great for easy storage, and very stylish.", 
    "The chairs are very nice. They match my table perfectly.Although the chairs are a little hard we still like them.We put pillows in them and that added comfort and style!", 
    "I struggled with only giving these chairs a 4 star rating because I LOVE them so much!! I ordered 8 chairs for my teak wood patio table and they not only look fantastic, but they are super comfortable as well. The only disappointment was a tiny printed label on the bottom of the seat...\"for indoor use only- not suitable for high humidity\". Gulp. I have decided they are well worth the expense to have them powder coated with an exterior paint. So, thank you Overstock!! They're fabulous.", 
    "I love to entertain, but always feel like I'm short on seating and wanted something with a little more panache than regular folding chairs. I love the look of Tolix cafe chairs, but don't love the price tag that comes with them. These fit the bill! These are comfortable even without a chair pad (although I had some standard chair pads around that fit these nicely and upped the 'sittability' factor). My house has more of a cottage-eclectic feel and I was worried that the somewhat modern design of the chairs combined with the black finish would be a bit too sleek, but the look so cute. These arrived quickly and were packaged well. Buy these now. Do it.", 
    "I got these chairs to use with a farm table to make things more contemporary. They are good quailty, inexpensive and look great with the table. I can pull onto the deck in summer for extra seating. They arrived quickly and in good condition. The chairs wouldn't be for everyone--they are a bit shiny(I got black), but very comfortable if you don't need and upholstered seat. I recommend.", 
    "i totally expected to return these chairs. given the price for all four, i expected cheap and flimsy. not so. was pleasantly surprised these chairs are weighty and substantial and look great with my table.", 
    "Great chairs, shipped quick, would of been 5 stars but they need more contour to be 100% comfy. Perfect for the price!", 
    "I ordered these chairs for my kitchen dining table. It is from Ikea so it's really simple. These chairs gave it personality without being over the top. They are well made and can handle my kids scooting them around alot. The black finish is shiny and flawless. They are substantial but light enough for a 10 year old to easily drag around. And, the wrap around arms keep kids in place when scooted upto the table. With that stated, you cannot fit them under a normal height table so they do stick out but it looks fine. Great chairs with a great price tag!!!", 
    "I love these chairs! They were shipped super fast(and shipping was only a dollar!) and didn't need to be assembled.They look great with my kitchen table, they are very easy to clean and my four small children haven't been able to tear them up yet.", 
    "ok so i wanted to order the white, waited to long and was *very annoyed* that they sold out. Then i decided on the red.*sold out*. my last choice was black really, but they just arrived right now and they are amazing. they look so much more modern in person. they remind me of a pretzel chair? I am so glad i bought them. very sturday and do not look cheap.", 
    "I ordered 8 of these chairs after waiting months for and finally canceling an order with another retailer for MUCH more expensive and backordered Tolix cafe chairs. I am very pleased with these chairs. First, they were a bargain. Second, they have a utilitarian look, and I placed them at a long, primitive antique table -- the contrast works well. Finally, they are comfortable (I put cushions on them) and they appear to be very sturdy. Do not hesitate to order.", 
    "This product was ordered as a ''move in' gift for my grandson who was just accepted in medical school. He is totally in awe of the chairs..perfect to fit at his table which his parents ordered from Overstock. Perfect for studying/having friends over for dinner and studying around it. We all expect that he will still have these chairs and the table for his entire life..as a memento of his years in medical school and afterwards as he pursues his studies of hopefully becoming a pediatric surgeon. Thank you Overstock for once again coming through."
