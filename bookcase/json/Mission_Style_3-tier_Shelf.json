    "When I was reading previous reviews of the product, I was hesitant, but the price and style were perfect. I crossed my fingers and ordered. Unlike those people who had complaints, I was quite happy. All the screws were there, all of the holes lined up, the directions were easy to follow and I was able to assemble the parts and pieces without help. It took about 30 minutes. The finish was even and flawless. There was a small nick in the back on one piece that was easily disguised with a dab of black sharpie.", 
    "Good quality. Solid wood which is rare to find and a steal for this price. I wanted a sturdy economical bookshelf for my daughter's books and settled on this after a long search. The \"kiddie\" bookshelves could hardly hold 10-15 books and everything else was flimsy particle board. Also, I didn't have to hear hubby gripe as the assembly was quick.", 
    "I like the wood, style and color, but the top piece had a broken corner that the manufacturer glued back together and packaged for sale rather than scrapping the damaged piece and making a new one. I expect furniture to be free of such damage when I order it because it is a hassle to send it back. Clearly, Overstock.com is dealing with a very dishonest supplier. It is NEVER OK to glue a broken corner and not indicate to the buyer that the product is damaged. I feel taken.", 
    "Look, this is not an upscale piece, so it helps if you compare it to other units at a similar price point. This shelf unit is sturdy, easy to assemble, and looks nice-- just don't examine the finish quality or grain too closely. It is sprayed, apparently with one coat of stain with the urethane/lacquer together. No apparent rubbing to show the grain, but that's OK because the grain is not all that attractive anyway. Now, understand that these are shelves and will be covered with books (in my case), so that's mostly moot. I can't afford a great piece of furniture for this purpose in this location, and the price makes it a really good value. On balance, a great purchase.", 
    "This is a very inexpensive unit that is actually sturdier than expected. I'd thought with the open design, the piece might not be sturdy enough to support all my books and magazines; yet it is really a solid fixture. The color is true to the photo, but the finish is a bit inconsistent in the less-noticeable areas, and I recall a couple of the pre-drilled holes were ever-so-slightly off; however, I'm still thrilled with the unit - and especially at the cost. It looks great and fools the eye. As always, I added wood glue to all the openings for added security - as I'll not be needing to ever dismantle the piece. The glue probably wasn't needed. I'm very please with this.", 
    "Product arrived in good time and undamaged, with all parts and pieces. Assembly was done by myself using only manual screwdrivers and took over ninety minutes including both shelves, but I did not consider this an unreasonable amount of time. The shelves are as they appear in the ads and sturdy.", 
    "This shelf is nice and sturdy and a beautiful color. It took a bit of effort to put together, just to make sure that all of the screws were tight, but it was not difficult.", 
    "Easy to put together, especially since I don't do that well! Some minor blemishes, yet these shelves are open, light and stylish. The espresso color is a gracious addition to other furniture. Bought them fo books, not sure I will bury them with all that paper!", 
    "Relatively inexpensive, looks great and is sturdy. This is the third one I bought for my home.", 
    "Terrific little bookcase. Solid wood a cut above.", 
    "SmallerThan I hopedBut nice", 
    "exactly what I was looking for. Perfect size!", 
    "Easy assembly, study enough to hold two full shelves of books.", 
    "Well designed and constructed", 
    "Wish it was a little deeper. Good product for the money.", 
    "This works well for me. Exactly what I wanted for some pictures and figurines.", 
    "This piece looks nice, but it's a little wobbly, and not great quality. It went together fairly easily, and it's a good buy for the price.", 
    "Stain on the top of the bookshelf is thin enough that at an angle, one can see the multitude of finger joints. Back of shelf began to split because ore drilled hole didn't exactly line up. The bookshelf seems sturdy and will work fine, and was simple to assemble. Just know that it is not a fine piece of furniture.", 
    "A little wobbly, but looks nice from a distance.", 
    "This had been out of stock forever. I bought the 5 shelf bookcase and couldn't wait to buy this one too. Very easy to assemble and looks great. Great price too!", 
    "Easy assembly, solid wood, nice quality.", 
    "I bought this to have under a window and next to my recliner as I seem to build up a lot of reading material that I wanted within arm's reach. Comes flat-packed and there is some assembly but it's easy. I wish they weren't out of stock as I'd like to order another one.", 
    "i LOVE THIS ORIGINALLY WAS GOING TO USE IN LIVING ROOM BUT JUST REDID MY BEDROOM AND IT LOOKS REALLY GREAT IN THEIR!", 
    "Good looking-nice design-well made shelf- I use as shelf and lamp tablebeside my recliner. middle shelf for my remotes bottom for magazines and books- I am enjoying this 3-tier-well pleased with purchase at very reasonable price. Overstock always ships promptly.", 
    "Just what I needed for the price. Pretty good quality and easy to assemble.", 
    "Looks great in the sunroom with some plants and piano books on it. Exactly as described, sturdy, couldn't ask for more. Great value.", 
    "Good cheap bookcase. Not as nice as other furniture bought.", 
    "Easy to put together. Sturdy enough for a light-weight design. I bought this one after purchasing the 5-tier shelf because it was so beautiful.", 
    "perfect for guestroom bookshelf. easy to put together. pretty sturdy", 
    "This was put together so easily. All wood as descibed, a nice product!", 
    "It arrived on time, and very well packed. Went together in about 20 minutes. The only tool you will need is a Phillips Screwdriver to attach the bars to the top shelf. Wood has a very nice finish. Well worth the price.", 
    "A beautiful little book shelf that matches my desk. Easy to assembly and looks exactly as it appears in the picture. Excellent value for the price. Am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "We just received our bookcase this morning, and after about 30 minutes had it assembled, following very easy-to-read instructions. My husband is so pleased with the quality and the price. The color is true to the photo, and it fits the space perfectly.", 
    "wood shelves are tricky - these are very nice, good color and finish", 
    "Really good quality for the money. We are ordering more..", 
    "The shelf it's self is sturdy. And it fits in the space where I wanted it for. It's not that it's cheap looking but in no way does it look as if it's a real mission shelf. I'm not even sure you can say that it's \"mission style\". If you are looking at it to blend in with other mission pieces it won't.Where I have it no one is really going to see it except for me for the most part, but I don't think I would be happy with it if I was going to put in a more visible area in my home.", 
    "Decent quality. Easy to put together.", 
    "Nice \"real\" wood shelf...the finish is a little thin...I nicked a shelf during assembly. It was easy to put together It took about 45 min for me. Final product looks good & will be functional. I don't think it can handle a lot of weight...no encyclopedia sets!All in all good value for the price paid.", 
    "Good value for the money. Compares favorably to bookshelvessold at much higher cost.", 
    "Item arrived in a timely manner, in very good condition and was easily assembled. Very good product.", 
    "Overall this is a nice bookcase. The only reason for 4 stars is the buttons that cover the crew holes are so tight they barley fit in the holes so some stick way out and some don't. Also 2 corners were damaged on both pieces from either warehouse handling or shipping.", 
    "I got this shelf to fit in a small office/planning area. It looks great. The shelf was easy to assemble and is very sturdy. I would recommend it. kk", 
    "The mission style shelf was exactly what I was looking for in my kitchen to hold my cookbooks and CD player and tapes. I listen to music in the kitchen and I had so many books that I didn't have room for. This way I am able to display them with style and purpose.", 
    "Easy to put together. Looks lovely. Exactly what I wanted. Really like the color!", 
    "The description said it was solid wood, frame and finish. Well, it must have come from a styrofoam tree because it was not solid anything. Pretty darn cheap and I'm sad I bought it. I've bought many pieces of furniture from Overstock and have been satisfied, but not this time. Don't buy it unless you have small books or light weight items to put on the shelves.", 
    "This is a tasteful piece of furniture...VERY easy to put together. Looks like I bought it at a nice furniture store. I am very happy with it, the color is a nice cherry color. Perfect size for books and my printer.", 
    "This is a very nice bookshelf and very easy to assemble. It comes with some tools for assembly, but one would still need a screw driver.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Good and pretty sturdy. Nice color.", 
    "this is a great shelf, especially for the price. Easy to put together and very sturdy. I am using it in my kitchen to hold cookbooks, recipe boxes and some other kitchen items. I also placed a nice plant on top.", 
    "This bookcase went together easily. We like the dark color and style and it will do the job nicely. The very top shelf arrived with several long scratches and a gouge and is now being replaced by Overstock, which was very easy to work with. We've decided to use a sealer on the entire piece, as it will get plenty of use.", 
    "fit the space, looks good, easy toput together, price was right.", 
    "Sturdy mission style book case that appears to be easily accommodating two full shelves of mostly hardback books without bowing or tipping. Attractive, above average quality, and looks to be much more expensive than it is. Plus, I could assemble it fairly easily by following the instructions in less than an hour, and the occasional errors (note that the side pieces with 3 holes must face inward!!) were purely due to not looking at the diagram closely enough. Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "We love this bookcase. It was easy to put together, just make sure you follow the instructions and NOT tighten the screws too much. It is very sturdy. We are using it to hold some medical equipment that is fairly heavy and vibrates when in use. The bookcase never moves! A great purchase for a great price.", 
    "I needed something to put plants on in front of my window Matches my furniture was easy to assemble", 
    "very easy to put together, looks expensive but was afforadble", 
    "Recommend with reservations. I am no novice at assembling furniture, but this little shelf presented some problems. 1 - nowhere in the instructions did it say you needed a Philips head screwdriver for the smaller screws. Not a deal breaker, but I like to have what I need organized before starting a project, so that info should have been included. 2- (much more annoying) one of the larger screw heads refused to accommodate the small side of the wrench which made it impossible to tighten that screw. I had to run out to buy the smallest quantity of that particular size screw. It's a nice looking shelf: I needed something small to house my media units and it does this job nicely and inexpensively. Just not the equality control I'm used to coming from O.com.", 
    "Every thing I marked is true, putting it together was a bit time consuming however.", 
    "I wish I had gotten a taller one. All the books that I had didn't fit. I'll probably get another one It seems like good guality, and not too difficult to put together. I bouht mostly because of it's size(deepness), but I also like the style and that it was all wood.", 
    "Great shelf...solid wood...easy to assemble and looks great ordered this one and two taller ones and they look great together.....", 
    "I have needed a good looking bookcase for some time, & my purchase is exactly what I needed. I have limited space, so it is small enough for the space I have available. I like it very much.", 
    "Solid wood! not chip board or particle board. East to assemble. Nice dark stain. Perfect for my TV and alarm clock in my bedroom", 
    "This is a beautiful shelving unit. Easy to put together. Overstock also has a 5 shelf unit to match that I also purchased. Maybe a small glitch with installing the top shelf (alignment issue) but no big deal.", 
    "Fairly easy to put together, looks great. Just what I wanted and just as it was pictured on site.", 
    "For the price -simply elegant. A wonderful addition to an empty corner of my living room. Easy to assemble and color is true to the picture. Will absolutely order from Overstock again.", 
    "When I read prior reviews, I was a little skeptical, but I decided to order and am glad I did. I was looking for an attractive shelf for my cookbooks, and it is perfect. The shelf fit together well - nice and tight - and was easy enough to assemble that this 60+ grandmother was able to do it alone. With everything tightened properly, it is not rickety at all. The appearance is very nice and definitely looks more costly than the price. If I needed a similar item I would make this purchase again.", 
    "I am impressed with the advances that have been made in engineering 'DIY put together' furniture. These shelves were made in Thailand so I was braced for problems but I did not have one. I bought 2 bookshelves & both were no problem at all. The look much more expensive than I thought they might & they are real wood. Would order again .... & might !", 
    "Not bad for the prize. If you like mission style, this piece can fit in different rooms.", 
    "It's nice looking but they did not drill the holes for the top so I can't finish assembling it so that colors my whole rating of this product. I will try to get them to recify this problem but it sounds like a lot of hassle", 
    "Recently I purchased two of these shelves (two different orders). I'm using them as storage for odds and ends and I like the look and how it compliments my existing furniture. The surface is smooth and the staining appears even. The language in the assembly instructions was clear and concise. What I did not like is the fact the back crossbars never fit (peg and hole joint). On all but one of the eight dowel pairs I had to sand them down in order to get them to fit into their associated holes. This is quite disappointing considering the overall high quality of the product. Such an error could have been easily prevented during manufacturing (e.g. using a assembly jig) thus insuring proper spacing between the pegs/dowels. Once the modification was made (about 15 minutes of careful sanding with a wood rasp) the shelves assembled beautifully and securely. There's little to no indication that any modification was made.", 
    "Very satisfy with this product and the color match with my other furniture. I will recommend this product to my friends.", 
    "I like that this item is solid wood and is economical. I was looking for something just to hold my many books and this does the job. I had a little trouble assembling it by myself but got it done. I was disappointed in that the top shelf had its lacquer dulled by packaging foam paper as it left an imprint on it. I understand what the other reviewer said about expecting perfection for the price but I am from a generation that expects quality work whether the item is expensive or not. I had this very same situation happen with high-end furniture from a well-known department store. I returned that furniture but will keep this bookcase due to its functionality and I will put a large doily over the dulled laquer spot.", 
    "I highly recommend this bookcase. I'm not all that handy with tools, but even though I put it together myself, it is amazingly solid and sturdy, and looks lovely in my bedroom. I really appreciated that there were text instructions for the assembly of the bookcase and not just pictures.", 
    "This shelf serves my purpose for extra cookbooks. Looks nice, has simple, clean lines, good color. It's obviously not high end furniture, but for the price, better quality than some others. I can never understand people who buy an item like this for a relatively low price, and then rant and rave about poor quality, difficulty in assembling and color not matching the picture online. After all, what do you want for under $70? Henredon???", 
    "Easy to assemble, good value. This is a nice addition to the living room for books, photos, etc. Would recommend.", 
    "love the bookcase great price good quality the color was the same as in picture", 
    "easy to put together, sturdy and nice looking. only issue was that the hardware was not inculded. Overstock Customer Service had the parts sent immediately.", 
    "This was easy to assemble and it looks very good in my home office. I plan to purchase another one to match it. I will use it for books on the bottom two shelves and photos on the top shelf so it serves two purposes.", 
    "just pay attention to which sides go up and which ones down. and as other post say do not over tighten the screws overall a snap to put to gather", 
    "I thought that this shelf unit was a good purchase. It looks exactly as pictured and the dimensions are as described. It makes a nice entertainment center. I will say that putting it together was a little more complex than expected since it was billed as being already put together. I ended up needing help but it wasn't too bad and we didn't need any special tools.", 
    "I needed a simple bookcase and this was perfect. It is the right size and was easy to assemble.", 
    "After reading a few reviews (some negative, some positive) I took extra care to not over tighten the screws. I did, however, also make sure they were fully tightened. The result: a sturdy, attractive shelf and looks just as I had expected from the description. The item arrived very quickly, and is perfect for my needs - for records and a record player. It's also very attractive, and a very good price.", 
    "These are very handsome shelves. I bought 3 of these and 3 of the 5-shelf verson for books. They are sturdy and look great. Having a drill and a rubber mallet was important when assembling.", 
    "We were very pleased with the bookcase - the directions took a while but not too bad and we are still talking now that it's over :) I think the finished product looks like we paid much more than we did. It was worth the DYI effort. One tiny scratch was covered with black marker. MOST IMPORTANT ADVICE: As instructed, do not overtighten the screws until you are completely done.", 
    "I have been searching for a bookcase for the last 6 weeks and anything that came close to me liking was over $100. I found this bookcase online and looked at the dimensions, as the space I needed a bookcase for was pretty small. The height and width were perfect so I ordered it for a steal of a price. Within a week I received my order and it only took about 20 minutes to assemble. I am very happy with the look, quality and definitely the price.", 
    "I went all in and purchased 4 at once after reading afew of the reviews and was content with the shelves. I placed three of the shelves behind my sofa to act as a room divifer/sofa table. Decorated with books/albums/decor stuff. All three lined up fit perfect lenghtwise behind the sofa. Easy to assemble, I put together three under an hour. You do have to make sure the holes are lined up before you start tightening the screws to prevent cracking of the wood. They do wobble a bit but not sure if it's my tile floor or the table itself - but it goes away once you add books or whatnot to add some weight to it. I have the fourth one I am placing in the office and will be purchasing another one so I can place next to each side of a bench.", 
    "it was very easy to put together until i got to the last step: screwing in the top shelf & of course it cracked...go figure! the holes must not have lined up good enough because it cracked really bad on the front left corner & the wood was super thin so im not surprised!", 
    "used in guest room to display old books. perfect for what I needed.", 
    "I downsized from a large desk with a hutch and extension to a much smaller desk, and I needed something on which to put my phone, store papers, etc. This little bookcase fit the bill perfectly.", 
    "This Mission Style 3-tier Shelf is over priced for it's quality. It wobbles and the wood end-caps keep popping out. What I like about this Missions Style 3-tier shelf is it's dimension. The shelves are spaced high, good for tall books, and the book case is narrow enough, in depth, to fit in a tight space. From a distance it looks attractive; up close it looks flimsy. The Christmas Tree Shop sells a very similar Mission Style 3-tier shelf for a fraction of what I paid for this Mission Style 3-tier Shelf on Overstock....Look around you could probably find somethin better for the same price or similar for less.", 
    "Good-looking unobtrusive shelves hold books or anything else you need. Good price. I recommend this unit.", 
    "This shelf was fairly easy to put together, although having a buddy helped. We probably would have returned the shelf if we were planning on using it for a piece of long-term furniture in our home. The dye on the wood was streaked in some places, leaving very obvious changes in color like pockmarks. This happened on several pieces of the wood, and was really noticeable on the top side of one of the shelves. However, we bought it for a short-term bookshelf and with some books and a vase on it, it looks pretty classy. I wouldn't say that this is a quality piece of furniture by any means -- but then again, it only cost about $$$. It serves a purpose.", 
    "I ordered six of these shelves for my computer room and they look great! They are solid wood and my books look so much better. I was able to put them together myself without a problem!", 
    "When I opened the shipment to begin assembly I found that the top piece was cracked lengthwise, right down the middle. I immediately called Overstock, and they sent me a replacement piece which I received five days later. The shelves were very easy to put together, and look great. Thanks for the prompt follow-up.", 
    "The bookcase is the perfect color I was looking for and is very neat and compact. I found it just a tiny little bit tricky to put together (the instructions weren't really very clear, though it's not rocket science so I figured it out!) I'm a small woman so the hardest part was tightening everything up with the little allen wrench. A male friend helped me in the end and voila! Perfect! Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Love how easy it was to assemble. Very beautiful bookshelf, am purchasing again for my son's.", 
    "Only complaints are that wood pieces have very minor nicks, some in obvious places. The wood stain could have been better applied so that the color is uniform throughout. But overall worth it for the price.", 
    "Beautiful color, easy to assemble, excellent quality. Highly recommend it.", 
    "love this bookshelf. easy to put together (way easier than other furniture i've ordered through overstock) and best of all, it isn't press board- -heavy, clunky, easily marred junk furniture- may i never buy press board again. This shelf is mission-esque, looks well in the living room. Absolutely recommend.", 
    "I have ordered several small cabinets and media cases over the last few years and have had some bad experiences with the product not meeting the advertised expectations. That was not the case with these great little book shelves! They were exactly as described, hard wood, good craftsmanship, and they arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner. They are just right for my small home office and you can't beat the price!", 
    "We have been looking for a record album storage cabinet to store record albums & wanted something for over 200 records. Works great & was easy to put together. It took me a long time to find something that would store all my record albums & this does the trick.", 
    "The product was shipped promptly and we put it together in less that 30 minutes. It looks great and is very sturdy! Great value for the money!", 
    "As said, it's sturdy and is made of solid wood, not particle board. I think it was a good purchase."
