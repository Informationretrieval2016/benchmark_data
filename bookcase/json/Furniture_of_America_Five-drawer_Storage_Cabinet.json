    "I purchased this piece of furniture to accent my office space and for storage of papers and other documents(specifically to be used as a filing cabinet). First off, I think the unit is a bit pricey for the quality. This unit should be sold for no more than $89.00. This is a prefabricated unit that would be best used as an accent for the bedroom or bathroom. It does not allow you to place a filing stand for hanging files nor does it allow you to horizontally store paper documents. The unit was well packaged, however, as with other reviews the second drawer front panel (with glass insert) cut out for screws and placement holders for the glass came broken. Nothing a little carpenters wood glue could not remedy once I was able to shift through the packaging for the hard to see(transparent) placement holders. If I had seen this unit on display at a store, I would have thought twice about purchasing it as an accessory to my office for filing and paper storage as it looks much better accenting bedroom furniture or in a bathroom used as a bureau or drawer storage for washcloths and towels etc. The unit seemed pretty easy to assemble. This furniture is best suited as bedroom furniture for additional drawer space for small items or as bureau used in a bathroom.", 
    "Took the pieces out of the box. My husband said it would take all weekend for me to put together. I put it together by myself in 2 hours. Use it as extra storage in my bedroom for nail polish, makeup, etc. Love it. Will buy another soon.", 
    "This was by far, the best piece of \"put it together yourself\" furniture I have EVER bought. It doesn't even look like I put it together!! The quality if far superier than I could have imagined. It is smooth, sturdy, very useful, and very attractive. This could sit amongst the finest. AND, GREAT buy!!!", 
    "This is a nice piece. I've bought a fair amount of assemble it yourself furniture items. This is about as good as the genre gets. It took me and my 17 yo son almost 2 hrs to assemble even w power screwdriver . Definitely reccomend 2 people .You could do it by yourself but it would be torture.I am very happy w this purchase", 
    "I am still in the process of putting this together. At first glance I had trouble identifying the pieces, as they are numbered on the unfinished edge of each piece. To put the drawers together. Instead of following their instructions go ahead and put all three sides together and slip in the bottom to the drawer BEFORE you go to attach the screws. With all the pieces of the drawer together, including the bottom of the drawer....lay on a firm surface so that you can getll how the drawer will sit toghether BEFORE you start to screw it together. As you screw be sure to make sure that you are centered enough so that screw does go into the side fo the drawer and does not end up actually in the inside of the drawer. I messed up this part up trying to do it the way the instructions tell you. Better to get everything lined up the way the drawer will sit BEFORE you begin screwing. I have all the drawers together, and as a finished product it does look very nice for the money. I have put together many a computer desk in my day and have put down laminate flooring so this task was easy enough. Just that you need to mark each bag of screws and accessories and get the boards grouped together before you go to put this together otherwise it will seem very overwhelming at first. At first glance of the instructions, like I said, I had trouble finding where the boards were marked so I knew what attached to what. Check the edges of each board and be sure to read the instructions because there are different size drawers and you don't want to mix the pieces. So far so good, I like!", 
    "My husband and I put this together in about two hours. The instructions were good and all the parts were there. Very happy with this puchase as I usually am with OS. The quality is great for the price and it looks lovely in my dressing room.", 
    "Very low grade particle board. The oak laminate was shiny. Assembly was relatively easy and directions were clear. Took about an hour for my wife and I to put this together. Looks much better now that it's been put together.", 
    "This is an excellent cabinet,good quality and all the room I need for my clothes. Shipping arrived in just three days, and it only took me 45-1 hour to assemble, which is not bad and it was easy. Great style cabinet, it can go anywhere in the room and doesn't take up too much room. Great cabinet you have for your clothes, very roomy drawers and sturdy. The price is incredible compared to all the other cabinets out there that I've encountered. Excellente!", 
    "Great looking cabinet. I t looks better in person than on the site. I received my cabinet fast and the shipment was great. When opening the box I was a little scared I would not be able to put it togther. It took me some time but I got the cabinet togther and it looks wonderful in my office. The pieces were fine with no damages. Im happy with the product and The price was great.", 
    "The cabinet is a great contemporary piece - I use it for lingerie in my bedroom, it matches my dark bedroom funiture (which I also purchased from Overstock). There are lots of pieces and took my husband several hours to put it together, but it looks great when all assembled. The draws are very room and slide in and out easily; once put together it is very sturdy. I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend it.", 
    "I bought it because it the most affordable cabinet that I can buy and it turns out, I got more that what I paid for. This cabinet is so much for. Great drawers with incredible storage space, and the quality of the material is solid and sturdy. Easy set up, manual easy to follow, and the shipping was fast and I didn't pay extra for expedited shipping. Overall nice experience purchasing this cabinet. I love it.", 
    "Great cabinet to have with great affordable price and good quality. Very sturdy and easy to assembly. I also like the design and a great storage spaces that is very deep and can fit a good amount of clothes, etc. Good furniture for such a low price and outstanding quality.", 
    "This item was easy to put together, and looks great in the office area of my living room. The drawers roll smoothly, and it looks clean and modern. Would buy again.", 
    "I really got a good deal on this cabinet, I bought one almost just like it. The same size and everything but the price on this one is great and it even looks better in style. Also easier to assemble and it has a lot more room inside the drawers. It's also sturdy and whatever's it is made of, comes from good quality. Great cabinet to have for such low price. I lovin it!", 
    "Just the cabinet I was looking for. Great storage, good quality, easy to asemble, and a good looking cabinet. Worh buying especially with a great price!", 
    "Purchased two for my room and my bathroom, and I love them both! my boyfriend but both of them together for me and it didn't take him very well and loved it right when it was done. it has all the room that I need for the bedroom and the bathroom, and the design of it looks very well and it looks great in both rooms. Very sturdy cabinet and the I got the brown ones and it's amazing. I wouldn't trade this for anything else, I love them both. What more can you ask for, very affordable and the quality is beyond great.", 
    "Very happy with my cabinet. It was delivered by UPS in just a few days, very quick. Assembling the cabinet took almost an hour but it was easy, one of the easist furniture that I've ever assembled. The quality is great and I'm happy with the design, really sleek and modern. Godo price as well and very sturdy cabinet.", 
    "A useful and solid storage device. The alignment is good.", 
    "We have stoped useing Amazon.com. And like finding o.com has things we are looking for. Steve", 
    "The cabinet looks nice enough, just as the photo on the website. However, this is NOT made of durable wood, as the description states. This is all MDF and laminate. It's still not bad for the price, but MDF should be cleary stated on the product description to avoid disappointment.", 
    "I can't believe how cute this cabinet is, I love the design of the 2 glass face for the 2 upper drawers, very nice.To top it all that the qulaity and the wood is very nice especially if I didn't pay much for it. I got more quality than the money spent. I would recommend this to anyone, it's perfect if you're also trying to save some room, it fits anywhere.", 
    "I would recommend this 5 drawer storage cabinet for any office that needs a little storage space and decluttering. It is a nice finish for the price. It is not the highest quality, but heavy, solid and nice finish. So, if you are wanting a place for your paperwork and other odds and ends, this could be for you.", 
    "I found this at a medium level to put together. This is not for the impatient person as there are many parts. My wife and I put this together in about 2 hours. Parts fit together very well - there was no straining to make anyting fit. It is a nice sturdy piece of furniture once you get it assembled. I went back and bought the matching modern 5 drawer cabinet on Overstock for the complete set. My wife is definitely excited for her soon to receive drawer. Thanks Overstock.com for the great buy.", 
    "Great Deal! Not only does it provide spacious storage, it adds lots of style to the living room! Great delivery time and easy assembly. I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "To many pieces to put together. I never finish making the cabinet.", 
    "I needed an office cabinet for a visible spot, and this does the trick--attractive, well-built, looks and feels high quality. Drawer runners placed on the base of the drawers for stability. One serious problem, particularly for office use: none of the drawers is deep enough for standing files--I now have them lying down! Easy to assemble, I, an older woman, did it alone with no difficulty.", 
    "This item was easily assembled, all part and pieces were properly marked. when the item was finished, I had a expensive looking piece of furniture, the color and style was remarkable.", 
    "The wood is sturdy and so is the glass. Very nice looking, wish it were a little bigger. Only up to my chest. Definitely worth the price.", 
    "This five drawer cabinet is juse what I needed to replace my other plastic that was real cheap. I'm very satified with my purchase. Thanks overstock once again!", 
    "When one is use to buying a merchandise already put together, with this well it's worth it if you have the extra time. It very nice and also very elegant, I like it very much!", 
    "The directions are not the best, but if you go step by step you'll have a solid, good looking piece of furniture that is very good considering the price and how much more similar products cost elsewhere. I recommend this product and may buy another!", 
    "The size is good as it trucks into any space. Simple item for holding small items. Metal base is excellent. D\\Assembly required that can be stressful unless you have a good hubby to do it all :)", 
    "Great price and good quality. exactly what we were looking for", 
    "Th cabinet looks great when put together, but assembly took approximately 4 hours", 
    "I am quite pleased with the cabinet. It was easy to assemble and is sturdy and of good quality.", 
    "This storage cabinet is narrow so you can fit it in very easily. I use this for shirts and it holds alot. Very pleased with it.", 
    "I would recommend this storage cabinet. The quality was really good for the price. To be on the safe side I reinforced the bottom of the shelves with a silicone glue, but it wasn't necessary. I've never put furniture together, but this worked out really well. There were predrilled holes and the hardware was lined up in the order of use in a string of vacuum sealed bags. It took time, but the effort was well worth it. Awesome deal, awesome quality, fast shipping for only $2.95.", 
    "I was looking for a small cabinet to put beside the front door that could hide keys, hats, mittens, dog leash, etc. when I came across this. It was a little difficult to put together, but it sturdy and exactly what I needed.", 
    "Bought this piece for storage in our bathroom. I don't remember how long it took to put together but I was not in a rush. Did it while watching TV so alot of concentration is not needed. I would not get it if I did not have a screw gun or some type of ratchet. I think there were about 4 screws for each drawer. 5 drawers. Then a bunch of other screws. Easy assembly. Piece looks great just as in the pics.", 
    "I loved my first one so much, that I ordered a second one! Incredibly roomy; beautiful; and with exceptionally smooth drawer glides. I now have one in the coffee bean finish on either side of the bed, serving as bedside storage for my makeshift bedwall. Once you take a step back and process the assembly instructions and the parts labeling, the chest is not at all difficult to assemble. I also appreciate how efficiently all hardware is pre-sorted and packaged. Time consuming, yes. Extraordinarily difficult, no. This second time around, only when attaching the braces linking the two side panels did I even call for a second pair of hands - just to speed things along. Be careful, however, when screwing in the plastic clips for the small glass panels...do not over tighten, so that nothing cracks. Make any adjustments in positioning the glass first, then finish tightening; same with the drawer pulls. The chest is amazingly solid and sturdy once assembled. Be aware that the base is not metal, it is spray painted MDF. If you think that might cheapen the overall look, it can actually be left off. Yes, the chest is MDF, with a thin veneer - but the veneer is one of the nicer ones I've seen. So much so, that my adult sons are eyeing them now for their own spaces. They agree that these lend a kind of upscale boutique hotel vibe to the room. I have to agree with reviewer who called it their best DIY furniture purchase ever. One (actually, two) of my best Overstock purchases to date.", 
    "I was looking for a cabinet and it was just what I needed . It was the right size and color. It was not hard to put together. I couldn't be happier with this piece. Very sturdy. Loving it.", 
    "I needed something to store DVD's in paper sleeves and this appeared that it would work...and it does. I purchased some plastic bins (the kind that you fold to put together) and two fit beautifully along side each other. Due to the height, the top door is where I keep spare sleeves and drawers 2 & 3 each hold two of the plastic bins. I made divider alphabet cards and if our collection continues to grow, I'll be able to expand to drawers 4 & 5. This is being used at the library that I am the director of and I'd say that I chose a winner of a product. It took my husband probably 3 hours to put it together, but he took the time to glue and do it right vs. just slapping it together. He didn't complain too much (he was at the library and I had patrons) but still, he didn't seem to get too frustrated with it.", 
    "The cabinet happened to be the prrfect size for my office. Took a while to assemble and one of the panels were defective and had to be replaced (which Overstock was very good about.) After a few months the cheap veneer started to peel, annoying but what do you expect for the price. Remember the addage \"you get what you pay for\"? Well this cabinet is a case in point!", 
    "I'm very pleased with this cabinet. Although not \"true wood\" it is still a sturdy piece. In my opinion, even more so without attaching the legs at the bottom. I was looking for something small, sturdy, and somewhat tall. Perfect for storing linens. It has an elegant clean look as well. This cabinet also worked great as a place to perch our tv in the nook of our bedroom. I will warn though that it wasn't the easiest assembly, however; well worth the challenge.", 
    "I really do like the dresser/ cabinet. I do think that they should describe it a little better and not use the word \"METAL\". there doesnt seem to be any metal in this product. Beisdes that discrepancy I think the cabinet looks good in the office. There was not much assembly and I didnt seem to have much hassel with it. So far I like it and I dont think that people should be to drastic and say they are afraid to move it because it might fall apart. Ive moved mine around and its still standing. For the price I had for this Item Its great and doing its job.", 
    "This is a great storage cabinet especially the price! Very affordable, is way less than my budget that I was planning to spend. Arrived early than expected, assembly was pretty easy and quick, and I'm very impressed with the quality, it's very strong and solid. I can't believe with the price I paid for it, I got more. Great storage cabinet.", 
    "This product appears to made of veneers with a metal bottom. In truth, there is no veneer, it is 100% MDF with a plastic paper over it printed to look like wood. It is not shiny as it is in the picture and the silver part at the bottom is actually wood. Once assembled, it works very well and the drawer quality is extremely good, it's just disappointing that it is not really veneer. Overstock needs to remove that from the description. All in all I would recommend it but it's better to know the facts and not be disappointed. Of the glass inserts, one had a 6 inch scrape in it that you can tell was part of the manufacturing process. I had to touch up alot of the surfaces with a dark brown marker. Especially, the inside drawers, they were extremely marked up from the manufacturer. I would buy it again, but would probably prime and paint it a glossy black before assembly since it's not real wood veneer.", 
    "For such low price that I paid for the cabinet, I received fast delivery and high quality. Great to have which is a good size and lots of room for all your things. I love the style and all the room. Good buy.", 
    "This is a great piece to have off to the side and keep it as a pretty piece. Get ready to build though. I conned my step dad into building it because it was a bit overwhelming. It actually took a few hours as every piece has to be put together. All in all, its great. Its sleek and modern and fits perfectly on a small section of a wall.", 
    "great storage solution for my contemporary vanity!", 
    "I like it because it's very modern and especially the style. I bought the dark brown color and it's outstanding so nice. Very easy to put together and the it has a good amount room for a lot of my stuff. I like how I can easily throw everything inside the drawers to keep my surroundings neat and tighty. The price is also great, didn't drain me at all and Overstock did great with the shipping.", 
    "I bought this piece for my office, to clean the clutter off the desk. Overall, for a manufactured product that requires quite a bit of assembly, it is a very solid and attractive piece. Well worth the price! And I did not have any issues with broken glass panels. In fact, it came insanely well packaged.", 
    "The quality was more than what I paid for this storage cabinet, so nice and each drawer fits a whole lot of my things. Very easy drawer that glides smoothly and locks to prevent from coming all the way through. The material is good quality wood that is very strong and sturdy that is able to hold a lot of things. The shipping took a little over two days which wasn't bad at all, it was still fast for me, and the assembly which everyone talks about was also easy for me but took alomost an hour because I worked on it everyday with such a busy schedule that I have. But overall, I'm very happy with my storage cabinet.", 
    "I like the cabinet very much ever since it was shipped to me in less than 1 week. Usually order like this take a very long time, but mine didn't. I guess it all depends in where you buy it. But anyways this cabinet is exactly what I needed and the quality is great.", 
    "I ordered this cabinet/drawers to go in my closet to hold miscellaneous small items. It is sturdy, assembled easily by my very handy husband. Is nice enough to use in any room. I really like the glass front drawers. I am very happy with this purchase and it was packaged very well for shippng.", 
    "Very happy with my purchase...It arrived just in time and it only took me a short while to assemble the cabinet. Good quality cabinet with great amount of room in each drawer for all me needs, I'm happy for sure!", 
    "I needed a place for my unmentionables...something chic to put in a little corner of my bedroom. This cabinet fit the bill quite nicely. It took me about two hours to put it together, but was worth all the work. You can also use it in an office, but for what I needed, I love it, and the color is amazing. I'm thinking about getting another one!", 
    "I'm so glad I bought this one, is exactly what I needed for my other things. I needed this fast and overstock had it at my door step within the same I purchased it which was very helpful and saved me a lot of stress. Each drawer was able to consume all my things with an extra drawer for future stuff and very sturdy too. No more stress in trying to force my stuff to fit in other cabinet.", 
    "Quality is better than those I have shopped in local furniture stores at much higher prices. This strylish 5 drawer cabinet fits every where, and the storage space is great. I've never seen one like this before.", 
    "Not only is the file cabinet attractive, the quality is pretty good. The price was the best anywhere. The cabinet was delivered within a few days after ordering too. Came well packaged and no damages. Great experience shopping with Overstock.com", 
    "We needed storage badly and looked high and low for the right piece at the right rpice. We found it while browsing through Overstock. The drawers slide open effortlessly. The chest itself has a very contemporary and fun design - you can't go wrong with this piece!", 
    "I am more then pleased with this purchase than with any other online purchases I've made in the past but that could be of Overstock customer service. Considering the price, it is nicer then anticipated. I read through some reviews and people say that you paid for what you get, well - I really think with this dresser you honestly get more than what you paid for. Quality is not top notch but it is sturdy and it's holding up extremely well - considering I am using these as filing cabinets for my office. The only complaint I have for this is the assembly because it does take quite a bit of time - but the directions are straight forward so it was all that bad. All and all, I got 2 and I am very happy with them, so far so good. I would have given it 5 but again the assembly bumped it down to 4 - but it's a solid 4 for sure!", 
    "After buying a different dresser that fell apart within weeks, I was looking for something more solid but not too pricey. I ended up getting this dresser since it looks very attractive and just in my price range. It took a long time to put together. It wasn't difficult but there are a lot of pieces. I put it together by myself in about two hours. It seems solid and sturdy and looks great once its all put together. The true test will be to see how it holds up after a few months because my last experience wasn't too pleasant, but so far I'm quite happy with it and got many compliments from friends about it.", 
    "This dresser is pretty decent. I liked it but then every one perspective is different. The quality of the wood was above average, but of course anything that we have to forked money out we would want it to be 10x better than it really is but then for the price, I definitely say the quality could be upgrade to good. The assembling took a long time, 1.5hrs, it would have been better if it was little bit simpler but then I knew what I was going for when I bought a put together yourself piece of furniture so that really isn't a complaint. It's very good looking & creates the illusion of being a more expensive piece than it really is. Again, you get what you pay for, and it's better than others in this price range to be honest. It looks great in our dining room. As a matter of fact, the more I look at it the more I am glad I bought it. I am content.", 
    "Great product for the price. Easy to put together instructions and shipping was prompt. Happy with my overall shopping experience.", 
    "I read some good and bed reviews, but I just got to have this cabinet because it looks so nice on picture. I held my breath and ordered it. It finally arrived and I am so happy that mine came in very good condition and everything else is history. I LOVE my new FIVE DRAWER STORAGE CABINET WITH GLASS PANEL. Looks exceptionally good in our living room!", 
    "After spending hours carefully and tediously putting this together I was not impressed. The unit seems kind of flimsy and the finish didn't live up to my expectations based on other reviews. The drawers seemed to knock eachother when opening and closing them. I would not purchase this item again and don't plan on keeping it for very long. If you are looking for quality, this isn't it.", 
    "This is a wonderful storage unit. It is easy to assemble (really), and stylish as well as functional. I am using it in a home office, it has an adequate amount of storage space and it looks great as well. I highly endorse this product for anyone who requires storage in a small or compact space. The unit also is well built and has a very polished look. It is a very good buy for the money.", 
    "Both glass doors came with the fasterners, that hold the glass in place, broken. I could have returned it but it was in the middle of assembly when it was found. I thought it would be too much trouble. My nephew put it together and he said it wasn't that hard to assemble, but it had lots of pieces and it took him hours to complete.Other than that it's a nice looking piece of furniture that will look good in any room.", 
    "This item is to be assembled. I had completed all of the assembly except attaching the drawers to the drawer glides. When I tried to screw the drawer to the drawer glide the pre-drilled hole was too large and it would not attached/grip..I have been going round and round with customer service and have been shipped unrelated parts 3 times. Overstock customer service has been great but the manufacturer they deal with is incompetent. I'd like to have the issue resolved however I would have to disassemble the thing to send it back and that is more of my time wasted.", 
    "Really nice color and well made. Looks more expensive then it is.", 
    "This is a great cabinet to store towels and washcloths. We did not have a linen closet in our new home and this has helped to add storage.", 
    "I have been using this unit in my office and it is pretty sturdy. I pack books, folders files in it as the drawers are spacious and deep. I have been using this for over 2 years and there has been no buckling or bending the drawers glide open and shot smoothly. The design is sleek and goes with almost any decor and takes up little space for the capacity it stores. price wise it was a bargain.", 
    "Great looking storage cabinet. But, it's not a file cabinet as I thought it was when I ordered it. I still decided to keep it because of the good quality and look of it.", 
    "Great quality would recommend", 
    "Not what I thought I was getting, but it's beautiful and well build.", 
    "just what I was looking for", 
    "First, let me preface this by saying that my needs for ease of assemblage may be different from others. For individuals who are handy or like to put together furniture this could take up to 2 hours. It's a gorgeous and functional piece when put together.", 
    "broke easily drawers came off and is made of cheap laminate", 
    "Adds sophistication to my study", 
    "The storage cabinet came in great condition and was easy to put together. Some of the drawers would not stay shut, though. Over time, it's settled a bit and the drawers stay shut now but do not shut smoothly. The cabinet looks nice, though, and does what I need it to do - hold my stuff!", 
    "The picture makes it appear much larger than it is. But overall its a nice piece. You do need to take care when you put it together and it isn't the strongest piece of furniture. But from an aesthetic appeal and functional set of drawers its good.", 
    "Item is of nice quality and looks really nice. However it is not as big as you expect based off of the information provided. There was not enough depth in the drawers to actually use a a file cabinet.", 
    "solid (heavy actually). its currently awaiting its \"final destination\" as we are renovating, but it even looks good in our over stuffed eclectic holding area for all furniture :)", 
    "Very functional and attractive.", 
    "great cabinet but i was expecting it to be a lot bigger, its not as big as it looks", 
    "I've had this for 18 months now and really do love this! The wood is deep risk espresso. The glass pieces are clear with that vintage *almost but not quite aqua* tint. The hardware is a nice brushed stainless look. Have used it in a bathroom, a bedroom, and the hallway between bedroom and bath. Narrow enough to fit where dressers won't fit. Love the various depth drawers. LOTS of storage space here!When I looked at the very involved assembly instruction, I was scared and had my nephew over to assemble it. It took him quite a while as he was concerned about getting parts mixed up. To remain organized with assembly, he laid out everything in the dining room where there was lots of space. Note: follow instruction to lay the wood pieces on the cardboard packaging to prevent scratching. The photo almost makes it appear that this is sitting on a silver metal base and legs but that is silver painted wood. It's been quite sturdy and survived 3 moves now but if you've going to frequently move it about, I suggest adding those little glider feet you can buy at any hardware store. Otherwise the feet drag and that feels less sturdy.", 
    "Okay, I'm not gonna lie; the idea of putting furniture together did not thrill me. I purchased two. I put the first one together & it took quite a long time because I had never done anything like this before. It came out PERFECTLY! What a beautiful piece of furniture! The quality is very good, the knobs for the drawers and metal. The second one took me less than 1/2 the time to put together. I would have liked the directions to be a little clearer on the drawer sliders because on the first one I had installed the sliders backwards on two of the drawers. The instructions didn't speak to a \"front\" or \"back\" of the slider. That said, I am absolutely delighted with these Cabinets. Just take your time, enjoy the process of putting it together and you will have a great, sturdy cabinet at a very affordable price. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "The instructions are not clear and it takes a while to put together. The plus side it looks REALLY GREAT when put together. Also, Smaller than looks in photo", 
    "This is a wow! Very sturdy construction. Drawers are deep and glide smoothly. Had my handyman put it together in no time. I will seriously consider Furniture of America products in the future.", 
    "Very stylish and wonderful deal! It did take a while to put together, but that was my engineering hubby's fault because he refuses to read directions! :-)", 
    "Both glass doors on top had to be repaired after a couple of months, its used for my grandsons spare clothes in my room --- not very often. Would not buy again.", 
    "great, inexpensive storage cabinet....looks more expensive than it is.....", 
    "This has been a fantastic space saver for our family . Mohave used it for many many things., good quality", 
    "Compared to other furniture at this price point, the assembly was relatively easy and assembled unit is solid - no loose components.", 
    "Love the detailing of this storage cabinet. Plenty of room for storage", 
    "nice quality and easy to assemble", 
    "I love this dresser. Its tall enough to were I can store my personal items on top, I'm 6ft. I place it by the door so I can grab my shades, rings, watches, etc as I walk out the door. The perfect pitstop. The wood is deep capaccino and the light colored panels on top give it a nice polished, cool feel. I likey!", 
    "just not as attractive as appeared", 
    "Very nice in a corner. Easy to assemble and looks great.", 
    "This cabinet is good looking. Took awhile to assemble. I like the glass panels in the top drawers.", 
    "Perfect for Bedside Dresser!", 
    "I was sent the incorrect color. Quality was poor. Drawer space did not accommodate needs. Significantly overpriced!", 
    "Couple Years later it's still nice. A the only problem I had was the little things that hold glass broke. I just hot glued it into place.", 
    "interesting piece of furniture that can work for ;ots of things. I thought I would use it as a file cainet but it is too pretty. It is an accent piece in my formal living room...very pretty", 
    "It was not easy to put together. Sits in hallway not even used a decretive piece and all the glass fell out.", 
    "Good quality, fits nicely in small spaces, spacious inside.", 
    "I purchased two five-drawer storage cabinets for my husband's office. When the cabinets arrived, they were fairly easy to assemble and it took about 1-1/2 hours to finish the first one. The second one took close to an hour to assemble. The storage cabinets are sturdy and have adequate space for his files.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Looks like a piece of high end furniture. was a little disappointed that the legs are wood painted silver instead of being metal.", 
    "First off let me say I like the piece and it works well in space. It may have been my error but I thought item was going to be the color pictured in the photograph, it wasn't. It's more of a walnut color and I was looking for epresso. But, outside of that I really I like it. It's not as big as I thought but I should have paid more attention to the measurements. But its well made and it appears to be sturdy, I have a small office formerly a bedroom so it goes well and doesn't dominate the area. I actually thought of purchasing the smaller piece that goes with for a printer stand but the colors really don't fit well with my area. I think the clear planes add character. It would work well as a dresser for maybe smaller items maybe for kids or underwear.", 
    "I really like this piece. I bought it as an unmentionables drawer and it's great! It has a nice finished not cheap look. It looks like it could have cost about $$$. Not the easiest to put together. A lot of pieces. I took all of the pieces out and set them up by number on small pieces of paper to keep them organized because different sections would require the same pieces as another section. I really found this little method to work. I unfortunately put a couple of things on backwards and had to take them apart. A drill with a reverse is mandatory! Overall, good piece though. All parts came in package. In fact, they gave you a few extras. Hopefully they didn't belong to someone elses package. :-)", 
    "I love it, it makes my bathroom look wonderful and everyone comments on how much they like it!!!", 
    "I use the cabinet for my lingerie like another reviewer had mentioned. I thought that was an excellent suggestion. I keep it inside my closet. But those that I have shown it too have complimented it. It holds alot of my lingerie and the drawers are very deep. It didnt take too long to put together, maybe only a few hours and I tend to move slow when putting further together. I don't know how you intend on using it, but if you are looking to store lingerie you can't go wrong.", 
    "Product was just as it looked. Went together easier. Drawers slide easily. Nice accent for where it is being used.", 
    "Good looking cabinet that matches the desk I purchased. I should have read more carefully - hanging files do not fit in the lower drawers. It is stylish and I will keep it but now I have to go find a file cabinet that will hold my hanging files. My fault totally but....", 
    "This is a very stylish and sturdy cabinent. It looks great with one of the desks found in Overstock. Exactly what I expected by description.", 
    "My favorite purchase so far!!! i had bought it originally as a filling cabinet but believe me... far from it..... the drawers are to small for that but..........for lingerie it's amazing!!!!!! you can put all your delicate feminine products, make up, perfume and anything else women use there. Quality it's very reasonable except for silver colored legs but once it was set up in my bedroom you don't notice them. I highly recommend this for women who need that extra space for their intimates.", 
    "Came quickly...was fairly easy to assemble...great looks in my office!", 
    "Bought this for home office storage since my desk has only three small top drawers. This worked out perfect. Has enough space for what I need and goes nicely with our expresso furniture. It take a while for my husband and grandson to assemble and poor hubby shutters when he sees these do it yourself projects arrive.", 
    "Love the additional space that this cabinet provides.", 
    "Great little storage cabinet for a narrow space. For the money, I was not expecting the ultimate in quality, but for our purposes, it absolutely meets our needs and looks good to boot.", 
    "I bought this for home office storage, to help control clutter on the desktop and work surfaces, and I think it will serve that purpose well. I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because it's hard to get excited about purely functional office furniture, and it didn't blow me away, so it won't be on my top 10 list of Best Online Funiture Purchases Ever, but I'm very satisfied with it and I would recommend it to others. It provides a good amount of vertical storage without taking up much floor space which is what we wanted. Not sure the top will be wide enough for it to serve as a printer stand like we'd hoped, but the measurements provided were accurate, so it's no one's my fault but my own for not double-checking the printer base measurements before I bought it. My husband is becoming something of a pro at assembling furniture, but he did struggle a little with the instructions, and it took him just under 2 hours from start to finish. We looked at storage units in a large scandinavian retail furniture/home store before we bought this, and found this to be less expensive, but of equal quality, and this was delivered right to our door, thankfully saving us another hellish trip to that store. The drawers slide nicely, the frosted glass drawer-fronts are a nice touch, the hardware seems solid, and while inexpensive, it doesn't look like a \"cheap\" piece of furniture. My only complaint, if it can be called that, is that from the picture I had assumed the base/legs of this cabinet were aluminum, or some similar metal. They're not, they're wood or engineered wood painted a silver metallic color. There's no metal in the description of the materials, but the picture made it appear so, and I was hoping it was so we could match it with a dark wood veneer/aluminum leg desk in the office where this piece is going to find it's home. Unless you're right up close to it, it has the effect of looking like metal, so it works with the desk, and we're pleased.", 
    "Aesthetically, this is a decent piece, but the top drawer sticks and until I figure out how to adjust it, can't be used.", 
    "I put this together by myself and I've used it for several months for my home office. It holds tape, stams, banking materials, etc. very nicely. I", 
    "nicely packed item, but like previous review, too many small stryofoam parts that leaves stuff all over floor. Overall it was a pretty easy cabinet to put together if you have 2 person. took myself around 4 hours to put together and I'm pretty good at putting stuff together. I did it with a screw driver and afterwards my hands was pretty roughed up and tired. i suggest anyone putting this together to get a power drill. The cabinet look very nice and matched very well with my bedroom furniture. does just what i needed. the cabinet look like it was made with nice material, not cheap and flimsy. I would recommend it.", 
    "we love it, its a perfect size for our needs and looks really nice. Im happy I chose this storage cabinet. Only downside is if your not handy its a pain to put together, my husbands very handy so their was no problom. But if i didnt have him to do it, i would have had to hire someone to many pieces and steps to follow. Im handy myself but would not have had the patience. But since I didnt have to worry about that, im thinking of buying another one for another room in my house.", 
    "Lacking any mehcanical skills myself, but being highly desirous of having this lingerie chest, I purchased it and my husband (who was sick with a cold at the time) put it together in just about two hours, including unpacking it and laying it all out. When he was finished one of the top drawers was a little crooked, but, and don't ask me how, he fixed it. NOTE: the backing to the chest is in the VERY bottom of one of the two boxes--we thought ours was sent without it, but when my husband was breaking down the boxes for recycling, voila' he found it. So look closely for that piece. I love it. Moved all my lingerie into another bedroom and everything has its plae and I now have more space for sweaters, pjs, etc. Looks very good. I wouldn't sit on it or put heavy objects on the top, but I do have a porcelain decoration that weighs 3 or 4 pounds on it. Modern, chic, love the frosted glass. After cleaning the glass, it seems that the \"frost\" goes away, but once dry it comes back. Very happy with it......would have paid twice as much for it after now seeing it in my home. I've already recommended it to friends. DEEP drawers--love that--first furniture purchase from O/stock but won't be the last. Had good reviews......DITTO! Thanks O/S for helping me with my organizational issues. Don't think you can go wrong here.......however, I would not have been able to put it together myself.....NOT mechanically inclined......if you are the same, ask a friend to help you. Fast and safe shipping. Clear directions, according to my husband.", 
    "I was in desperate need of more storage in my bedroom, but needed something tall and not too wide. The dimensions and look of this was perfect. It wasn't too difficult to put together but there were 2 screws missing for the drawer pulls. I need to go to the hardware store to get them so I can put them on. Other than that it was fine and looks good in my bedroom and closely matches an Ikea dresser I already have.", 
    "This cabinet has been great thus far. Assembly was a little challenging, as the directions were a bit of a road map as opposed to step by step instructions. For most people this would likely not be an issue whatsoever.", 
    "I liked the color of the cabinet. My problem I had with the cabinet was the drawer assembly. The screws holding the rails are short and it's difficult to get short screws to hold in manufactured wood. The per-drilled holes on the top drawers will probably need to tweaked a little. The top of the second drawer hits the bottom of the first drawer. After the slight adjustment of drilling a new hole it fits perfect. This problem is only known once you try to install the second drawer. I still like the quality for the price.", 
    "Like with many other \"flat-pack\" items I've purchased from Overstock, this is a decent piece of furniture. I was looking for a storage solution that wouldn't take up much floor space, but still looked nice in my home office. This item was the perfect solution. I'm a 55 year old woman, pretty handy, and I put this together in less than 2 hours. Directions are excellent, if you've built flat-pack furniture before. Seems to be holding up very well.", 
    "Instructions for assembly were great. All pieces labeled well and hardware in individual packages in order of use. Some of the alignment of the holes were a little off but other than that it was not difficult to assemble. I had never built anything and it only took me a little over an hour. Very attractive piece. It isn't the greatest quality, but it wasn't expensive either.", 
    "Very pleased to find this storage cabinet on Ovestock.com. It very closely matched some other pieces that we had purchased at ****. Extremely satisfied.", 
    "Got this for my garage \"foyer\" to have a place to store gloves, scarves and assorted items, coming in and out of the most-traveled door of the house. Ended up putting it in the powder bath next to foyer, but stil store those items. Lots closer than coat closet. Looks good and does hold a lot of items for a smaller cabinet. Metal at bottom seems to be metallic paint-covered wood.", 
    "We bought this as file cabinet for our office but it is so elegant we ended up using in our bedroom. It is really elegant and does not take up to much room. we love it, and the price like always overstooooock rules... :)", 
    "Delivery was very fast and both boxes arrived undamaged. It went together fairly well, a couple of the drawer bottoms didn't line up and had to be slightly forced. One pre-drilled hole was missing, had to drill that myself. Total assembly time of about 4 hours for one person. Worth noting, I purchased this piece for storage in the company restroom and had assumed that the silver legs were some sort of metal that could stand up to wet mops. To my surprise, the legs are spray painted particle board... sturdy enough, but I expect that the paint won't hold up to much abuse. The description did not describe the legs as metal, I just assumed, so it is accurate. Over all, it's a good looking piece that was well worth the fairly low price, but I wouldn't expect it to withstand much daily use.", 
    "I lowered my expectations when I ordered this product, but the size and color of the wood as described was what I was looking for. But, lo and behold, after my husband assembled everything, it looked fantastic. I could very easily use this as a starter to complete a room full of this type of furniture. I really loved the smooth glide of the drawers. All in all, this cabinet suited well for my intended purpose.", 
    "So its not steel or even chrome legs its silver painted wood. The directions were all mixed up and it took me about 3 hours to put together but overall the product works and looks close to the picture.", 
    "Very nice storage cabinet. Didn't wait very long for it to arrive, it actually arrived earlier than expected. Setting up was easy but took a little more than because I'm a very busy person but I did it. Great for clothes stirage, and a very sturdy cabinet. I also like it because I'm able to put it nowhere in the room and I still have a lot of room space. Very throughout design, and a good quality wood was used to have such sturdy ability.", 
    "This cabinet is super. Well built and easy to put together. I'm really impressed with how well it is built.", 
    "I was in need of something for my office but didnt want the same old thing. I found this item and I really liked it and seemd alittle different. The asembly wasnt to bad and The price was jsut right!!!!!!Glad I got it and I receive alot of compliments on it.", 
    "I like it . I was a little nervous at first because im not one for putting things together but I did it and it looks great. The service was wonderful. I received my item right away and even asked if there was a possibility that they could ship it out the same day i ordered it and they said no problem. This piece is perfect for my papers in the home office and even just a storage cabinet. Im happy with the purchase.", 
    "The listed materials: Materials: Wood What I got? Cheap particle board (which, I guess, is TECHNICALLY wood). I've ordered other furniture from Overstock before and loved it, but these? These were TERRIBLE. The plastic clips to hold the glass in place were too short and broke when screwing them into place. The drawer bottoms were thin cardboard. The handles? Plastic.The feet are spray-painted, cheap wood, not metal. I'm afraid to move them from where I put them, let alone fill them with anything heavier than a paper clip. And these were meant to store things for my business! The only reason it got two stars was because the color matches, and they DO look attractive once in place. But I will not order these ever again.", 
    "Great looking dresse for my office! Although it did take some time to assemble, once this dresser was put together it looked wonderful and pulled the whole room together. The price fits the material used but still good and worth it. This dresser will last like any furniture as along as u take care of it. . The drawers glide very smoothly and it has quite a bit of room. And honestly for the price, it is quite a steal!", 
    "I can't believe how nice it is once I received it by UPS in just 3 days! Fast set up and the quality is very nice and the features all around is incredible. I'm so glad that I bought it, so affordable as well and the design is incredible! I love it.", 
    "First piece of furniture I bought online and I have to say I was a litle nervous but after putting it togther and seeing the finished product Im very happy with it and I hvae to say it looks great in my room. Alittle time consuming but worth it. Would recommend for anyone who needs a nice looking but not super expensive cabinet", 
    "Bought 2 and both arrived at the same time in just 2 1/2 days and it took about an hour or so for both cabinet to install but easy, no problems at all. The price is great that's why I bought it, but the quality is even better. Pretty sturdy cabinet with more than enough room inside each drawer than expected. Reall good stuff.", 
    "Easy to assemble cabinet with fast delivery and quality is more than what I paid for the furniture. For such a small price to pay, you get a good quality cabinet with so many room for all your stuff so no complaints here.", 
    "I love how it fits anywhere! I thought when I purchased it online that the drawer will be to small and can't fit anything but my jewelrys but I was wrong. I was able to fit a lot of my clothes inside and my jewelrys at the very top. I even like the glass face on the upper to drawers, it makes it look even better. The cabinet is very nice looking, and very sturdy. Easy to assemble and the shipping was pretty fast, so I'm very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I seriously doubt this item would burn if the house caught on fire. Having said that, it will most likely last a long time and the color and design are nice-except the drawers don't match up well/flat with the front. What a royale pain to put together! I also purchased the 4 drawer dresser at the same time-I think I might spend the extra and purchase items like this in a store already put together. There was no directions, just drawings which were totally incorrect and the red stamped numbers on the wood pieces was either smeared beyond recognition or not there at all. Between ill fitting drawers, screw holes that don't line up correctly and the runners which were put into place by the company and the screws holding them in place were placed crooked so the tops were poking out into the track at an angle-I seriously doubt I will purchase anything again like this \"assemble at your own risk\" furniture. it isn't just this one, any of these items are like that. its a crap shoot whether you get a perfect one or one off kilter like I did. Its the chance you take.", 
    "Design and quality is like *** assemble-it-yourself products. Color was only slightly brighter than color on my laptop screen, but works for the room I've put it in. Unlike ***, all the assembly hardware pieces are hidden so it's not as obvious. Knobs are nice and small. I bought a pair to use as nightstands next to a very tall modern bed. Looks good and give extra storage in that room.", 
    "Was not to like about my storage cabinet, arrived fast, fast assembly, nice design with two nice glass face on the upper drawers, and each storage has a lot of room for so many of my things. The cabint is very sturdy and I can put it anywhere in my bedroom and it doesn't take up a lot of room at all. I love this so called storage cabinet, it's great!", 
    "This is a nice-looking piece of furniture for the money. Assembly wasn't terribly difficult.", 
    "the package arrived, I took out all the pieces however there were no directions!! I did call Overstock's customer service and Robin was able to email me the directions. All pictures, no words! After I put it together (about 2 hours later), it's a beautiful chest and holds alot! It fits perfectly in the little corner of my bedroom!", 
    "Great price cabinet for all the room that is provides, easy instructions to follow when assembling the cabinet so it didn't take very long to assemble. Easy slide drawers, and very sturdy. The service was great also with 2-3 days delivery, didn't wait very long. I'm highly recommend it.", 
    "Just the cabinet I was looking for. It has great style and the quality is great, very sturdy. The price is very exceptional and it was quite easy to assemble. I also like the fact that it was delivered to me in just 2 days and I didn't pay for expedited shipping. I love my cabinet, I can fit a lot of stuff in the drawer and it looks nice in my room.", 
    "A perfect storage cabinet that was priced at a had-to-buy level. I needed a cabinet that would fit in with my position as a live-in caregiver, living in my elderly charge's home. My room is a very small extra bedroom. I am very glad with my overstock purchases.", 
    "I like the style and the how each drawer provides room for all my things and easy smooth slider when opening each drawer. I love it, it's very different from than the rest and the quality is great. I paid less for the great quality that I received so I'm very pleased wtih my cabinet. Highly Highly recommend it.", 
    "The cabient has a nice style and the drawer is just right for what I need. The price is great, easy set up ,and the cabinet is sturdy which means the quality is great.", 
    "This item should be called a \"Upright 5 drawer night stand\". It is gorgeous in my bedroom. You should make a \"2 drawer night stand\" to match! Well worth the price!", 
    "I like the design and style of the cabinet. It fits in a lot of places in the my bedroom and it has a lot of room for so much of my stuff. It was also easy to set up and the 2 front glass on the 2 upper drawers was a nice touch to this cabinet that gave it a lot more style. I like it.", 
    "I like the style of the cabinet. it has the compact size look but deep drawers for a good amount of room that I was looking for and needed. It was easy to set up and the the legs, the drawer, and everything else is very sturdy. I got the dark coffee color and it fabulous!", 
    "This product is beautiful! The only downside was the time to assemble (not hard, just time consuming). A little patience and you'll have yourself a nice quality piece of furniture for a low cost.", 
    "This is a NICE cabinet however: like other reviewers the price is too high for MDF the bottom silver part that looks like metal is not metal but silver painted wood instructions consisted of about 8 full size pages with NO written instructions - give yourself plenty of time to put this together! MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT: after opening the box, the pieces all smell like \"bottom of the cargo hold on a wet ship\" mold smell...UGH . I wiped down all the pieces and of course after you get them out of the box the smell starts to dissipate however, after completing assembly, I can still smell that smell every time I open a drawer so my next action is to wipe out the drawers with antibacterial something and set them out in the sun for a day. GOOD things: The cabinet is nice looking and I like the roominess of the drawers. Would I buy this again? NO, unless they knock down the price by at least HALF!", 
    "i bought two for the room and it's exactly what I needed. Good quality of course, and it has all the room I need for some of my clothes and husband's clothes. Great addition to our bedroom and the dark brown color is what we bought and it matches with the rest of our furniture.", 
    "The cabinet was such a good price especially comparing to all other cabient I've seen. This one beats the price. My experience in purchasing with overstock is great! fast service delivery and they provide intructions to build the cabinet easy to follow. Not only that the quality if great and the cabinet is sturdy and solid.", 
    "sturdy cabinet will all the room that I neede for all my stuff. It was delivered to me really fast and the assebly was easy. Highly recommend it.", 
    "Just the cabinet I was looking for. It's absolutely nice and it has all the room that I need. Good quality, fast delivery, and very sturdy.", 
    "It's a great cabinet, it provides all the room that I need in each drawer and it slides perfectly. I'm glad that I got this cabinet because it was a great price and it was delivered to me on the third day after purchase.", 
    "Because of the reviews, I bought this cabinet and plus I needed something fast. I got it and I'm glad. Very sturdy and easy set up. I got the dark brown color and the color finish is very modern and good quality.", 
    "It has all the room I need for some of my clothes and so it's very sturdy and it fits at the space it needed to be.", 
    "I can't believe it only took me a short amount of time to assemble this cabinet, the instructions was so easy to follow and the pictures provided was so helpful! Cabinet perfect for all the room I need and the quality is great.", 
    "It has all the room I needed for a fair amount of clothes and very sturdy drawers made out of real solid wood, and it was nice that it didnt take me very long to set up. Love this cabinet, it looks cute.", 
    "It was pretty easy to put together, it is sturdy and has the support it needs for the base of the drawers, unlike other drawers (flimsy). Great quality and nice color (dark oak).", 
    "It has all the room for all my clothes that needed to be stored some where and this was perfect It provides deep sturdy drawers that I was looking for. I'm so glad I bought it, now my closet looks great.", 
    "the cabient is just the right size for what I needed. plus easy to assemble, very solid and it looks great in my room.", 
    "LOVE the look! The draws are on tracks, big bonus for the price. I'm giving it only 4 stars because of the legs.... they appear to be an after thought, cheap and fragile. They are actually painted partical board base with the the same painted partical board type legs that were GLUED onto the base, not metal as they appear, in the picture. The pre-drilled holes for the base/legs mount didn't line up well, we would have to ream out the holes to force the fit. Not a good idea for a weight bearing component. Since I love the peice itself, well designed and easy to put together. I left off the legs and like it MUCH better without them. I plan on buying another one, and will leave off the legs. If they legs were well aligned metal instead partical board, this peice would earn 6 STARS! Fantastic value regardless.", 
    "I thoughr for the cheap price I got it for that I would receive a terrible color job, but I was very surprised! I bought the dark brown color and it looks very nice. I got it for my daughter's room and it makes the room very elegant and it goes well with all her other stuff The cabinet was easy to put together and the quality of the wood is very solid and the legs are very sturdy.", 
    "I don'y understand about some of the negative reviews, I guess some hate to spend money and they will be negative about everything. But I'm happy with this cabinet, if you need drawers for your extra stuff then this is perfect. As a sock drawer, t-shirts, sweaters, and shorts is what I use it for and it fits perfect and it gives you enough space that you need it for. But if your cheap and expect this cabinet for all your clothes, then you're just cheap and expect too much. I can't believe some of the reviews. This cabinet is very sturdy, easy to assembly (see the picture instructions), and the cabinet looks great. Don't read the negative reviews, it sounds like customers that has had their cabinet for a very long time and they broke it themselves and want a free one. I highly recommend this cabinet to everyone.", 
    "The cabient is great!!! somuch room and very sturdy and it does only take 20 minutes tops to put it together and it looks nice anywhere in the house and it saves room and it has lots of room inside. love it!", 
    "awesome cabinet! easy and fast delivery process and 20 minutes assembly and easy functional drawer that provides all the room that you need. I highly recommend this item, it's affordable and you receive excellent quality.", 
    "The quality and the color finish in dark espresso is perfect! Each drawer can fit all the things that I need and very sturdy and easy to open drawers, not once it ever got stuck.", 
    "So glad I bought the cabinet, it was very cheap cabinet which I can afford but it looks very expensive which comes with good quality wood. Putting it together was easy and overstock got it over to me in no time with also less than five dollars delivery.", 
    "I got mine cabinet in 3 days and I had helped with the assembly and it took us 20 minutes. The cabinet does have incredible room inside each drawer, is quite deep. plus it doesn't rock when you open the drawer not like the once i\"ve experienced before so I love it", 
    "I'm very happy with Overstock's delivery because it arrive on my door step in 5 days and I didn't have any trouble with setting it up and I got a good deal withmy cabinet because it provides all the room that I need in each drawer and it is very sturdy and the dark oak color i love very much because it was colored very well and the cabinet you can tell very well in person that it was done with detaled workmanship.", 
    "the quality is really nice and is a thing of beauty. Overstock provided fast delivery and it was very fair price. I highly recommend this cabinet it provide a lot of rooms.", 
    "I wasn't expecting much for what I paid, but this item is definitely on the low end when it comes to quality. I would rate it on par or somewhat worse than the assemble yourself furniture sold at big box retailers. The pieces are made entirely of particleboard with a vinyl laminate, so it is does not even have a wood grain feel veneer. The box arrived HEAVILY wrapped in bubble wrap so there was no damage to the pieces inside. Assembly was easy, although time consuming; I think I must have spent about three hours total. As one of the other reviewers noted, I too had to move two sets of drawer guides because the drawers laid slightly on top of each other. The piece does look very nice - from a distance. I'm not sure how long I can expect it to last, but I will remain hopeful.", 
    "I love how I got a nice, and good quality chest drawer and paid less for it and the delivery was under 5 bucks. What more can I ask for?!! I love it!", 
    "I got 2 a couple of months ago and they're great. Everyone was right about this cabinet, it provides a lot of room and quite sturdy. You really get more for your moeny.", 
    "I love how it was very easy to assemble and how the delivery service was and it was practically free for shipping. I'm very happy that I bought this cabinet, very reliable.", 
    "This is a great piece of furniture! Perfect size for a jewelry chest, lingerie, etc. Drawers are easy to open..........very rich looking finish!!!!!!!!!", 
    "I loke the cabinet, though it look small, inside provide lots of room for all your needs. I know I love it because it provides all the things I need, and it's very sturdy. The price is great also.", 
    "It was very easy to set up and the quality is great! I'm happy with mine", 
    "lovin my cabinet! easy to set up and very sturdy cabinet, i like i like.", 
    "This was an amazingly easy piece to put together. The drawer slides were pre-installed, and that was a real help. The item is largely particle board, but it is a reat value for the price.", 
    "It looks great and fits beautifully into my professional voice studio where I coach celebrity clients. The drawers open well, the color is exactly as it looks in the picture, and the price is great. The drawers hold quite a bit!", 
    "The chest looks a lot more expensice once it's assembled. The cabient is a great piece, it's great for the kids room. With the safety lock of the slider, it's perfect for the kids because it prevents it from coming all the way out and falling on them. I'm glad that I bought it for the kids. A good quality SAFE cabinet for my kids.", 
    "I decided to buy this cabinet because of the great reveiws and it is exactly what I expected. Teh quality is great and the dark color match perfectly with my bedroom furnitures. It has held up the end of its bargain. I use it for jeans mainly because I have lots and it holds them very nicely and they are very heavy jeans the drawer holds them very well wtihout the drawers falling through like other drawers that I've had before.", 
    "All the way good, I think so! Good because overstock delivery was great, cuz it was fast! plus i received a cabinet that I can depend on and good quality which assures me that it will always be with me standing storng. Good all the way I'm telling ya! Who ever puts this cabinet down is probably someone who didn't know how to follow directions and mest up the one they have and trying to find someone to blame...No good! I've been a customer for Overstock for some time now and communicating your problems is the key and being roudy and rude is not the way to go. This cabinet is great!", 
    "Bought a couple for the kids room and I love it...The quality and the sliding technique is quite smooth, and each drawer has such deep drawers were my kids can stuff as much as clothes as they want. I know is not like the other cabinets where it seems like it will tip over but not this one, it's very sturdy. Bravo overstocK! u guys come with fast delivery and good quality stuff!", 
    "My cabinet have been witg me for months almost half a year and they are perfect as ever. The quality remains uplifting and I tend to put a lot of things inside and there's so much room. I love overstock, I've purchase a lot for the past years and I'm very satisfied each time.", 
    "bought it for cheap and I received good quality. Plus assembly and delivery was easyily done and fast.", 
    "Bought it for my home office and it's extremely nice and wonderful. The sliding drawer, so smooth and each drawer which I often use is filled with files and office supplies and everything fits. I know it supposed to be something for home use, but close I use it for my home office and it's perfect. I bought a pair and it only took me 45 mintues for both with of course my daughters help. This is a great buy for my money and I'm a big on quality that's why I bought this cabinet.", 
    "great cabinet, top quality, lots of drawer space and easy to put together. High recommend this to anyone, buy it, it's worth the money.", 
    "Received my cabinet 5 months ago and this cabinet is still in perfect condition. Just imagine all the things that I've stuffed inside each drawers and still Ihave no problem with it. The quality is really great and I know it will stay with me for a long time.", 
    "This is a nice piece of furniture. Looks stylish and doesn't take too much space. Was shipped really fast.", 
    "This cabinet is quite a good buy. It has proven to be very durable and to this day it looks as good as new. Owning for a good 5 months now. The drawers are very handy for storing various things like books and magazines. My favorite aspect is the tempered glass front. Overall, the design is visually appealing, stable for usage, and sufficiently customizable for varying needs. I would recommend it.", 
    "Bought it months ago and still look very new! There's a reason why it's still selling because is that great! People like myself love quality, and that's what I got when I bought my cabinet from overtock, top quality and very fair price.", 
    "Saves space and the room inside each drawer is very roomy and a lot of space for shirts, sweater, and etc. A lot of room it's amazing. Oh and I've never assembled anything my whole life and this was the first and not bad, the manual directions was easy to follow and took me only 30 minutes. Beside the fact that it has so much room, it's very sturdy and it looks nice.", 
    "the storage space for this cabinet is amazing. Eveything fits inside and the quality of this cabinet is a the top like the other cabinets out there with good quality and worth the money. It also looks great no matter where you put it in the house, you can use it for your room which I did at first but now is in the bathroom for all other stuff so I may need to buy another. I recommend this cabinet to all who needs a good price for a cabinet and good quality cabinet that can handle all the stress you throw at it. I bought it and I'm a satisfied customer. Try it!", 
    "I have a set in my home right now and I love it. Good quality and the cabinet is heavy so it's very sturdy.", 
    "I'm serious about my new cabinets, well a few months old but it seems like it still new. But I am serious about my cabinets it can handle a lot of the stuff I like to put inside the cabinet drawers. Let see, I put a few of my photo albums, stationary, and all sort of art supply that I have. I bought 4 for my art gallery and all out art supplies is stored inside so this item can take all sort of useful things.", 
    "This was a great buy, the price is reasonable compared to other cabinets out there with their outrageous prices! This is a great because it is very useful for so many things. The thing i like about this cabinet is that you can put anywhere and you tend to still have room but each drawer provide a lot of room for example my makeup, brushes, lotions, shampoos, all the accessories you can think of that you may use in the bathroom. I bought mine way back and the quality and conditions is still better than ever.", 
    "This cabinet is great! I can't get over how the cabinet can be so deceiving. I thought I was going to get a small cabinet for just my jewelry but instead after I assembled and saw how deep the drawers are, I decided to use it for my clothes upstairs in my bedroom. The see through glass gives it that unique look compared to other cabinets. Highly recommend this cabinet.", 
    "I purchased four of these storage units for the office and I am very pleased with them. The cabinet has plenty room. It is strong, sturdy and easy to assemble. Very stylish and modern looking. All of our clients kept asking where I got such stylish drawers and of course I recommend them to buy it on Overstock. You really can't find these cabinets else where.", 
    "nicely done with this cabinet, I love it! great sturdy cabinet. I bought 2 so I can put it on the 2 corners of my bedroom and it looks great. I use one for clothes and the other for my makeup and other junk that I may have and the drawers are very solid and thick. No regrets and well worth buying.", 
    "This cabinet is wonderful and the size in width can fit anywhere. It took only 30 minutes to install and I'm very happy with this item ever since. The drawers can be filled all sort of things and I like that the drawer does not get stuck when you have opened it several times like the other ones I have. I have such good experience with this cabinet and I will buy one nextweek after the holidays to put in my bathroom. great stuff overstock, I highly recommend u!", 
    "We bought the second cabinet, because we liked the first one so much. It looks more expensive as it is and adds a nice tough to a room", 
    "this cabnet is very nice and it was very easy to assemble with comprised pictures which made it easier. The delivery was amazing since I didn'y pay much and it arrived before 7 days which was amazing. I like how the sliding mechanism slides smoothly and it doesn't get stuck. The drawer can be filled with variety of things and is sturdy enough which can handle the stress. If you look at the pictures, it looks really nice, and is the same in person.", 
    "The product arrived extremely well packed. It is a very functional piece. It is tall and narrow and fits very nicely where needed. It was well represented and looks just like the picture. It is not a decorative piece, very functional. It took us 3 hours to put together - my husband is very handy - putting the bottom on the drawers proved somewhat difficult because they did not line up, but my husband was successful in figuring out how to make it work. Thanks again Overstock.com", 
    "this is the 2nd one that I bought because the other one that I have already I'm really happy with. the price is great and so is the quality. The drawers are very well made and the sliding mechanics. And I know it will arrive fast just like how I received the one I have now.", 
    "This cabinet is great!! delivery service is great and so is the quality, style, and the materials to make this product. And the assembly was easy and great also.", 
    "I was excited when I purchased this item but then at the same timeworried because I've never ordered a furniture before online and I was worried that it might arrived damged, but I was very delighted when it arrived because it was in perfect conditions with so many layers of packaging. The delivery was also fast and the assembly was even easier because of the well instructed directions. After all this, the cabinet is beautiful and very sturdy. A thing of beauty.", 
    "My expectations were exceeded by this product, especially I paid for like it was on sale. top quality for the material used. It is solid wood and sturdy. It's very nice looking cabinet. I found the directions to be very easy to follow, they are comprised of pictures and take you step by step. I was glad that there was no printed text directions because sometimes I find them confusing.", 
    "I love this interesting item! it fits where ever you please and it saves from taking too much space in the room. When it came the following Thurs after it was order on a Mon., it took me good 35 mins to put everything together. I'm happy with mynew purchased drawer, I can put numerous things and it's stable and sturdy so I don't have any problems.", 
    "I was very surprised by the weight and quality of this dresser. It was easy to put together and looks great, plus delivery, talk about fast!", 
    "It actually got to home sooner than I thought ,and the asembly was not hard at all. This cabinet does everything I need for it to do, drawers slides smoothly, fits a lot of my tshirts and under garmet. I recommend this product for anyone who needs a drawer but don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the best.", 
    "It's amazing how a cabinet like this handles the objects i tend to store in the drawers. The drawer cabinet has deep space which holds several heavy heavy objects. I'm so glad that I bought it here, it was shipped over to me less than 5 days and the instructions had pictures where it was easy to follow. The other great thing about this cabinet of mine is that it's a space saver, it holds about anything you can think of and still a space saver. It doesn't take up a lot of room in my bedroom which is nice especially my room isn't too big.", 
    "I love this cabinet! I use in the bedroom and it's great. I get to store a whole lot of stuff and with the sturdy quality, it can hold all my stuff. Easy to order, easy to assemble, and easy on the money! I love everything it!", 
    "bought two of my diva cabinet and oh my gosh I love it! It came so soon that I hesitated in assembling them, but when I finally had the courage to do so I was so proud of my work! I can't believe how cheap I bought it and the wood pieces are sooo solid and the two top glasses makes my cabinet such divas! I am very pleased, and I'm hard to please!", 
    "Very sturdy and well made. The style is very modern, which it's very nice. I like it. No problems with putting the parts together, and no problem with the order or delivery, it came well packaged.", 
    "Great construction and very heavy, it was not hard to put it together, and it didn't take long. the packaging that this furniture came in was awsome, bubbled up and everything. I didn't wait that long for it to come, so glad.", 
    "All I can say is that this drawer storage cabinet is fantastic. It came early than expected, easy to buid, sturdy, and is a nice new look for this era, cool...", 
    "Arrived before expected which was great plus for me. Sturdy and useful for small items that you do want to store in your linen closet. Sturdy and useful for variety of things that I usually store in my bathroom drawer. My husband put it together and he said if oyu follow the directions carefully, it will be a breese. This is a such beautiful cabinet and well worth the money than paid for it.", 
    "What a bargain. It looks lovely in my bedroom. Arrived quick and in good condition. I didn't have any issues with any broken pieces. Boxed up like a mummy, no chance of anything damaged. Assembly was a shin! well what can i say, love it, love it, love it.", 
    "Very underwhelmed with this product. Materials are flimsy and many pieces had chip marks when i opened the package. The assembly was very difficult. I ended up going through the hassle of returning this item because the end product was so terrible. avoid avoid avoid!", 
    "I'm very impressed by this product. It was delivered within 3 days of contact and is beautiful and well-made. definitely worth the price. All the parts fit (that in itself is amazing), it looks great, it's solid, drawers slide easily. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "The internal packaging of this material is terrible. The glass doors arrived shattered and this was the 2nd of another similar storage unit from the same manufacturer that arrived like this. So, it clearly was not a one off. The external packaging was solid. Internally, the wood pieces were all piled together without any paddiing between them. So were the faux glass pieces. Damage is inevitable in my opinion. Returned for a refund. The only saving grace was overstock.com hassle free and responsive customer support.", 
    "I bought two of these cabinet because of the special offer I had with Overstock. It arrived in less than 5 days without any marks to the packaging. The instructions were doable, improvement can definitely be emphasize on and assembly was not difficult. I'd recommend it to anyone that wants a nice looking cabinet that is budget friendly.", 
    "When I opened the box it seemed a little daunting because the chest had so many pieces. Once I started putting it together it went very quickly and the end result was good for the price. I puchased this piece for the conference room at my office and it fits well. However the quality is not something I would want in my home.", 
    "This is our second dresser and once again the product was delivered in excellent packaging and no damages. Although, the first one we bought was almost 9 months ago - this new order, the finish match perfectly with the old one. This second one took a little less than an hour to put together (learned from the first). I'm thrilled to finally find a good quality dresser that is attractive and affordable. Will highly recommend it.", 
    "This item looks alot better than it is constructed. It is made with cheap materials. For our purposes, it will be ok. But it would not take alot of wear and tear.", 
    "This chest really is a bargain value. It's solidly built, and the assembly time wasn't too terrible. I will definitely recommend this. In fact I've already been telling people I work with how nice my drawer is and that they should shop with Overstock more often if they're looking for bargain pieces that look really nice.", 
    "I bought this for my daughter's room and it's such a good size the room. I'm actually getting ready to buy another one because I have another little one on the way.... I like this dresser because it's heavy and sturdy and the price is reasonable and best of all if you're limited in space it's the best solution.", 
    "I ordered this cabinet in Coffee Bean for my home office. It was pretty simple to assemble, and I did it by myself. It looks expensive. It's a great addition to any area where you want/need modern storage solutions. The only downside I would have to say are the feet that come with this unit. They are a cheap wood, mine came split so I opted to leave them off. I actually think it looks better that way. Other than that, go for it.", 
    "I like this product alot. I would recommend it in the coffee color because I think that looks better and has a nice finish. It looks very nice especially with the glass drawer. I would also recommend that you look at the instructions very carefully. I ordered two at different times and when I ordered the first one, the drawers would not close properly at the top. After I built the second one, I realized that this was because I had not built the sides of the file cabinet appropriately. They should really supply the written instructions rather than illustrations for this cabinet because I would have not made this mistake if there had been. Luckily, I was able to rebuild the first one and now it looks as good as the second one. It would have been a five stars but it is four stars because there are no written instructions.", 
    "This storage cabinet is very classy looking. You can't tell that it is made of mdf unless you go really close to it and look at the crack of each drawer. COME ON PEOPLE!! It looks nice in my flat. I would highly recommend it. Affordable price for a designer look. What more could you ask for??? I think I will by the bigger sister chest. Beautiful!", 
    "This piece is pretty and classy and does exactly what we hoped. We are using it to store piano music, in our living room right next to our piano. It looks great and we've gotten compliments from recent visitors. Finish is pretty. Drawers are on rollers, so very easy to use. The whole piece is very sturdy. Classic and contemporary at the same time. My husband spent a lot of time putting it together and there were imperfections in the pieces on the sides where they didn't show, so he was worried that there would be dings and scratches on it. But I don't see any. It looks great!", 
    "Not as high of quality as I had hoped, but it does look nice. Two of the pins that hold in the glass were actually broken when I opened the box... clearly broken before they ever left the factory, shame! But, they do still work and I am happy overall with having 5 small drawers for organizing my mail, pens & paper, etc. I would recommend this for the price.", 
    "I purchased this storage cabinet for my home office and I absolutely love it. It is very sturdy, it was easy to put together and I can store quite a few things in the drawers. I love it!", 
    "Got my order today....had just finished putting it together. Tiring, yes...but worth it though. Looks very good in my bedroom. I had espresso furniture in my bedroom right now and the coffee bean color fits pretty nicely with my furniture. Overall, a very good shopping experience. Wouldn't mind getting another one if ever needed.", 
    "Be prepared when you receive this - it is bubble-wrapped to death! At 45 pounds, the box is not heavy, but the packaging makes it so if you have a partner-in-crime to help you pick it up (as in my case, which is what I had to do, as UPS does not leave packages on my doorstep the first time - the guy at the UPS counter helped me), request their muscle. That being said, the parts and pieces are numbered, which is great because most RTA (Ready-to-Assemble) furniture products are not; it took me 4-5 steps into the process to realize this. But, if you check the pieces on the non-espresso sides, you'll see the red, marked numbers. My gripes... Some scrapes on the wood, but for the price can I complain? The clamps, to keep the glass in place, snapped-off; 2 on one piece of the frosted glass; 1 on the other (each frosted panel has four clamps). For the one with the one broken clamp, I was OK with; the one with two, however, were broken-off on one side, leaving that glass with no pressure. So, I unscrewed the remaining two clamps and glued the frosted glass. Problem is (my fault entirely), I used a little too much Gorilla Glue, so it bled on the facing side of the drawer. I let the glue dry and peeled/picked off some of it, but you can still see the error of my ways. I'm sure I could request another drawer, but for what I need it for, not worth the time. In conclusion, if yours arrive with no damage, this will be a beautiful piece. I think, despite my build issues, it still looks great. I think the glass may have broken with how it was placed into my car and I would look at the other reviews if you're hesitant. The piece looks a lot more expensive than what you pay for it. Someone mentioned the legs being wood instead of metal; yes, that is true, but you can't tell unless you were to physically knock on the wood. When you pay $135 for furniture, you should not expect Stickley, so take some of these reviews with a grain of salt (when they complain about price).", 
    "I like the cabinet and it was easy to assemble. One problem with shipping - the back board had a cracked corner which I put at the bottom, and two clips in one of the glass fronts were broken but the glass seems to be sealed in pretty well. Overall, I am very satisfied.", 
    "No question about it, this storage cabinet is still the best product for the price. We bought two of these for two different rooms. Too bad they don't offer any other colors besides the ones pictured or else I would probably buy another one for a guest room. I recommend it for those in need of storage but wants something nice looking and inexpensive.", 
    "I have my entire home furnished with this colored furniture. It is heavy duty, attractive and a good value. I truly love this brand and would recommend it to anyone. Assembly takes time but looks great at end and you can't tell that it's a assembly required piece!", 
    "Very nice finish and looks great. Got four for our small make-up studio and all of our clients been asking about it. Took my husband and I a good half of the day to put four together, so do prepare some time out to assemble it. Well worth the time spent though because it is very sturdy and looks great.", 
    "A nice solidly built set of drawers with good dimensions and storage. Delivery was prompt. Instruction could have been a bit better but for the size, price and looks, I don't have anything to complaint. It looks fabulous in our bedroom.", 
    "Ideal size and looks good. Perfect for smaller places that wants a nice looking cabinet that doesn't take up a lot of space. The panels are solid and the drawer bottoms are good as well. Definitely reasonable storage for the price. There are a lot of cabinet such as this out there but this one is truly nice looking and the quality could last for a while.", 
    "What a mistake! This cabinet comes in many, many pieces. Assembly instructions are not clear. Quality is also poor. Way overpriced!!", 
    "Purchased as a nice storage unit for my bits and pieces. Assembly wasn't terribly bad. Overall construction feels very solid. It will definitely serve me well!", 
    "For the price its ok, the assembly is actually really easy, sure quite a few pieces are there but for a cabinet that size i think it normal. All the pieces were labeled and the diagrams are clear. I had some trouble with one drawer not sliding in correctly but it was due to the way i assembled it. onces i fixed my mistake all worked fine. It looks ok, nothing spectacular but nothing really to complain about. I needed extra storage and it serves it purpose. Delivery was super fast and packing was very good.", 
    "Looks really good, we're completely happy with them. Had a few chips here and there on the bottom of one drawer but nothing can't be fix with a little touch up markers. Aside from that little bits, this item still is a very modern, classy and solid piece and we're ordering another one for our study.", 
    "I really like the cabinet. It not only will be functional, it is also a very nice looking piece of furniture.", 
    "This drawer is smart and stylish and look very well in the corner of the bedroom. It is sturdy and roomy too. Packaging was done impressively well and we got our order promptly. We didn't have any issues with the assembly and it does take some time for the complete project and the aftermath is great. It seems very well structured and it is durable. I am very happy with my purchase and would not hestitate to recommend it to friends and other big O shoppers.", 
    "Very pleased with Overstock's prompt and very economic and timely process and delivery of this cabinet.I was disappointed because in the picture the bottom drawers gave me the impressioin that they were filing drawers, but when it was put together and in my office/den it fit perfectly and the drawer space has become invaluable.The Coffee bean colour combined with the brushed nickel accessories and vynil inserts gives it a very understated, yet contemporary, edgy look that complements my tempered glass desk system (also purchased at the \"O\" website) Its tall, narrow shape works perfectly in a small den space as mine, about 10 ft x 11 ft.My eldest son, who came over to assist me in putting it together, did short work of it in 1/2 an hour total!Another great buy at the \"O\"!!!", 
    "I'm not quite sure why some don't like this dresser, it's a great dresser to me. Spacious drawers, nice looking, compact size. I mean, I love mine but I guess everyone opinions are always different than others. Assembly was time consuming but the piece is solid as a rock!", 
    "This storage cabinet is perfect for computer materials and sits right beside my computer desk.", 
    "Although I was impressed how well packaged this product was, I found it to be quite inferior. After quickly assembling the five drawers (which I thought were very well made), it was time to assemble the cabinet. The directions were just diagrams but very thorough and all of the hardware were clearly marked. The holes were all pre-drilled, so I assumed the drawers would just slide in. Well I was WRONG! the drawers did not fit properly and I removed the drawer guides and repositioned all ten of them. After four long hours of trying to make this work I ended up with a very bad piece of furniture. I would have returned it but the thought of taking it all apart again and repackaging it just didn't seem worth the effort! So I placed a table runner over the top to cover the top drawers that do not close all the way. I would strongly advise you to stay away from this particular piece of furniture. I have purchased other furniture items from Overstock and did not have a problem. This cabinet is just not worth the money!", 
    "When I first opened the package containing this cabinet, I was overwhelmed by the number of parts and wondered whether I made the right decision ordering furniture that I imagined would need quite a bit of assembly. Don\u2019t let the number of parts daunt you! All the parts are already pre-labeled. Even the various screws are sorted and are in different pouches within a larger plastic packet. Nevertheless, to facilitate easy assembly, I used stickies to prominently number each part and used a marker to label the plastic pouch of each type of screw (I highly and strongly recommend this approach). After that it was relatively simple to assemble using the instruction manual that was very clear. Though relatively easy to assemble, I am nevertheless deducting one star because of the sheer time needed to assemble this cabinet (remember it has five drawers). By the time I was done with assembly, I was exhausted! The assembled product was well worth the effort! The veneer is nice and the cabinet has a very modern and chic look. Further, the movement of drawers on the rails is very smooth. The price of the product seems to be a tad on the higher side but I assume the premium is for the finish and good looks. I ordered the beech color and it is a nice looking color. However, in order for consumers to better match the cabinet-color to their other furniture, I wish the cabinet was available in more colors such as mahogany, birch, and wenge, to name a few. I believe the manufacturer and reseller of this cabinet is reading the reviews and is acting favorably. For instance, one person said in an earlier review that the cabinet was damaged on arrival. Well, the outer cardboard packing box is now shipped in bubble wrap (and additional layer of packaging) to prevent damage in shipping. Likewise, one reviewer said that he had problems installing the glass on the first two drawers. Well, now the glass comes pre-installed. I rate the cabinet 4 stars overall.", 
    "I did not have all the problems that other reviewers had. I got my package in less than two and a half weeks after ordering. It took about two hours to put together, the directions were no different from directions I have received from other online purchases else. Like other reviewers said only pictures, no words. None of it was complicated or frustrating to put together. It was basic, it just took awhile because there is a lot to put together (5 drawers and all) - so time minus 1 star out of 5. I am not sure if it really deserves the 1 star ratings or not from other reviewers because honestly I think my dresser turns out very attractive and sturdy. Personal perspective is that this dresser is probably the most attractive and the most solid dresser for the lowest cost that I could find. Good luck to all who purchase this, I do hope you'll find it as useful as I am now. Cheers!!", 
    "I was very dissapointed with this cabinet. It is a bit flimsy and difficult to put together. Assembly took about two hours. Some of the pieces were damaged I had to contact customer service for replacement parts. I wanted to return it but overstock returns are costly and inconvenient. Once put together it is attractive but not worth all the hassle.", 
    "This was a sturdy cabinet, but beyond my patience to assemble. Therefore, my husband put it together with little difficulty. The frosted glass had some marks on it and there were a few scratches, but overall satisfied for what I need it for.", 
    "I am a broke college student but really needed a new chest of draws. After looking for 3 months at furniture stores I finally found this chest on Overstock. I received mine yesterday and put it together. It did take little while but I expected that. You can't get something that requires assembly and then expect to have it done in 30 mins. I believe that it is good quality. I also love how tall it is. OVERALL PERFECT!!!", 
    "Although it did take some time and patience to assemble, once this dresser was put together it looked beautiful. It is not made out of the finest quality product, but then again it does not have the price tag for that either. This dresser will last plenty long enough until my daughter goes to college in about 2 yrs, and maybe she will take it with her, she loved the stylish design very much. The drawers glide very smoothly and it has quite a bit of room. And honestly for the price, it is quite a steal!", 
    "This is made from particle board. I was not impressed with the quality. This looks very nice but is way overpriced. It should be more like $**.", 
    "We just finished putting this Five Drawer Storage Cabinet together and I think it's fantastic for the price. This isn't high end quality furniture but if I wanted high end then I guess I would probably go with something above this price range but honestly, I think this dresser is pretty good. It's attractive, not too difficult to put together and I guess I was one of the many lucky campers that got this unscratched. Overall, I love it and it saved me a lot of money. Will it last me for 5 years? I don't know but most furnitures after 3 years, if you don't take good care of it of them (even good quality furniture) - it would still get worn out and rough looking. Will I recommend this? Sure of course...Good Luck all!", 
    "I agree with a lot of the other commentators. This is not the best quality, and a little metal would have been nice instead of all particle board. The assembly was not too bad, although the directions could have been clearer (they were only pictures, and did not differentiate between similarly shaped pieces). Overall, it was ok.", 
    "I jus want to say that this dresser fits my apartment to the T. I love the look and actually when ordering I didn't realize that it has a glass panel, which makes it even more better looking. The box this comes in is heavy and ours looked like it had received some rough treatment during shipping. But the inside packing seemed to be effective at protecting the contents and nothing was damaged! This is a good quality \"assemble it yourself\" dresser. The fit and finish are very good. I will recommend this drawer.", 
    "This product looks good, but is made poorly. The partical board construction breaks easily. I had to re-drill several holes that were the wrong size. It was a nightmare to put together. Although the legs look metal they are partical board painted silver...and only fully painted on one side.", 
    "What a great dresser, after it is assembled! Assembling the dresser was, at first, a bit scary because of the many pieces that needed to be assemble, but the clear instructions made it not too difficult once the right pieces get in their places. This dresser is very modern, very sturdy and so worth the money. It is very affordable especially for someone like me starting on their own.", 
    "This cabinet is being used in the bathroom for extra storage. The drawer hold plenty of items and will not fall out if you pull them too far. That's a great thing for me. The cabinet is a good cabinet for the price. I would recommend it. The drawbacks are the number of pieces to put the cabinet together. Plan on spending 1.5 hours. I also was disappointed in that I thought the foot support was metal and it is not. It is painted gray wood. I cabinet was received with minor scratches that I could polish out with a stain/polisher.", 
    "I agree with most of the reviews on here: it's a really cool looking piece and sturdy. The storage room is fine for my needs and the slim and slender shape is perfect for my apartment. Will recommend it.", 
    "This piece wasn't too difficult to put together, I've read some reviews saying that assembly was tedious but I felt it wasn't at all. The instruction manual is simple and straight forward, although it would probably go much faster than the 40mins if they have some written instructions instead of diagrams. But then again, 10 mins out of those 40mins was me spending to open the packaging up since it was sooo wrapped up with these huge bubble wraps and taped in every single corners. Heck, I am not complaining at least it got to my place safe. After the assembly, I wished I had room so that I can buy one more, it's very nice. It's slim and slender and doesn't take up much room, but courtesy of NY apartment- you know we can only fit so many items. The coffee bean color is more like a dark espresso color, the over all finish is very nice and the tempered glass makes it look even better. I hope my review is helpful to all those out there that is interested in this product. I just browsed through Overstock website again and found the sister drawer, I really surely hope I have more space, I would so totally stocked up my apartment with all its coordinating pieces", 
    "I bought this for for my wife for some extra storage in our small kitchen, and it looks great, she absolutely loves the coffee bean color. It was able to put it together in a few hours. Every thing came all packaged up and in perfect condition. Overall, a very sturdy and good product. I will surely recommend it to those who are looking for this kind of cabinet.", 
    "I purchased the fiver-drawer storage cabinet because I thought it looked very contemporary and edgy looking at the same time. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful and meets my expectations completely. I was super pleased with the assembly; the instructions were easy to understand, all the parts were there and packed intelligently. I'm thrilled with this cabinet and would recommend them to anyone. I'm quite sure they'll be around for a while.", 
    "I cannot speak to the quality of the item or assembly, as I never got that far. My item arrived severely damaged. The manufacturer did not package the item well at all. Individual pieces were not wrapped. It arrived with the hardware bag open and nails and hardware spilling out of the box, and all over the interior. One of the frosted glass inserts was chipped, with the loose glass in the package. The severely damaged box with the item from the manufacturer was placed in a larger shipping box which did not show damage, so I did not consider refusing the shipment for damage. Overstock was very responsive when I contacted customer care, and I am now initiating the return/refund process which I hope goes smoothly. This did not seem to be a problem with Overstock, but with the Manufacturer of the item and/or the consolidation warehouse. The warehouse may have put the heavily damaged item into another box to ship it because the current box was too damaged to withstand shipping (without ever opening it to assess the damage).", 
    "Easy to assemble, looks modern enough.Good storage space.", 
    "I've been looking around everywhere to find this size storage cabinet and this was PERFECT! I really like this storage cabinet's design esp because of the 2 upper drawers having a semi-see through window. Very simple yet looks expensive. Although it took me about 2 hrs to put it together, I'm really happy with how it turned out! I really recommend this to anybody looking for a smaller size storage cabinet. I am planning to order two more for my office!! Great buy, you won't be disappointed!!", 
    "Three words to describe this cabinet: Sleek, compact and timeless. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "This product comes in a box that is easily damaged in transit. Although the corners of the box had foam around them, they still got damaged. The part of the cabinet that gets nailed on the back lost a corner due to the damage of the carton. One of the glass door fronts must not have made it through to an inspector because I can't believe it would have passed. The glass is held in by 4 pieces of plastic and a thin gasket-type insert. The insert was broken and the plastic piece fell out. This meant the glass was being held in by 3 corners instead of 4. I was able to drill a hole in a different section to secure the glass but the insert is stil broken. In fact about a 1 1/2", 
    "The piece arrived at my office and the box was a bit bulky but fit in a cab perfectly. Once home, I opened the package and the hardware was all conveniently separated and sealed in plastic. The directions were very simple and it took about 45 minutes to assemble. Once completed it looked great, I live in Manhattan so space is limited in my apartment, this piece fit into place perfectly. Typically furniture constructed from particle board is difficult to move around but this one seems like a solid piece. The only complaint I have is once assembled, the drawers seem a little crooked when they are put in.I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.", 
    "easy to assemble and appearance is great! the drawers are deep and the color is nice. it's good for storage definitely!", 
    "You really can not find anything like this else where for the quality and price Overstock is offering. Ordered one for my office and loved it very much. It definitely beats the old and bulky metal cabinet. It has a very nice finish look to it. It doesn't take up a lot of room but still offer enough storage spaces. The drawers are deep so allows you to put a ton of paper work inside. It is very sturdy, I put a lot of heavy books inside too. The workmanship and quality is superb. I would think they will sell this for a much higher price, but hey I am not complaining because I love mine and I got it for such a great deal! Space saving and maximum storage - definitely need to buy this cabinet.", 
    "I got this cabinet as a gift from my sister and i ended up ordering 2 more myself. Great value and use of storage! I'm not really good with tools and assembling these things but I didn't have a hard time at all! I am very pleased with these cabinets and recommend it to all my friends. The dark coffee bean color esp. looks very rich and expensive. GREAT BUY!!", 
    "This piece was exactly what I was looking for. If you're in the market for a cabinet to hold those items that seems to end up on the dining table or counter top, then this cabinet is for you. It was well constructed and very elegant in style. The construction was a small challenge though.... I'm actually pretty handy but this required patience. My advice is to lay everything down on the floor and match it up before proceeding and you will have success... Good luck and enjoy........very nice product.", 
    "The legs came in brooken and the the laminated boards we all banged up. Very poor quality.", 
    "I purchased 10 of these for styling stations for my salon. They are the perfect size, and surprisingly sturdy. Assembly was painless....even after all 10! Note: there are three different bolt type things, so make sure you separate them accordingly (I did have to back track once) Very affordable. Good looking.", 
    "Works well for storage and looks good too! Would recommend for price point.", 
    "This storage cabinet goes great with the new bed frame that I bought (also on Overstock). It is a contemporary with a nice air brushed color. I love the spacious storage drawers and can store lots of my belongings. Great delivery time...and very easy assembly.", 
    "This storage gives us so many options and functions! I love the modern chic design. It is now in my bedroom right next to my bed and it looks great with my decor. Good delivery time and assembly was quite easy. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "The finished product was fine. My major issue was the lack of proper assembly directions. The booklet had pictures with numbers on pieces. However, nothing was labeled. The holes were to small in some areas that would not let assembly go as direction state. This lead to left over parts that would not fit. Overall nice product.", 
    "Great buy for a great price!! Not difficult at all to assemble and looks like I paid a lot more for it.", 
    "Another awesome product from the O! Oh Yeah! Easy to assemble and looks like I paid 3 times more for it", 
    "I like the cabinet but I wanted the dark color. What I received was a very blonde cabinet which doesn't match any of the furniture in my office. If I had known that the color was blonde, I would have ordered something else.", 
    "Oh we'll. I bought it as a filing cabinet, but none of the drawers is tall enough for letter size folders. I know the vendor didn't advertise it as a filing cabinet, but I wish they had stressed that fact to avoid confusion. Other than that, the unit looks stylish and compact and sturdy enough for fabricated wood. it fits in the corner nicely. Since I really need a filing cabinet, this doesn't serve my need. But it's a hassle to disassemble and ship it back.", 
    "It was really hard to install.I'm normally really good at working on a project.,but this was a painful project.I spend about 6 hours nonstop to install the cabinet.Couple of the pieces weren't right and I had to fix it myself.I don't recommend this cabient.", 
    "I bought this product for the way it appeared in the photo and it's size. I assumed that when O.com said wood it would not be medium density fiberboard. It took me hours to assemble all the drawers and then the main structure. At the end I was assembling the metal looking base which is really silver painted MDF and it was cracking as I slowly put in the screws. It cracked in a few other places as I put in screws as well - I did not over tighten - it just is not well made. I have it up and loaded and am just grateful that it's standing and the drawers all work fine. So I guess it's BUYERS BEWARE - when the copy says \"durable wood\" it's really just sawdust and wood particles press together.", 
    "I have both the light cabinet and the dark one.. The dark one is better quality... I like them.. but really hard and time consuming to assemble so many parts to assemble...", 
    "It is not made of wood. The quality is about the average level. But the style is good looking and guess it will do it job.", 
    "Good price for a high quality cabinet. Plus fast delivery and easy installation. i bought 2 months ago and no problems at all.", 
    "It is misleading that this is the first product that pops up under filing cabinets when the lower drawers are not deep enought to use as filing drawers. Although the pictures looks nice there was excess glue around the frosted fronts of the drawers making it look less expensive and once put together it wables.", 
    "I really dislike having to leave a bad review, but this cabinet is not well constructed. The predrilled holes for assembly does not align properly and therefore after putting it together , it is very obvious that the drawers have uneven gaps in between them. Some of them fit lopsided on the tracks. I would not recommend this product. I had intended to use it in my powder room, but I am embarassed by sloppy look of it.", 
    "As I did a search for filing cabinets, I thought i hut upon a nice one. A couple storage drawers with the bottom being a filing cabinet. If I had read the reviews I would not have been fooled like so many others. I tried to stop shipment en route but that wasn't allowed. Returning will cost about $$$ so now I'm stuck with a knick knack cabinet and still need to get a filing cabinet.", 
    "This took over 6 hours to put together and the final product looks average. The top does not sit tightly and large gap is visible showing the unfinished edge. While I thought this company packed everything better than its competitors, and the quality of the finish was high, the pieces were not cut properly and nothing in the final product was square. I would not buy another piece from them."
