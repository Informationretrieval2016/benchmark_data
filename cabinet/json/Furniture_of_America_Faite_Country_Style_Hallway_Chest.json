    "Definitely not the bright blue color as advertised. Mine was more of a dark mud blue with the bright blue painted as the back panel and underneath the bottom piece (ie. places that aren't visible). The quality is not bad for the price, it's a pretty sturdy piece that was packed well in the shipping boxes. One of the drawers isn't functional as a slide-out and it was a pain to put together. It took about 4 hours. I'm keeping it as it would be more of a pain to return. Although the color isn't true to the picture, it is not a bad looking piece and does look nice in my guest room.", 
    "I really like this chest that I purchased. It goes perfectly in our entry way. Doesn't look cheap and has pretty solid construction.It took awhile to put together, but hey, there area lots of parts.One of the rear corners came with a ding on it, but not enough to be too upset about. It is not on the front.Color may be a little darker than pictured, but it still works well.", 
    "Love the chest. It is actually darker than pictured which works better with my other furniture. However, it is a lot of work to assemble it and it came slightly damaged.", 
    "This hallway chest is beautiful and seems sturdy. Arrived in good condition. While the chest is great and is what I was looking for, can honestly say that if I knew how bad the instructions were I would have passed. I have put together many a furniture piece but this ranked as what as the most time consuming and frustrating due simply to the less than optimum instructions....in my opinion.But the chest is beautiful though.", 
    "it was very nice i love it", 
    "I am very satisfied with my purchase, it's just as beautiful as the description said, would highly recommend it.", 
    "As soon as I saw the photo online I knew I wanted this for our foyer. When it arrived in a flat box today, I was doubting my decision. Was I surprised!This is an extremely well made chest. Instructions could be a little rough for some inexperienced people but the construction of the chest and the ease as to which it goes together is stunning. I love it. Now, I am looking for more Furniture of America pieces. What an amazing find!"
