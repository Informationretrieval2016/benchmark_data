    "Nice little chairs for the price. The color is a beautiful, deep blue. Upholstery is velvet, just as stated. Quite comfy as well. I got them for my home office and everyone who sits in them remarks how comfy they are.", 
    "I was hoping to use this as a reading chair in the bedroom. This chair is good for a small space, but its not comfortable (very firm) and it's not very wide...so it's not a chair you can \"curl up\" and read a book in (and I'm 5\"3). But overall its a good chair for the price.", 
    "Exactly like the picture: Rich color, super soft, and easy assembly; I'm just in LOVE with them! I ordered a pair and matched them with an antiqued white cabinet, swavorski lamp, and orange blossoms.", 
    "We ordered two chairs and when they arrived, they looked beat up with indentations and scuffs on the material that did not come out no matter what we did. We ordered two replacements and they were worse than the first pair. We ended up returning all 4. Very disappointing as the color is beautiful. If you can get assurance from Overstock that they will package them extra carefully, it might be worth it to order these, but beware.", 
    "Great chair for the price. Soft and plush fabric. My only complaint is that the back is too low to be truly comfortable.", 
    "great bold color and great for an accent chair that doesn't get much use, if any at all. good quality for the money.", 
    "We needed extra seating in our living room so I purchased two of these chairs to go across from our couch. They're the perfect size for company to sit and visit with, and the style is great. Chair is a little firm but I'm assuming will soften over time. If you're looking for a cute little sitting chair, this will get the job done!", 
    "I'm using is as an accent chair in our bedroom and it looks beautiful! Gorgeous deep blue color! Very easy to assemble.", 
    "Hard surface but OK with the ottoman. Overall good purchase", 
    "exactly like pictured. very soft", 
    "Super price. Beautiful item. Arrived within a few days. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!", 
    "Very easy to assemble legs. The leg color is a little darker than shown in picture. Fabric is nice but if you have animals that shed, it could be a problem. Not the kind of chair to lounge in but good for conversation. Size is perfect. Over all I'm very pleased. It looks great.", 
    "minus one star for binding very hard. not a cozy chair but nice fabric and seems week made"
