    "Great looking headboard and even a GREAT price! Would recommend this to anyone for a master bedroom or spare room!!", 
    "I was looking for a decent headboard for me guest room that was not too expensive. This one is perfect. Easy to put together. The fabric is nice. I ordered brown. It is not a dark chocolate brow, but a medium brown that has a linen look to it. You can adjust the height of the headboard to accolade different mattress heights.", 
    "This is a nice headboard for the money. The color was not as I expected. It is a blue gray not a silver gray. I will have to find different bedding but have decided to keep it.", 
    "The headboard is absolutely beautiful! I bought the smoke color which is a dark gray. It was easy to install and I bought it at a great price! The headboard really adds that special touch to the room!", 
    "It was exactly as presented on the website.", 
    "Super easy to install. Looks great!", 
    "great headboard, my daughter loves it", 
    "looks good, fits a little loss on the frame part of bed.", 
    "Great buy for price, I got the smoked color and was the perfect dark grey I was looking for.", 
    "This headboard really my pulls together my guest room. It looks great! The only issue I had is that the screw holes didn't line up with the ones on the bed frame to attach it, but that's a problem with the frame. Awesome product!", 
    "I love this headboard. It looks very classy. I would definitely buy it again!!", 
    "Awesome buy for value, stunning appeal. For some reason pulls a bit easily when touched. Great look at an awesome price.", 
    "As shown in the picture and very sturdy", 
    "To be honest, I have to pinch myself to believe that I had the audacity to order this headboard and the good fortune to receive it so quickly. Not only was delivery fast, the quality is outstanding! This receives a WOW on all counts!", 
    "like some new ones--I have a picture on the wall above. Workmanship was great for the price.", 
    "Could not have asked for more at this price. No lingering scent and looks very elegant in the blue- which we thought would be more grey since the color was named charcoal (why i removed a star) but it worked out for us in this case. Easy to attach to any wooden bed frame.", 
    "Perfect and a great price. Bought in the brown, it's the shade of a cigar. Easy to put together.", 
    "Excellent quality , it its a padded linen material not flimsy at all", 
    "Looks very stylish. Chose the grey and it's perfect!", 
    "Looks beautiful in my guest room and I have received many compliments about how much it adds to the decor of the room.", 
    "Very nice addition to the bedroom. Great customer service for allowing me to return for correct color. Careful when selecting color, it shows one color in the picture in the cart but check the color description to see if they match.", 
    "I looked everywhere for the perfect headboard and am so pleased with this purchase. I got it in 'cafe' and am absolutely in love with it. Love the studded look as well. Super easy to assemble too, took me maybe 3mins!", 
    "Great headboard for my guest bedroom. Super value.", 
    "The price was great! The quality is great and I had it right on schedule!!!! I would recommend this compleatly!!!!", 
    "even thought i bought a queen ,it only fits a full", 
    "Looks nice and neutral color is attractive.", 
    "Shipping - Arrived on TimeColor - Purchased Ivory, shade very close to the pictureQuality - Very good", 
    "I received the headboard today and was pleased overall. Great value. I thought I ordered in ivory but rec'd green, which actually might work better! The complaint I have is with the nailheads. They look great until you get up close and have to figure out how to glue the corner left one so it sticks to the fabric, and see the damaged corner right one (which needed to be pulled off). They are cheap, flimsy nailheads. For our purposes, I believe this was the correct purchase even with the nailhead situation. So, if you're okay with a glue gun, you'll probably be okay!", 
    "Better than I expected. Very easy to put together and mount to the bed frame. Looks real good. It took only a few days to arrive and in good condition.", 
    "Great purchase for price.", 
    "Quick shipment! I LOVE this headboard! Quality look at a reasonable price. I would highly recommend this product!", 
    "I got this headboard in dark gray color and attached it to an IKEA storage bed. While it isn't quite perfect -- grommets aren't perfectly lined and the overall shape is a bit off -- it is a good value for the price. It is much lighter than I expected; I am a petite woman and at six months pregnant I was able to lift this and assemble it by myself. It looks sturdy and heavier than it actually is.", 
    "Absolutely beautiful! Lovely fabric, classy look and feel...two minutes to assemble. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!", 
    "For the price of this headboard it looks like it should be much more! I ordered the grey and it came a little darker than it looked in the picture but I know there will always be a little variation when ordering online. I LOVE it! It put the perfect finishing touch on our new bed!", 
    "Headboard looks awesome...I LOVE it! Can't remark on the install as my husband did it but I love the look!"
