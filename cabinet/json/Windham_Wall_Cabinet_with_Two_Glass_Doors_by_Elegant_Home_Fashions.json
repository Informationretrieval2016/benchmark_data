    "This is not a high quality product, but it definitely looks good for the price of $xx. Be careful during assembly. Heed the instructions when they say do not overdrill or screw too tightly. This is especially true when drilling the screws that will hang it on the wall. Drilling this too tightly will cause the back panel to be disconnected from the frame, and the cabinet will fall off of the wall. Yep, it happened to me.", 
    "My cabinet arrived in the mail with a broken glass door, I know that's not overstock's fault. It's just the hassle of ordering a replacement. When the replacement door did arrive the hinges did not match up with the cabinet. My finance had to drill holes so that the door could fit and even then it's not quite lined up.", 
    "I like this cabinet very much. fast shipping well packaged. Very Dark Espresso, nice color, Sleek Rolls of TP fit perfect on the shelves., adjustable shelves are good to have. When I read other reviews about the glass being very see through. I didn't think it would bother me that much. But it does a little You can see any contents clearly. Slightly weird. Nice glass though. I replaced the knobs with nicer ones. Looks Great, no complaints.", 
    "We got this cabinet for a small half bath that we had just remodeled. The color is nice and rich. It looks high end and the quality seems good. My husband put it together without any problem. Great buy......", 
    "The dark espresso work is beautiful, the glass doors are gorgeous and it was very easy to put together and hang too!", 
    "I really like this cabinet! I was able to put it together myself without calling on my husband for backup. The glass doors look sharp and compliment the dark finish.", 
    "Standard 'assembly required' cabinet. Beautiful chocolate color, as all the pieces in this line.. I've now ordered 3. I received a broken glass door- the folks at Overstock were ON it. Wow. Response, follow up, continuous contact until the piece was located and shipped - great service, as always. Thank you overstock. Great value on decent stuff, but mostly I adore you for the lightening fast shipping and phenomena service.", 
    "Great cabinet for over toilet area. Got it to store extra T.P. and linens for guests.", 
    "I am now redecorating and will be painting this oak, I could have bought a new one but very satisfied with this one and keeping it.", 
    "Good guality easy to assemble", 
    "Beautiful cabinet, easy to put together. Clean design lines.", 
    "I bought this rug for use as toiletry and make-up storage in the bathroom. I am fairly handy and it took me about 35 minutes to put together and hang.. It has been in use in my home for about 5 years and looks almost new. The cabinet has a good quality finish that seems to resist fingerprints. I left the original pulls because I have polished chrome in the room. I looked and looked for the right cabinet and I feel that this was a great choice. The only negative is that the back is flimsy but since it is wall-mounted this is not an issue for me. I easily covered the inside back with paper to match the room paint and it looks great. I love the glass that was used. It has a contemporary appearance but I feel that it will blend with almost any decor style. The overall appearance of the cabinet's style, finish and glass is of a higher end cabinet than the price indicates. Another winner from Overstock.",

    "excellent for extra bathroom tolitries", 
    "Nice wood good finish and well made", 
    "Good deal for the money worked out well",

    "Well made and easy to put together = adds a bit of class to my bathroom Plenty of room to add all of my cosmetics and perfumes", 
    "Never came with intructions, but even though I like it, I gave it two stars never came with intructions", 
    "To put together. And it had a nice wall guy made out of paper they could help you align the cabinet on the wall when you were ready to mount it. I did have to reinforce the bottom of it with a brace that I bought separately though, because I did not have a lot of confidence in the two screws it comes with to mount. It felt like it needed more support because the cabinet is it light.", 
    "Purchased this cabinet years ago. It looks just like the image you see when shopping. Good quality - good price.", 
    "Looks great and pretty easy to put up. Just the thing I needed and the color works great.",

    "really liked it / **************", 
    "Decent quality for the price. Does the job.", 
    "We needed a cabinet in our bathroom and loved the color of this. But it seems it is made out of cheap material.", 
    "Arrived in perfect condition. Not too difficult to install and serves the purpose of storage in our powder bath. Added new hardware to enhance. Was hoping the glass would be a bit less transparent. Overall good value for the price.", 
    "arrived exactly as described. wonderful addition to our bathroom", 
    "Very nice and rich looking. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Really nice and reasonably priced", 
    "This cabinet looks great over the commode in our guest bath. However, the directions are unclear on how to assemble the main box.", 
    "Looked a long time for this item. Had to put it together but it was very easy with the directions. Looks great in the bath room. Just what the picture showed is what we received.", 
    "I loved this cabinet - is a deep rich brown. HOWEVER... I must have missed the part where you had to put it together... lol... thank goodness for my BF.... it really is a nice looking cabinet was actually fairly easy to put together (yes, I could have done it w/o him) I actually changed out the knobs for some crystal looking ones and is even better! You can't go wrong with this one!", 
    "Great compliment to the floor cabinet. Glass doors give it a more open feel. Well made-good bang for the buck!", 
    "very dark brown..looks black, but its not.", 
    "This cabinet is really nice for the price, simple instructions, delivery was really fast. Great experience", 
    "I purchased these for my husband's salon for towel storage. These are perfect. They are well made and easy to assemble. They even included a template for hanging on the wall, which we found helpful.", 
    "Looks great on my wall. Sturdy so far and spacious enough for all of my bathroom items. Very functional for use as a \"medicine\" cabinet. It had a few scratches on one of the boards, but overall good quality.", 
    "Looks great in my bathroom.", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks great in my bathroom . Nice quality and Beautiful color!", 
    "This is perfect for my bathroom. It matchs the cabinets under my sink. The glass is not clear so you can't see the stuff inside.", 
    "Cabinet arrived with minor damage here and there, but I expected that from previous reviewers. For $**, you get what you pay for. It looks nice enough and holds a ton of bathroom items, and for that it works just fine. What I did not expect, however, was how bad it SMELLS. Truly awful enough that I considered taking it down only a day after I installed it. For now, we're airing it out and hoping that the smell will diminish, but if it doesn't, I'm throwing it out. Be forewarned. 2 stars for ease of assembly and look, but that's it due to the stink.", 
    "looks good easy to assemble and good quality", 
    "Useful, I like it !!! I'm buying the second one.", 
    "Great Quality .. Looks Great!!", 
    "Product arrived on time and is a very nice cabinet with excellent quality and easy installation. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the color is very dark (closer to black) than what it appears in the ad. I read that in a few other reviews and it is true, but not a big deal in my case.", 
    "I love this cabinet! Put it over my toilet for storage and it holds everything I need.", 
    "Wanted a small cabinet to hang over the toilet, this one was perfect! Impressed by the quality and beauty. This is an item that needs assembly but well worth the time. Well built and it even has real glass panels. Very please with this purchase. Thank You Overstock!", 
    "Cabinet very attractive and easy to put together. Looks great!", 
    "This was for the hall bathroom that has a dark vanity, this cabinet happens to match perfectly! Quality is excellent and it was easy to put together. Love it!", 
    "Easy to put together. Perfect for any bathroom.", 
    "I like it, but it was supposed to be Brown, and it is Black. But I am keeping it anyway, it will look alright. I have gotten it put together, it was easy, if you go by instructions, if you don't you will never get it together.", 
    "nice product, but the glass was cracked when it arrived. Overstock customer service was great as always and send a replacement immediately.", 
    "I bought this to go in an office bathroom. I bought it with the Windham Floor Cabinet with Door and Drawer. They look great together and this piece is wonderful on the wall for storage. It was easy to put together and easy to hang because it came with a template and everything we needed to hang it. I will be buying another one soon for our other bathroom at the office.", 
    "Very easy to assemble and great product!", 
    "I like this cabinet. It was not hard to put together and looks real nice in my bath area. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get this.", 
    "dark enough to work in a Black & white bathroom and holds bath items needed", 
    "I love the set which went great in my other bathrooms, but this hanging cabinet will have to be replaced. Hope it finally works once the replacement comes.", 
    "Expresso color works well in new bathroom over toilet. The glass is the best. Pay attention to door alignment when assembling. I traded the chrome door knobs out for brushed nickel.", 
    "We purchased five for a multi bathroom condo at a college campus. They look great but are a little tricky putting together due to the thin wood. They work fine for our needs and the price.", 
    "Love this cabinet. Bought it for a bathroom that has no drawers in the vanity. Attractive and useful; a tad pricey but it's more expensive everywhere else.", 
    "This cabinet was a gift for my niece and her eyes lit up when she opened the box. She said it was just what she wanted.", 
    "The cabinet arrived just as pictured. It is a really nice cabinet and easy to put together. Only problem with the cabinet is that it is heavy and when attempting to hang it the screws on the back scratched the wall and I had to do a quick repaint on wall. I put tape on the screws so it wouldn't scratch the wall again. It may be best to put the doors on after hanging on the wall to keep the weight down.", 
    "Looks perfect and matches the cabinets in the bathroom", 
    "The color in the picture is nothing like the color in person. The picture looks like a dark wood but in person it looks more black than a dark wood. The material feels very cheep. It easy to put together and instructions were very easy to follow. I wouldn't recommend this item. since I waited a year later to open it and put together I can't return it so I guess I'll just put it on the my dining room wall as I intended.", 
    "This is perfect in my new house bathroom. Easy to put together.", 
    "Easily put together, looks really great. Really nice quality and a deal for the money. Will enjoy for a long time to come.", 
    "Very easy to assemble, looks great, and arrived quickly. Will probably order another one for our master bathroom.", 
    "I just love this cabinet! It is beautiful and it was very easy to assemble.", 
    "I bought 3 of these cabinets. One is mounted above the toilet and two have been mounted vertically on an opposite wall to simulate a tall, thin cabinet. The result is a great look. We used to have a larger bath cabinet/armoire type of piece that made our bathroom too cramped. But, we needed the storage space. I had the idea to stack these vertically and it looks great, opened up the bathroom floorspace, and still provides the storage we need. I also bought a one-door wall cabinet and two small, thin linen cabinets (which I similarly stacked vertically) from Target. They have this style under the name of Chesterfield, in case you are looking for matching pieces.I'm pretty experienced at RTA furniture, and actually like putting it together, but I must say that these took me a while. The end products were worth it and I'm very happy with these for the price.", 
    "We just moved into a condo but the bathroom didn't have anyplace to store medicines and the like. This works perfect. Easy to assemble and very solid on wall.", 
    "nice but took my very handy hubby over an hour to put together...a ton of pieces.", 
    "Our new home didn't come with medicine cabinets! Just vanities and large mirrors. I searched for 3 weeks until I decided on this cabinet. I was skeptical because you get what you pay for but after a big move, I didn't want to pay hundreds for a cabinet. I actually purchased 2 of these. They match my vanities perfectly. The glass doors are heavy and of good quality. You can see through them but not necessarily what the products are. There is a lot of space for toiletries within the 3 shelves. My husband put them together in a snap. The cabinets are of good solid quality. I am very happy with this purchase and may buy a 3rd for my guest bath.", 
    "Great quality. This cabinet looks very stylish and is very roomy. It is a great value. We are very pleased with this product.", 
    "Received this cabinet today and was disappointed when the first door I took out had multiple defects in the finish. There is apparently a lack of quality control and I hesitate to reorder.", 
    "I've bought my share of \"put together\" pieces of furniture, so I expected some corners to line up less than ideal. All the pieces lined up well to speed up the process of constructing (which was minimal) & to reinforce the integrity of the piece. No weak seams/corners. The final test was the completed appearance. The two front doors were parallel to each other, making it close snug without an uneven gap or overlapping, also making the two knobs even and level in appearance. This overall finished look made the piece look very rich. The espresso color was very true to \"espresso.\" Very dark brown, looking almost black in dim lighting and very dk brown in bright light. No slight cherry look that espresso can often look like. We were going for as close to a black look as possible and this was perfect.", 
    "This cabinet is black and I was expecting it to be dark brown/espresso. I did a search on Overstock for \"Bath wall cabinet espresso\" and this item turned up. The picture appeared to be espresso. I liked the looks of it and it received good reviews so I ordered it. When it arrived, my husband put it together. When he was done, I was not pleased to see the black color. I went back to read the item description, and sure enough, it said \"black cabinet\" in the description, while the picture was dark brown. In addition to the color problem, the pre-drilled holes for one of the hinges was aligned incorrectly. We had to redrill it, and after that, the right door does not open freely, rubbing against the overhanging top piece. We will have to sand down the door to keep it from scratching.It's an attractive, solid feeling cabinet for a reasonable price, so I am going to keep it, but I don't like the black color. It's my fault for not reading the fine print, but I think Overstock was negligent in putting the wrong color in the picture.", 
    "This is a very useful bathroom wall chest that's also attractive and clean looking. The rippled glass keeps the \"necessaries\" out of sight but still easily accessible. VERY NICE", 
    "Cheap cabinet for a cheap price. Both doors had flaws but the manufacturer sent me new, excellent doors hassle free and for no charge. Replacements were shipped quickly.", 
    "I didn't expect anything less out of this product. I needed a space saver cabinet for such a small area in the bathroom and this worked out perfect. I love it & although this has glass in its doors you can only see shadows of whats actually inside the cabinet", 
    "No longer needed, so I returned item. It looked like a great piece", 
    "I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS ITEM I ORDERED (2) OF THEM GOOD QUALITY STYLE AND PRICE", 
    "I was kind of concerned about the quality of this cabinet but to my surprise the caninet look great on my wall. The glass doors on this cabinet gives the room a sense of elegance. I am really satisfied with this product.", 
    "This is a nice \"little\" cabinet and I do mean \"little\". I have to order two of them to have enough room for basics in our bath. Good news is they are small enough that I can put two in so the effect is nice to look at. Also got the little floor cabinet to go between two pedestal sinks and it fits perfect and is a nice height. Overall they're a nice addition and for the price really do look nice.", 
    "Received the cabinet promptly, however it was delivered to my neighbor's house. The cabinet assembled easily and quickly. It was the nicest cabinet I saw and a better priced then any in the big box stores.", 
    "Was pleasantly surprised. It's inexpensive, so I wasn't expecting high end, but it's really sharp looking. Went together easily, everything fits precisely, and looks fantastic. Would buy again and would recommend.", 
    "Easy to assemble, about 30 minutes. Decent wood and very nice plain design. I haven't hung it up yet. Color is dark dark brow, close to black. Great value.", 
    "Beautiful look and easy to assemble. Ordered the wrong color so I will have to sell and replace.", 
    "The style of this cabinet is modern and it really gave us the extra space we needed in a small bathroom shared by roommates. Fits nicely over the toilet without sticking out too much. For $XX, I'm not crazy about the MDF parts but hey, it looks great and does the job.", 
    "I purchased three cabinets from overstock. This one and two smaller ones. This cabinet is perfect. The instructions were easy to follow, the assembly provided a tight and sturdy fit. I was able to assemble and hang on the wall easily without the assistance of another. The cabinet looks great on the wall and holds the items that I intended. Though I desired smaller cabinets for the other two bathrooms I wish I had purchased two more of this particular cabinet. This is a nicer and more study cabinet and easier to assemble than my son's legos.", 
    "Got this cabinet for my husband bath room. It looks attractive,it's got plenty of space, and it was easy to install.", 
    "Very nice...the look is modern and sleek, The glass adds a nice touch as it is criss-crossed one inch squares that are cut in different depths giving it a \"house of mirrors\" effect. Lots of compliments on guest bathroom.", 
    "I bought this a few years ago at my previous home and loved it. Unfortunately, I left it there so when we moved in we needed another cabinet. I was open to any model but ended up getting the same one. It looks fantastic and is very easy to put together. You need someone to help you put it up though. When it arrived the glass doors were broken. Overstock just sent me new doors which was great - didn't need to pack it all up and send it back. Thanks O!", 
    "Love it! Fast shipping! Easy to put together, perfect size!", 
    "Great quality and superb product. I would recommend this to any one.", 
    "Matched perfectly, color and style of my bathroom vanities. Very easy to assemble, but the hardware was not consistent I. Screw sizes needed, as I purchased three. Still, very easy and a great addition and storage solution for my bathrooms.", 
    "I wanted a simple cabinet for my bathroom for a little more storage, but I didn't want the doors to be clear for a visual view. This one is perfect in that I get the extra storage, even personal items, without everyone being able to see what's in there.", 
    "I ended up loving this bathroom cabinet but it was a little tricky to assemble. The instructions could be a little more specific. I had to take it apart and re-do, which was not fun.", 
    "This is a nice cabinet. It was a little bit hard to assemble but I managed and I'm a 60 year old woman. It looks great mounted above the toilet.", 
    "This was just what we needed to complete our master bath with enough storage for personal items. We bought a his & hers.", 
    "It' good i was really expecting it better but the price we have paid I would definately say it's good. Very light wood probably not sure it will last long or not. otherwise everything is realy good.", 
    "Item was exactly as I thought it would be color is a perfect match to one that I have that is smaller Item came packed neatly and directions were easy for me to put together myself", 
    "This is a great cabinet for the price, it was really simple to put together with precise instructions that were included along with wall mounting hardware. It only took one hour from the time we opened the well packed box to get it put together and mounted on the bathroom wall. The adjustable shelves are great to accommodate various sized items. I did change the knobs on the door, they are pretty shiny.", 
    "High class look. I really love the cabinet. Very detailed instructions made cabinet fun to put together.", 
    "This is a nice looking piece. The back is a thick cardboard so it's not wood like the rest of the pieces but that works fine. Assembly was fairly easy.", 
    "Cabinet arrived in good shape. The installer had no problem putting it together and hanging it. He did use an extra screw at the bottom due to the weight. Looks really nice on the wall. For the money, a very good buy.", 
    "The item came without assembly instructions. Luckily it only took me about 30 min to assemble, though I had to redo some things. Quality is okay and will work for my bathroom.", 
    "This cabinet adds a classy finished look to our bathroom. Clear assembly instructions. Overall very pleased", 
    "Great cabinet, great price. Took about a half hour to assemble and it's very solid. Goes great in our newly remodeled master bath. We've received many compliments on it from family and friends. We're very happy with the purchase.", 
    "Looks great in my bathroom, has lots of storage space, and of course you can adjust the size/height of the shelves to your needs. I accidentally put the top on backwards from how I was viewing the pictures and directions on the instructions, however it was easy to fix once caught. I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member! I think the only thing I would like more is if the glass doors were frosted, however the squares design of the glass looks great.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised by not only the cabinet but the packaging - very well packed and not one thing was cracked, chipped, broken or missing which is rare these days when you order something. It was very easy to put together and...they give you a template for hanging which makes it so much easier considering the cabinet is really heavy. It looks great on the bathroom wall - has tons of room, shelves are adjustable and the ribbed glass helps hide contents while at the same time looking good. Best wall cabinet I have ever had! Would highly recommend. This is the second cabinet I ordered for this bathroom - the first is a white floor cabinet - also high quality, was easy to put together it just didn't fit the floor space so I put it in the Laundry room and it is perfect in there. I am super happy with both cabinets and overstock! Great product/s.", 
    "This completely changed the look of our bathroom. It is the perfect size and everyone that has seen it has raved about it. Great option for a small bathroom, it's decorative, and it adds storage space. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Beautiful cabinets & easy to assemble. Better quality than expected", 
    "I used this in a VERY small bathroom. It is a great size. Ir was very eaay ti assemble and is very pretty in a \"modern update\". The glass does obscure what is in the cabinet if the item you are obscuring is dark in color. I would buy this cabinet again.", 
    "Received cabinet very quickly. Assembled it in 1/2 an hour and hung it on wall over toilet. It has enough space for all the daily assential toiletries. Looks very handsome. The only problem: now I need to buy more stuff to match the style.", 
    "The cabinet came fast and was exactly as described. I put it together in about 15 minutes. I loved that the shelves were adjustable so I could fit my products in there. No one can believe that I only paid 60.00 for it. The only problem is it hangs from two screw at the top, my boyfriend felt like that wasn't sturdy enough so he just put two screws at the bottom. I thought it was fine.", 
    "The cabinet came very well packaged. Glass doors were in tact. Easy to put together and hang. Nice attractive piece and it serves the purpose in laundry room.", 
    "This is a great piece at a great price. I like the fact that the glass is obscured and you don't see all your bathroom items. I placed it over toilet in a bathroom and it looks great with espresso vanity. I wouldn't hesitate if you need extra storage in your bathroom. The shelves are adjustable, sturdy and keeps things out of sight.", 
    "Works great in our bathroom over the toilet to hold necessities. Shelves are adjustable so you can fit in everything you need. The variation in the glass lets you see that items are inside, but obscures the view so you can't exactly read that the box of tampons is in there. I put it together in 1/2 hour and actually hung it on the wall by myself, but you may want a helper to hold it in place while you drill/screw it in. Love the template for the wall hanging installation, it helped a lot. The knobs are a shiny silver, so I may switch them out, but that's so easy to do.", 
    "I originally purchased 3 of these for 3 of the 4 Bathrooms in my house. After 3 years I decided to see if they still had some so I can put it in the last bathroom. They have held up perfectly and look just as good as the new one I just got. Very nice cabinets at a very nice price.", 
    "A decent light cabinet, finished nicely, no complaints but I got it at a sale price and I think I would have been less impressed if I had paid full price for it. I must say that the glass is very cool (this is real glass) I was looking for a retro 50's type glass front cabinet and this definitely has this look. The glass is slightly translucent so you can see the blurry images of the things inside, so if you want to hide them this is not for you, but I like the look very much, just wish it had been a tad lighter in color (I think black would be closer to the actual color).", 
    "This cabinet was nicer than I expected. The glass doors are very pretty. The cabinet looks much more expensive than it was. It holds a lot of things, and adjustable shelf lets you put in really tall items. Compared to other cabinets I looked at in big box stores, this is a much better quality for less cost. It was also well packed with no damage.", 
    "Overall the look and finish is pretty good. Mounting instructions were not accurate, but not a big deal to fix.", 
    "I love this cabinet. I had looked and looked for a reasonably priced cabinet for my bathroom and finally found this one. It is good quality and definitely looks more expensive than what I paid. The color is very nice. It has adjustable shelves inside. It really holds a lot which is great since I like to stock up on stuff. It was VERY easy to put together. I've never built anything before but this was a good starter. My husband hung it on the wall for me and we followed other reviewer's advice and attached the doors after we hung it. You can see through it more than I would like (and bottles of shampoo aren't very pretty) so i plan to put some frosted film that I have leftover from another project and that should do the trick. I love it and would definitely buy it again!!!!", 
    "Great cabinet - purchased this and the matching medicine cabinet. The color is a rich dark brown. Changed the hardware to match the other hardware in the bathroom. Went together and easily and also pretty easy to hang. We used two people to hang it - one to hold it while the other attached it to the wall. Also put an extra screw in the bottom of the cabinet into a stud to secure it a bit more. I will be putting frosted cling onto the inside of the glass on the doors; although they are nicely textured, they are a bit too transparent for me. Overall, great cabinet - roomy, very nice looking and good quality. Looking at it, you would not know it was as inexpensive as it was.", 
    "Was looking for a wall cabinet what was slightly smaller than the 25\" cabinets found at Home Depot (HD) or Lowes (L). Assembly very easy. Glass is very nice and adds a nice touch to the cabinet... (Of course you can kind of see what's behind the glass, but I knew that before I made the purchase) I am very happy with this product and it doesn't look like every other one you see at HD or L. Less expensive than almost all the ones I saw as well - what's not to like....", 
    "Easy to install, done it myself in ~15min. However, need to buy mounting screws from HD with heavy rating, I don't think supplied mounting hardware come it work will hold the cabinet strong on sheet rock. Material is very paper-like, not very good material but can't complain more due to the low price", 
    "This cabinet arrived quickly and in good condition and was easy to assemble and mount by myself. It looks nice and I am happy with the purchase.", 
    "LOVE THIS CABINET. it is perfect for my remodeled bathroom. The color is a dark, dark, cherry...and love the glass. very contemporary if you want that type of look. I shopped everywhere to find a cabinet, and Overstock had it all the time. Easy to assemble...my 16 year old daughter did it with help from her aunt. A bit heavy though, so make sure you buy strong screws and sheetrock plastic inserts from a hardware store. Don't use the cheap screws that they come with to hang it on the wall. My husband is a mechanic and he never uses the screws that come with the products I buy to hang heavy things. Yeah Overstock!", 
    "This is a great cabinet. I love the style and the glass doors, which are real glass and not plastic. The construction is good although not the highest quality, but that was to be expected for the price. It's good enough for me. It's very stable and sturdy, not flimsy at all. The color is a deep rich chocolate brown, pretty much exactly like the picture. The size is perfect, it holds a ton of stuff but isn't over-sized in my broom closet of a bathroom. I have it over the toilet and it looks just fine there. It's a bit of a pain in the rear to put together, but I did it by myself and hung it by myself too in just about an hour. It comes with a nifty stencil to mark the wall where the holes should be which helps a lot.", 
    "I was pleased with the packaging - everything was wrapped carefully. It was very easy to put together and the template to place the inserts for the wall was extremely helpful. I had it together in less than an hour and my husband and I were able to hang it with little difficulty. It looks perfect!", 
    "Now this cabinet I have had two or three years,but it arrive with the one glass door broken:( Overstock refunded me.Instead of throwing this beautiful cabinet away I had new glass made and it looks great !", 
    "We needed more storage in the bathroom and I ordered this cabinet to put over the toilet. It was easy to assemble and very well made. It looks great and serves the purpose perfectly.", 
    "I really love it... It sure does give my bathrooms a nice look. I bought 2 of them to make sure that my bathrooms match and they sure do look great", 
    "The cabinet has a good look and assembly was accomplished. However, the handles had a defective finish on one, so that will have to be replaced with new handles. The two doors were the same, so the magnet catches were off, one on top, one on the bottom, so a new location on the bottom of the door had to have holes drilled so magnet catch is at bottom as it should be. The doors are just a smidgon off, so the center line where the two doors meet is wider at the top than the bottom, not much, but it would have been nice if it had been right on. I may call the company and have them send me another door altogether. Would I recommend this item? Relatively solid piece; It looks sleek, and the glass panels are quite lovely & unique. By today's standards, anything that comes in a box is always a scarey experience. More times than not, there is always something out of whack a little. I am sure once hung, it will be great.", 
    "Very easy to put together and good construction. Disappointed in color but too much work to return so made do.", 
    "Thie item is excellent. Both the look and feel suit me very well. After a lot of shopping this selection won and exceeded my expectations", 
    "I initially purchased two of these cabinets to hang on the two side walls of my master bath, but upon actually seeing the size of them, I may hang them over the toilets. Assembly is not difficult (I am a 58 yo woman), but careful reading of the directions is recommended and some of the directions are not clear. For example, I overlooked the part about gluing the dowels in the top and bottom and got the doors on backwards so the magnetic catch is on the top and the catch plates are on the bottom. It is also recommended to have someone help you when you are attaching the door hinges unless you can figure out a way to prop them to support their weight as the screws are very tiny and easy to misguide or damage. I also wish the glass was more opaque as I needing them more for storage than display, but other than that, they are very attractive and go nicely with the decor in my bathrooms.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet to hang above the toilet in my master bathroom; it was easy to assemble and very attractive, adding a nice aesthetic to the bathroom.", 
    "Some nicks were covered in touch up paint, which stands out too much. But, I dealt with Overstock Cust Service and they shipped a new replacement oor with no questions asked. Very good service!", 
    "These cabinets were a great deal and what a difference they have made (storage, etc) in my bathroom. A great product for the price. Universally clean design, ample storage. Arrived fast. Wish I did this years ago.", 
    "This was a fantastic purchase for the price. needed something cheaper for my newly remodeled bathroom and this was just the thing. very nice for the price.", 
    "This is a good product for the price, very good in fact. It goes together easily if you go slow and think it out before assembly. The color is a little reddish under a bright light, but very nice. Glass panels were better than expected. It is not however a fine hand made piece of furniture, so if your expecting that you will be disappointed. We used in a bath remodel and were very pleased, with careful use it should hold up for years, The adjustable shelves are a big plus. Overall we are very happy.", 
    "The assembly was easy; the cabinet looks very good, and the quality is as expected", 
    "This cabinet is very well made. Top quality at a good price. I received the initial package and one door was cracked. I notified Overstock.com and they sent me a new door within a few days, no questions asked. I'm very happy with this purchase and very happy with the service.", 
    "this piece was fairly easy to put together, the color was as described, and it arrived in perfect condition. It is the highest quality cabinet that I've found in a long time--it's a great value and beautiful addition to the bathroom.", 
    "Great item,easy for asemble Looks nice and elegant,lot of space,cabinet isnt to small or to big- perfect!!!", 
    "Assemble was easy, put together lots of kits, this one had all the hardware in separate bags, labeled with numbers. Hidden side hinges Only flaw was when I hung it on wall, the anchors supplie were too big for the screws. So had to use bigger screws. Very pleased with it. searched many stores for this and better than anything I found for less money", 
    "I received this within three days of ordering and the packaging kept everything intact. It was super easy to put together and came with easy to following directions. It's a beautiful cabinet. I'm never disappointed with Overstock.com.", 
    "i purchased this cabinet for my adult son as a surprise gift for his bathroom. it was easy for my husband to assemble. it was absolutely gorgeous. my son loves his surprise.", 
    "Was a little surprised that the cabinet only had two places to anchor it to a wall. I worry about the weight of a 3 shelf bathroom cabinet fully stocked. Haven't stocked it yet, but will report if it comes crashing down. Overall, what you see if what you get. My doors seem to be a little cockeyed; they aren't quite even, one is a little lower than the other one.", 
    "The box arrived safely and the instructions were easy to follow. The cabinet is just as described. It is not high quality wood but totally satisfactory for its use in our little guest bathroom.", 
    "This cabinet is a great buy! It's a beautiful well built piece, easy to assemble. A definite yes to this one!!!", 
    "I bought this to provide additional shelves for my bathroom. I am very pleased with it. It was fairly easy to assemble and all parts fit as they should. For a lower end cabinet, it is very stylish and good looking.", 
    "Love this piece other than one important flaw. The color depiction in the picture showed the unit as mahogany brown in one shot and darker almost black in another. Considering I was purchasing to match the stand alone unit that was mahogany brown, and it showed up in the almost black color, I'm not very happy. There is no option for choosing color and I even called before ordering in an attempt to clarify. The operator I talked with before ordering was no help at all. If the color matched the piece I got from Overstock that was the same in every other way, this would have gotten 5 stars from me. For that reason I would recommend to a friend if they didn't have the other piece already!", 
    "I really love my Wall Cabinet...It did take a lot of work to put it together, but it was well worth it!", 
    "We had one of those over the toilet space savers but after a year it started rusting out so I was looking for a cheap but nice looking cabinet to go above the toilet in our rental. I got this one because of all the positive ratings and it was a breeze to put together (less than half hour, could have taken less time but we had a toddler distracting us). Anyway it is so much better looking then the space saver and adedd an element of new-ness to our not so new bathroom. Very clean looking and sturdy.", 
    "The cabinet I ordered arrived in no time, was easy to assemble and looked even better than the picture. I just love the dark wood color. I am extremely pleased with my purchase and will definitely be purchasing item from overstock.com in the future.", 
    "I am rehabbing a run down house and bought two of these cabinets to install in the bathrooms. They arrived in a week and were impressively packaged. I put them together with no help from my husband, which is a testament to how easy they were to assemble! They look beautiful, very rich and of high quality. The only negative aspect was when I put the doors on the first cabinet--one door was noticeably a different color from the other. One was a dark espresso color, the other more mahogany. The thought of repackaging and returning the item was unpleasant to me. BUT, as luck would have it, I opened the second box and found the other cabinet had the identical problem! So I switched one door on each cabinet and they both look fab! Also, I didn't like the shiny chrome knobs that came with the units (it really cheapened the look) so I replaced them with brushed nickel finished knobs from the Home Depot; it made all the difference. I hope they retain their great appearance over time because they sure look good now.", 
    "Received product in a timely matter. The instructions were very clear without being too wordy. I was worried the color wouldn't matche the decor. It turned out perfect. I just need to hang it once the remodeling is completed. Crossing my fingers.", 
    "This is a very nice cabinet for the price. The color is a very dark espresso. I was concerned about it being made of MDF but it looks very high quality. Even my husband who HATES anything MDF says that it is a nice cabinet and is happy to hang it in our newly remodeled bathroom. It does take some assembly but was not difficult. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because one of the glass panels arrived scratched.", 
    "I received my order timely and was MAJORLY impressed with how all the items were boxed neatly and individually labeled. It took me 45 minutes from start to finish (including hanging). We love it and it makes our bathroom look \"polished.\"", 
    "note please - color is indeed darker that on a picture. but if you are looking for that expresso rich look then it's the right item for you. very nice. took a while to put together, but perfect. a glass arrived broken in one door, but overstock replaced with no hassle at all. they are the best when it comes to qulity of service.", 
    "The cabinet puts together good, but the screws to attach it to the wall were too small. Need more support. I got longer screws and washers and attached to the wall.", 
    "Being on a budget, I hunted far and wide for the best value and I found it with this cabinet. The cabinet is darker than the photo shows which only enhances the richness of the product. VERY simple to assemble. Even the parts bags are labeled! This cabinet holds it's own with cabinets costing 4x as much. You can't go wrong purchasing this piece.", 
    "Easy to assemble, love the size of this cabinet as well as the color very strong , overstock as always fast delivery and great service, I would recommend too a friend to buy, I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!", 
    "This piece turned out to be really nice but the sheeting on the doors is thin so anything you place in there (medicines, etc) show through...It is solid and nice though. My husband said the \"putting together\" process was one of the most lengthy he had ever had to do but once it was done it was worth it. You are required to glue it, etc..it was VERY heavy to hang. I would recommend it because it does look very classy once it is installed.", 
    "This cabinet is very rich looking - especially compared to other cabiners in this price range. The color is more of an expresso. It goes together easily and I hung it on its original hardware and achors with no problem. I am very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "This cabinet was easy to assemble. As other reviews have said, I think the cabinet looks far more expensive than it is. The only issue I had was that the color was much darker than what it appeared online. I had read that this was the case in reviews, but the difference was more extreme than I thought. I was trying to match the cabinet to an oak-colored wood. I knew this cabinet would be a bit darker, but it ended up being a very dark cherry, nearly espresso but with a cherry tint. Otherwise, I found that the cabinet was really great. The doors open and close perfectly with quality hardware. I thought the directions were very accurate. The only problem I have had is finding a floor cabinet to match b/c they are quickly selling out. Some websites say that the floor cabinets will become available again in Feb. As usual, Overstock.com did a great job with their part in order and delivery. I'm only giving a 4 instead of 5 b/c of the inaccuracy of the color in the image provided online.", 
    "Wood is darker than appears in photo. Went together well. I wish the back of it was of heavier material, but it is against the wall and that does help. The wall anchors that came with it were on the small side so we just got heavier and longer wall anchors to secure it. It looks as nice as the expensive ones from that high end hardware store!! We have received lots of compliments on it.", 
    "I love this kind of cabinets, it looks noble and comfortable.", 
    "This cabinet was purchased to complete a bathroom remodel and it's really nice. A little bit unsturdy, so we replaced some of the screws -- also didn't care for the doorknobs, but easily replaced them with alternates that matched other fixtures better . . . Overall, a really great value that looks much more expensive!", 
    "I was very pleased with the construction and workmanship of this cabinet...very sturdy. The wood was darker than pictured....but it worked out better actually in my case. It's very classy looking. This was a great bargain!", 
    "I love this cabinet. It definitely comes darker than the picture, but I like the darker color better. It didn't take long to put together, although the directions are not quite the clearest. It does have a strange chemical odor which after 2 weeks is still there. The quality is very good and all in all I am very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "We wanted to remodel on a budget. This is a great little cabinet that looks like I spent a lot more on it. I am very pleased.", 
    "Once it was put together (which took a bit of doing - the instructions come with no written detail, just pictures and it is easy to accidentally flip parts, etc.), I loved this cabinet. It is exactly as described and looks great in my bathroom! Would buy it again (but put it together right the first time this time :-)).", 
    "We could not be more pleased with our purchase. This cabinet is well made and it was easy to put together. The color is rich and it shows better than the picture. Buys like this make me keep coming back to Overstock! You guys rock!", 
    "This cabinet is beyond beautiful. It is perfect in our water closet. The glass doors make the cabinet look classy but not over done. Two things worth mentioning. The shelves are not adjustable and it will not hold very tall shampoo bottles. But it is perfect for extra rolls of TP, bar soaps, hair coloring etc. I am considering buying one for our half bath.", 
    "Excellent value for the price-good looking and functional piece. I like the frosted glass doors-it gives it class and and upscale look-very contemporary.", 
    "Assembled fairly easily and looks really good. My only \"complaint\" is that the veneer dings easily, but once you have it on the wall, I don't see that as a problem. Looks very nice and adds valuable storage space.", 
    "This cabinet, though made of mdf, which I usually avoid, is actually of a very nice quality for the money. And the veneer and finish is quite well crafted. The assembly was not difficult and it was easy to hang with the supplied hardware. It is placed above the toilet in our guest bath and holds a nice supply of necessaries. Like others have noted, the cabinet is much darker than the picture on Overstock shows it to be, which is a plus for us.", 
    "My husband and I are very happy with this cabinet. We are remodeling our bathroom and had bought a vanity from another store. When I saw this piece on Overstock, I thought it might match, but was unsure of the color. By reading some of the other reviews, it help me figure out that it was darker than it appeared online, which is what I needed. It is a very rich, mahogany color and the wood and craftsmanship was very nice. It was easy to put together. We haven't hung it on the wall yet because our bathroom isn't quite done. But I think, when all is said and done, people are going to think that we purchased the vanity and cabinet as a matching set!", 
    "It's a nice looking cabinet, but the color of the wood is much darker than it looks in the picture. It is an espresso brown. The only other problem we had was that the doors weren't lined up quite right and they rubbed when you close them. With a little adjusting we were able to get it to work ok.", 
    "The cabinet is very nice, looks classy and was easy to put together", 
    "The color of the product is nowhere the same as the color on line. It is a very dark brown almost black, rather than the reddish brown pictured. The quality and size also did not merit the price. I would have never bought it if I saw it in a store for this price.", 
    "This sure looks black - guess what - it's not. You'd think with a picture like this they'd tell you the color. Now, I've got a nice little painting project on my hands because my wife really likes this thing...in the box...I haven't even taken it out yet except to see how not-black it is. Again - THIS IS NOT BLACK IT'S FRICKING BROWN."
