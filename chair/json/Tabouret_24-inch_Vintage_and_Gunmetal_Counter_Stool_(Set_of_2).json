    "These counter stools were a great buy for the price. They are the perfect height for my counter height island. Wanted something that wouldn't scrape across the floor when moved, and so far the feet don't leave marks when you move the stools over tile. Really love the handy handle on top which makes it really easy to move the stool out from under the counter and to put them back. They aren't too heavy to move, but at the same time have a nice heft to them. I do like the color which is very similar to what is shown in the image, trending a little toward brownish gray. One thing I will mention is that I was a little unprepared for how splotchy the finish was in some places. I'm sure this was intentional to give it that \"vintage\" look, but I would have preferred something without such noticeable splotches. Makes it look like you borrowed it out of someone's garage so be warned and look carefully at the close-up pictures to see what I mean because it is much more noticeable than in the pictures.", 
    "These stools were exactly what I wanted. Wide seats are comfortable. Very sturdy and well made. Bonus that they stack a real space saver. The vintage industrial gunmetal color is not shiny and goes well in my eclectic kitchen. Very pleased.", 
    "These are great stools, especially for the price, have looked at similar ones in stores for twice the price & not as nice. Happy that the color was warmer with the bronze hi light, looks great in my kitchen when mixed with the wood stools.", 
    "These stools are great! They are heavy and are a pretty gunmetal color. The 24' height is on the low side for a counter height which works perfectly for our kitchen counter that is lower than most. Otherwise, get the 26'.", 
    "Excellent quality, great hard rubber feet on bottom. Would purchase again.", 
    "Gunmetal is a nice antique bronze true metal look. I was at first worried it wouldn't match my stainless appliances but now I like the contrast. I returned the Tabouret Metal counter stools (the one that came with the bonus stool) because the perfect paint job looked like plastic to me.", 
    "Stools are extremely solid, nothing to assemble! Finish is matte and it is 'vintage\" meaning there are some scuffs to make it look timeworn. If you are looking for a perfect finish these stools may not be for you. I love the character they add and also don't have to worry about keeping them perfect. Got them with a coupon and even at regular price they are much less expensive than what I had found at other retailers.", 
    "I needed counter stools for my new tiny apartment (no room for a kitchen table, but I do have a large island with seating space). Love the tolix stools, but not the price-- these were a perfect, cost-effective alternative. They do the job, look pretty good and at $** a stool, fit my budget. All around, a good deal.", 
    "I was looking for a inexpensive industrial look stool. Thes fit under your counter, their sturdy, stackable, have rubber feet. But they don't have a cushion. That's not a problem for me but some may want to add one. Overall a great buy.", 
    "Even better in person, great quality", 
    "Hefty, good quality, decently priced. Purchased these and the taller set for my kitchen. Use the taller ones as plant stands and these under my kitchen island.", 
    "Color is a great match to our decor. Sturdy and attractive. Such an unbelievable value!", 
    "I use them in the garage and when not in use they stack perfect.", 
    "They're perfect for the price", 
    "Love them in every way. Perfect for my sleek gray and tangerine kitchen remodel and the eat-in white quartz island counter.", 
    "Great product especially for the cost. We ordered an additional set.", 
    "Perfect and not a bad price", 
    "love these stools. they look great and are just the right height for our counters. perfect!", 
    "Classic and so durable! Love these", 
    "Came assembled and great for the price.", 
    "These are sturdy good looking bar stools. I love the gunmetal color. Also bought but returned the vintage color. It has a copper overtone that did not work in my room.", 
    "Nice quality! Heavy metal! Shipped out quickly!!", 
    "Fit my decor perfectly...love that they're a little rustic", 
    "These stools match very well our modern white kitchen. Comfortable to sit on and easy to clean. Good construction.", 
    "I debated whether to buy the Restoration Hardware ones or these, and I am so glad I saved money and bought these. They are sturdy and durable (and we have kids who have friends here often!). I just love the look of them too. I just wish they would sell single ones because in my case I only have room for 3, not 4. Otherwise, great buy!", 
    "Used these at a trade show. We love the industrial look and the fact that they stack. Made shipping and set-up a breeze.", 
    "Very happy with these stools, perfect color for my d\u00e9cor and nice finish.", 
    "Ordered 4 stools for my kitchen counter area. Goes great with he pendant lighting. Very happy with them.", 
    "I love the color and they are durable. They aren't as heavy as I thought they would be but they are still beautiful and the perfect height!", 
    "Good quality and you can't beat the price for 2.", 
    "These stools are perfect for our kitchen island and the metal of the stools go perfect with our metal pendants. The give a nice industrial look, sturdy feel, and comfortable. We were concerned with having these type stools on our new hardwood floors but there are rubber feet at the bottom of them.", 
    "very good for the price..look perfect", 
    "These are my \"go to\" stool. Have them in just about every color for several houses. they are priced right and look great!", 
    "After much deliberation on the type of stools I wanted, I settled on this style. I looked at every brand and color, and then I came across 'gunmetal' which seemed to be sold out everywhere but Overstock! So ordered them, and I could not be happier! They can packaged perfectly with even a wood cross bracing at the bottom of the box to ensure rigidity. They look very industrial and classy! There are rubber feet on the bottom to ensure my floors don't get scratched which I like. They are also stackable for storage, solid (yes I did some standing on it to get up I'm a high place) , and easy to carry since there is a handle cutout on the seating surface. I also enjoyed having no assembly! Now choosing a hight of stool was difficult without seeing them under my kitchen counter bar, but I went with 24\" and they fit perfectly! It is 35 1/2\" from the floor to the top of my counter and I have 10 5/8\" from the top of the seat to the bottom of my counter; so a perfect amount of leg room too. From one perfectionist over thinker to another...if you like the way they look, than put them in your cart. You'll be happy you did!", 
    "Posting a review so overstock quits emailing me to review. Stools are great. Nice clear coat on them. Color is good.", 
    "Great stools. Great vintage look.Kids drag them around my hardwood floors with nary a scratch.", 
    "These counter height stools look wonderful in my kitchen and compliment my oil rubbed bronze light fixtures perfectly. They look rustic! love them.", 
    "I finally found a set of bar stools that actually looked like a galvanized metal and not the gun metal that is almost black or the painted silver. Although shorter than most counter stools, these bar stools complimented my stainless steel appliances perfectly. I also purchased the matching side chairs and I am very happy. Shipping was fast too!", 
    "These are amazing. Sturdy, high quality pieces that get a lot of compliments.", 
    "Really like the industrial look of these stools. I purchased the gunmetal stools and they look great in my kitchen which has stainless steel appliances. Another plus is that there is no assembly. These stools are constructed to last !", 
    "The stools go nicely in my kitchen. I find them to be very comfortable. I like the opening in the seat which makes it convenient and easy to pick them up to move around. Very sturdy and attractive. .", 
    "I LOVE these chairs!! Provide a great contrast to my dark cabinets and grey granite countertops.", 
    "I've had these stools for over a year now and still love them. Perfect to fit underneath my kitchen bar and be out of sight when not in use. Very sturdy, you feel very secure sitting down on them. I have the Vintage color and they look just as good now as they did when I first got them. I just recently bought another pair to go with the old ones.", 
    "Purchased for kitchen under kitchen island for son's home. He really likes the simplicity of design, modern industrial look and they are sturdy. Leg tips protect floor.", 
    "I love these stools. They were perfect for my counter top bar. Products come fully assembled and are very sturdy",

    "Perfect for my newly renovated kitchen! They are stackable so I can easily seat more at my large granite island. Easy to store and they look great. I have white subway tile, gray rustic washed cabinets, Dallas White granite on my white island",

    "LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! very nice stools! They came in a timely fashion. Color is just what I expected!", 
    "Nice quality, best price around. These stools are popping up everywhere, residential and commercial venues.", 
    "Solid stools and good design, but the vintage color stools are brown and have no silver at all in them. They are more of an oil-rubbed bronze. Nice looking, but not what I need.", 
    "You wouldn't want to sit on them for hours, but these stools are an gorgeous color and a perfect height for our kitchen counter.", 
    "Great stools, exactly as described and pictured. Look great in our kitchen.",

    "These are impressively good quality. I thought they would scratch easily but they dont. They're a good weight and don't feel cheap at all. The metal is soft and velvety. Im so happy with the purchase.", 
    "Use as additional seating on kitchen island... Stackable so easily stored away when not needed", 
    "Sturdy. No assembly. Love them.", 
    "These chairs are such a good deal and look really nice. The vintage color is beautiful and matches most settings. I was running into trouble finding stools that were too tall at 30 inches or more. These fit perfectly with plenty of leg room under a 36 inch bar.", 
    "The counter stools are great, just not exactly the color I was expecting. Unfortunately, the packing material was recycled so I will keep. I would have returned for a different finish. The vintage color was more bronze than vintage.", 
    "great look with my modern rustic decor", 
    "There stools are awesome! The color is fantastic, like a light bronze color. Very industrial, which was the look we wanted. Love them!",

    "I really like these stools. They are as pictured, sturdy but lightweight. I would have given them 5 stars but one of them has rust under the protective coating.", 
    "had these for a year. great price & great value", 
    "The color of these stools was more dark bronze than I expected. The stools are a nice size and the quality is very good.", 
    "Industrial, modern, exactly what I wanted! Great price", 
    "high quality. would buy again...", 
    "Great for the money, good overall. Nice \"depth\" to the look -- not the painted-on finish referenced elsewhere. Haphazardly applied \"rust\" detailing doesn't make a ton of sense (especially because the obvious clear coat would prevent any rusting) but the impact is minimal. They hold up your butt and look good doing it -- what else could you want?", 
    "These are great and sturdy stools. They look just like the picture and have a nice vintage/industrial feel.", 
    "They seriously fit my spot perfect even better in person!", 
    "I ordered the counter stools in gun metal and am very happy with them! They are solid and arrived as pictured. I had only a small concern with the finish on one, but Dimensions followed up quickly and professionally. I am very pleased with their customer service and the five stars are as much for that as for the stools.", 
    "Chairs are exactly as stated and pictured.", 
    "Love these and they are a deal and a half.", 
    "I love these stools! Not only do they give me the industrial look I wanted for my kitchen/family room, they are sturdy and exactly the right height.", 
    "These are a lot nicer looking in person! They are very heavy and solid, I love them!", 
    "These work great in my newest remodeled kitchen. They look like very similar, higher-end stools. In fact, my husband thinks they are. Don't tell him! Easy to maneuver and I don't worry about my children banging them up. Attractive, functional, inexpensive = perfect for busy family with young kids.", 
    "I ordered these stools to go in my kitchen they are very sturdy and i like that the are square so they fit better under the counter", 
    "These stools are solid yet mid/light weight (easy to grab and move around). Look just like the picture. I'm very happy with this purchase.", 
    "can't believe it's only $100.", 
    "These chairs are a beautiful addition to our home. I love how durable they are, so easy to clean (I have kids:) and are still comfortable to sit on. I always get compliments on them.", 
    "Shipped quickly and in great condition!", 
    "Just as described. I love them.", 
    "these stools far exceeded my expectation compared to the low price!", 
    "These stools seem well made and at a fraction of what they sell for elsewhere. Arrived in great condition though I'll warn that you may want to put felt feet on them because the metal stud in the middle of a few of the feet still made contact with our hardwood floor.", 
    "Great stools. Exactly as described. Perfect for under a kitchen bar. Definitely recommend!!", 
    "I get compliments on these daily.", 
    "beautiful color - perfect match to my kitchen table", 
    "Great, sturdy, good-looking stools. We got the gunmetal color and it looks great with the stainless appliances in our kitchen.", 
    "These are sturdy, don't tip easily and are easy to get on and off of. In addition, the color and finish is very forgiving, much like leather, even if a scratch or dent occurs, it just adds to their patina, unlike painted stools. These were the first set we purchased and loved them so much that we've since bought several 30-inch versions for a high bar.", 
    "These stools were perfect. Color matched exactly as online. Was surprised by heavy they are. Very sturdy.", 
    "Great quality, great appearance. Very well constructed. The finish is MUCH better than similarly priced stools I've seen around (e.g. at ******).", 
    "They are exactly as described. Nice and sturdy and look great!", 
    "These stools are perfect and exactly what I was looking for. They feel like good quality and not cheaply made. We have not used them yet though because our home is being built. The color is as others describe- it is not a perfect solid color.", 
    "Just what I was looking for. They are well worth the price. I'll be buying another set.", 
    "Nice stools, sturdy product, comfortable and oh so NOW!. I ordered the wrong color. This look is more of a contemporary look and my d\u00e9cor is country. So they just don't work. But do really like them.", 
    "Very sturdy and the gunmetal finish is really pretty! Definitly recommend these stools!", 
    "These are exactly as the picture shown. These also price a lot higher from other retailers. They are a perfect fit in my kitchen.", 
    "Stylish, contemporary, and perfect for a short bar area.", 
    "I bought two sets of these for my kitchen island and I love them! I wanted something with a vintage look but would also be kid friendly. They are really pretty in person.", 
    "Love my new stools and can't beat the price. Very pleased", 
    "I like the \"distressed\" finish. Much more comfortable than I thought they would be and a great, cost effective solution for counter stools. Well packaged and delivered quickly.", 
    "Exactly the right height and look for our kitchen island. Each one has a bit of unique distressing, which give them more of a vintage look.", 
    "I got the gunmetal color and they look really good. We recently remodeled our kitchen and have a newly built peninsula that we needed shorter chairs for, and these are perfect.", 
    "This is a great product that comes as pictured with nothing to put together. Easy to clean.", 
    "These stools are great! I plan to get more. They feel solid and look great.", 
    "Great stools! Super sturdy and solid with great coloring. Bought them for my kitchen counter and use them every day. Highly recommended.", 
    "I use these stools at my kitchen island and I love them. They look expensive with just a slightly worn finish (think character, not worn out). They are light weight while sturdy, allowing me to move them easily while cleaning or entertaining. I would definitely buy these again and recommend them to others", 
    "I ordered the table and stools in gunmetal for my daughter before moving her to New York City. The table came dented and the stools came in Vintage. We had no realistic option to return the stools. If you know anything about NYC, you know it's impossible to get large deliveries. We left the mismatched stools with our daughter or she would have had no where to sit. I contacted Customer Care and asked them to credit the cost of the stools given the bad situation this put me in. They did nothing. Will NEVER shop at Overstock again. Buyer Beware!", 
    "Economic tolix-like stool alternative. Well priced!! Functional and arrived on time.", 
    "These stools were perfect for our 30\" iron crank table. These were the best. Not painted silver but have a natural industrial look. Great for under our sky lighted breakfast nook!!! Get the crank table too!!!!", 
    "Very pleased with these counter stools! They are vey sturdy and surprisingly comfortable!", 
    "very nice appearance and very stuedy", 
    "I love how these look in my kitchen. Used for seating and also to stand on to reach high cabinet shelves.", 
    "Great product and price... very modern industrial look", 
    "we order 4 stools (2 sets) The 2 out of 4 were damaged. They had rust marks on the seat. Called Overstock and their customer service was great. They sent out another set of 2 stools. One was damaged with rust spots again. I'm still waiting for UPS to examine the first set of damaged stools. It's been 5 days since I last spoke to Overstock. They said UPS would contact me in 2 days. Overstock is very friendly and willing to fix the problem. However, their quality control is awful. They don't examine their product before leaving the warehouse. I didn't bother calling about the 3 damaged stool. I'll just keep it because I can't wait around for UPS to never show up.", 
    "Great bar stools and perfect for our kitchen counter.", 
    "I've already purchased 8 chairs for dining room seating. All the seating, including the counter stools can be stacked for storage when not in use. The stools fit comfortably under my kitchen island and as with the chairs, are comfortable seating. The finish is more rustic than polished, but the seating can be used anywhere.", 
    "Great for the kitchen or outdoors", 
    "good. sturdy. seems like it's made out of a mix of plastic and metal, not just metal.", 
    "I bought these to go with my kitchen island along with a few different types and styles and love the look. My kids do complain that they are cold to sit on because of the metal but the look is great. I would say also to check your height because they are a little shorter than I thought they would be.", 
    "Nice quality goes well with a lot of different decor", 
    "Very nice stools. Just needed something with a back on them. Would recommend them to others.", 
    "these are the chicest stools in the world. great quality and a great price.", 
    "Perfect for our kids, lightweight but heavy duty, easy and so nice looking. I get tons of compliments", 
    "Great value. Love the color.", 
    "Perfect stools for a short counter. I'm very happy with these in my home.", 
    "I made a mistake when buying these thinking they were table height, and not counter height. No big deal, I'll have my husband modify them. They are great quality, and when I put an island in my kitchen, I'll buy more.", 
    "I love the color of these stools.", 
    "We have previously bought the larger grellow (green/yellow) stools from overstock but in our new kitchen we needed shorter stools. We got these and love them.", 
    "Love my counter stools. They have a slight distressing which only adds to the look.", 
    "Very industrial look, quality construction. I get compliments on them!", 
    "These chairs are great to look at and can stand up to the rigors of four wiggly kids crawling on and off them all day. Definitely recommend.", 
    "great stylish stools for great price", 
    "I researched a lot before making this purchase. These stools are a great color and finish. They are very comfortable and lightweight. I would highly recommend them. They deliver in one huge box but each was in one-piece each.", 
    "Chose the gunmetal and it matches stainless appliances really well", 
    "Love them except they are a little uneven on a hard surface", 
    "These stools are awesome. They have a really cool industrial finish to them too. Great buy and a great price. The gunmetal was the same finish as my stainless steel appliances.", 
    "Sturdy and very comfortable. I also really like the \"vintage\" coppery color and faux vintage aging on these! It adds just enough of a rustic feel. These stools do not have a cheap plasticy look. Comes in a set of two and easily stacks! Very happy with these stools.", 
    "Great deal for the stools; well-made and sturdy. Look great in my kitchen! Relatively comfortable, too, for metal stools!", 
    "they look nice, shiny and industrial.", 
    "These were nice but I sent them back because the color wasn't quite what I had hoped. They were very well made and definitely worth the price though.", 
    "Very fun, useful, comfortable counter height stools. These knockoffs are attractive and sturdy. Love them.", 
    "Love these stools, great buy!", 
    "Love them, exactly what imwanted", 
    "We bought 4 of these stools for our homeschool room and they're exactly what we wanted. We decided on the vintage stools which were at a lower price. Love the look of them. We have already \"christened\" them during an art class and the paint wipes right up. We are so pleased with the price, the sturdiness of the legs, (there's no wiggling), ease in stacking, and the look of the vintage. The stools also arrived early which was an added plus. We will definitely buy from Overstock again! Thank you for a great product!!", 
    "Fit well under my kitchen counter", 
    "Sturdy, well made and true to color of the online product.", 
    "sturdy, affordable and good coloring.", 
    "these look great and sit well. Plus, they're durable and stackable. We would buy these again.", 
    "exactly the right height and very sturdy. excellent buy.", 
    "I liked them so much, I ordered another pair.", 
    "These stools are exactly what we were looking for and at an amazing price. The \"vintage\" finish is perfect for a refined industrial look and looks way more expensive than they were. We plan to buy chairs in the same finish to be used with a wooden farm table. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.", 
    "I bought six of these stools to go around my kitchen island. They are perfect. They are lightweight, making them easy to move around as needed, but very sturdy. My husband weighs 240 pounds and doesn't feel like he's going to break or bend them when he sits.", 
    "Gunmetal finish has a glossy coating and looks more industrial than the regular Metal finish. These coordinate nicely with stainless steel appliances, chrome, and brushed aluminum.", 
    "These stools are perfect for counter level seating. Love the ease of moving them with the grip hole and they stack perfectly.", 
    "I've been seeing these stools everywhere. I got them in gun metal and in red. I love them - great design and pretty sturdy. They look great against the island in my kitchen.", 
    "Exactly as pictured. Great color. Sturdy and stable design. Great hight. I like the pads on bottom of legs, they don't mark floor or scratch.", 
    "Purchased these stools to replace some wooden PB ones we had. Really like the vintage look and they are surprisingly more comfortable. Initially ordered one set just to see if I liked them. One of the stools was defective (you could see straight to the silver metal underneath on the seat), but Overstock sent a replacement at no charge. As for color, I would say they are a silver metal that has been stained/painted oil rubbed bronze to get that vintage/old look. So in some areas it is a little darker or lighter; i.e. it is not a purely solid colored stool.Bottom line, really like these stools!", 
    "Love this stools, the color is awesome, durable, great for extra seating and the best part is that they are stackable!!", 
    "We bought two sets of these stools for our newly remodeled kitchen. They go well with the farmhouse/eclectic design as well as the butcher block farm table we now have. They are more comfortable than they look. We got the vintage color and really like it for the more subtle metal colors than the aluminum color of the gunmetal.", 
    "These are beautiful. I live in Alaska, so shipping was about $**, but it was still cheaper than buying at my local furniture store. These are a great deal, very sturdy, and look amazing. I highly recommend them.", 
    "These stools were exactly what I was looking for. Compact, sturdy, so easy to move around with one hand while sweeping and mopping. The price is great too! I purchased 6 of the vintage finish and they have been the best purchase for our large breakfast bar/island.",

    "Great quality and good looking", 
    "I'm absolutely in love with these stools! They were such a good price, but I don't feel I had to compromise on quality or style at all. They came ready to use, no installation required. They've survived many meals, parties, and even one move without any problems and I've gotten tons of compliments on them. If you're looking for this style stool BUY THESE NOW!", 
    "These stools are so light, practical, sturdy & great looking! I bought the vintage color. I have 3 kids and these are so easy to clean and for them to move around. Perfect for what I was looking for! I didn't havr a lot of space so these are great for small spaces. My counters are 37\" high, work great! Great stool, great price! No shipping...you can't go wrong & I got them super fast!",

    "These are really cute and vintage inspried.", 
    "very sturdy and great quality. practical as we use them not only for a chair, but also as a step stool. well worth the money! buyer beware there is a bit of discolor in the finish. i like it but, if you're looking for the perfect finish, this isn't your chair.",

    "The vintage color is really dark, like oil rubbed bronze. I returned them bc they were not what I was expecting", 
    "We are in the process of remodeling our home and we chose to have these bar stools in our kitchen. They no only look good but they are very comfortable and get this...They stack beautifully. I love it! This way we can store them away when they are not needed and they don't take up much room. They are perfect for us. You should try them too.", 
    "We have a 37.5 inch tall countertop in the kitchen and the stools are about 5 inches shorter than I wanted. That being said, we like the look and the functionality of bar stools so we kept them.", 
    "They arrived in a timely manner and the packaging was superior.Pulled them out of the box and set them out. Loved the \"vintage\" look, the color is more of a bronze which was perfect.", 
    "We just recieved these stools and so far love them. I am looking forward to using them more and seeing h ow comfortable they will be. They look great.", 
    "These stools are affordable and stylish! We absolutely love them in our new kitchen. The only drawback is that they are a bit cold now that winter is here! :-)", 
    "I was exceptionally happy with these stools. I purchased them for our patio bar", 
    "Bought these a year ago but returned them thinking they might be uncomfy & cold. A year later went to a restaurant that had these and sat on one for almost 3 hours over dinner. Turned out they were SUPER comfy and still loved the beautiful styling. Bought them right away when I got home and have been happy since.", 
    "The gun metal finish looks perfect in my kitchen! It added the final touches to my bar to give it the bistro look.", 
    "I knew I wanted stools of this design, and these have perfectly met my expectations. They have a great vintage/industrial look that pairs well with our white kitchen and butcher block countertop. The stools are comfortable and sturdy, but light enough to move around easily. They also stack very well. They arrived quickly and were well-packaged.", 
    "Look much more expensive than I paid! \"Vintage look\" was done perfectly - mine were not too splotchy at all. Super fast shipping and no assembly required were added bonuses. Would recommend!", 
    "I order 2 sets (4 chairs) for my new kitchen. I changed my style to a rustic look and these chairs were perfect!", 
    "The packaging did the job. Came in with no noticeable flaw. It is not heavy as I expected as some reviews have stated but it isn't light either. I was expecting a solid chunk of metal. The footrest looks like it could bend if a grown man was to stand on it. Other than those complaints, this counter stool is perfect. Matches our appliances and overall quality and comfort is good. Saw something at a designer furniture store x3 the price. I'm a big Overstock fan now!", 
    "Overall great stools for our kitchen counters. Love the color and the fact that you can stack them. I highly recommend these!", 
    "These counter stools are the perfect height for our counters. Our kids love being able to sit and enjoy time in the kitchen while I am cooking. They are comfy and well made.", 
    "Purchased these stools to go in the home we are renovating and are decorating in a vintage industrial style decor. They look great and the price was right. I also like the fact that they are on a smaller scale so I could fit 4 stools at my 6 ft island where most stools would only fit 3. The built in handle makes them so easy to move around.Very happy with purchase.", 
    "Totally cute! Mine were in great shape, and don't wobble at all! So many compliments. I ordered the gunmetal color, and they're great.", 
    "Got these stools and matching bench for my kitchen. They are perfect, nothing negative to say about them.", 
    "I love, love, LOVE my bar stools! I searched online for this specific stool and found the finish I wanted on this site as well as a great price. I pulled them out of the box when they arrived and it was love at first sight. The stools are represented well on this site. The gunmetal finish is beautiful and wipes off super easy. They are lightweight and easy to move around, even for my young children, yet are very sturdy- I've used them to stand on as well. If you purchase these stools, you will not regret it!", 
    "These are just as pictured. They're sturdy, stackable and stylish - love them!", 
    "Great customer service. Quick shipping. Quality product at an affordable cost.", 
    "These chairs exceeded my expectations, one of the best purchases I've made over the internet. The style, quality, sturdiness are fantastic. I was worried about the color from other reviews, but mine are bronze as described and the finish is not splotchy at all. They are not at all wobbly and no assembly!", 
    "Great looking stools and comfortable. Perfect counter height. Some areas look dented or like the paint job went wrong, but it is not really noticeable unless you look very closely. Perhaps it was an attempt to make them look \"vintage\".", 
    "These barstools are just what I was looking for! They are perfect for kids because they're easy to wipe off. They have rubber feet so they don't scratch up my wood floors. The color is as shown. Love them!", 
    "Looked exactly like the picture. Nice and sturdy stools. Very nice!", 
    "These are great. I got four. I felt that the images were true to color. They are much lighter than I expected which was a very pleasant surprise.", 
    "These stools are great quality, BUT not quite what I was expecting. More of a bronze color, kind of modern. I returned with no problems at all. OS customer service is outstanding. I am waiting for new ones to arrive in its place from OS!!", 
    "Happy with this purchase. We've purchased these stools in multiples now, using them for breakfast bar and, while looking for the perfect pieces of furniture, even as bed stands.", 
    "I'm absolutely thrilled with these stools. I bought 4 for my kitchen island. Well made to hold up to my 4 kids, yet stylish too.", 
    "This is an awesome value in a stool, they are sturdy, stylish and completely functional. I bought the vintage color which has sorta a bronze look to it, mine had some \" burnishing marks' left over from the manufacturing , but the OS customer service took care of the issue right way. Thee stools sit next to wooden stools around a counter and look great, the handle on top makes moving them around very smile, they are some what light in weight but feel secure , they are braced well in all the right places. I will be purchasing more.", 
    "I bought these as a gift for friends who just started a new business. First of all, they came packaged better than any large and heavy item that I've ever had shipped to me. There was no way for them to get damaged in transit. The stools were exactly as described. They look great. My friends loved them and get many compliments on them.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect height for my butcher countertop.", 
    "Shipped in two days, already put together! Always get compliments on the stools, because they are awesome!!!", 
    "They look just as pictured. I love them and would recommend them.", 
    "Counter high model - perfect for extra seating for party hosting. If you have a large backside, these won't work that comfortably but I tied on some thin flexible el cheapo dining cushions from K-Mart in red and that allowed for a softer sit and a bit more real estate for seat. : ) Used them w/ counter high table and people also took them out on porch. I shopped around and these were a great price - they come in different finishes also but this color was the least expensive. They do look 'cool' and think they would blend in any room...I purchased four, very happy.", 
    "Very durable, light, and elegant. Highly recommend them", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for. Very sturdy, great color.", 
    "I absolutely love these! Ordered these for our camp as I am going for the retro feel and doing it on the 'cheap.' These were a great value, very sturdy and very shabby chic! I am even thinking of ordering 2 more!", 
    "Great value and superior quality. They stack neatly for storage and clean easily with a damp cloth.", 
    "i just received my new stools and could not be happier. they are of great quality, love the vintage look, blends very well with my farmhouse decor. I would highly recommend these stools to anyone, you will be happy with your purchase.", 
    "These stools are exactly as pictured and described by the other reviews! Perfect for replacing my old wooden stools to update my kitchen. We did have to hammer the rubber protectors in to get them level and it worked!! Can't wait to get rid of the wooden ones!", 
    "Great product, sturdy and good looking. Will withstand the abuse of my children.", 
    "These stools are great for the price, true to color, the hole in the top makes it easy to carry around. Love it that they are already assembled and ready to go. No worrying about the screws coming loose, like with wooden stools which seemed to always need tightening. Only thing I noticed was they were a little cold to sit on at times, so I purchase comfy bar stool covers which fixed that and added some color!", 
    "I have the chairs and bar stools. These are beautiful and sturdy. Definitely buy again.", 
    "These stools were exactly what I was looking for - modern/industrial/vintage. Designer look at a lower cost! You see them in magazines and on websites everywhere. I prefer these to the ones available locally in my town because they are sturdier and have a nicer design. They look great at my counter (black granite with light gray walls) and are comfortable to sit on. No problems with uneven legs and the rubber caps on the bottom keep the stools from scratching my stained concrete floors. Wish they came in singles though because I'd like three at my counter. I highly recommend them!", 
    "Great price, great look, very sturdy! I recommend these wholeheartedly!", 
    "Stools are perfect for my low kitchen counter. Solid one piece construction required no assembly. Very sturdy.", 
    "We ordered a pair of these- they look great and are very sturdy- they hold up well to our little one. I was worried that they would be lightweight and could tip easily but they are substantial without being too heavy to move.", 
    "Product has exceeded expectations, and fits very well into my decor. The finish on the stools has depth and character that are unique. I only use three stools around my bar and use the fourth stool as an end table and it looks great.", 
    "My only complaint is that the stools are cold! Not much can be done about that since they are metal:)", 
    "Awesome classic look. Perfect in my kitchen, which is open to my dining area, where I used the tabouret vintage dining chairs with a gorgeous west elm starburst oval table.", 
    "perfect fit for our kitchen island. I like the metal look and feel, though the welds are not completely ground/sanded/finished--they look a bit rough> but for the money they are great stools", 
    "These barstools are so pretty, practical, and functional. I love the fact that they can be stacked.", 
    "So satisfied with this purchase! They look exactly the same as the photo. Good quality, light but sturdy. There are some imperfections in the polish/coating but I think it makes it look more unique, which fits the style we were going for.", 
    "these 24' stools are great if you're looking for something in a fun color to add to your counter. the color is exactly as it is shown in the photos and the stools seem pretty sturdy. i am only giving 4 stars since i've had them less than 24 hours but from what i can tell, i think they will last for a long time. really happy that i purchased 4 stools total.", 
    "The stools arrived quickly and looked great. You get the vintage industrial look for a price you can't beat.", 
    "I love these stools! I just remodeled my kitchen and added a small counter-height island. I've been looking for COMPACT stools with a decent-sized seat that can hold up a man without having to worry that they're going to break!. These are great! They are sturdy, and I love the rubber bottoms that protect my hardwood floor. And yet, they are lightweight, which is another plus. The slot in the center of the seat makes them easy to move around too. The price is very good. Overall, a very good deal.", 
    "Comfortable, functional and unusual. These are great and easy for both old and young to sit comfortably at our kitchen counter. Easy to move around too because of the open handle at top of stool. Color is more bronze than silver.", 
    "These are sturdy, good looking stools. The color is a bit bronze... lovely in the right room.", 
    "Beyond our expectations. Sleek, solid, fabulous. Highly recommended.", 
    "We are very happy with our counter height stools and plan on purchasing two more. The are very stable and we think we will get years of use out of them. The price is right too!", 
    "These are a great set of chairs for the price. Exactly the same as what you get at the high end stores for half the price. I bought these because I wanted stools that could take a beating by my three year old son. As he grows out of his seek and destroy phase I can replace these with something softer and then use these for outdoor chairs. I think I will have them forever! And I actually plan to buy another set soon.", 
    "Great purchase...shipped quickly, and packaged well. We absolutely love the color. It's pretty true to the picture. The finish is a little distressed, as others noted, so of you're expecting a very clean, polished look, this probably isn't the stool for you. It has a flat, non-glossy finish, which I think adds to the character and contemporary design of the stool. 3 of them fit well at our moderately sized kitchen island. You really can't go wrong, and they are neutral enough to go with a wide range of decor.", 
    "These stools are super stylish and matched the decor of my kitchen perfectly. I had been searching high and low for something that was both functional, beautiful, AND wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg. The price for this pair is unbelievably reasonable yet the quality is not compromised in any way. I couldn't be happier.", 
    "Bought these to have extra set of stools for the kitchen table when friends were over. They stack on top of each other for storage, no assembly required (always a bonus) sturdy, great pewter industrial color. I even use them in my garage at my work bench. Great purchase!", 
    "These are by far cheaper than the original designs you might find at stores. Visually you cannot tell the difference. Physically they are a little thinner and may be susceptible to dents and marks, but that is part of their charm. The stools were packaged well and unmarked. However, the colouring did have some marks and stains on them. It's part of the effect but it's very evident that this effect is just applied by bare hand while the coating on them is still soft. Finger prints and hand prints from the makers of these stools can be clearly spotted in areas and are permanent. No amount of buffing can remove these marks. It's all part of that rustic finish. This bothers me on one of the stools I received as it's on the top and very visible and kinda looks like a poop stain. Since these are cheap as far as stools go, I am choosing to live with it. My guests can sit on that one. With that said, I still feel if you buy anything else that looks like these and paid more you are a sucker.", 
    "The picture is accurate to the product. The color is nice, a sort of brown/copper color but not too bright/metallic. They are sturdy and I love that it has rubber caps on the legs so it doesn't scratch whatever surface it's on. The only \"complaint\" I have, which is hardly a complaint, is that they can be pretty cold. Not the best feeling when you first wake up in the morning. Cushions would be an easy fix, I just don't like the look of cushions. I LOVE LOVE LOVE these stools!", 
    "Authentic looking metal stools that have both an industrial and vintage vibe to them. Well worth the cost, and very versatile.", 
    "Good quality and a reasonable price. I like the vintage industrial look and these fit the bill. The colour presented on the website was accurate.", 
    "I ordered one set just to see if I liked the color (which I LOVED... the dark steel color). I ordered a second set since I need 4 total, and the second set arrived in an ugly aluminum color! Since this is final sale, I'm stuck with two stools I definitely don't want. Overstock is now out of the darker color, so I'll have to shop around somewhere else to find them. As for the make/quality/sturdiness of the stools, they are very nice. Just wish the second set had arrived in the correct color!", 
    "I ordered 4, 2 of them came with slightly bent legs (which I worried over time would get worse), overstock was sold out but I contacted the original seller and they sent replacements right away. Love these stools!", 
    "We are pleased with these bar stools. We have 3 small children and these stools are great. They are very sturdy and safe for the kids to climb on and off and move easily. They also wipe clean very easily and don't show fingerprints or grunge.. We bought 6 and one had a glob of what looked to be extra varnish on it. Overstock responded immediately and sent us a replacement stool. Very pleased with the customer service. The only complaint is the bottom rung where you rest your feet is narrow and not very comfortable if you are not wearing shoes. Otherwise comfortable to sit on.", 
    "We have had these beautiful wrought iron, very expensive bar stools with backs on them & dining set for several years. we decided to go with something totally different. We saw these kind of retro chairs & bar stools with no back shopping in San Luis Obisbo, CA and really liked them so we went to overstaock & found the same ones for a much better price. We ordered them & have really been happy with them. We can just slip into these bar stools and they are not heavy and bulky like our wrought iron ones.", 
    "This stool is exactly what I was looking for. They're light weight, but sturdy. Great for sitting at the island in the kitchen, and also standing on them to reach a high shelf. They don't scoot easily, so I'm not afraid of them sliding out from under us. Great product for a great value!", 
    "I ordered 4 stools and I love them! They were packaged in a way so they don't scratch each other. I love that they stack together. My kids handle them great. They're light weight and easy to move around with the cut out handle on top. They sometimes appear to be dingy brown, depending on the sunlight. I'm just so happy to have found this color! I didn't want a shinny chrome and I didn't want to have to just go with black. I love being able to add more metal to the decor instead of more wood.", 
    "I have only had for a few weeks but I love these stools. You can't find a better value anywhere else. My friend got the same ones and referred the link to these for me. I am going to be ordering more chairs for my dining room from Overstock bc they made it so easy and the price is excellent.", 
    "These bar stools are really great. The simple metal design and vintage color bring a nice industrial, slightly rustic feel to my kitchen and the price is unbeatable. I think the stools are actually pretty comfortable too, considering there is no cushion or back. Our family of six eats most of our meals at our kitchen island and I have no complaints about these bar stools. They wipe off easily. They tuck under the counter top so they don't take up any extra room when they aren't in use. They are sturdy and they come with rubber bumpers on the bottom of the legs so I don't have to worry about scratching my hardwood floors or adding floor pads to them. And of course, they look great! Also, they shipped out quickly and arrived at my home less than a week after I placed my order. Definitely recommend with no reservations.", 
    "Great price, great stool for a smaller area. I also love tat these stools do not have the plasticky coating you get on some metal finish items.", 
    "Solid, handsome stools that look fantastic in my kitchen. I got the color between the silver and black (I forgot the name of the color) and am very happy. Goes fantastic with stainless appliances. I bought two counter height stools for my counter seating area. Love them. The other colors look great. What I loved, too, was that no work was involved. Take them out of the box and go. Would recommend highly to everyone.", 
    "We have been looking at stools for about two years for our house, but wanted something smaller and stackable. I'd looked at similar stools on Overstock and had considered red, shiny metal and a few others. However, when I saw these, I finally bought. I liked the look of the color online and thought they would go well with my decor. These are perfect.", 
    "Very sturdy stools. I did not get a description on the color but picture was accurate in color. Very happy with my purchase.",
