    "The Good: Styling is great and it is very easy to follow the directions. Arrived in a secure box that showed some wear but the product was safe.The Okay: Product looks more of a light cream color vs. bright white. Its not country/antique white but it is something to be aware of.The Bad: It was a little difficult for a few of the locking screws to secure and as a result I had to rebuild an entire drawer twice. One of the rods that holds the hanging folders kept falling out of its hole a little crazy glue in the holes will easily hold this in place.Value to Hassel ratio 7.5 out 10 .", 
    "It is a beautiful addition in our home office. It arrives quickly. The book case is nicely made and it is sturdy. The assembly instruction is easy to understand, you can put the whole thing together fairly quickly. Definitely will recommend to friend.", 
    "I love it, love it, and love it! I wish I had bought two instead of one. Although there were quite a handful of pieces to work with, the instructions were very helpful in constructing the file cabinet. It can be placed in a bedroom or living room like a piece of furniture rather than just an office fixture. With a very nice finish and excellent drawers, I would recommend this product to anyone in need of a very fashionable file cabinet.", 
    "Not sure why some reviewers said the assembly of this product was easy. My husband is very intelligent and capable, but it took him a long time to assemble this. What's worse is that the quality of this product is awful. Every step of the assembly process, we encountered issues and kept telling ourselves to try to ignore it until it was just too much. (Problems include: the feet do not align at 90 degree angles; the bottoms of the drawers are extremely flimsy; the drawers don't slide easily and they do not sit flush to the cabinet.) I returned this item as it is, for all intents and purposes, defective. I would not recommend this to anyone.", 
    "I wouldn't have bought this if I new it was cream!! I put it to the side of my white desk in our bedroom so it is obviously NOT WHITE!!", 
    "Took a while to put together. Nice file cabinet. Drawers slide easily, looks great.", 
    "This looks really good when assembled. I had some trouble but eventually got it together. It is pretty sturdy and fits my needs. It's in my bedroom and looks like furniture.", 
    "really love this product .", 
    "Product is okay. Drawers wobble a bit and you must never have both drawers open at the same time or it will tip over. Be careful.", 
    "Love it. Use it as an end table so multifunctional. Shows beautifully.", 
    "I am still in the process of assembling this piece, but overall it seems like a good quality product. The wood is sturdy, but there are A LOT of screws. The directions are pretty easy to follow, but it's time consuming. My biggest complaint is that a portion of the directions that refer to the metal sliders is called F1 and F2 in the directions, but were simple labeled N in my packaging. So they are only one piece and I can't seem to detach the one part of the metal slider to be able to screw on side into the panel of the drawer and the other into the main frame. Waiting for my husband to get home now so he can hold up the drawer while I screw it in place.", 
    "I have a small home office in one area of my bedroom and did not want a metal file cabinet that looked like your average file cabinet. This cabinet is perfect. It could easily pass as a fine piece of furniture, could be used as a night stand and it matches my white desk and chair perfectly. The white color is crisp and clean looking and the silver handles are stylish and decorative and the sturdy legs add to the overall look. The drawers fit perfectly and glide in and out quietly and smoothly. They do open all the way. We had no trouble with the drawer guides as some reviewers wrote and easily snapped them apart. It does come in many pieces but the directions are detailed step by step and my daughter and I had no trouble putting it together. Takes a while but it is well worth it! I couldn't be more pleased!! Note: This item shipped the same day I ordered it and was on my front porch the next day, well packaged and no damage!!", 
    "This filing cabinet is beautiful. It is easy to assemble and fits letter-sized files. It is a wonderful addition to our home office and looks significantly better than any of the metal cabinets you so often find in stores.", 
    "I would recommend this filing cabinet if you are looking for a 2 drawer cabinet but would like something nicer looking thana metal file. It does need to be put together but the directions were very clear and I was able todo it without any assistance from my husband. It took a little patience, but it comes out nice.The drawers open smoothly and there is plenty of roomI am using this file in a home office and I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Be ready to spend time putting this together! A cordless screwdriver proved helpful. Bummer that it wasn't more put together before shipping it to customers", 
    "i just love this cute little cabinet. love it! love it!", 
    "Way too complicated to put together. For $*** this was a disappointment, plus the quality of the product leaves a lot to be desired. The drawers don't stay closed and something had to be inserted under the front feet. Overpriced, you can do much better than this.,", 
    "Luckily my wonderful husband put it together for me, you know how long it takes when a filing cabinet comes in a flat box!", 
    "I purchased two of these in black, they're very good looking and don't have the look of your average file cabinet. My only complaint is they are not very easy to put together", 
    "Perfect for my home office, good quality, I purchased black and love it. Assembly was 10 minutes tops. It is a sturdy cabinet. .", 
    "Functional, drawers slide great, just takes awhile to put together.", 
    "Ok, so my dad helped me put this together but everything was labeled, all parts were there and with my assistance, (kind of like me being an OR assist to his surgeon saying \"scalpel\") we put it together in about an hour and a half. He didn't complain one time! It isn't just cute- this is a solid piece of furniture. It looks expensive and I love it. Now if they would just make a matching corner desk I would be stoked! I definitely recommend it!", 
    "Good quality. Not great. Lots of parts but easy enough to put together. Looks great!", 
    "works as expected and was easy to put together.", 
    "looks good, relatively easy to assemble, need to keep the back to a wall for appearance purposes, it works well and does the job", 
    "Took a bit to put together, but does what its suppose to do and looks good in my living space.", 
    "These look nice, but they were a pain to put together and the top and bottom drawers rub against eachother.", 
    "I would have ranked it higher but I had a BIG problem with the metal pieces that links the draw with the frame. Under NO circumstance do you follow the direction and separate the two metal pieces. Its hard to put back together, instead keep them together and have someone hold up draw while you drill draw and frame. It took three weeks and company providing extra pieces to me to figure that out. Dont disconnect pieces as directions states. Drill to unit. But piece is lovely once I figured that out.", 
    "I'm new to ordering furniture online and when file cabinet came in white instead of black as I ordered, I thought oh no, never again. Sent a message to customer service and they quickly sent return label and reordered black one. Thumbs up! Black cabinet just what I needed as a side table in bedroom that does double duty. Looks great! Better than I thought for the price. Hubby says it was the hardest piece to put together (we have since ordered 2 side tables, sofa table, cabinet etc).", 
    "This white 2 drawer filing cabinet was perfect for my home office. I recently moved and my larger desk with filing drawers did not fit in the new space and I had to use a smaller desk. Therefore, I needed a new filing drawer system. This was perfect. I read the reviews that it sometimes toppled over, however, I have a marble chess set on top of the cabinet, and that seems to weigh it down just fine.", 
    "Cabinet looks nice. Nice addition to office furniture. Instructions not so easy.", 
    "easy to put together. holds a lot of files looks really good excellent value for the money", 
    "I felt the written directions and illustrations were not well done and made assembly more difficult than it should have been.", 
    "I ordered the 2-drawer in white hoping I could get something more stylish than the metal one I had before. This was my first Overstock purchase. I didn't realize it would have to be assembled once I received it... should have researched a little better. It was put together with out too much trouble. The drawers open and close very soft and it seems sturdy. I liked it so much I ordered the 4-drawer (sorry husband - one more thing to assemble). I would buy another if I need another 2 drawer.", 
    "I thought two to put my printer on top . Unfortunately, both do not match . The drawers don't pull out very well . Rather then taking them apart and returning I will keep them .", 
    "Not wood and the slides are inexpensive which makes the drawers difficult to close. The piece is lightweight and slides on wood floors when drawers are difficult to close...", 
    "I bought the cabinet in ivory and it looks really cute - not cheap at all. I took one star away, because as the other reviewers noted it is pretty difficult to put together. Not rocket science, but I definitely had moments of confusion. Delivery was quick and painless. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "Nice piece. Quality is good", 
    "Assembly can take a while, but they are very sturdy and look wonderful", 
    "I needed an end table and a file cabinet. This fit the bill. Directions are pretty good, but be sure you get the sides on the correct side...these could be marked better. Wasted a few hours due to mix up! I like the cabinet and it serves it's purpose. Great deal for the price.", 
    "Looks nice, but it came in too many pieces. I had to hire someone to put it together.", 
    "Nice filing cabinet, easy to put together.", 
    "Good product, pretty easy to assemble, and pretty as well.", 
    "After reading some of the posts about how hard this was to put together, I decided to order this any way. I found it quite easy to put together if you pay attention to the directions and don't go on auto-pilot. As for quality it works fine for what I needed, is it a high end office filing cabinet, no, but who wants that in a home office?", 
    "Does not look like a file cabinet, which is an added bonus. Was kind of difficult to put together, but overall I am pleased with it.", 
    "love the modern look. looks great in my home office.", 
    "Hard to put together but looks lovely. I got the white.", 
    "excellent, quality is fantastic. I get a lot of oohs and aahs.", 
    "Looks nice, but a pain in the *** to assemble. Do not undertake without the help of an engineer, and certainly not by yourself with any amount of wine. I wound up installing the drawer mounts backwards, so the doors do not close all the way, but honestly, I could care less. I couldn't bear the thought of spending another hour of my life trying to assemble it. 3 hours later, I have a semi-working file cabinet. If you look at it head-on, you can barely tell."
