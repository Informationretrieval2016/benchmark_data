    "Very good looking, they just don't feel very sturdy. Color is spot on. Ordered two of them for extra seating in my living room. Kind of worried about how long they will last.", 
    "Nice chair, easy assembly, and comfortable. Be cautious of the height, it is quite short.", 
    "Very nice chair. Great color.", 
    "Nice and sturdy and definitely cannot beat the price. I think the fabric looks different than pictured but feels like great quality/color. I ordered a second one bc I was impressed! Perfect simple chair and will look even better with a bright pillow to dress it up....", 
    "The bottom fabric did not have slits to put the legs on, so we had to cut holes in the fabric on the bottom of the chair. The legs were not easy to put on the chair. We love the look of the chair now that is has been assembled."
