    "This is a lovely little console table for the price. It's a clean & contemporary piece you would probably pay 3xs for if purchased locally. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the quality of the finish on the drawers is a bit less than desirable. There is a seam running horizontally across both drawers that is not finished properly. I knew before purchasing the table that this was MDF. The rest of the table is finished beautifully & unless you were really looking, it would appear to be solid wood. However, this seam totally gives away the fact that it's cheap MDF/particle board. The seam across the drawers is completely unfinished & you can see the wood particles are glued together. Even though the MDF showing through the seam is dark, it is unfinished & not the same black satin finish as the rest of the table. The good news is that it's really only noticeable during the day as I have a very bright house. When the sun goes down and the lights are dimmed, you can't tell at all. I would still buy the piece again and would not let the seam deter me from making the purchase. This is just a small issue that should be addressed with the manufacturers quality control. Also, this piece says assembly required.....you bet you posterior it requires assembly! Haha....my poor husband was on his hands & knees for about 2 hours in the garage. This thing needs to be fully assembled, I'm talking wood glue and all. If you don't have someone handy to put this together for you, you may want to think again. Other than that, a lovely little piece. The storage space in both drawers is more than adequate. I'm using it as a small buffet/bar and it's perfect for the space.", 
    "Nice table but it took two intelligent men QUITE some time to put it together.", 
    "Such a great understated piece that I just keep turning my head to look at. So simple, modern, lovely and fresh. The matte finish is perfect and the storage space in the drawers is plentiful. I plan to add boxes or baskets for the space under the table or not. It's just fantastic. All the pieces were clearly marked and directions even I could follow. Two people are needed to complete it. Gosh but it's so just right in size, height and style. You can't go wrong with this piece!", 
    "This sofa table is the perfect fit behind my crimson-colored sectional furniture. I put two tall lamps on it and it's perfect. The table arrived in a week. It took my husband a couple of hours to assemble but he said it wasn't difficult at all. I didn't hear him complain about the instructions either. I really like it that it has two deep drawers for storage. It is not real wood but the finish looks like wood and it is a very \"modern\" accent piece. I am very pleased.", 
    "directions on how to assemble had several errors with stickers placed on incorrect parts. Also handle came in broken.", 
    "This is in our living room. It's not high quality, but it's nice for the money. It's pretty lightweight (moveable) which is nice. I love it. Bought it to look good and it does. Love the dark espresso with the chrome bottom", 
    "If you're deciding to whether to buy this.........DO IT!!! We put this in our entrance and it just adds that modern flare and the piece stands out. I have been debating for a year now whether to get this or not and I am not sorry I did.", 
    "Nice modern look. Easy to assemble. Looks great in my family room. Great product, reasonably priced.", 
    "Nice piece for the money. Great for entry way drawers hold a lot and are very deep, but would not put anything to heavy in them. Well packed.", 
    "This piece is a nice sturdy item, a bit of a challenge to put together. Works well for my staging company. Its a color/style that will work from a traditional to a modern home.", 
    "This console table is satisfactory - the drawers are ok - have holes as pulls - didn't really like that but it was ok for where we put it.", 
    "the quality is not that good but the look is great", 
    "Modern looking with good sized drawers. Assembly similar IKEA products.", 
    "This console table looks great in the family. I was looking for a table to put a music system and storage for media. The larger drawer is huge and plenty of room for media and since I needed to put it on a wall where there was a vent, the open base was perfect! 2 lovely baskets underneath give it a complete warmth. Very happy with this table!", 
    "I bought this console table for the entryway/foyer of my home. I needed a place to put down mail, phones, keys, purses, etc as I was coming in the house. This table is very functional in that regard. It looks pretty nice - nothing fancy. It took me a good 4 hours to build. Instructions were minimal, but not impossible to figure out. I made a mistake midpoint and at the end had to disassemble parts of it to correct it, so that was rather painful. I will point out that the two drawers are not equal in size. I didn't know that looking at the pictures online. However, it doesn't look bad. The table itself is pretty solid, but the drawer bottoms are rather thin pieces so I'm not sure how much weight they can hold. All in all I'm satisfied. It is a useful piece of furniture.", 
    "The table looks fine, almost like in the picture. But it is poorly made, *** - type construction. But you can get 8-drawer dresser in *** for this price, which is made out of more expensive materials. Beware, the construction is so poor, you need to have some furniture assembly experience before touching this piece. If you accidentally drive a screw into at a wrong angle, you will most likely see the bump on the opposite side of the console surface! You can put this console together only once, no reassembling and putting it back together when you decide to move it to another house or apartment! Forget about it! It will fall apart! Once it is assembled, it's better to leave as it is. And remember, there are only 2 (two), not 4 drawers in this console! It says in specifications that there are only two, but I wasn't as attentive as I should be and was expecting 4 small drawers instead of two big ones.", 
    "Unless you have several hours to put together all this stuff I would not purchase, when it stated assembly required, it means from the ground up. What a waste and unfortunately I bought 4 other pieces that are sitting in my garage needing to be all put together."
