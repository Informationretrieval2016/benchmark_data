    "The cabinet seems to hold my stuff, for now anyway. Took about 4 hours to put together by my brother in law who is a carpenter and welder so he knows what he is doing. The holes put into the cabinet to line up when drilling make the doors lopsided and the doors have a large slit in the middle and don't line up. Looks ok and holds what I have put in it so far but I wouldn't buy it again", 
    "The Cabinet was not packaged properly. The screws were all over the place in the box they all fell out as soon as i opened the box. Corners of the cabinet were chipped. Thankfully were not on the outside where it would face out so i decided not to return. But it was disappointing that a lot of the pieces of wood were chipped.", 
    "It is a nice looking cabinet. It is very sturdy and well put together. I was worried that it would not be of good quality but I was wrong."
