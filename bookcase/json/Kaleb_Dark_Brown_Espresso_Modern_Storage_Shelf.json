    "Very modern and up to date. May be used as a room divider, bookcase, or storage.", 
    "I was going for a contemporate\\modern piece and this book shelf matched my other furniture. I love it. Only downside is that it's made on cheap composite wood.", 
    "Excellent for the price. Sturdy and looked like the picture. Does not look cheap. The only reason I did not give 8t five stars was that there was a scratch on one of the shelves. I recommend this product.", 
    "Bought this to display a teenagers bobble-head collection. It looks great in his room! Was easy to put together, seems really sturdy!", 
    "Very beautiful elegant and good as a stand alone piece!", 
    "Love it, good looking and easy to put together by myself", 
    "Perfect size for the living room", 
    "not very good quality compare to other storage shelf that I bought on overstock. very thin wood, easy to scratchespresso color does look as nice compare to the photo.", 
    "It is a bit darker than in the photo but the cappucino with the steel makes it look good. The assembly took almost 2.5 hrs. It was hard to decipher some of the stampings on the wood pieces. Once put together it is strong and firm.", 
    "This is a wonderful piece for storing or displaying items of all sizes. Easy to assemble."
