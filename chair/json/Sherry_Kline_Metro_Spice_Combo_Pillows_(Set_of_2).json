    "I got this set to go with the two 18\" pillows of the same design. The colors are perfect for pulling many room elements together. The variety in sizes add style and interest. The only thing I would change is how light the pillows are. A heavier fill material would add a richer feel in actually using them for back or arm support in a chair. Overall, I am satisfied with what they add to the room.",

    "Great buy. Really nice throw pillows. Exactly as pictured.", 
    "I shopped far and wide for pillows to match my living area. The colors are vibrant and intense. The photo really does not capture at all the gorgeous texture of the fabric - a mixture of what looks like silk and velour with beautiful threading on the front and solid brown microsuede on the back. They look nice at each end of our cream sofa and also stacked at one end and if you wish, you can set the pillows pattern out on one, and the solid out on the other if you want a change. The filling is plump and even, making them very comfortable. And they are made of high quality so I have no worries there. Delivery was super quick! This was my second Overstock purchase and both times I was extremely pleased with my purchase.", 
    "Very attractive pillows. Not recommended for someone who has a family member who is rough on pillows and furniture. Meaning not made for someone who likes to mash and squish pillows into different shapes while in use.", 
    "I was looking all over for accent pillows to go with me new livingroom suite and these were the right style and fit.", 
    "I bought two sets of these for my office. They are way better than I was expecting! Beautiful, great quality, great price, and made in the USA.",

    "The go well with our decor and are nicely made, we should have them a long time!", 
    "The pillows are a perfect compliment to my living room decor and furniture. There is also an area rug available in this pattern which I am seriously considering purchasing!", 
    "I debated on these pillows for a couple of weeks because even though they were the colors I wanted, I couldn't decide if I really liked them. I finally ordered them and they arrived today. When I opened the box, I couldn't believe how beautiful and classy looking these pillows are. The picture doesn't do them justice at all! The colors are very rich and the quality is amazing. I can't stop looking at them!! If these are colors you need, then get these pillows. You won't be disappointed. Overstock, you have made my home so much prettier with all the great things I have ordered from you!!!", 
    "These pillows are beautifully made. The colors are a little deeper than shown, but work well for me.",

    "Nice quality pillows, well worth the money, colors are vibrant just like the picture!", 
    "perfect accent for my merlot colored leather couch and chair. The larger pillow was a bit smaller than expected but works out well. Love the accent colors it brings into the room. Made well.", 
    "Great pillows. Great price. I do wish mine had more red on them since they are going on a red couch. I have no green circles with red in the middle like on both pillows in the photo. But very high quality, nice fabric.", 
    "These pillows were a perfect gift for my brother and his wife matched the sofa perfectly, and very comfy pillows!! They loved them.. Price was good.", 
    "In the photo, these pillows look to have a dark green background; it's really more of a brown--not what I'd hoped for.", 
    "Pillows look exactly like pictures. Appear to be good quality. Would re order", 
    "These pillows are very nice, the fabric is true to the items description. They are not too large and the two different sizes and shapes work well with each other. The fact they are made in the USA was a big factor for me. I got two sets for the sofa and I am very happy with the purchase.", 
    "I purchased these pillows to give as a gift to my daughter. I loved them as soon as I saw them and felt the vivid but not at all garish colors would look great on her dark brown leather love seat and chair. She agreed as soon as she saw them and called me later to confirm that they gave the room a fresh new look. Amazing but true that something as simple as a couple of pillows can do so much for the look of a room. One thing that should be mentioned is that the pillows were a little smaller than I expected. The measurements, as given, would be correct if the stuffing were out and the cover was laid flat so it's not false information. But when the stuffing plumps up the pillow the length and width are shortened a little. Not a problem for us but just be aware. Overall, though, love them and the price was so much better than any I saw in stores.", 
    "This colors on the pillows are not as bright as shown on the O site.", 
    "These pillows are great! They are well-described and look almost exactly like the picture. I thought there was some burgundy circles but they were more orange brown. But they coordinated very well anyway. The stitching is fine and I like the texture. They are firm and sturdy. The price was very good, considering most pillows are at least $25 a piece at Target and Pier One. Liked them so well the first time I bought another set right away!", 
    "Very well made and are also very comfortable. I know we will enjoy them for a long time", 
    "Color on site is sharper than actual pillow. The red on site is absolutely opposite to what you get. It looks like a wine color. Was lucky it worked for my living space", 
    "These pillows are a perfect match to my sofa and loveseat everybody wants them!", 
    "When I saw the pillows online, I was taken with the colors, but also afraid they might be \"too much!\" I took a chance, and when they came, the colors are much softer in person and they look great on our couches. They blend with everything and give a slight \"pop\" to the room. Have gottem 3 compliments so far. :) Also, love my lazy susan!! Looks great.", 
    "very nice good quality, colors are great nice and fluffy", 
    "These pillow are absolutely gorgeous! I love them and the colors were perfect! I get so many compliments! A must have, definitely recommend them to anyone! :)", 
    "These pillows are the perfect accent colors to my Espresso Coaches. The background color and the backside of the pillows are a chocolate brown. This works for me. :) I backed them with some gold, larger accent pillows and I love the look of my living room with these pillows.I highly recommend these!", 
    "Bought these to go with a new crimson sofa, hoping that they would bring it together with the camel and brown chairs and in our den. And here's the good part...bought them w/out consulting my wife! She LOVES them! They are not so large that they dominate the seating surface. The fabric is rich ( in color and quality). Very well made. Vivid, earthy tones go with green, gold ,crimson, brown, tan, etc., \"earthy\" palate! Can't go wrong with these.", 
    "This pillow turn out to be better than I thought. Very well made and pretty too! Reverse side is made with a soft faux suede and looks very rich. I've received many compliments on them and they look great on my couch! Thank you for having such a wonderful product to offer at a really good price!!", 
    "Loved the pillows. They go nicely with what I wanted. I did think they had more red, and werent quit as dark as they turned out to be.", 
    "I WAS PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE.THE PRODUCT WAS AS DECRIBED.I WOULD RECOMMEND OVERSTOCK TO MY FRIENDS.", 
    "The square pillow is more like 16\" square and the oblong is more like 16\"x12\". The question and answer area said the pattern is on both sides, the pattern is only on one side and the other is a solid brown. I like the colors but not as bright as the picture. I'll keep but only because the colors work....", 
    "Color and quality were great. Bought two sets to go on a brown leather couch. The colors are vibrant and pillows look great.", 
    "Received these pillows, and almost returned them, when I saw them, with the throw rug I already had. Was even chatting re: how to return, but as I was waiting, I took another look over at my , Cream colored, leather sofa. and realized, To keep the pillows and replace my old throw rug, under the coffee table/ bench. They are very superior/ classy looking, with great colors, Depending on what computer you are using, I have a Mac, and the colors shown were exactly as shown. The details, the color combo, etc, are well worth the $ if not more. Happy I decided to keep them! Now on with buying a new rug, This is one of those situations, when it is good I am not married :). I know me, I will buy the rug, and them I will have to replace something else, ha ha...", 
    "The pillows are more brown than anything with a small hint of red. It still compliments my red sofa however if I would have known that so much brown was in the pillows I would not have brought them. The quality is good and other wise I'm satisfied with the pillows.", 
    "Pillows look expensive and feel that way too.! When I held the computer up to the colors in the room they matched perfectly, was afraid they would clash when I received them. The colors were right on and tied all the colors in the room together. Very, very pleased with the pillows.", 
    "Ordering online can be scarry. I walked by the box twice, make my dinner, and finally decided to open said box and prepared myself to be disappointed. I pulled one out and with relief and excitement could only say, \"WOW\" they are perfect. I love them. I got the combo set and two that match the larger one in this set. The long pillow I placed on an overstuffed chair and the three on my couch, they look awesome. Fear not, order!", 
    "I love the colors in these pillows - they look great with our dark red leather couches and yellow/beige walls and the additional colors add great accents. They are also soft and comfortable. The only thing my husband doesn't like is that the covers are not removable for washing but I was going more for looks!", 
    "Pillow colors match the leather couch and chair perfectly", 
    "Great pillows. There was just much more brown than appeared. I expected more green. It would be better to show front and back of pillow, so brown is obvious. If you want a dominant brown color in your pillows, these are great.", 
    "These are beautiful pillows. It accents our colors exactly the way I wanted. They are a good quality. And----they are made in the USA. It is what I look for when I purchase products. Our country has the best quality.", 
    "I really like these pillows. They are of a very high quality. I recommend purchasing them."
