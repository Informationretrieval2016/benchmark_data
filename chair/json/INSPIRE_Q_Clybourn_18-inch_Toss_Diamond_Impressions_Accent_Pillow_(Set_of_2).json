    "These pillows are durable and attractive. I paired one with a matching slipper chair in the bedroom and tossed one onto the bed--nice.",

    "These pilows were flatter than expected.", 
    "worth their money Matches with my storage bench.", 
    "These pillows are soft and well made.", 
    "Well made match my sofa so beautifully", 
    "i purchased 4 pillows look great on sofa with chairs to match", 
    "Loved these throw pillows, came back and ordered the ottomon bench.", 
    "Nice padding. Wish fabric was a little softer to the touch", 
    "These are very nice pillows and I appreciate the fact that the fabric is upholstery grade, which you can't necessarily ascertain from a photo alone.", 
    "Nice pillows but would not recommend as there is not enough stuffing, they are flat. At the price I don't think I should have to go out and purchase filling.", 
    "Love these pillows! It matches the Ottoman/bench I purchased. I 'fluffed' the pillows after receiving them and they looked even better!", 
    "Great style and very well made pillows.", 
    "Nice pillows. Smaller than I thought. I bit on the expensive side, but good quality material.", 
    "Look great and are great quality! My only wish is that would be a little more stuffed.... Still would def get again and recommend", 
    "Very nice cover on pillow.Colors are not faded. Looks like it is from ************. Only concern is that pillows inside covers are not very full. However they unzip so more fill can be added", 
    "The pilliows are very atractive although not very flexible. They will do the job.", 
    "These pillows have exceeded my expectations. They are very well made, the covers are removable and fit snugly, the design is subtle but interesting and they enhance the look of our milk-chocolate brown sofa. Well worth the price. I will check this brand again when I need new throw pillows."
