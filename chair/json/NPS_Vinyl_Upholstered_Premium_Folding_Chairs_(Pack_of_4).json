    "I purchased the chairs for my daughter who just moved into her first apartment. She does not have a lot of seating available and was planning a house warming party. The chairs arrived quickly after I ordered them and were better than I expected. They are very comfortable and much nicer than unpadded chairs. I plan to order a set for my home and for my other daughter, because she loved them too. Thanks Overstock!",

    "We ordered these folding chairs to ensure we had extra seating an outdoor get-together. I was extremely pleased when we removed the set from the box. As always, with Overstock, they arrived quickly, too. And the chairs are just great. They look impressive and with the padded seating, they're really comfortable. I highly recommend this set of folding chairs.",
