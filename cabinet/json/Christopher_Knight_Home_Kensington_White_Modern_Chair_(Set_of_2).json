    "These chairs are great. I was hesitant about ordering white, but they clean very easily with MR Clean magic erasers, it wipes anything off of them for a bright white again. =) Careful in stacking them so that something underneath doesn't damage the upholstery. The high back is really nice, and the slight swooping seat is very comfortable for the legs and back. They look amazing in our modern dining room. I would order again! =)", 
    "The chairs are a good find - purchased 3 sets. The color is a real white. Esthetically a very nice, contemporary design. The seats aren't very comfortable in terms of padding. However they work well for dining occasions, if you're not going to be sitting for long periods. Fairly easy to assemble. However the pre-made holes in the seats don't all align with the chrome bases. Some are more centered than others. But not too noticeable.", 
    "I purchased 6 chairs for our dining room table, which needed a modern update. I am extremely pleased with the value and look of the chairs. Because they were such a great deal, I was afraid that the quality would be really disappointing. Aside from a few minor things (bolt cover not fitting etc.) the quality was much better than expected. I am very happy with the way it looks and would definitely recommend.", 
    "They look great, difficult to assemble. The back is some kind of crappy plastic I'm guessing that cracks and you can hear it when you bend back. It's a mess! If you have back problems don't buy these. I got these and and yawned while sitting in the chair with my arms up and crack-crack-crack-crack went the chair. Junk!", 
    "These chairs are so fabulous and for the price - they're a steal!!! The hardest part about putting these together was unwrapping them from the excellent packaging! It took me less than 30 mins to put 6 chairs together on my own. Fantastic buy!", 
    "Nice chairs that are sturdy. We have a friend who is nervous to sit on them though with their thin legs. He is around 350lbs. Sleek look but definitely need to get special leg protector pads to protect the wood floor from scraping. I'm very happy with the look and the comfort of these chairs.", 
    "I was not sure about this chair, so I just purchased two just to be one the safe side. As soon as I received them I had to order two more...Great Chairs...,", 
    "These chairs are super comfortable and look great in my casual dining room in my Florida condo. Excellent value...love, love, love them!!", 
    "Chairs shipped faster than site expectation. They were easy to assemble. However I found the workmanship very poor especially at the weld sites. The chrome was scratched because the packaging was very poor. They are a great look for the area which we're using them. I would recommend these chairs but very hesitant at the quality of workmanship. One chair even had a soiled back... smacks of poor quality control on the factory floor. Other than that I'm looking to enjoy them in my dining area despite the discomfort factor.", 
    "Beautiful, modern, chic and sleek looking. I really like these chairs for our showroom.", 
    "Love the chairs. I think they look great! They went on sale the day after I bought them for $15 less. That was a bummer. Other than that, I am very pleased!", 
    "Really classy chairs that are very well constructed.", 
    "I love these chairs - they instantly add a modern upgrade to any unit. They were not too difficult to put together, however I agree with the reviews below regarding misalignment at one part. This was the most challenging part. It took me 1 hour to put together 4 chairs. Would definitely recommend these!", 
    "Love it! Comfortable and stylish, liked it better than the picture.", 
    "Very comfortable and clean lines. Love the modern feel and soft leather.", 
    "got these chairs today to go with the chrome and glass table I also purchased at overstock and they go together like they came together. well made comfortable, stylish. love them and at a great price. easy to put together and boxed really well. I cant thank you enough for your website and your wonderful prices and value!!", 
    "Really attractive chairs. They were easy to construct, and look really nice in my modern / transitional style room.", 
    "One had a few blemishes in the chrome but I am very happy with these.", 
    "Exactly what I wanted....great look!", 
    "So far so good. I notice a few imperfections in/under the fabric, but nothing too obvious---and for the price, who cares", 
    "LOOK GREAT AND ARE SIZED FOR OFFICES LACKING ROOM! I BOUGHT 4 AND LIKE THAT THEY ALL FIT IN MY OFFICE FOR VISITORS WHILE GIVING A MODERN FLAIR", 
    "First time I've sent an item back.. But these chairs were not for me. I dint even take out of the plastic wrapping. When I felt the material, hard plastics with a thin covering? Just not for me!!", 
    "Nice and reasonable price .", 
    "not very comfortable to sit", 
    "Beautiful to look at but don't sit in your dark jeans. Stains easily!!", 
    "We bought these for our office.Very sleek looking and very easy to put together.", 
    "sturdy and easy to clean.", 
    "I ordered 2 set, so a total of 4.The assembly was clean and quick and wasn't too much of a headache [two thumbs up].The chairs are easy to clean with a damp cloth. As for comfort they are comfortable and I usually sit in the dinning when I work from home, but after 6 hrs your butt might be a little sore...lolWould I recommend to a friend?: YES!Are the chairs sturdy?: YES! I had a friend who weighted 210 lbs sit on the chair and it held up her weight just fine. Overall: I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "They were more than I expected !", 
    "Beautiful but hard and thin so not great for larger individuals.", 
    "Other than the fact that one chair was missing a couple of nuts and bolts, I am completely happy with my purchase.", 
    "look good, feel sturdy, very stylish", 
    "Chair very thin ..... But yet comfortable ! I was surprised.", 
    "Love these chairs as well. Very stylish and since its PVC, you can just use any wipe to wipe it clean with soap and water!", 
    "Nice looking chairs but not great for sitting in very long. Had to return them.", 
    "I only needed 1 chair for the kitchen desk area. We had difficulty assembling them though because the holes did not match up to the screws correctly. I had to unwrap the second chair and that one lined up properly.Make sure to switch the parts around as one might fit the other. It was frustrating trying to get them to align so we could tighten them up. The chairs are also on the hard side. They're ok just to sit in for a short time, so perfect for what I needed.", 
    "Nice materials and design. A little too hard for a leisurely dinner, but looks great for a breakfast table.", 
    "color at edges were yellowed", 
    "Clean really easy which is why I bought them! I have two kids under 5. I had one that came with rust on the chrome but over stock took care of it-no problem. They are comfortable, maybe a little narrow for some. Overall, happy with purchase and how much I spent on them.", 
    "We just set these chairs up last night. I was looking for a sleek desk chair and this really does the job for me. It gives a lot of good back support.", 
    "I was looking for a sturdy but contemporary clean looking chair. The chairs were super easy to put together. 4 screws per chair! Definitely a one person job and took about 10 minutes per chair.They are sleek and simple yet hold up to 300lbs.The chairs have hard plastic on the feet and I have hardwood floors so I purchased the little foam bottoms from ***** and attached to all four feet (you can't even see the foam.) Works perfectly and no scratches on the new floors.", 
    "I love these chairs they came Rt on time. And I'm not a skinny woman but they hold me just fine lol.....", 
    "If though they were too big for my space and I had to return them, they were very sleek and sexy.", 
    "Nice addition to our beach house. Easy assembly and easy care!", 
    "Elegant chairs,very light and comfortable. I got them for my breakfast nook.", 
    "I bought these to go with a glass and chrome table and it looks like they were meant to be a set. Exactly what I wanted.", 
    "These chairs were a perfect compliment to our modern and simple living room. We placed them around a dark wood table and it looks great! The price was perfect for what we were looking for. They were easy to assemble and feel sturdy. Plus, the white material is extremely easy to clean. We're loving them!", 
    "cute little chair,but shoddy workmanship. I bought 2 of them. the holes were not lined up on either one. I was able to finally push the screws in place on the first one, but the second one had a bent frame. I had to hire a strong man to physically bend the chair so we could get the screws in the holes. Very poor workmanship. Don't frustrate yourself with this purchase unless you are a very strong man able to bend a chrome frame.", 
    "Easy to assemble, and pretty. Also modern and I am very satisfied with this product"
