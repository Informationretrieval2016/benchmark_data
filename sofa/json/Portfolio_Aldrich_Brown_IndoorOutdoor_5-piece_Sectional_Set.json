    "The sections of this sofa are extremely light weight so they slip around when you sit down on them. Additionally the seating is very shallow not very comfortable. We didn't return it but we probably should have overall construction is just fair. It was very inexpensive so I guess it is appropriate for the price not the great buy / value we were hoping for.", 
    "Did not look like the picture. Pretty cheap quality for the price. Was delivered quickly but did not meet my expectations.", 
    "When the box first arrived I thought the order must have been incomplete. I was wrong,it was so well packaged. It was easy enough to assemble and has been great so far. Very satisfied!", 
    "Cute sectional but probably better in a den or covered patio. The cushions retain too much rain water, it's been a week since our last rain and the Florida sun can't seem to dry the cushions. The framing is a little shabby as well, will definitely rust outside.", 
    "It's versatile - I love being able to mix it up into different configurations. Great find for the price.", 
    "I was looking for a couch for my covered patio. This is the perfect size. Easy directions and assembly. The \"back\" cushions could be \"fuller\", but I added a few more to help with that. I would recommend this couch to add seating to your patio area."
