    "I purchased two of these chairs and they are just what I was looking for. They are not huge but they are still comfortable. The color was just like the picture.", 
    "I would not recommend anyone to buy this chair for a tall person because the seat is very low. If you notice the picture it shows that the bottom seat drops downward in the back. It is very costly to return this item. I was very displeased with how the reviews was so misleading.", 
    "This chair is very comfortable and not very big, it is perfect for small houses.", 
    "This chair looks lovely in my living room and is very comfortable.", 
    "Very comfortable, easy to put together. Bought it for my husband after his hip surgery, now the whole family fights for it!", 
    "Bought 2 of these in burgandy, and they look great in our smallish living room. However, the chair does not lock into recline position. Yes, the foot rest locks into place when you move the lever, but the back & head support area do not stay reclined. If you actually want to fully recline, you must push the top part back with your body. But, again, it doesn't lock in that position but springs back to sitting up position. Not very relaxing. So, yeah, I think I am somewhat disappointed in these chairs ... not as comfy as I would like ... not a true recliner. I do like that they are rockers. Thinking of buying another set of chairs that will actually lock into a recline position.", 
    "Love the color, price and material of this chair. I was surprised it came in a very big box and when I opened it, I thought OH NO, I AM GOING TO HAVE TO PUT IT TOGETHER!!! I CAN'T DO THAT, It was easy as pie. It comes in 2 pieces and just slides into the glides. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CHAIR. I plan to order another one. Thank for making my day!!!", 
    "The rocker came on time and without any issues, it is just small. It is much lower to the floor then the one we have and the leg rest is shorter when extended. If you are 5'2 or shorter this rocker would be perfect size.", 
    "\"I giving it a 4 star because the measurement is not correct. It is very will bult, love the colar. The measurment are:The seat, inside where you set, W: 20in, Lenght: 21in, Lenght with foot rest out: 36in. The seat is very firm. Now the back is not the height shown, measurement inside from the the seat to the top of the back rest: 28in. I am 5' 7\"\", 175. The back rest has lot of padding, very comfortable, If you any taller the back rest would not be tall enough. I would call this medium size, as it is bigger then my old recliner. The handle only pulls the foot rest up, you use our legs to put it down. The back does not move with the handle, it is spring loaded, so you can push back to any position.\"", 
    "A little disconcerting because it rocks even when foot feed is up so I have to watch out for my laptop. I prefer a chair that the handle not only puts the footrest up but also down otherwise it's nice", 
    "Bought for my wife, she likes it very much, looks great also.", 
    "Happy 2 recline and relax in comfort.", 
    "chair looks good and is easy to put together. It is not comfortable when reclining all the way especially the head rest. It is stiff.", 
    "Very nice chair very comfortable and was easy to put together.I ordered for my husband but was better height for me", 
    "Appears to be a good quality chair at reasonable price, with quick delivery.", 
    "excellent fabric, very good size and construction, very comfortable", 
    "Outstanding Recliner, not to large and is made with good material and should hold up over time. A great buy", 
    "Well constructed, comes in two pieces that fit through the narrowest of staircases and doorways ... We were counting on this as we had a very similar recliner years ago. Love the fabric, the smoothness of the reclining mechanism and overall styling. Value for money, that's what we like the most. We'll be purchasing another next week, following the north-easter due later today!", 
    "This chair is not what it appears to be in the picture. It is lovely, nice material, but it is very small and not well constructed. I got this to replace a recliner I had for 10 years and I'm almost sure this one will not last half as long. Sadly disappointed.", 
    "It feels a little small, but very comfortable.", 
    "I wished the back reclined without the foot being elevated. I also wished that the lever could be used to lower the foot. every time I put my weight on the leg to lower, I feel like the chair is going to flip. It hasn't, but the chair is quite light for a recliner, so it feels like that. The burgundy color i got is really pretty. it's dark wine/ merlot. Overall it's a great deal for the price. But not a lazy boy.", 
    "Very comfortable, easy put together. Love the color.", 
    "If you like compact (and if you are not tall in stature) - this is the rocker/recliner for you. I have a small apt and this rocker/recliner is the perfect fit!", 
    "The item was great for the first two months I had it. It wasn't as soft as the couch I have, but still great to sit in. I like the rocking and the reclining features. But after having it for 3 months one of the arms on the chair is starting to wobble and will likely soon come off. The material the chair is made of should also be more high quality for the price being charged. It's an okay chair, but won't withstand time or kids playing on it for long.", 
    "I love my chair! This is what I was looking at from a chain \"chair/sofa specialty store\", which was almost three times more expensive. This chair is well padded, easy to use and assemble(just two pieces), very attractive(I love the color), and SO comfy! It is JUST what I wanted, for a fraction of the price and free shipping!!!", 
    "It's a nice rocker recliner. I can't wait until I break it in. Seat is a little hard but it's still comfortable.", 
    "I like it tho, it will not stay back when reclined.", 
    "I bought this chair for as a gift to mother, pettit weight less than 100lb. It was great for two months, but seat starts sagging, now I can feel the bottom, slanted to left. I can't recommend any one for this product.", 
    "Not as comfortable as I thought it would be", 
    "he loves it !!!he said it was so comfortable fast shipping ty", 
    "For the price I paid on this chair, I could ask for no more. Great product at a great price!", 
    "This recliner/rocker is very comfortable and well worth the money I paid for it.", 
    "I don't have a big living room and I needed something to fill in a small space. This chair works perfectly and the quality is great.", 
    "I've had the chair for 2 months now. I use it everyday. I'm 5'5\" and the chair is a bit big for me. Which is great. It's comfortable and I am very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "The chair is comfortable and well designed except for the lever that pulls the foot rest out. It is EXTREMELY difficult to retract. I bought this for my mother who is in assisted living, and she loves it except for this one aspect of the chair.", 
    "The chair was very nice and fit the spaced .", 
    "I got this chair for my 86 year old Mother and its the perfect fit. She loves how comfortable it is.", 
    "I am very happy that after 3 all nighters researching the best deal for a small recliner that fit my bedroom, Although it arrived a day late and box was banged up, It also did not ome with any receipt, nada, just the recliner. It fits perfect in my average size room. Also like many said, If your any bigger than 5'2\"- 5'4\" Don't do it. I am 5'2\" and it fits like a glove. Firm, which is perfect for my lower bak. It also looks great! I'm snuggled in it now in heaven!", 
    "I purchased this for my husband as a surprise for Father's Day, we have had it 6 months and its already broken. Do NOT buy this, it's cheap, I would send it back if I could and buy something better!", 
    "Perfect for what I was looking for. Big enough to be comfortable, but can still fit in a small room. Seems to be well made. Wood parts seem to be all solid wood not particle board. Great chair for the price!", 
    "We ordered two of these and I'm so glad we did. They are easy to assemble and were ready for us to relax in within minutes. They are cushioned well - lots of seat room and they are rockers, too. For the price, they are excellent!", 
    "This came yesterday boxed and simple to assemble. My husband is 6ft tall and about 190lbs, and he says he loves it. It's very comfortable and seems to be sturdy. A good buy for us!", 
    "I'm a Single (Old!) Person, and This Was Such an Easy Purchase and SetUp for Me. It Arrived in Record Time (Free Shipping too), was Just as Described and Went Together Easily and Quickly... It Made a Believer Outa Me ;-))", 
    "nice chair for the price,, the best was I didn't have to haul it home .........", 
    "Purchased this for my 78 year old mom,,,chair is not comfortable and requires extra effort to get out of th", 
    "Well built and looks good, very happy with purchase", 
    "Love it! Came in two pieces but was easy to put together. Very comfortable!", 
    "The chair arrived very quickly and looks great. It's a little stiffer than I had hoped, but it does the job. You take your chances when you buy online. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it."
