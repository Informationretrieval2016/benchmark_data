    "I ordered these in antique iced blue to use as night stands in our master bedroom. We have a darker colored bed and wanted to bring a little color into our room. These really did the trick! These came assembled, except for the feet that you have to screw on (super easy!). They were packages well in the delivery boxes, which I was worried about because stuff can get pretty banged up in delivery and our UPS man isn't exactly gentle when he slams boxes on our doorstep. The color was a bit lighter than what I expected from the picture, but I still love the color. the measurement was slightly different than expected as well. The width across the front was about 15.75\" which turned out to be perfect because I wanted it to be slightly larger than the 11.8\" that was listed. 11.8\" turned out to be the front to back width. Overall I really love that we chose these, they look great in our room and are great for the price. I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because on one of them the drawers stick a little and one was slightly more \"antiqued\" than the other. No major issues though.", 
    "But it is little. I had to send it back because it was too short to fit in bathroom. It would be perfect next to a bed. I gave it 5 stars because it was well made, adorable and the color was gorgeous, I was sad to see it go. The color is so much better than in the picture, as another reviewer mentioned.", 
    "Great little chest for my home office. Just somewhat smaller in size, especially the drawers, than I anticipated!", 
    "I bought this for our beach home. It the perfect color and looks great.", 
    "this little piece looks good and fits nicely in the space but the top drawer is uneven and sticks so I have to leave it shut", 
    "Gorgeous color and well made", 
    "Great purchase! !! The color is beautiful, and the perfect nightstand. I will buy another.", 
    "This piece is completely pointless and so tiny that there is no use for it except maybe in a child's room to make them \"feel\" grown up with a dresser. Drawers are not smooth to open and close even if you do find something small enough to keep in them.", 
    "Love, love, love! Just what I need by my bed!", 
    "My daughter loves the color and its size. It fit perfectly in her closet under her hanging shirts and holds her undergarments as well. It was simple to attach the legs and put in the closet. What a great little chest of drawers!", 
    "Arrive earlier then expected, only needed to put on the legs, I got the blue and it's beautiful and we'll made, it's by my front door and I get compliments on it all the time.", 
    "Love these for our small cabin, ordered the blue, they are beautiful!"
