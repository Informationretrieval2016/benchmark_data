    "The product is nowhere as slick as the picture. Showed up with minor damage. The chair is very firm, also very wide (I like how wide it is) If it lasts a year I will be happy with it. I bought one just to check it out. Glad I didn't buy the couch. The frame construction looks like it was made out of broken down shipping pallets. For the $ it's ok at best.", 
    "OMG, I really should have heeded the other reviews. This chair is a string board! Literally. When you sit down, it goes down and makes a pop sound. Then, it feels like you are sitting on concrete. The fabric looks dirty but it just really cheap quality. This chair was for my office to sit in and occasionally watch t.v. Ha, I don't think I'll be doing much of that. However, it will make for a great place to keep my purse. I could not imagine anyone putting this in any other area of their house. Playroom maybe.I would not recommend this chair to anyone.To expensive to return so, I'll keep it for 6 mos or so.", 
    "Bought them for my kiddos. They wipe clean with a sponge and the seat flips back to turn into a lounger. They can nap on them. They are perfect for our family room area.", 
    "This chair was easy to assemble and looks great. The overall comfort is good, albeit a little firm. The color is really sleek. For the price it's a great buy.", 
    "Very Hard and not as bright navy blue as it looks in pictures.", 
    "While the concept a fold down chair is pretty cool, this chair is very uncomfortable to sit in. My five year old likes it folded down with comfy blankets on top. But you get what you pay for.", 
    "I love my chair its comfortable and it looks good", 
    "I bought two of these chairs. They are easy to assemble. and have clean simple lines. They are low to the floor. I am planning on using the two together to make a twin bed for a guest.", 
    "I love this chair it's comfy and big, it was a little difficult putting he arms on the chair but over all it looks great in my living room", 
    "It's a fun \"man chair\" for my 5 year old. Sturdy and very easy to assemble", 
    "I bought this for my 5 year old. Great little chair and he really likes laying the back down for reading.", 
    "Not a good couch chair and it was like sitting on cardboard!!!!!", 
    "very nice and comfortable plus it is easy to assembling", 
    "Love my futon, nice tone of navy blue and very easy to put together.", 
    "I really think this is a great chair for the money you pay it looks fabulous. was easy to assemble and I think it is very comfy and large almost a 2 seater. my expectations were exceeded."
