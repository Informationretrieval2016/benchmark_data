    "I ordered this French Country chest twice. The first time it came and the top was scratched in production. It was not due to shipping. It also had a horrible oder to it! Some sort of formaldehyde or something they coated it with that gave me headaches. I ordered it again because I really love the design. It was not damaged, but it had the same oder to it that I just could not stand! So I sent it back. Sadly.", 
    "I LOVE IT BUT THE COLOR IS LIKE A DARK GREEN NOT A THE BLUE IT SHOWS WHICH MESSED UP THE DECOR OF THAT ROOM BUT I ADJUSTED B/C I LIKED IT SO MUCH.", 
    "product was welcomed/ friend loved it shipping is not the quickest", 
    "This chest is a nice peice in my bedroom I'm using it for my lingerie. It was easy to assemble but once done the 2nd and 3rd drawers don't quite line up with side rails and is a bit of a hassle to open and close. Overall it is a beautiful peice of furniture in my bedroom, but not worth the price.", 
    "This chest take my bed room to a beautiful place. Look very nice...", 
    "Arrived early and in great condition. Assembly much easier than other boxed furniture. No problems with drawer fit. Color is a creamy yellow with no distressing. Overall a nice piece of furniture for the price.", 
    "This is yellow, not cream. And not a pretty yellow! The drawers do not close well.", 
    "I purchased this to use as a night stand, and it is perfect. The top is spacious enough for a lamp, 3 alarm clocks--don't ask, a bottle of water, and several pretty little boxes. The drawers are a good size, and I use the top one for little \"junk\" and the second for extra sheets, third for extra blankets. The drawers slide easily, which is handy for pulling from in the bed if I need something out of the drawer at night. All in all, I love the chest and would recommend it. Oh, I purchased the blue one and the color is lovely.", 
    "I ordered the cream white and when it showed up it is pretty much a light yellow. I'm not all that upset about the color because my original plan was always to paint it but if you were looking for a genuinely cream colored table, you better look somewhere else. It does have a cute shape and was not very difficult to put together. I did it myself in probably over an hour. It is cheaply built. Not that I am surprised since I ordered furniture from overstock. However, since I did spend upwards of $300 on the small table, I was thinking I would get something a little bit more substantial. In conclusion, it is a super cute, easy to put together, cheaply made table that is a different color than described. I am going to keep it because I really need it right now to stage my home to sell but I would absolutely send it back and get my $*** back if I had the time to get something else.", 
    "A beautiful piece, looks expensive", 
    "The Elissa French Country chest arrived in a timely manner and with good instructions for assembly. The frame is real wood, and the finish is lovely! The recipient loved it, and has received compliments on it. It did have a small bruise on the corner of a drawer front, not really noticeable, but that was the only disappointment. It was worth the price and an appreciated housewarming gift!", 
    "I purchased 2 of these to be used as night stands. I love how tall they are and the color is actually more teal than blue. They were kinda hard to put together but they look great and not too girly or cheap. I'm very pleased.", 
    "Not easy to put together but looks gorgeous. I used this like a console table behind the couch and it works!", 
    "We ordered this chest in the cream color. We assembled it in the garage. We did have a little trouble with the drawers not looking evenly spaced once the chest was put together. My husband was practical enough to see the drawer guides were not put in straight at the factory. So he took off the crooked set and slightly repositioned the guides and other adjustment allowed for the drawers to close and look even and great!!", 
    "The size and shape of this chest of drawers is perfect.....I bought 2 to use in the master as bedside chests. I bought the ivory (it is just a bit too yellow of an ivory, not as pictured). I kept them anyway as my decor is gray, ivory, and accents of yellow. My biggest complaint is that some of the drawers do not line up correctly. I decided to keep them because they are such a perfect size and shape for my room. I put beautiful new handles on them which does make them look more expensive. I would have given them 5 stars if all the drawers lined up and if the color was a true ivory.", 
    "Had a few scratches ...the good thing they were all on the inside. Absolutely live the color.", 
    "Took me 3 hours to assemble but the final result was great. I am happy to have it."
