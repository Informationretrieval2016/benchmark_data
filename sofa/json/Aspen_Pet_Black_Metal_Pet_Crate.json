    "Although the crate is of quality, the description should have been a bit more explanatory other than the weight of the dog that it would fit. A crate is used for many reasons. And for a dog/puppy one of them is potty training. I would not have bought this one if I had known that it was meant mostly for transporting. I have a 20 pound puppy that is too tall for this crate.", 
    "I just got a new puppy and this is perfect for him! I was pleasantly surprised when it came with a divider in it because the puppy is so small right now that the crate was way to big so was able to modify the size until he has grown into it. It also gives good pointer on how to crate train which is very helpful since I have never down this before. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Very good price , nice looks good", 
    "Got this for our 6mo old lab mix and I was worried it would be too small but it's perfect! Nice and sturdy and super easy to set up."
