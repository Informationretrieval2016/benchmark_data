    "This is a high quality replica of Hans Wegner's famous \"Wishbone\" chair (aka the Wegner Y chair or the Wegner CH24). I am the proud owner of an original that I got from my grandfather's estate, and I got this one so I could have a set (but without having to pay the enormous price of an original). Wegner is a world-famous mid-century Danish designer who passed away a few years ago (and ever since the market for his work has gone through the ceiling). For fans of classic mid-century design, this piece is well worth the price.", 
    "We have owned the real Wegner chairs for several years. And we wanted a couple of more chairs for extra guests but did not want to spend the money that we did on the originals. After reading the reviews, we took a chance and ordered two. We were indeed surprised by the quality. The finish on the wood and twine on the seats are very similar and the feel when sitting is no different than the real Wegners. And it only cost us on a fraction of what we spent on the real thing. Love them!!A", 
    "i am surprised how well made this chair was. i was expecting a sloppy job, but instead found this chair to be beyond reproach! Great price for such a well made chair.", 
    "Super wood chair. The seat is strong and comfortable and the curve of the back fits the curve of my back. I\u2019m a pretty big guy and often find wooden chairs too stiff and straight. But I can lean back in this one and it takes my weight. It\u2019s a nice wood and overall just a well made dining chair. You can\u2019t go wrong with ordering this inexpensive dining chair for your house.", 
    "I am a huge fan of midcentury design, although by no means an expert. To me, they look quite close to the real \"wishbone\" chair. I love the look of these chairs, and they are comfortable, too. I have 2 young children and it is easy to get dropped/spilled/smeared food off of these chairs. My husband is tall (6'4\" and 200+ lbs), and he finds them comfortable and roomy enough, too. They add a stylish yet relaxed look to our dining room :)", 
    "I wasn't sure about these chairs. I usually like a little cushion on my dining chairs to help encourage longer dinner conversation. These chairs were comfortable on their own, however, so no additional pillows were needed. The light wood looks great against my darker table.", 
    "This chair gives you a lot of style for the money, at a price that\u0092s really unbeatable. It has an Asian feel with clean contemporary lines and really adds a lot of zip to my living room. Since I live in a condo, it\u0092s perfect because it offers extra seating without being bulky or taking up too much room, and it really works great with the furniture I already have. I also like that I can use it as an extra dining chair, if I need to it\u0092s fabulous!", 
    "I like the chair . It fits the space at my desk in the kitchen and it is lightweight. It is a bit smaller than I expected,but it will work.", 
    "Thank you Overstock! I am now the happy owner of a great repro of Wegner\u0092s classic wishbone chair! I cannot believe the low price, the high quality and the quick delivery of this piece, which arrived much earlier than expected. If you are looking for a little piece of classic midcentury design without the hefty price of actually getting an original, this is a great piece to get. It has given my home a nice modern lift.", 
    "I absolutely love these chairs! If you put them next to the originals, you'd notice the difference in materials/quality, but on their own they are beautiful and good quality. I got the natural finish. Very comfortable and light weight, yet sturdy. We often get compliments on them. I'm very grateful to be able to enjoy the terrific design, since I'd never be able to afford the originals.", 
    "Really wonderful repro of classic Danish chairs. Lovely low profile; comfortable. My kids like cushions; I think the hemp is comfortable in itself. Really gorgeous wood. I ordered what I thought was the same chair from another source; the back rail was pieced, and not well. The piecing was very visible, different colors wood, so I returned them. There is an old review on Overstock that says these chairs have pieced back rails; not so. Solid wood backrail, very nice. In addition, my order arrived very quickly and was packed brilliantly, so no worries about the chairs arriving in good shape. I'm very pleased.", 
    "I love this chair. The curves are so attractive. I purchased one for my vanity and it is the perfect height!", 
    "really nice dining chair. Looks great and very comfortable!", 
    "this a real high quality product. well made and it was well packed durng shipment too.", 
    "Always hated formal dining room. I want to be comfortable while I eat, don't you? This chair is different from the typical seat though. There may not be any bells, whistles, or cushions, but it is strong, comfortable, and the curved back allows you to relax against it.", 
    "The curved top rail of the chair is not one piece of wood. Instead, it is composed of 3 pieces of wood. I wasn't expecting the same quality construction as the original, licensed piece, but I was very disappointed. The middle piece is also a different color so the fact that the top rail is made of 3 pieces is very noticeable.", 
    "These chairs have all of the positives listed in previous reviews and none of the negatives. Surprised at the good quality and they look fine. They are sturdy and comfortable and I'm using them to replace vintage Thonet bentwoods. The only caveat is the high arms that could come in contact with the dining table.", 
    "Just make sure to pay attention to the size. It is not very big.", 
    "We ordered these chairs even after reading a few negative reviews. Ours arrived in perfect condition. The wood matches perfectly throughout the chair. The quality is remarkable fir the price -or any price for that matter. In short we could not be more pleased.", 
    "Customer service was terrific and took care of my problem with the damaged chair immediately! The design and manufacture of the chair is lovely, but two of the legs do not sit on the ground - warped. I solved the problem by putting leg tips on the two short legs. The other chair arrived with one leg completely shattered and un-repairable. The packing for shipment was deplorable - nothing could have survived, The chair could have become warped in shipment! ?", 
    "The chairs were well made and quite comfortable. My problem was that the wood is more red oak in style with an orangey-peach cast to it. There was one other review that mentioned this but I chose to ignore it because it was one out of many, many positive reviews. I have very pale, white oak floors. If the chairs were pale white oak or the ash finish that you can get if you order the actual Wegner chairs they would've totally worked. For my situation they did not and I am returning them. These are lovely chairs that will work for most people. Be aware of the color as it relates to your other furnishings. We (the 4 adults who test drove these chairs) also found them to be about an inch too short for our dining room table. So be sure to check your measurements as well!", 
    "I absolutely love these chairs. I bought four! Being a modern mid century enthusiast, I have to say they are the next best thing to the real deal. My husband is 6'5 and actually tossed out his ratty ole' office chair (an unexpected miracle!) and says that they are actually more comfortable. You won't regret it.", 
    "Great design and very sturdy for the price. We'll probably end up getting more--great neutral, would work well anywhere (desk chair, dining chair, occasional chair).", 
    "I have both a formal dining area as well as a in-kitchen table. I found these chairs work in both atmospheres, which saved me money because I only had to buy one set.", 
    "never thought id buy chairs like these but they look great up in my house", 
    "i purchased these chairs for the little table in my kitchen. look nice. doesnt bulk up the space.", 
    "I really like the craftsman style and i think this fits so well with the rest of my decor. But my favorite thing about it is that my cat Fifi loves taking naps on it.", 
    "I use two of these as my client chairs. Look professional. Still comfortable though.", 
    "bought a couple of these chairs when i got my older sons their own desk. comfortable enough to sit in for long hours.", 
    "Stylish and well-made chair. A very acceptable alternative to the pricy original.", 
    "I am very happy with my dining wood chair with hemp seat. Great value at an amazing price.", 
    "Love these chairs! They are sturdy and have held up well.", 
    "This is wood composite with formaldehyde (stated on chair sticker), not solid wood as advertised. Very lightweight and has faux wood grain. The \"natural\" is also very peach-colored", 
    "Sturdy and beautiful chair.", 
    "Amazingly faithful reproduction of the Hans Wegner Wishbone chair. Unfortunately, the contour of the wishbone makes, along with the awkward position of the curved arms, makes for singularly uncomfortable sitting. That's not the fault of the manufacturer/vendor, however, but rather of the original design. The rush seats are beautifully finished.", 
    "Came assembled, and feels solid and well-made. Authentic Hans Wegner chairs go for upwards of $500 each, but with so little difference in the design, these were perfect for the price. One small gripe - bottom of the feet had clearly been exposed to paint or something black and sticky wherever they were stored. I ended up putting pads on them anyways to protect my wood floors and it did a good job of hiding the black residue.", 
    "These arrived very fast and came by UPS in a huge box. Couldn't be easier to get to them. Minimal packaging but there was no damage. The chairs do seem painted. You can see grain but it almost looks plastic. They are comfy and chic. I do like them for my dinette set but for the price, I don't know if I fully recommend them. Maybe in a darker color they would look more high end. I am keeping them because they do go with the two other chairs I had purchased. Not as nice as those chairs and more expensive but I couldn't find any more of those. Not super impressed but they are nice chairs. Maybe I am just blah because I had wanted two more of the ones I already had.", 
    "Great chair. Very sturdy and looks exactly like pictures. Be aware, the arms are pretty high, so they may not fit under a standard desk (mine didn't, which is ok because I have room, but could be a problem).", 
    "I wish that I could have tried the chair before purchase. I bought four of them thinking that the low back would work well at my table. They are not comfortable and they will probably be replaced.", 
    "Perfect for my apartment, and just what I've been looking for! They are lovely to look at, comfortable & I'm going to enjoy them for a long time!", 
    "I was happy with the chair..after I finally got it. I ordered it & it was \"lost in shipping\" Then it went \"out of stock\" I had to call & asked where my chair was. They didn't know ! It came back in stock in a few weeks, then I re-ordered. The chair is great, shipping stucked ! They should have offered me something, a O Club membership ..or something !", 
    "These are very comfortable!", 
    "I love the look and construction of this chair, I use it in my office and it is very confortable.", 
    "These chairs have a modern, yet simplistic look. They can be used for dining chairs or even as sun room chairs, which is what we are using them for. They are well crafted and comfortable. I like the neutral color, goes with the pieces I already have. Would recommend these chairs.", 
    "Light weight and attractive. Great addition to dining room.", 
    "Not very comfortable. Negligible back support.", 
    "Very comfortable and well made.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised that this chair looked so much like the original Wegman chair and is just as comfotable. Of course, it's much lighter, but the price was SO much less for the look. I am using it in the office and it goes with the sort of transitional design of the place. This was a very good deal.", 
    "good product, matches w table", 
    "Love these chairs and great price considering other ones I've seen online are so much more . Just the clean mid-century I wanted . But watch out ... Quite low (which is ok since I'm short ) but taller guests may take issue .", 
    "This is the fourth wishbone chair (reproduction made for Baxton Studio) I have purchased. The are solid hardwood (beech I believe) and look well made. However, I must say that one of my earlier purchases was not glued properly at the horizontal leg braces. It flexes when sat upon. The genuine article with a brass serial number tag costs over $800!", 
    "I will order one more to complete the set of four, they come in different colors but solid wood and hemp seats....love them", 
    "I purchased 2 chairs to serve as end chairs for a contemporary marble table.The Hemp seat is good quality and very comfortable. The wood was as pictured in the ad, so I was very pleased.I am 5'2\", so I need a chair pad to make it feel at the correct height while dining, but I would put a pad on them anyway to protect the nice seat.The curved back is extremely comfortable for lingering at the table. I was impressed with the free shipping, it arrived on time, without any dings, or problems. I would recommend this for anyone who likes light feeling furniture, but is also durable and comfortable.", 
    "I am obsessed with these chairs. I do not find them uncomfortable as some other reviews have mentioned. They are solid wood, yet lightweight. And they have a mid-century yet bohemian look because of the woven seat.", 
    "I bought two of these chairs hoping they'd coordinate with the beech floors in our kitchen, but no such luck. I'd have to agree with the couple of other reviews that mention the color being off. It's too dark for beech--more like oak--and has an unnatural peachy tone. While the chairs are reasonably comfortable, I can't get past the finish and will be returning them ($26).", 
    "I bought four of these chairs to use with a new Danish-style dining table I purchased from DWR. The chairs are beautiful and a great value - much less costly than purchasing the same chair through DWR - but they mesh perfectly with the more expensive table. Some comments say these chairs are not comfortable, but I disagree. I like their low-profile design that eats up less visual space than, say, a high-backed dining chair.", 
    "Before I received these Wegner reproduction chairs, I was a bit concerned that they might be cheaply constructed. I was totally relieved and pleasantly surprised upon delivery that they are sturdy and beautiful. I got 4 chairs to go with an antique, claw footed, round table for my town home. They look great. And the best. Thing? Fully assembled!", 
    "Beautiful reproduction of a Hans Wenger Y-chair at a fraction of the cost of an original! A stunning addition to mid-century modern danish decor.", 
    "I have had my chair for almost 2 years now and it is as beaautiful and sturdy as when I first received it. I see this style in all the home decor magizines and it is perfect in my craft room!", 
    "Well built, sturdy, and stylish perfect for smaller spaces. Cushions from *** or *** or *** are a great fit. Quick shipping very happy.", 
    "this is a beautiful chair, simple, elegant. If i had more space, I would get more.", 
    "Even if this was made in China it is still a very comfortable and well made chair.Hopefully this will last for a long time.I have this as extra seating in the bedroom.", 
    "We bought this chair because we had seen it in all the modern decorating magazines and were interested in making our home have a modern feel. The chair is really nice and well made, but if you are taller than 5 ft 9, or a on the thin side with no \"padding on your back\" the round back is pretty uncomfortable for sitting over longer periods of time. We placed a pillow on the back of the chair to make it more comfortable and have some back support, and are currently using them in our guest room. They arent used every day but are ok for occasional use.", 
    "After looking for a mid-century modern chair for my living room, I found this replica on Overstock. The first shipment was delayed and arrived damaged on the \"Y\" but Overstock's customer service was excellent with a quick replacement. Very satisfied with purchase. Paired it with sheepskin from IKEA.", 
    "I bought this chair for my kitchen desk. The style is attractive from the back, low enough to fit under the desk cabinet space and is very comfortable. Delivery was on time in excellent condition and product required no assembly ,", 
    "It is an expensive reproduction of the wenger chair. For the price, you can't beat it. Very happy. Would have loved a teak tone option, even if a bit more expensive. Would certainly buy again.", 
    "Love the style! Great chair! Sits well and looks perfect in the corner of our guest room.,", 
    "I was very happy when I received these chairs. The color is just what I wanted and they look great with my round glass top table. As I am a senior with arthritis, I wanted something lightweight that would be easy to move. The price was great too.", 
    "I ordered two of these chairs, and both were bizarrely colored. The wood is not blond as pictured, but stained a light peach. If I put it next to my skin, I matches perfectly. Also, the grain is mismatched, some legs being oak, and some what looks like maple, and each being a slightly different shade of peach. If the cost of return shipping wasn't so high, I'd be sending these back. Instead, I plan on sanding the stain off, and re-urethaning the wood in clear. The chairs were well packaged.", 
    "I was looking for a small chair that is easy to move around. This chair definitely fills the bill. It is fairly comfortable - not my greatest concern as I needed something portable. I would definitely recommend this chair. It is very attractive - great retro look!", 
    "We really like the chair. It is a very elegant and stylish design, seems well built and fits with our decor. We will definitely order more.", 
    "Love this chair, it fits well in the space. My only complaint is that there are three small scratches on the front leg. The box the chair came in was falling apart. This is the second furniture purchase I received that the merchandise was slightly damaged due to the shipping. In the future, I will hesitate to purchase furniture on line unless it is delivered and unboxed by the shipper.", 
    "Could not be happier with the chair. I have been looking for a quality reproduction of the Wegner chair at a good price, and this has been the perfect match for our dining room.", 
    "These are great chairs. Great quality, size and proportion as you would expect, and they come fully assembled. Love 'em.", 
    "Absolutely beautiful chair, and exceptionally made! About to order another now... j", 
    "We have had these chairs for overc a week now and like them very much. They are comfortable, feel solid and look great. If you turn them upside down you do notice some white glue leftovers where parts of the wood were attached to each other. There are also big \"made in China\" stickers at the bottom of the seats. Overall: a good copy of the original at a reasonable price.", 
    "This chair is exactly what I hoped for. It looks beautiful with a sheepskin rug thrown over the seat for softness and Scandinavian style. I love it.", 
    "Really love these chairs. They are very comfortable! If you want a mid-century look at a sane price, then these chairs are for you.", 
    "I would recommend this product! Out of 6 chairs I ordered, only 1 had a minor scratch.", 
    "I bought two of these chairs, they shipped in one box and arrived quickly. They are very sturdy and look just like the real wishbone chairs. I did add protectors to the feet of the chair to protect the wood, it didn't come with any. I plan on buying 4 more to complete my dinning room.", 
    "Great knock-off of the Wegner Wishbone chair. I own a couple of other ones I purchased on Craigslist, and the ones from Overstock look much better in comparison - the craftsmanship and attention to detail is noticeable. Would highly recommend.", 
    "I wanted eight of these chairs for a large dining table and initially purchased two for evaluation. Unfortunately, the seat is too low and the arms too high for my table. Check the dimensions carefully. I think the seat height in particular is at the low end of the standard range. I love the chairs though and am keeping them for another use.", 
    "A great chair. I wish I had room for more. Well made, fits in with 60;s furniture.", 
    "If you don't want to pay for the expensive designer version, but want a great chair this is a perfect option. Compact, comfortable and a good weight too. Comes fully assembled. I used it as a desk chair, but also looks great as an accent chair. Will probably buy more.", 
    "This is a sturdy, but less expensive version of the wishbone chair. Yes, if you want the authentic, beautiful, perfectly designed original, this falls a little short aesthetically, but it's still a very attractive chair. Other than that, it is very solid, and will hold up for quite a while, I reckon. That's not something you can say about a lot of repros, so consider it a big plus. Not to mention it looks great with my Saarinen table. :)", 
    "i want ten more of these!!!!! Great chairs and modern look. Clean nice wood", 
    "These chairs are so special and unique. And what I hadn't really suspected - super comfortable lumbar support. As pictured, the chair is quite blonde - but so not like an **** purchase (that was my fear). The quality of these chairs is off the charts. They arrived two in a box - were well packed and flawless upon inspection. Overstock is amazing with the deals you can get, and I would so recommend this chair to anyone with an affection for the unconventional and the clean lines of mid-century furniture. I guess these are replicas of a famous chair - I don't know anything about that, but if you like the look of it - buy it. You won't be disappointed. I love mine!", 
    "Using this with a small art table in a combination guestroom/artroom. It's comfortable and a great look.", 
    "I bought these chairs to serve in both the living room and dining room. They fill both functions and are beautiful and comfortable.", 
    "This is a terrific chair. We ordered two, and the beautiful lines and comfortable seats make them lovely additions to our dining set.", 
    "The chair is well made, very sturdy and extremely comfortable. It is a pleasure to look at, so graceful.", 
    "just what I wanted - great service and product as per usual O/S", 
    "Beautiful copy of Hans Wegner chair, Looks wonderful in my family room as extra seating. Very comfortable..I've already received lots of compliments!", 
    "It's a simple but striking design that works wonderfully in my front entryway. It's sturdy yet light enough to be easily moved to another room if the need arises. I'm very pleased.", 
    "It's so hard to get an aesthetically pleasant and decent quality chair for less than $200 bucks these days, isn't it? This one is both, which makes it a great buy. The curved back is comfortable for me (5'4\"). The hemp portion is tight and very well made. We haven't actually used it yet since we're in the middle of a move but I cannot wait to use it, and possibly buy more.", 
    "Ordered 10 for our lake house - matched our Stickley table excellently - made in China however like everything else these days. Very economical and all were in decent shape and packed very well for shipping.", 
    "This is the second chair I purchased. Good quality.", 
    "It feels very solid, didn't need to be assembled. Large seat, so its comfy. I like how the back of the chair just comes above the table, so visually, the dining area feels more open. First I ordered one pink one as a desk chair or occasional chair, but then I loved the way it looked at the dining room table so much, I ordered 3 more. I need another 2. In terms of design, the top bar in the back isn't the most comfortable to lean back on to, but it is very nice to put your arms on the bar. Had a party Saturday night and people sat in them for hours.", 
    "This chair is just like the original designer chair at a fraction of the cost. The quality is great. I can't find a single thing wrong with it. I may buy more in the future.", 
    "These are great chairs, a real coup for the money. Every inch of them is fine quality. I could find no flaw in them. Will order two more when they are back in stock.", 
    "A fabulous find. A designers touch--a cross between old school and bahaus. The hemp seat is more attractive and durable than the run-of-the-mill rush seat. An excellent choice for an accent chair.", 
    "This is a very well thought-out and comfortable chair with exquisite craftsmanship at the joined areas and with a smooth clear finish over what I believe to be it's European Beech frame. I will probably buy more and have mentioned it to others as a very good product for it's price.", 
    "I ordered four Wood Chairs with Hemp Seat for my winter garden and they look fantastic. I was searching for something simple and tasteful, something fine and light. These wood chairs have a fine, warm brown color giving luminosity to the room and are also highly comfortable. The high quality of the chairs is a great addition near the low price and the comfort is the best. With simple design buying these chairs was the perfect choice to make.", 
    "I love how it looked, easy to move and light. I use it in my kitchen for my small dinette table", 
    "Good quality, packaged nicely. It had a little nick but figured it'll get more as it'll be well used so kept it instead of sending it back. Would've been nice if it came clean but the nick wasn't big enough to go through shipping hassle. Overall I'm happy with it, it sits pretty low so won't work as dining chair unless ur table is low.", 
    "This chair is attractive and gives a modern edge to a usually ordinary piece of furniture. However, it's not very comfortable to sit in. The back feels awkward and my thights rest on the raised legs on the seat. It's better used for occasional rather than regular use.", 
    "These are beautiful chairs! I was looking for new chairs for our everyday dining room - casual chairs that were also modern, chic and comfortable. These chairs fit the bill in every aspect - and although these are arm chairs, they fit around the table and are comfortable for sitting around the table after dinner. The wood is of top quality and beautiful color, the hemp seats are very sturdy and well made - I plan to buy more of them for unexpected guests!", 
    "Great replica of original wishbone chair. No assembly required/solid piece! Beautiful chair!", 
    "Very pleased with this Hans Wegner reproduction chair. Comfortable and sturdy. Extremely fast shipping.", 
    "I am always looking for unique and useful pieces, but this one surprised me with it's stunning design, quality and functionality. I use them for extra seating for large gatherings and at my table for regular seating. They are lightweight and slimlined so no bulky hard to move, floor scratching chairs. The color and design fit in with any decor...love these chairs!", 
    "I bought two chairs for my tea space at home. They were very well built. The design has an oriental flare yet sleek and contemporary; exactly what I wanted. They are comfortable to sit in as well.", 
    "I am absolutely delighted with this chair! It has a wonderful unique look, is comfortable, and completes my small apartment's living room beautifully. It seems very well made, and as with almost all purchases from Overstock, it arrived even before the scheduled delivery date in perfect condition. I am truly happy!", 
    "I love these chairs. They came in great condition, and very quickly.", 
    "this is the chair I wanted - Hans Wegner wishbone knock-off - at a price that is an unbelievable value. Seats quite comfortable for hemp, not padded seat comfortable, but has nice shape. The arm and back support are perfect. Great looking wood, couldn't ask for more.", 
    "I bought 2 of these because I couldn't resist. I've seen others in retail stores for at least 2x this price. So, I took a chance and ended up sending for 2 more because I love them. The wood is smooth, strong, light in color. The seat is tightly stretched with the hemp, and they are comfortable for sitting for extended periods of time. When I returned to the web site to buy the 2nd 2, they were out of stock. As soon as I was emailed that they were back in stock, I ordered the last two.", 
    "I ordered these chairs on Monday and received them on Wednesday. Wonderful service. Even better, we are delighted with the quality of the product. They look great, are extremely comfortable and blend well with the design of our teak dining table.", 
    "Although the company got this title wrong, it is a 'hemp rope' seat, not 'temp'(?) you can guess it would be hemp; makes sense.I continue to be impressed with the great comfort, smooth finish, strong construction yet light weight, and overall Wegner like style of this wishbone chair. I bought four to be used with a natural finish distressed wood rectangular table. This chair came double packed and was very well protected for the shipping journey, unlike many other items I have bought online. Be confident in purchasing this one. I know you won't regret it.", 
    "I just love these wood dining chairs. I have received some many comments on since receiving them. My other dining room set was rather boring, but these wooden dining room chairs have really added a sense of flair to my dining room. I now just love entertaining, and I can not wait till I host my next dinner party.", 
    "Ordered 4 of these chairs to replace others which had worn upholstery. Our original set is teak, so it was not easy to find wood chairs to match. These blend well with the color of the table. In our small house they are perfect, because they don't have a tall back, and you can literally see through them. They arrived quickly and in perfect condition. We find them comfortable, and have created a whole new 'look' in our dining room.", 
    "I ordered 4 of these chairs to go with a Room&Board dining room table. The chairs are beautiful. They're comfortable. I get lots of compliments and my husband loves them too. Plus -- unmatched price. Overstock customer service was helpful and shipping was fast and easy.", 
    "I will recommend you buy this chair if you do not afford the original one. The quality is good. The size is a little small but it still works for me. Buy it!", 
    "N/A review Would like to see this chair up front and personal", 
    "Pair with a modern design, the sublime wood lines of the hair, the extravagant carving and design of this Wood Chair with Temp Seat can be the perfect choice for everyone, no matter how classic, contemporary or undefined their taste is. The curved backrest and the sturdy temp seat make this chair comfortable enough. I would certainly recommend it to everyone."
