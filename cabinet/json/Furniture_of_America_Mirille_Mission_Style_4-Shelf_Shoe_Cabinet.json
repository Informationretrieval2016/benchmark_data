    "This cabinet does the job but the instructions are HORRIBLE. There are only pictures which would be alright if the pictures were actual diagrams. They don't include any distinguishing features so you can't tell the direction a piece should be facing or if it's the finished or unfinished edge of the wood. I was also missing the last page of the directions. I was able to figure it all out but had to make my own adjustments and drill my own holes for parts of it. Overall, the product is alright but expect to spend a few hours putting this together. It took me about 3 hours to put together and I am no novice when it comes to this."
