    "I purchased this couch about a month ago, so I feel qualified to leave a review. The couch is super comfy and doesn't look cheap at all. Perfect for marathon watching tv. It's fairly small and only sits two comfortably (three, uncomfortably), but that works for my space. I would definitely suggest purchasing additional seating as this couch is not big enough for entertaining. The tufted gives the couch a more sophisticated look and people have often asked if I got it from Restoration Hardware! One con, as a small woman, it was NOT easy to put this couch together and certainly took about 30-45 mins as opposed to the 5-10 minutes they advertise.", 
    "the look of this sofa is amazing. perfect mid century look. that being said, the cushion is already ripping at the seams after only a few months. We definitely use it so maybe if it's more for looks or very gentle use it would work great!", 
    "First of all the color is not grey, it's a very dark olive or military green. There are a lot of threads lose and the stitching is crooked. To top it off the seat board is an inch too small. Not sure if it's comfortable but I'm frustrated about the item and am going to try and return this couch. I wanted a dark grey couch. It looks grey in pictures but it definitely green. The customer service was great. They gave me some tips on what may work to fit the seat board, but the tips did not work, that one piece is just too small. I hate the color! It's deceptive", 
    "It is definitely more green then charcoal grey.", 
    "Fantastic styling! Fabric is not the best quality, but for the price it's to be expected. The back of sofa is a velco flap of material. Ok if your putting against the wall but not to float in room, which is what I need to do.", 
    "This sofa is very nice looking, and it's fine to sit on (especially for taller people, as the seat is quite deep). However, because of the way it's constructed, the seat is slightly slanted (down towards the back), which makes it uncomfortable for lying down/sleeping. You feel like you're lying on a slanted surface (you are) and you're sort of rolling to one side. So, I would recommend it for a pretty couch if you don't plan to have people sleep on it (which I often do, so I'm a bit disappointed with it). I does look like a high quality sofa.", 
    "I love this sofa.It sits my husband ,son and myself comfortably .Th grey has almost a cool green hue. I still love the style!!!", 
    "The sofa arrived today and I assembled it by myself in about 30 minutes. I was worried about the color since a lot of the reviews say the couch looks more green/olive than grey (our wall color is Benjamin Moore Tapestry Beige, carpet is Karastan Modern Way/Everglades) so green/olive was NOT the color scheme I was going for. I took a TON of photos in early morning sun with the blinds open and closed hoping I could post them to show folks that in person it might have a green hue, but in all of my photos it looks down-right grey (at least to me). I'm not sure if the green/olive hue I think I'm seeing is only because I expected it to look that way or not:) I've had the couch less than an hour and sat on it once - it does seem a little 'firm', but still very comfortable. We purchased the couch for our living room so it probably won't get much action - but for the price we felt it was perfect for our family. The dimensions are spot on, and it fit perfectly in our 10.5' x 12' formal living room. My husband and I did A LOT of research online and in stores before buying this and now I know it was the right decision. I was hesitant about buying something online without seeing it in person first - I worried about size, color, etc., but after shopping at local furniture stores it appears to be of similar quality you'd find at American Furniture Warehouse or Rooms to Go but without the pushy sales people;) Some reviews mentioned it was smaller than expected but like I said it fits our average sized living room just fine.One thing we did after going to local furniture stores is take the measurements of the furniture and 'mark' them in the house using masking tape or painters tape to visually see how large or small items we liked would fit once we got them home. I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone before making any purchase. It sealed the deal for us and this awesome couch!If I can figure out how to post photos I will!", 
    "very easy to put together only took 1 person very fast look good seats high", 
    "Solid couch. The puckered look really adds to the appearance of quality, and the dark gray is a great shade. I love it!", 
    "Easy to put together. Firm, but not too firm. Very happy.", 
    "I wish I looked at this more closely, I was hoping for a darker grey , but is in fact green. Like olive green with undertones of Grey. Not too happy , but the quality is nice. Comfy couch.", 
    "Elegant looking sofa. Looks great in my living room", 
    "Exactly what I expected for the price. They may not be the most comfortable couch. It's a bit stiff, but it works for us.", 
    "I wanted a sofa that will hold up because i lay on it to watch TV. So far its held up and the quality is surprisingly good for a Chinese made sofa", 
    "I love the look, but the color is hardly Charcoal Gray... in fact it is OLIVE GREEN... UNFORTUNATELY I ORDERED TWO OF THEM..", 
    "for the price it looks great, comfy just like in the pics. the cushion are firm durable piece .", 
    "classic, comfy, and easy to put together for my husband. perfect affordable couch for our enclosed porch. i love it next to the fire place!", 
    "I am very pleased with this sofa for the money. It is comfortable and easy to get off. My couch before I struggled to get up. The color is a bit grey olive but it works in my room. My daughter tells me it's very comfortable to lay on also!", 
    "Very happy with it. It looks great and doesn't take up a lot of space.", 
    "This couch was easy to put together- -yes it has detailed directions with all parts and hardware included. I read other reviews of this item on Wayfair for tips on how best to assemble and pros and cons from purchasers. The SoFast sofa does not have a two sided seat cushion, so you cannot turn it over to equalize wear or hide a stain. The fabric seems strong so far but did come with quite a few threads that were easily cut. The only issue I foresee is the one piece cushion will probably flatten out unevenly due to construction style and while the couch is definitely NOT cushy it does look very nice in a retro/modern style. If you aren't looking for a 10 year couch, this will fit the bill. As far as size, it is very comfortable to stretch out and lie down on (I am normally couch sitter) - -I am 5' 9\" and I have a bit of room to spare, fully lying flat on my back. Overall, I like the sofa a lot but gave 4 stars as a comment on the durability and probable life span of the product- -but it was only $* so I'll console myself with my savings. :)", 
    "I just got it tonight. It was simple to put together and the color is grey with a slight shade of grey/green but it looks great. Very comfortable. I may buy another one!", 
    "It's okay. The price matches the quality", 
    "i love this couch and everything about it. i needed help putting it together because i just couldn't \"see\" the directions. it's totally comfortable and long enough to stretch out, especially if you're short but it would fit a 6' person. any stains come out quickly especially if you get them right away. it's a very good looking couch.", 
    "I was very hesitant to purchase a couch online but relied on the favorable reviews. I LOVE this couch! The color is gorgeous - I don't notice any green in the color like many other reviewers have noted. It's comfortable and stylish. Great for the price.", 
    "Overall it's not bad for the price and I don't think anyone can expect much more. It's not very comfortable as the cushions are pretty thin. They could be filled with some more substantial padding.", 
    "The couch was easy to assemble with one person, it took me less than ten minutes. It's a great looking couch. It's firm, not the kind of couch you sink into, but I consider that a positive thing. It's definitely more of a green color than \"basil grey\". There's a few loose threads, I'm hoping when I cut them off the whole thing doesn't fall apart.", 
    "Full disclosure: I haven't put the couch together yet, but wanted to speak to the shipping experience. Through no fault of Overstock (I just didn't read the shipping info fully) I didn't realize that it would be delivered UPS Ground. This means that it's delivered just like anything from *, etc would be - straight from the truck to your door. I assumed I would get a delivery window and would be home to collect the package, but that's not the process. I was a little nervous about a very expensive box sitting on my porch all day while I was at work. Luckily in my case it was fine, but I've definitely lived in apartment buildings before where I would not have been able to have this package delivered. If you live in that kind of building (narrow stoop, no doorman, unsafe area) take that in consideration. You may want to consider collecting from the UPS center, if you have a big truck and nice friends to help, or arranging delivery for a day you'll be around.About the package: it's the length of the couch (so about 68 inches) and about 2-3 feet wide. HEAVY - 120 lbs. If you're picking it up yourself you will need the bed of a truck, or maybe an SUV with a big trunk and fold-down seats. I could have recruited someone to help carry it up to my 2nd floor apartment but I opted to take the box apart on my porch and carry it up piece by piece, which worked out perfectly. Very easy for an able-bodied person to carry up each piece individually without any help. So far I like the couch. It's a dark gray with a greenish hint, as others have said, but it's not flat-out green like I thought it may be. It looks very classy (in pieces) and seems like it will be comfy. May have to revise when I put it together but so far so good!", 
    "Was looking for MCM inspired couch. Considered others that were much more expensive. So glad I went with this. Put it together myself (took a little longer but that's ok) and it looks great! Stylish, classy, firm but really comfortable. It looks wonderful in my new apartment.", 
    "good price, comfortable but much darker than expected. Also, had to put together and one part was too small. not sure how it will hold up."
