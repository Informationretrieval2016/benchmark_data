    "Cheap construction, flimsy, light weight. Hinges do not close/fold with precision. Hinges were separated from frame to make doors close without a gap, so doors do not stay fully open. \"Wood\" in door corners coming apart; No rails for flimsy drawer, so hangs down and falls out if tipped. Not worth 1/2 price, much less full price. Will not bother to return. Donate to charity. Some college student may buy it for $**.**. Three little pigs house made of straw."
