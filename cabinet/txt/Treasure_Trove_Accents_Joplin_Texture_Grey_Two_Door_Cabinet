Antiqued to perfection, this two-door cabinet has charm to spare. Each door has a glass inset that is divided into geometric patterns. The finish is Joplin Textured Grey, and neutral enough for all decors. Decorative metal hardware finishes off the exterior and an interior shelf doubles the storage and display space.
