    "I was a little worried about A: Ordering a couch without having seen it in person, and B: Ordering something that has had no reviews. I took the dive, and I have to say, I'm very pleased!First off, the couch looks exactly as it does in the photo. The fabric is true to the color it is in the photo, and it also feels fairly high quality and worthy of wear. The nailheads look great, and none were loose or off-centered. The extra touch of the reclaimed-looking wood on the bottom is really nice!The couch arrived as 4 packages, the back, the arms, the base, and the cushions. The 3 larger packages were around 50 pounds a piece. This delivery method was actually ideal for me as I live in a smaller apartment in NYC, so I knew without a doubt that I'd be able to fit everything in. It'll also make moving it a lot more simple later on, as I can just break it down to its constituent parts and move it out!The only warning I have is that the cushions are pretty firm, which I actually prefer. If you're looking for something really squishy and soft, then you may want to look elsewhere.", 
    "The material is nice. And seems to be of good quality. But I've only had it a few months. I don't like the very firm cushions on it.I weigh about 190 lbs and I don't sink down but about a quarter inch. (very firm) not that comfortable for sitting for very long periods of time. There's already a button on the back that has came off.So, I am not that pleased with the product. Did not know it was a slip together sofa. I believe it is over priced. I guess I should of done more research on it before buying it. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO A FRIEND !!!!!!!", 
    "I just wish, the seats were deeper and softer, other than that, if looks very nice"
