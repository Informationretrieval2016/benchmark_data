    "The buffet is cheaply made, parts are easy to break when assembling. The paint on wood is streaky. No matter how carefully assembled, it wiggles when moved. I knew I was not buying an expensive piece of furniture, but this buffet is not worth the low price charged for it.", 
    "We thought it looked very good and for the price figured the quality might not be very good. When we took the pieces out of the box it was clear that some parts were not painted with the same batch of paint. The color of one of the doors was a noticeably different shade of red. Because we needed a piece of furniture and felt we did not have to shop for a replacement, we kept it. We ended up painting the doors a contrasting color and are making it 'do'. Also, the doors do not meet in the center, leaving a 0.25 inch gap, nor do they seal very well. The finish is delicate and does not resist scratches at all.", 
    "Do not purchase this buffet. 1. Not red, not even close, more like peony pink.2. Comes in a million pieces.3. The interlocking cams are so cheap, 3 cracked in half on the first turn. Then I was 3 short, they do not provide extras.4. The screws that attach the top front to the frame are 3/4 inch too short, tried longer screws and the frame split.Not worth the money or the cost to return it. I would give this item a minus 10 stars if I could. Poor is not strong enough rating.", 
    "Purchased this cabinet for my mom for Christmas, took a while for it to arrive. Therefore I had no time to exchange it. The factory had run too long of screws through the front piece, leaving screw holes in the front of the cabinet! So...had to be creative, went to HomeDepot bought a plate that goes behind a cabinet pull handle, also had to buy a hinge, for the decorative screws to use on the decorative plate(they come without screws) He put the plate on to cover the mess it came with. It took my very handy husband a couple of days to put together. Then he had to drill and put in new and more screws. It was to wobbly just to not do anything! It also had paint missing here and there, so we had some paint and fixed up the spots! What a job! It took a week to get everything done..it turned out beautiful, my mom loved it! Merry Christmas \ud83d\ude42", 
    "Received the buffet during the week of Xmas -- all I can say is that it really POPS my kitchen!! It takes time to put it together (at least for me) -- most importantly DO THE FRAME of the buffet right and then everything falls into place. You need two people to put it together (I did). What you see in the photo is what you get. VERY NICE PIECE.", 
    "Nice product with lots of storage. I suggest 2 people for assembly as there are a few larger pieces which makes it easier to stabilize while piecing it together! My wife & I assembled this in about 45 minutes. I am very happy with this red colored buffet. It is a subtle deep-red color that hints at antique finish. I wish I could find other furniture in this color as it goes very nicely with darker finished furniture & my hardwood floors!", 
    "The picture is pretty consistent. I did make one mistake because the instructions were a bit tricky for an amateur. But I'm still happy with the product!", 
    "Love it! Much bigger and higher quality than I expected for the price", 
    "We received this cabinet buffet from Overstock several weeks ago. I put it together myself, which took about 2 hours. While putting together I had to take a piece or two back apart to flip or allow another piece to be added (like while it was on its side and allowing for the top brace piece to be added. I found that when you take out the cam locks they don't quite go back or tighten again the second time. So, I ended up with at least two cam locks that are just kind of hanging in the holes they are in. All the pieces fit great and no issues with mis-aligned holes, etc. Color was also good and no scratches. Just be sure you don't have to back out those cheapo cam locks.", 
    "I love all the purchases that I've ordered from overstock.com", 
    "Assembling wouldn't have been bad if I had had another person helping me, like the instructions recommended. Trying to hold pieces while connecting others, and then flipping it over to work on the other side without another set of hands to support the unsecure pieces was a pain in the butt. Regarding the buffet itself, I'm very happy with it. It's exactly like pictured and perfect for my space. I'm also happy with the quality for the price. Great value.", 
    "I buy tons of furniture here to use staging homes (I'm a Realtor), and this buffet was the worst purchase ever. My boyfriend assembles all my furniture for me easily, but regarding this he said, and I quote: \"It gave me welts on my eyes and lesions on my brain.\" Even if you have the Instruction Manual recommended \"Two Persons Of Assembly\", you still will not be able to assemble this unless you also have multiple drill bits, boxes of screws, a blow torch, the blueprints to Area 57, and the two guys from Mythbusters.Save yourself. Save your relationships. Do not buy this piece of crap.", 
    "Its a nice buffet and I love the color .It took my husband about 3 hours to assemble it and he is very very handy .The instructions say it takes 2 people and my husband did it alone .All the other person would be able to hold it while the other did the work..The instructions are correct and you must follow them to the letter The finished product is an attractive eye catcher !", 
    "Very beautiful and well made. A real bargain.", 
    "Nice buffet. It takes about 1 hour to assemble.", 
    "Looks great but latches on doors are uneven and need adjusting. Back panel is cardboard like.", 
    "For the price you can't beat it", 
    "Very nice little cabinet. The color is a little on the pinky red side.", 
    "Material seems really cheap and lightweight. It's nice to look at, that's about it..", 
    "I'm not a diy person so my husband put it together. I really like it but we did reinforce the cabinet on the bottom due to heavy items making it bend. Love the color too.", 
    "This looks great in the room as I had envisioned it! The assembly always seems to be the hassle and some of the screws were difficult to get in (on door hinges) and another will not stay in connecting the top (still seems sturdy). Also be cautious when assembling the magnet door closure on top rail not to use the wrong screws as they went through the front. There are 4 screws in the packet and two are slightly longer. I am going to request touch-up paint and will hopefully be able to get it. The piece overall is very nice especially for the price.", 
    "The hutch design is attractive. Everyone compliments the rich color. The height and depth are perfect. I'm a bit cautious about its sturdiness. I would not move the piece without moving all of the contents. Assemblage requires two people. It is a nice addition to our room.", 
    "Nice color almost like picture, fits perfectly with our decor.", 
    "The assembly was difficult but once this was mastered I love this piece. It adds a pop of color in my dinning room and goes perfectly with my pictures, drapes and rug. The color is as shown.", 
    "Love Red, once put tover her it is beautiful. Took 2 guys to put together, took awhile.", 
    "I'm giving this cabinet 5 stars, but understand why some people give it less. It's for my office and is perfect there. The red color is great and the paint job was consistent (just commenting about this as someone else received a cabinet where this was an issue). If you're purchasing for your home and it's going to be used all the time just know it's not something that will last for generations to be passed on to your kids, but it's really great for the price. Not a centerpiece, but storage with some flavor :)", 
    "I truly loved it, the color, the finishing, etc and it fit perfectly with my home d\u00e9cor.", 
    "It came with a corner broke. It had drill holes in the wrong place so they re drilled in the right places and just left the other holes partially red. Four hours later after its together I realize it's split on the corner... Direction were awful..I would never buy that brand of anything again..", 
    "The only problem I have with this product is that it has a strong chemical odor. Over time it's not so bad, but when you open the doors you can smell it again.", 
    "This jaunty red cabinet is the perfect size for the nook I have and the colour is awesome! I've got an old 70s style kitchen with paneling and a brown floor, so this pop of red is just what it needs. It was fairly easy to put together and the materials are of good quality - especially for a flat packed product. I feel that I got my money's worth with this buffet. I'd buy it again.", 
    "This is a pretty piece of furniture for the money, but it is very difficult to put together. The holes for the dowels were off and I had to fill them in and drill new ones. 2 packs of screws were missing as well, and there was a chip on the front of the top. It took forever to put together, so I was unwilling to take apart and send back.", 
    "This buffet was a royal pain to build. The instructions were horrible, I had to take it apart and redo it several times. The cabinet doors are a darker color than the rest of it and don't line up properly. The screw holes for the hinges were lower on one side so there is a large gap and the other door is tweeked so the bottom magnet doesn't hold it closed. Also it came with 2 very large scratches on the bottom and middle shel ves. I would have requested they send me a new one, but i didn't want to have to build it again and it probably would have arrived with the same issues.", 
    "I bought this piece for my living room and am very disappointed with it. First, the assembly directions that come with it are unclear. Second, the left panel's predrilled holes were off by a quarter of an inch, making it impossible to slide the back panel in. Third, the color is more of a deep pink than red. This is the second piece of furniture that I have bought from Overstock and have been extremely disappointed with (the ottoman I purchased was broken when I pulled it out of the box). I will NOT be purchasing any other furniture from this website in the future!", 
    "I love my new buffet! It's exactly what I was looking for and the color is perfect. It's probably not high end quality, but I didn't want to pay high end price. It certainly does not look cheap!", 
    "I purchased the red cabinet because I wanted an Antique Chinese cabinet. Fortunately the style and my addition of Chinese Cabinet Hardware, I have been able to create my ideal cabinet. I had no problems putting it together and it is very sturdy and a stylish piece.", 
    "Took us two 3 hours to put together one of the buffets. 3 hours for the other. They went together smoothly, all parts were there except for one screw which we had a similar one on hand from other projects. I feel it takes two working well with each other to put one of these buffets together. I tried doing first by myself, but needed another set of hands about mid way through. For the second buffet we did a few things differently from the first as we put parts together but in all we followed the pages of directions. Luckily no major chips or cracks in the wood parts though a few pieces have edges that are marred from I guess pressure points being in the shipping carton. We are using these two buffets in our large bedroom turned computer room for hiding storage boxes of computer stuff and techy books, their looks work well with our painted bookcases, desks and metal office cabinets.", 
    "The buffet is just what I expected except for the color. It is more of a wine color than red.", 
    "Don't get this unless you really want to be challenged. This was not fun to put together.I have put together a lot of furniture, but this one made me pull my hair out. The instructions were vague pictures that gave you no real order of how to assemble this. They supplied the cheapest screws and hardware and no extras. I was short 4 cam bolts and it was very difficult to reach anyone in the *** customer service dept. Left an email and after a few days got a reply that the bolts would be sent. I love the color of this piece but that is it. It is a cheap product, good enough to keep a few odds and ends dishes in. The top already is scratched from I don:t know what.", 
    "Very cheaply made. Thin panels, multiple scratches and imperfections. I'm very experienced and good at putting furniture together, I always get suckered into doing it for friends and family... This item has terrible instructions, panels are not clearly marked, and on the front top crossbar in particular the diagram doesn't clearly show which side is up/down (both sides have holes of various sizes) I would not purchase this again, nor will I buy any other Montego products.", 
    "As the other reviewers stated, the instructions to assemble are just poor pictures. Although Mine appears red and maroon, the paint looks inconsistently spray painted on. The smell of the paint also has not disappated in the two weeks that I have had this. On the bright side, all of my pieces were included, and this buffet has proven to be sturdy. I really needed an inexpensive piece of red furniture so I am keeping this, but definitely would have returned it if it were cheaper."
