    "I absolutely adore this chair. I am 5'7\" -125 lbs and I have no difficulties getting in and out of the chair. However the seat cushion isn't very wide, so a larger person may have issues. This chair stands out in my living room and has a great mid-century feel. The chair does have a shorter profile so if you are looking for a tall - more bulky piece - then this is not for you. Lastly, I believe the navy color is as close to a true navy you are going to get. Thanks for a fabulous chair overstock!", 
    "I spent a lot of time researching navy mid-century modern armchairs at a decent price, and this one definitely fit the bill! The colors are very true to picture. Material is comfortable, but not soft, if that is what you're looking for. Assembly was easy. The only tricky part was determining which were the front legs vs the back legs, since they are not clearly marked in the instructions. Tip: the back legs the angled ones.", 
    "The seat cushion is quite uneven. Only four of the 12 holes that the screws are supposed to go in were pre-drilled. The fabric almost has a white effect on the sides of each arms where the interior wood has rubbed against it. These are going back.", 
    "Ordered a pair, chair is good quality and expensive looking for the price. However, when I screwed in the legs, one of the chairs came out fine and the other one came out lopsided. Not sure where I went wrong, but they should provide better instructions if all the legs are not exactly the same.", 
    "I basically wanted a chair for my bedroom that looked inviting and fit for a bedroom, but mainly one that I could just throw my clothes on. Voila! This chair is perfect for both. First the color is just so pretty; a deep denim blue, and I liked it so much I bought curtains with the same shade of blue so now it looks like I hired a decorator.. The price also could not be beat, it's well made and I think it's comfortable even though I have read that it is a little firm. It's perfect in every way, and delivery was prompt and there was nothing wrong with it!!! Hey, I am happy!", 
    "Color is accurate. Nice size for smaller living room.", 
    "Great for the price. Looks gorgeous. Very happy", 
    "This chair is beautiful. The navy is as pictured and the chair is quite comfy. I do worry how long it would last with use though. I'd estimate about a year before the cushion starts getting all deformed. I had an issue with one of the leg screw holes. The screw wouldn't go all the way in (probably construction issue with the hole). The screw only went half way so if you look at the legs you can see the half sticking out. I decided not to return it because all the other screws were in tightly and it would have been more of a pain taking the chair legs off than having one unsightly screw peaking out.", 
    "The color and look of this chair are great, but it is not a comfortable chair to sit in. Every time I do sit in it for longer than 10 minutes, when I get up my back hurts. Not worth it.", 
    "The chair is as represented. Color is consistent with photos. Comfortable. Used in a bedroom. Client pleased. Would purchase again.", 
    "looks great. love the fabric. easy to assemble", 
    "Good size and very comfortable.", 
    "Lightweight, moves about easily on tile floor when you are sitting. Average quality fabric, legs look plasticky, its missing those beautiful wood grain on them. Cool overall shape, I like that is slightly oversized and its comfortable to sit in.", 
    "This is in our office and we get many compliments. Very sturdy too.", 
    "This chair is nice for the overstock price, but would have been unsatisfactory at a retail price. The fabric and design are nice, but the chair is slight and very short/small. I also wonder how it would stand up to frequent use. We purchased ours for the guest room where it will rarely, if ever, be sat in. It looks very small/short in the same room as the queen sized bed, so be sure you take the measurements into consideration. We were aware of the measurements, but the chair still seemed very small. But like I said, it is a cute chair with great styling and nice fabric. Legs are a bit slight, but that's part of the design.", 
    "Exactly what I wanted for my space.", 
    "I love this chair. Its on the smaller side and rather stiff, but as an accent piece its beautiful. The back legs do seem to be at a slightly odd angle (very slight) but if the piece is against a wall or in a corner, its not something you see anyway."
