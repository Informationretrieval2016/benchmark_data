  "reviews": [
    "looks beautiful in the provided pictures, but has dozens of pieces to install per unit, missing and/or wrong parts provided, difficult instructions to follow and also time consuming to put together,I recommend ( as I have done after returning it) an assembled unit , ready to use(more $ bur worth it)", 
    "As others have indicated the assembly of this set is a little tedious however it went pretty quickly after I got the hang of it. I like that this set is more slim than other sets I have looked at. The space this is for is fairly narrow so this smaller set works perfect while still having good size seats. The chair pad material seems to keep water from soaking in pretty well so I am hopeful it will hold up to some tough weather. I will add that te chair pads thinner than I expected and something I will probably look to change out next season.", 
    "Just the right size for our space ( not bulky). The grey color is perfect. The price is appropriate. Pleased. Assembly was not difficult. More parts mean more solid. Recommend.", 
    "This set is cheaply made and hard to put together. They also forgot the whole back side to my bench and couldn't just send me the piece -- I had to be sent another full set and then deal with shipping it back. I would suggest getting something else. Does look like the photo once assembled.", 
    "I was very pleased with the Malmo 4 piece resin Wicker conversation set. Although, it is scalrf small for a 6'4\" male frame, I find that I can sit in the chairs and love seat comfortably. If you live in an area with sever winds, I would suggest to weight the pieces, or move them inside when high winds are expected. They are a little light weight, however, that makes them easy to move around. They are good quality for the price. The only drawback is that I had to put the pieces together, but that was not difficult.I highly recommend them.", 
    "I am so impressed with the quality of the items that Overstock.com carries. We wanted outdoor furniture for our covered lanai by our pool, but didn't want to spend a fortune. This set is just perfect for us! The brown color is as pictured, as are the turquoise cushions. The resin material does not look cheap, although I will probably replace the cushions at some point as they are a little thin. The chairs and love seat are very comfortable. I love the fact that the table has a glass top and it's very nice. The set was fairly easy to put together and seems as though it will last.", 
    "IT took about an hour to build but worth every moment!", 
    "Perfect for a small deck not sure how it will hold up in the sun though", 
    "Nice a little pricey but sturdy and comfortable", 
    "Do not bug ordering this set. It is very small, very difficult to put together and items are missing. Screws do not line up. That one is just not worth the hassle.", 
    "Takes forever to put together, but once together, the pieces are really nice. Pillows are not thick but comfortable enough. Weathers pretty well. Fits nicely on my small patio but the pieces feel comfy and big enough when you're sitting on them. Good buy.", 
    "Very nice for the money. You will need back cushions as well but the set looks and feels very nice.", 
    "save your time and money. buy something that comes assembled. this came with all these parts to assemble and no parts had labels as to what goes with what. now I've figured it out and 1 chair the arm doesn't fit..", 
    "was exactly as described, super happy", 
    "I love this outdoor set. I purchased it at the beginning of the summer. My family and I have gotten great use out of it. It is great quality and made a great addition to my other deck. I am very pleased that I purchased it.", 
    "We hang out in these bad boys a couple times a week. They look and feel great.", 
    "The only problem with this was that the holes on the loveseat were way off. Luckily I have a friend who could drill new holes. The set is very comfortable and look great.", 
    "The set is pretty and I like it. It is difficult to put together because wholes don't line up well. Good deal. I gave it good because it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be.", 
    "This set is gorgeous and was a snap to put together.Directions were excellent.Very Happy with purchase.", 
    "I liked the items I purchased. Quality seems good but lots of parts to screw and bolt together. Came with small tools but we had to use our own tools as the tools that came with it were very basic. Took us about 3 hours to build. The screws and bolts for the table were missing so we had to go to a hardware store to purchase them.", 
    "Nice furniture for the price. It's an inexpensive set that is comfortable and looks nice. I would buy it again. Assembly took an hour or so but was pretty straightforward.", 
    "advertised as assembled NOT. missing pieces, was terrible experience.", 
    "I had a problem initially with missing parts. After a few emails and phone calls I was able to get that resolved and Overstock customer service people were nice. When putting the chairs together the brackets didn't align very well where you put the bolts in and was a lot of bending of the parts to get it all put together. I would not really recommend this product but buying from Overstock was not a bad experience.", 
    "It was more than a hassle to get this item to my house and then assembled because of UPS. Now it is together and is beautiful on my front porch.", 
    "Picture looks much better that the reality. it is just ok. Too much assembly thought", 
    "look nice but but it arrived in WORSE condition , missing parts !!!", 
    "Good price but smaller then expected. I needed to replace the cushions.I looked for a cover for this unit at Overstock and I chated with Customer Service, they said they do not carry a cover for this product. I ask what size should I be looking for, CS did not have a answer."
