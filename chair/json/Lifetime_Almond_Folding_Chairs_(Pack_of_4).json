    "Very comftorable and durable. Defiantly not your mom and dad's old rusty folding chairs. Looks nice to boot!", 
    "Looking for light weight portable chair and this chair fit the requirements.I have not used it enough to confirm long term durability.The product meets my requirements well.", 
    "These chairs are VERY comfortable and easy to clean. They are robust for repeated uses indoors and out. One of our chairs arrived with shipping damage. The Lifetime team replaced it quickly and to our satisfaction at no additional cost.", 
    "These chairs are perfect. I looked around at *** and *** and only found folding chairs with ratty looking cushions that get dirty over time. These chairs are sturdier, look much nicer and stack nicely. I am much happier that I waited and bought these chairs. I might even purchase more!", 
    "These sturdy and quality chairs were the best buy for times when you need additional seating for extra guests during special occasions and parties. They are reasonably priced and can be folded and stored neatly without taking so much space.", 
    "These have always been my favoritesVery strong and sturdy chairsLove them!", 
    "Couldn't ask for a better made chair. Very comfortable and well built, easy to clean", 
    "Nice productBad packaging, flimsy box", 
    "I first say this brand of chair at a church function. They are very comfortable even after a couple of hours. The ones at the church are a couple of years old and are holding up great even after weekly use. Overstock price is competitive and with door to door delivery makes all the difference. These chairs clean up extremely easy, just spray with any cleaner and wipe. If they are a little more dirty then use a little Clorox soft scrub cleaner and spray with the garden hose. Stacking is also easy. Much more comfortable than metal, even metal with vinyl padding. Metal chairs may be more economical but these chairs are perfect for me and I am slightly larger than normal.", 
    "comfortable and does not take up much space in closet", 
    "Good chairs that meet the need. Not flimsy. Shaping makes them more comfortable (for a hard chair). Clean easily and fold nicely.", 
    "These chairs are great. They are very sturdy and easy to fold up. They are also curved so that they are more comfortable than the old metal folding chairs."
