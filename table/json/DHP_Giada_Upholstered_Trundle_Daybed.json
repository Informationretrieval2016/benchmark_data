    "Easy to assemble, looks very nice. We needed two daybeds for two different rooms. This one is my favorite because you can leave the bedding on the trundle and still push it in during the day. The other style of daybed we bought you have to take off the blankets because they are to bulky and there isn't enough clearance in order to push the trundle in.So the design on this bed is much better!", 
    "This particular faux leather looks like plastic. I've seen faux leather that almost looks real. The seams were not flat and neat and although it looked as it could be a cute daybed, it looked to cheap to keep. Sending it back. PS: You must fully assemble this bed. There were a lot of nuts and bolts and it's not even partially put together.", 
    "I really like it but it's a little wobbly. I've tighten all the connections as much as I could and it still sways side to side.", 
    "Easy instructions, easy to assemble.Excellent quality.Love it!", 
    "Bought this for my 97 year old grandmother who weighs 125 pounds to sleep in when she moved in . In LESS than TWO MONTHS the metal crossbar is bent and the sides are not very sturdy. It looks pretty but thats about it.", 
    "For a $$$$ mattress for $$$ great deal!"
