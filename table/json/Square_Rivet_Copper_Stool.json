    "i have a rather artsy home and was in need of a container to store our dog toys. i flipped this over and turned this into a DOGGIE storage container. think outside the box because you can use this for so much more than a table. i actually heard my dog say how great it looks in the corner of our kitchen. thanx overstock - you RULE.", 
    "I needed a stool for my art room and liked that this was unique looking and could be used as a plant stand, a pet toy bin, a stool or even a small table. One of our cats had to crawl inside just to try it out, so it received feline approval as well.", 
    "I needed a side table for my new taupe leather arm chair. I wanted something different, with texture and character. This piece fit the bill perfectly at a very reasonable price. Warning: If you have small children, it may become a very handy Steel Drum! ;-)", 
    "Works great in the salon for holding extra magazines and clients' tea cups, but is not meant to support anything for too long.", 
    "This is a darling piece. It is being used as a side table in the living room of our coastal vacation home. I place some greenery within the middle of this and it makes a nice conversation piece as well as being useful. Love that it is metal and is nicely made. Great piece.", 
    "Light and just as pictured.", 
    "This is a well crafted sturdy piece. Has a classic industrial feel that adds character to my living room. Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "purchased two to use as bedside tables in our guest room--they are low, so perfect for the low-profile platform bed we have there.They are very unique--well-constructed and look really nice in the room. One of the two we ordered arrived with several what I can only describe as 'splotches' on the top. I returned it and the replacement looks great, as does the other one. For the price these are a great value for those looking for something a little different.", 
    "Wonderfully different piece of furniture. It will last long after I'm gone. I use it as a side table. But, it has been used as a stool and a drum. It's a wonderful addition to my living room and I'm very happy with this purchase!", 
    "Really pretty and versatile. Can't leave it outdoors in the rain because it rusts.", 
    "Like some reviews have said before, the product may be a bit darker than described (copper), but I was very happy with the color. I have a lot of dark browns in my living room with light oak floors and the color works great with both of these. The quality of the product seems good--I am using it as an end table next to a recliner and it is the perfect size and height. It looks great.", 
    "I like the look of this piece, I bought it as an unusual nightstand, but in truth it's a little small for that, so we've switched it to a side table. It's beautiful, much more copper than the photo shows - however, the title does say \"copper-colored\"!", 
    "The rivet stool was exactly as the internet picture, it fits my d\u00e9cor perfectly. Thank You Overstock for your fast delivery on this item.", 
    "This coppery steel table/stool is fantastic! It looks great, the rivets are done well, and the coppery hue is more noticeable than in the photo. Expect imperfections from the handcrafted piece-but I feel they add to the rustic look and charm of the piece. Excellent quality...a definite recommend.", 
    "I really, l really love this stool. Works as a small table or a place to rest your rear at the coffee table. Most of all it looks great- very industrial and ethnic. It's so unique. I just love this.", 
    "just as i though it would be, this sight is always on the money!", 
    "Needed a small table for the end of a piece of furniture and this works perfect.", 
    "Love it!! Perfect to use as an end table.", 
    "Receive many compliments on this stool. It is real copper. I know this because my dog (who strangely enough is also named Copper) decided to hike his leg and mark it. It created a very nice patina which I have to explain to company now. Other than that, I love this stool.", 
    "I bought two of these stools and used them on each side of my flat screen tv..... I put decorative accent lamps on each side, in our cabin home... Very nice, and rustic ! I was very happy !", 
    "I bought 2 of these to use together as a coffee table grouping. They are very effective used in my eclectic living room. But these are stools, and are built with a concave top--no good for a tabletop. So I got glass cut to fit each stool exactly (take each one to your glass place as they are not perfect) and used felt stickies to keep the glass away from the top. Some work, but I am very pleased with the end product.", 
    "I was looking for a small, but functional table to next to my new tub...to rest my ipad, a glass of wine, extra towel. This table was just the thing: lightweight but sturdy, a pretty color., right size.", 
    "Item was used in a remodeling of an office and it has a lamp on it. Everything matched and it was the correct height and width to not be unnoticed or overbearing.", 
    "way to small for an end table . very good quality.do like just wish bigger", 
    "color is too dark to be considered copper colored looks nice with planter on top packaged well"
