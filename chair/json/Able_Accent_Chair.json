    "Love it....it's comfortable and stylish", 
    "Beautiful and comfortable chair.. Easy to put together. Love it!", 
    "Love this chair - it fits my living room decor and provides comfortable seating. Easy to assemble too!", 
    "I'm very disappointed with this chair! There is no scotch guarding or fabric protection at all! We had them for less than six weeks when we noticed a light stain on it. When we tried to clean the stain with water and a cotton cloth the dye from the grey in the design bled all over the fabric. Now the fabric has a grayish tint along with the stain and the grey in the design is a spotted black! Now we are stuck with a pair of chairs that look like they are ready to be recycled and they are BRAND NEW!", 
    "Very well priced, I ordered 2 of these chairs and they look fantastic in our room. Stylish and comfortable, they are well designed, deep and wide. The fabric is fun with a little velvet running through. I received them within a week of order which is very fast in my opinion. Also, the assembly was easy.", 
    "Nice chair, contemporary, great addition to any room with bright colors and geometric patterns", 
    "I am very happy with this accent chair. It\u0092s lovely and sturdy, but the color is burgundy instead of red. The seat is large which I really like, and the chair was quite easy to assemble. It took about 15 minutes.", 
    "I ordered these chairs to go with my gray fabric couch so it worked out for me. The wood is not exactly espresso - it has a reddish tinge and is not dark enough to match the standard espresso. The red ovals are actually maroon and the yellow is more of a sand/ocher color. if you are looking to have this match something 'red' then just know that it is most certainly not red and is maroon. The maroon print is soft and has a velvety feel to it. the rest of the print is pretty much on the fabric and is not as soft as the maroon. I got these on sale (*** I think) and to me they were worth at that price. Assembly was very simple.", 
    "The chair has hot pink and green in it. Along with blue and burgundy. It shows different on the computer. But the like hot pink does not look good"
