    "I needed a small cabinet with extra shelf space that would allow me to store things conveniently that would not fit into my existing bathroom cabinets. This fits the bill. What I especially like about it are the front door glass panels. Anything I put into the cabinet cannot be seen unless the doors are open. Most bathroom cabinets that have glass insertions are see through. My towels are pretty but I would rather see the very attractive doors on this cabinet from the outside rather then my towels that are stored on the inside. The cabinet has 2 shelves on the bottom along with the 2 doors and an open shelf on top where I keep a basket in which I put soap and other small items. I also put a very pretty runner on the top of the cabinet which adds to its attractiveness. I could see this item being placed in a hallway or bedroom as well as a bathroom. If you are limited in space but need additional room to put your stuff this might be the item to buy. The color it comes in is called expresso which is a very dark brown. This fits in perfectly with my bathroom's color scheme and matches my existing bathroom cabinets perfectly. Perfect size, perfect price and attractive and functional as well. Easy to assemble with everything needed included. No parts were missing and my husband assembled it in less then a half hour.", 
    "Excellent product for a \"build yourself\" piece. I have built many of the home assembly type products and this was by far the most durable. Add to that the over-all look... and it's a winner. Took me about 30 minutes to put this together. Only \"con\" was I wish it was a few inches bigger in each direction, but it is exactly sized as advertised, so, can't complain about that. Also bough the wall shelf to hang above, so I have a functioning linen closet now, (small, very old home / no storage). If this thing catches your eye, and you dig the price, you wont regret buying it. I don't.", 
    "Love this cabinet! Came in fast and was relatively easy to put together. The only draw back is that it has a strong chemical smell that is taking several days to fade. But I am leaving it in a well ventilated area. But it looks great and I am very happy with it!", 
    "From opening the package, cleaning and identifying the parts, reading the directions (mostly pictures) to assembling and placing it in my dressing area it took me, an over the hill female, exactly two hours to complete. The picture is a true representation of the cabinet. If you place something inside the cabinet, the glass doors do not camouflage the contents. The door hinges are not the cheap kind and the doors close securely to the magnet. The feet are wood and screw into the bottom. The cabinet is level and sturdy. I'm using this as storage for my towels and beauty products and the dark brown fits into my decor. For what I purchased it for, it is doing the job.", 
    "Not only is the cabinet beautiful, it is also very well designed to be easily assembled. Everything supposed to be in the box was in the box. It only took this little old lady and two Phillips screw drivers to assemble in 25 -30 minutes. Just follow the abc diagram and everything fits perfectly. In addition to the screws, a tube of glue was included. I decided not to use the glue since everything was fitting so well with just the screws.One thing that does not bother me, but may bother someone else......though the doors are nice and heavy and hang in perfect alignment, when closed, there is about a 1/4 inch gap between them However. The magnets are strong and the doors stay closed. The dark brown finish is pretty. No blemishes. It was packed very well with protective foam sheets covering the pieces.", 
    "The construction and quality is cheap pressboard, but what do you expect for the money? Serves a temporary purpose. Doesn't last in a damp atmosphere and that is a problem for a bathroom cabinet. Does look nicer than it should by all accounts and goes together easily. The box was damaged and that worried me because of the panels can't be fixed if smashed.", 
    "Thought the color to be more like a milk chocolate brown than espresso. Easily assembled. Materials quality OK but not first class. Finish chips easily. We ended up relocating from bath to breakfast area and use as a phone stand", 
    "I couldn't find the matching wall cabinet here, so searched and found it on amazon. I am redoing my bathroom and these look so lovely. It was easy to put together (so said my son). I wasn't too sure how well the 'mosaic glass' would look in person, but the picture doesn't do it any justice. Its nice and reflective. Puts a little bling as a touch. Love it!", 
    "this is a very nice piece of furniture for the money. The only thing I have to say negative is the doors don't line up exact.they are pretty close but just not quite. other than that it looks very nice, its good and sturdy, it was packaged very well and if you are careful of it I can see it lasting for a good long time.", 
    "Perfect for holding TV accessories, etc. Easy assembly, nice looking., sturdy.", 
    "I ordered this cabinet as a corner TV stand fin our bedroom. I needed something with an open shelf for the DVR box. It's perfect! For \"build it yourself\" furniture, the quality is excellent! The mosaic panels are QUITE shiny -- I'm not sure I love that, but I know I can paint them or tile them or otherwise easily change them. I highly recommend this cabinet!", 
    "This is a really lovely piece that fits so nicely in our bathroom and provides a great bit of storage behind the glass doors. NOTE - the doors are clear, not \"blue-ish\" as they appear on my screen. The middle is a nice textured gold which keeps junk kinda hidden, and the clear glass keeps the room looking light and airy still but without showing all our mess. The open shelf is great for frequently used items. I put this together myself in about an hr, only enlisting help with holding a side together to make it easier. Instructions were very easy to follow.", 
    "In all, I am happy with my purchase. When reading the dimensions, I expected a larger piece but that was my misunderstanding. The top extends over the sides and front so that is the dimension given. The height includes the legs. The actual storage area is smaller. The \"golden\" area shown in the doors is a bit strange but acceptable.", 
    "This is a beautiful piece of furniture that is built to last. We are thrilled with the quality and design.", 
    "Very satisfied. I 'm sure I would have never found anything like this had a been shopping around locally. Arrived quickly. Easy to assemble. Very satisfied.", 
    "I have this in my entryway. I have gotten compliments on it. It's not the heaviest but it does what I bought it for. Nice piece for the price.", 
    "Fit the area where needed perfectly.", 
    "This matches my bedroom set beautifully! Great for storing bathroom items out of sight.", 
    "I'm very pleased with this cabinet. It adds extra storage in my hallway, and the glass doors are just as nice as they looked online.", 
    "Everything arrived in good condition and it was fairly easy to assemble. The back required us to drill our own holes instead of providing them so it was helpful to have an automatic screw driver - which would be my only complaint.", 
    "The cabinet was exactly as the description described and was pretty easy to put together.", 
    "This is a very beautiful cabinet good quality a must by", 
    "This is a nice piece and easy to put together .. just wish the doors would line up better (I don't think I've ever been able to get the doors to line up on any piece of furniture I've bought online) .. it's bigger / taller than I expected, even though I looked at the measurements before buying .. maybe it's just too big for where I wanted to put it (but that's not the fault of the piece, it's mine) .. I would recommend it but not if the price goes up .. I paid $122 and feel it's worth that but no more ..", 
    "Love it! It's easy to put together and made very well! I would recommend it to everyone! !", 
    "Just like the wall cabinet, it was easy to assemble and looks beautiful - matches my bathroom cabinets perfectly.", 
    "This is a very nice and elegant piece. Plenty of storage for all your bathroom items. Open shelf holds magazines perfectly. No need to have a separate magazine holder or basket. Goes great with the wall cabinet. Very sturdy and worth every penny. Get lots of compliments.", 
    "This little cabinet works great in a large bathroom area! It gave the room a whole new look. Not hard to put together if you read the instructions. For the price, this cabinet is a great value!", 
    "Well made , instructions for assembly well written and easy to follow !!", 
    "Perfect!! It is exactly what I wanted.", 
    "Just what I wanted. Looks nice too", 
    "We were looking for a cabinet to store video components that would be a nice accent piece. This fit the bill nicely!", 
    "It was easy to put together.. Quality is what you would expect for the price. Don't over tighten or the hardware will come thru the pressed wood.", 
    "Bought for my bathroom. Sturdy, attractive and very functional. Looks more expensive than it is.", 
    "does not store many things", 
    "Nice cabinet. Good quality for price. Looks great in entryway", 
    "Really like this cabinet for my treatment room, perfect for essental oils and crystals. just as pretty as pictured.", 
    "I bought 2 of these to display pictures on top, nicknacks in the middle and gemstone carving inside. (Less dusting) easy to put together and looks great", 
    "Perfect size for area I ordered it for and it looks great. Was it easy to assemble.", 
    "Great for storing extra pieces of cookware.", 
    "Helps with storage in bedroom. Bottom of cabinet is warping.", 
    "Top had a small chip in the corner and pre-drilled holes for doors were off a little causing the doors not to line up perfectly, but for the price, it does the trick.", 
    "This is a beautiful cabinet, at an incredible price. We bought it to fit into a small corner of our guest bathroom, and we are quite pleased with it. It's big enough to hold whatever we need, its well-made (nice details), and is attractive.", 
    "Every time I walk into my bathroom and see this cabinet I am so happy I purchased it. Easy to put together and looks like a much more expensive piece of furniture.", 
    "I really liked the way this cabinet looked and it was the perfect size for my small bathroom. Unfortunately, it is very poorly made and several parts broke when we were assembling it. The instructions are hard to understand, even by an experienced assembler, and one of the nuts broke just by using a screwdriver to tighten it. No, it was not screwed too tightly, just piece of crap hardware. Then, when trying to insert one of the dowels for the shelf, the fake wood just splintered. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone. If I could give it a zero, I would.", 
    "I ordered four pieces of furniture from Overstock .... And wasn't looking forward to putting them together ... Ugh! However this piece was really and truly a breeze .... Much more sturdy than I thought it would be ...I don't feel the need to attach to the wall ... The magnets ( while not being the strongest) do work and keep the doors shut ...... I just put it in my bathroom .... I would definitely recommend this piece to others ... As long as you're looking for small piece of furniture ( fits apartment perfectly)... As others have commented .. The color is dark ... Close to black ... Beautiful panels in the front ... Looks gorgeous ... You'll be glad you bought it!!", 
    "Excellent construction and the size is perfect. Fits all items wonderfully and looks very stylish.", 
    "Comes flat packed and requires about 90 mins assembly but it's pretty easy and foolproof. Lots of off gassing when first out of the box, but w/in a day no longer smelled it. Very happy with it thus far. Good value.", 
    "Item was easy to put together and is quite beautiful!", 
    "Nice product but be patient. You have to put this together yourself. Not difficult but you have to pay attention to what your doing or you have to disassemble and start over. It looks good but not does not assemble perfectly.", 
    "Excellent for the price looks more expensive than it is", 
    "It took me over a week to decide when I was going to put this together. It was so heavy moving the box, I kinda freaked a bit. Here's my review of the Jezzebel Double-door 3 shelf Floor Cabinet.Pros: They label everything, each piece has a letter on it. Even the packaging of the screws and bolts. All numbered. \"LOVED THAT\"The glass doors are in it's own box, and are covered to protect the glass. Really the cherry wood in pictures does not do this piece justice! With a drill I was able to put this together within an hour, taking phone a couple of phone breaks. Every piece fit perfectly, I would suggest some gorilla glue for the wood pegs they just seemed flimsy without it. Cons: The Styrofoam GETS Everywhere! You will have to clean the cabinet afterwards. I would suggest putting this together in a garage or someplace where you won't get it on your other furniture. Also they give you the option to hang this on the wall. I would not suggest it, the piece to hang this with the addition to the towels just don't seem to hold it on the wall.", 
    "It's a nice Cabinet that is built well! I loved the whole experience.", 
    "This cabinet is just what I was looking for to put in my small bathroom.", 
    "Love this unit!!! Awesome addition to bathroom.", 
    "This table is a GREAT accent piece to my guest bathroom....but it was a bit wobbly after it was put together. I just placed something underneath it but I love it anyway....", 
    "Holds drinks in my office. Easy to put together", 
    "Nice worked well in foyer", 
    "This is a very rich looking cabinet and it goes well in my small cabinet.", 
    "We actually needed this in our living room in order to put picture frames and a lamp on it looks really nice the only reason I did not give it five stars is because it came with a little chip on the front other than that it looks very nice looks to be like real wood and I love the detail with the broken glass and matches our Decor perfectly", 
    "Perfect for a small bathroom", 
    "Not only does it fit my apartment; it is sturdy, easy to assemble, and quite lovely.", 
    "me llego bien y lo are quedo muy lindo igual que la foto", 
    "Great item, was fairly easy to put together, excellent color, although I suggest to assemble it on a carpet, easily scratched. Solid, sturdy and great quality for the price. Recommended.", 
    "The cabinet is quite cute from afar. It is a little smaller than anticipated. It is also fairly cheap materials. The backing is just cardboard. The doors close by magnets that only work half the time.", 
    "So I don't like the same old look - I have a one sink master bathroom with a large counter where another sink should be. We are not ready to remodel so I bought this and put on the counter and it took my drab bathroom to an amazing high end look. My husband thinks we don't need to remodel now ( we will ; ) All of our grooming items are neatly hidden away and the look is amazing. Our 5 year old granddaughter even thought it was beautiful. No issues when it arrived and easy to assemble. The glass has a nice crackle sparkle giving it a fashionable look.", 
    "Very classy cabinet. Used in our dental office for toiletries in the patient bathroom. Serves the purpose well. Very well constructed and easy assembly.", 
    "It was exactly what I was looking for and it came just how the picture looked and how it was described.", 
    "I brought this item for my half bath it is perfect the corner I needed it for, I have gotten several good comments on it.", 
    "Received this in the mail several weeks ago---took my husband less than 45 mins. to put together. It is perfect. If you are looking for a deep cabinet it is not for you, but works for extra storage in our great room. The only fault I would say is that the back piece is flimsy. Looks good though and worth the cheap price.", 
    "We are using it as a liquor cabinet in our living room and I was surprised to see how much it can actually fit in the small space. Very stylish and was simple to put together.", 
    "I liked the look of this piece offered on Overstock, but once I got it and put it together I discovered that the width of the doors are too narrow and do not quite meet in the middle to shut the cabinet. There is about a 2 inch gap between the left and right door. Don't know if this was just a one time fluke, or an issue with each cabinet. In any case, too much trouble to take it apart and send it back. It still looks pretty good with the gap in the doors. Be forewarned!!", 
    "Cabinet arrived safely and was easy to assemble. The quality was excellent for the price and it looks exactly as pictured. I use it in one of the bathrooms and it has sufficient room to store towels and other bath accessories. I loved that it has a matching wall cabinet as well. Excellent purchase and I highly recommend it.", 
    "Came right on time and is top quality. Looks great in my kitchen with all my canning jars from my garden!", 
    "this sits in the hallway of my bathroom and i use it to store toiletries It is exactly as pictured very good detail, easy to assemble. however smaller than i expected", 
    "Beautiful meets my needs perfectly extra bath storage", 
    "I don't recall ever being so disappointed with a product I bought online. The amber mosaic is not really amber color; it is more gray/brown than amber. My biggest problem however is that the hardware to put the product together was completely inadequate. The cam bolts, screws and pegs were way too thin and short so that it was impossible to assemble. I am a long-time DIYer so assembling this cabinet should have posed no challenge. I left it on my workbench in my garage, planning to send it back - only to find that my husband had taken it to the landfill with some other debris and wood scraps. Good place for it, although it would have served me better getting a refund. Oh well. Live and learn. Don't recommend.", 
    "It comes in many pieces, has to be completely assembled, but has easy-to-follow instructions. The mosaic fronts are nice. It's smaller than I expected so check your measurements. Nice cabinet for the price!", 
    "Very happy with the price and purchase", 
    "Fits beautifully in a small space and allows good storage.", 
    "This was an involved cabinet to assemble, not as simple as the other reviews implied. My dad did it for me and he needed me to hold things steady as he went along; so, I don't think this would be a one-person assembly job. Once assembled, however, the piece is lovely. The colored glass is beautiful. The lines are clean and uncomplicated. The storage is not very deep; but, still, it meets my needs very well. I would definitely purchase another piece in this line. The price was excellent. A great value!", 
    "I am very happy with the look of the cabinet, especially the amber mosaic door panels. It wasn't difficult to assemble, just a lot of steps. Took me about an hour. The back panels are total cardboard, but nobody will know unless I tell them. From a distance it's a beautiful piece. For the price, it's a good deal.", 
    "It's the size and look I needed, but not very good quality for the money. More like a $$ cabinet in quality. But, it matches, fits, and looks good where I needed it in my bathroom, behind the door!", 
    "Ordered this for my hallway. The size is perfect and the best part is the extra storage!!! LUV ut", 
    "Love this cabinet! Easy to put together and is a great accent for my bathroom!", 
    "This cabinet is small when I was in need of a larger cabinet. In receiving it, I made do but it is not what I had hoped for.", 
    "Assembly was time consuming and missing a few screws. Back of cabinet is cheap and flimsy. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.", 
    "I like itI like itI like itI like itI like it", 
    "I like everything about this cabinet as far as looks and functionality go. However, when I was putting it together being very careful to not damage it, I still chipped off the finish in two places. One chip was from scratching off an assembly sticker letter on a shelf with my fingernail.", 
    "Sturdy, elegant and perfect for the spot I had intended for. Easy to assemble just used a manual screwdriver. Instructions to assemble very easy to follow. Great value. Shipment arrived sooner than expected.", 
    "This is a small but very nice cabinet. We had no trouble putting it together and everything lined up perfectly when we did. It is very pretty and I am very happy with it.", 
    "Awesome piece. Great looking!", 
    "Pleasantly surprised with this piece. It is exactly what I was looking for and the finish is quite beautiful. Would recommend!!!!!!!", 
    "This was simple to put together. We are using it as a coffee station in our dining room. It holds our Kcup machine and all of our coffee/tea supplies very well. Quality is nice.", 
    "Good cabinet, especially for the price. I had been looking for a small cabinet to store towels in because my new house does not have a linen closet. The cabinet was pretty easy to assemble and took me an hour or less. Decent quality and the price is hard to beat. Love the crackled glass on the front as well.", 
    "this cabinet serves its function but not overly impressed with the workmanship. typical product made in china", 
    "The legs were cut different lengths. No matter what surface I put it on it would rock and was unstable.", 
    "This piece was very easy to put together, and looks very nice. I bought it for my bathroom, I only wish it was bigger. It is a little narrow for folded towels, and I wish it was higher. It is pretty sturdy though and overall I think it is a good purchase.", 
    "We needed a cabinet for my husband's bathroom at his business. This is a nice little cabinet that is constructed pretty well and works well....especially for the money. I wouldn't put it in a high end home, but for most, this would do nicely.", 
    "This cabinet is really nice, the quality is very good, the price is right, no problem in put it together, even the back part is painted, not cardboard!!! and the front doors are so pretty! Nice Buy.", 
    "This cabinet is very well made. It will last for years. It took more time than I thought it would to put together but, worth it.", 
    "Not the best of furniture but a very nice, useful piece, does the job and looks good", 
    "I'll definitely be getting the matching mounted cabinet from this set. I have the bottom piece in my bathroom, under a window. Perfect size, provides much-needed storage. I like the glass front - it's a nice detail that doesn't put the full contents of the cabinet on display.", 
    "I received the product in two days-fast shipping and exceeded my expecations. It is beautiful, very elegant and went well with my living room decor. I highly recommend it.", 
    "My cabinet came arrived quick. My husband put it together in about 30 minutes. Better than what I expected and it's a prefect fit in my half bathroom. I would definitely order this product again!", 
    "Small cabinet, stylish, easy to assemble. Worth the reasonable price.", 
    "Cabinet assembled easily, all the parts and pieces made sense. Finish is consistent throughout the cabinet. The only issue I have is that one of the doors is not completely flat and the bottom inside corners of both doors don't line up when shut. Minor issue, and I can install a small stop that will make it look better.", 
    "I decided to assemble this cabinet by myself. At age 70, with arthritic hands, I thought I might have issues. It went together easily, all screws fit where they should, and the quality is excellent. It also looks wonderful in bathroom.", 
    "I absolutely love this cabinet! It was the perfect size for a small empty area of my kitchen. It is a thin cabinet but the dimensions on here perfectly describe the sizing, I was confused how people stated it was smaller than they expected when all the sizing information is listed; for the price I paid, I would never have imagined how great the quality of this cabinet was! I get constant compliments on it and it only took my husband about half an hour to assemble. You won't be disappointed if you buy this, shipping was quick as well!", 
    "This little cabinet is very stylish and useful to store and organize smaller items. It is in my bathroom, in the toilet room that does not have too much depth of space and this product is a much higher quality for looking for thin small pieces to fit into small spaces but have high style and look like higher quality. Keep in mind the glass is clear, but the cabinet is true to color and works perfect!", 
    "Perfect fit for our master bath. Easy to assemble and looks great.", 
    "The item was delivered very quickly. Fairly easy to put together and it seems very sturdy.", 
    "This cabinet fits the criteria and I was very surprised at how pretty the cabinet actually is. I needed some extra storage in my kitchen really didn't have a lot of space to work with (width or depth) i've looked all over and finally found this cabinet which was perfect! I put two little wicker baskets on the open shelf (Cut out area) and also use them for storage. I love the look it gives the cabinet. It finishes it off nicely. I wanted to attach a picture however it doesn't allow me.", 
    "This isn't an expensive cabinet. It serves it purpose plus it was easy to assemble. It's stylish and a good size.", 
    "Perfect for our guest bathroom. Very straightforward to assemble the cabinet. The instructions were clear and all of the pieces fit together very well. This is a very deep brown cabinet that is sleek looking. The doors have an amber mosaic pattern in the middle panel that beautifully picks up a similar color in an oriental rug that we have in the bathroom. Great storage.", 
    "Love, Love, Love this cabinet. It was exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "Even though I did not put the cabinet together it only took my friends a few minutes to assemble. It looks nice in my room, along with the other color scheme. Very nice!", 
    "This is a great piece and value. No, it's not \"fine\" furniture with dove-tailed joints, fine hardwoods and master cabinetry. It's DIY assembly. But the finished \"look\" is stunning (as if it cost way more) and it's durable enough for what I'm using it for (a bathroom accent piece to hold towels) that I have every confidence it will serve me for years. It came solidly packaged and with clear instructions. My handyman assembled it easily. There was one modest blemish across the back at the very bottom where the espresso finish (the color in your photo is accurate) was marred but noone's going to see it and I could easily touch it up myself if I chose to. I love this! And so have all my guests who have seen it.", 
    "Nothing really special here. Simple put together with an OK finish. Nice style. Not bad but I'm sure you can find better.", 
    "This is the perfect cabinet for our bathroom. Beautiful & functional for any room.", 
    "This cabinet is beautiful and was very easy to put together. All parts are clearly labeled. I only needed an extra pair of hands to put the doors on. I am extremely happy with this purchase. The color is accurate and a rich dark brown. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "I needed tables in the 34\" height range so these were perfect. Very easy to put together and well made. Slim profile so they don't take up much floor space. They provide just enough table space for the nightstand necessities. I recommend these to anyone looking for a slim cabinet or table for a tight space. Considering buying a third to use in a small half bath.", 
    "This is a great little cabinet for my needs. I am using it in the small toilet room in my bathroom. It holds toilet paper, cleaning products, etc. for use in that specific room. I measured the area, and this cabinet fit the closest. I love the doors, and the color of the cabinet goes well with my other cabinets even though it is in a separate room. With the door open you can still see the two together. It did have a new cabinet odor for a week or so, but that faded, and I really like this cabinet. Great buy for the money.", 
    "This is a lovely piece. Easy to assemble and arrived in perfect condition", 
    "This is an assemble-it-yourself piece, & the screw holes for the cabinet doors didn't line up properly on the one we received. There was nothing we could do about this, but now the knobs on the front of our cabinet aren't perfectly parallel. We just moved & have been putting together a LOT of furniture, so I know this wasn't our error. It's a shame, because the cabinet would look much nicer without this issue.", 
    "Definitely not worth the price for the quality. Also the way this item is packed creates a HUGE mess when upacking. It was however fairly simple to put together.", 
    "I love this for the extra space it gives me and it looks much more expensive than it was.", 
    "Really cool cabinet that took about 40 minutes to put together. I love it and would definitely buy it again! The only issue was that it smelled pretty bad for 2 weeks... I just burned a lot of scented candles. Excellent and unique piece.", 
    "I love this cabinet! It was easy to put together. My 14 yr old son put it together for me! I love the detail in the front. Very pretty and modern!", 
    "Beautiful cabinet that fits perfectly in the space I needed it, in my 1/2 bathroom. I work in stained glass and mosaic and the quality of the mosaic panels is great!!! I was afraid they would be \"plastic-like\" but they're not, they are real glass mosaic!! The only thing I would improve on this cabinet is, I don't know why they provided \"Silver\" screws to attach the back panel. They should have been black or brown to blend in with the cabinet back. Since it is the back, you can't see them where I have it placed, but I'm Pickey. But the finish and the quality is excellent for the price.", 
    "Nice cabinet -- the assembly is well instructed --", 
    "It looks really good assembled and the only fault was the material that wrapped the pieces left a messy residue.", 
    "Shipped fast, easy to assemble happy with purchase", 
    "This was a very nice buy, perfect for a small room or bathroom. Not a lot of storage space, but good for decorative items or bathroom stuff. It was easy to put together and the pieces fit very well. Good quality.", 
    "Too short. Looks much taller in pictures. Was easy to assemble(except the doors)"
