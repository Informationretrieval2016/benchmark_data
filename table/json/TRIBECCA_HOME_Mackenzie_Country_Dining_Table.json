    "Just what I wanted!This table is small enough for an eat in kitchen space but elegant enough for a decorator's home. I'm really happy with it.", 
    "I gave my kitchen set to my daughter when she moved out. I searched for a replacement set for my breakfast nook. It arrived quickly and I was able to put it together by myself. The colors are nice and looks much more expensive than the price tag! Would definitely recommend and Overstock had the best price.", 
    "The table arrived with small bubbles on tabletop. I didn't think anything about it but after a month the bubbles have come off and show the lighter color of wood underneath the darker finish.", 
    "We really love this table. The wood is beautiful and the quality is great. Overall very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Easy assembly. Great quality and perfect size.", 
    "Looks great. Just like picture."
