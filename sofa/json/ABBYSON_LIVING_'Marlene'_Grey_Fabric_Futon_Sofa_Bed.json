    "Definitely will not sleep anyone over 5'5\" but great for a tiny house or a small space. Firm seating. Well made.", 
    "This was a very high quality futon set. My daughter loved it but we had to return it as it was too small.", 
    "I helped our daughter look for a sofa for her apartment and spent a lot of time looking at various websites. Finally, she realized that the doorway to her apartment was narrower than average and we had to scrap the idea of finding a decent couch that could fit in her place. Then - inspiration from her dad: a futon could work! Again, I searched several websites and was put off by the \"college dorm room look\" and how industrial so many of the styles we looked at appeared. And then, I found this piece by Abbyson Living on Overstock's website and our daughter was impressed. The futon arrived exactly when promised and with free shipping, too. She was able to put it together by herself, but she said it would have gone much more quickly with two people. The futon is a wonderful design and she loves the tufted fabric. Also, we really like the walnut finish base/legs. It gives the futon a much more \"sofa\" appearance and the color works great w/ all of the different pops of color she has in her home. She is looking forward to hosting friends and being able to utilize the futon as a guest bed, too.Overall, this futon was a great value and looks like it will be able to hold up for several years. Kudos to the manufacturer for designing a futon that can work in a home and be a great asset for a living room.", 
    "like the material, design, etc. however, it has no legs!!!! would give a higher rating if legs were included! not worth as much without feet! inconvenient to have to wait for another shipment!"
