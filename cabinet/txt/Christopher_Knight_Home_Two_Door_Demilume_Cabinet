Like a fine piece of jewelry, the hand painted metallic silver finish frames the curvaceous form of our two-door demilune chest. Curved legs and a circular handle continue the flow, while the opulent Emerald Isle finish on the burl veneer makes this a piece that will not be overlooked. The two shelves inside add a delightful extra.
