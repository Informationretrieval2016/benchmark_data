    "Arrived quickly and in good condition. Assembly was not difficult, though not without issues. I had to drill a deeper hole to countersink one of the screws on the curved bottom piece. The top is smooth, the drawer is level and works properly. The wood grain is interesting and the matte finish looks hand rubbed.", 
    "Within just a few months of having this beautiful desk, a large crack developed across the entire length of one of the wood seams.", 
    "I love this desk. It is the center piece of my office.It was a little hard to put together. Very basic, but the holes where bolts were to be inserted weren't correct. So I had to make adjustments.", 
    "This desk arrived in perfect condition. It is solid sheesham wood and was easy to assemble. Looks beautiful in our office. Got the idris sheesham book case to go with it. Love it because the grain is beautiful and has an artsy look. Friends always ask, \"where did you get your desk?\"", 
    "Get lots of complements on my desk. Great purchase.", 
    "I love this desk. Comfortable and true to picture. This has quickly become a favorite and conversation piece in my house.",
