    "Ok, I was very impressed with the swift delivery of this product. I ordered 2 (other) outdoor benches and then 2 days later ordered two of these...I received these last Wed and the first ordered set, today!! Very, very impressed!!! On to the product itself - - appears to be well made, not heavy at all, surprisingly but not in a bad way. It appears to be solid but the wood itself is on the lighter side. It says weathered \"grey\" bench and although I read the other reviews, I went ahead and ordered 2 and hoped that mine would be on the grey side, but it is not. Very textural piece in terms of color but to the touch, it is smooth despite the wood graining; will not have any problem with splinter or anything like that. It's a very attractive modern looking piece, straight lines, which I like a lot. The best part? It came in 1 piece, no assembly required. The picture above looks to be reddish with dark grains, IRL it's light colored wood with black grains. The finish product is a beautiful piece. I would have given it 5 stars if the color is as described. All in all, very happy with the purchase and I can't wait to get my black/brown long table, the same lines as with this bench. I will put these on each side and regular upholstered chairs on each end.", 
    "My husband and I are so pleased with this bench! We wanted something different for our long, dark brown IKEA table (\"Bjursta\"), so we placed the it on one side and flanked the other sides with parson chairs. The look is amazing - a rustic finish with contemporary lines so as not to appear too fussy. The bench came fully assembled (very pleasant surprise) and passed the function test with flying colors at our Halloween party. It easily accommodates three adults and feels solid as a rock. I was surprised to read another reviewer's mention of splinters, because I can run my hand back and forth along the entire length without any roughness. It's weathered, yes, but the grooves are smoothly sanded and sealed. The only downside I imagine is that it probably wouldn't be comfortable to sit on for hours on end. I suppose one could fashion a custom cushion, but it would be a shame to cover up the beautiful surface. ;) In any case, the function and style can't be beat at this price. If there were a 3 to 4 foot version, I'd probably buy that too!", 
    "Well packaged, no assembly required, and suitable for a number of purposes in my home, both decorative and functional. Generally, I'm satisfied with this, but this is where the product is not what I expected: 1. There is a lot of texture to the bench. You can feel the grain and I'd be nervous to sit on it wearing a fine fabric. 2. I expected a cleaner, modern, monolithic look. At the inside corners (juncture between the horizontal plank that you'd sit on and the legs), there's an extra wood support piece stuck in that's used to attach everything together. Even going back now to look for it, it's pretty hard to see this in any of the pictures. A nice peice of furniture would have connected the legs and bench together without adding another block of wood that ruins the clean look. 3. In the photos, the grain looks tight enough that the dark grain color would read over the lighter color. That's the not the case with my bench. 4. The bench wobbles when sitting on a smooth and level surface. Although the bench was not what I expected, I've found a use for it and seems to be holding up fine after a few months of use.", 
    "this bench is very narrow so gettign a cushion would be hard and it might look weird. So check the dimnsions. Otherwise a nice product. Comes in a huge box so plus that no assembly reqd./ minus that packaging was not sustainably done.", 
    "This bench has clean lines yet has a rustic look. It can be used in several places!!", 
    "Received this bench today, In the write up it says its a gray-brown reclaimed finished look and metal hardware finish accents, mine arrived a orange brown color that I really had to check if it was real wood, it looked and felt like plastic.Its put together with wood pieces and glue, no metal hardware to be found. Its definitely real wood, as to remedy the situation I got out my sander and took the finish off and stained it with a stain called reclaimed wood, we also screwed in the wood pieces to make the bench more sturdy. So unless you want to take the time to sand, stain and purchase hardware I'd stay away from this bench. Item arrived fast and it was packed nicely!!! The contents of the box is what I didn't like. would have returned it, but shipping it back would have been pretty pricey I'm sure.", 
    "I received the bench about 6 days after I ordered it, and it was exactly as I imagined it. I read previous reviews about the color and quality, and so I expected the bench to be brownish/black and was not disappointed. I needed a narrow bench near my garage entry, and this fitted perfectly in that space. I was concerned that my husband would not like the bench, but he seemed pleasantly pleased. Great first experience with Overstock!", 
    "This bench is perfect and completes our entry way decor. It is clean and simple. We love it. We've had it for a couple of months now. It is perfect to put shoes under and to sit on while removing/putting on shoes. It's shallow so doesn't take up a lot of space. Came in one piece - no assembly required.", 
    "The packaging was fantastic but the bench arrived with a little chip at one of the corners, but I could live with it. It was also slightly wobbly due to the difference in the length of the two sides. I fixed it with felt pads and then it was all good. Personally, its winning feature was its delicate depth of 10 inches (and a good length to boot!), which allowed it to fit beautifully into the recess of the foyer, helping it to be both functional and yet nonintrusive. I even managed to jazz it up with two small cushions. All in all, I love it.", 
    "Beautiful hardwood bench. Looks great in our living room. Very happy with this purchase. Since this is solid wood I expect it to last us a long time.", 
    "Do you remember the standup piano your elementary teacher played? THAT is the color of this bench. HONEY OAK. There is no \"brown\" there is no \"grey\". UGH. I would NOT have ordered it had I known this. In addition, although I understand it is my responsibility to check the specs, I was more concerned with the length of this piece, and totally neglected the width. It is more of a \"plank\" than a bench. I am extremely disappointed.", 
    "The bench is simple and beautifully made. It will be a perfect fit for the space. Came intact and ready to use.", 
    "The bench is beautifully simple. Clean lines.. We are excited to have another place to hide shoes. The bench is not too wide but nice and long .", 
    "This bench is the right size for our mudroom and is solidly constructed. However, it is not grey or weathered, but rather a natural wood with a bit of black paint rubbed into the grain, no grey to speak of.", 
    "I was disappointed with the quality of this bench. Poorly sanded and finished, splotchy uneven stain.", 
    "This bench is perfect for our entry from the front door that is very narrow but still needs a place to sit and kick off your shoes.", 
    "Looks perfect in my bedroom.", 
    "Rustic ... Wood, looks perfect in entry hall!", 
    "Sturdy and stylish. Recommended.", 
    "This is a well constructed sturdy bench with clean lines and nice wood grain (the tone is yellowish brown which was perfect with our decor). It fits nicely at the foot of our California King size bed and provides a spot to sit to put on shoes, a surface to place items when necessary, and doesn't clash with our traditional furniture. The piece comes fully assembled which is a nice plus!", 
    "Perfect bench for rustic/chic look", 
    "The bench is beautiful and a great price for the size. No assembly required and a good quality piece of furniture.", 
    "Of the many items I've purchased from Overstock, this is by far the best piece and greatest value. You would see this bench in an NYC furniture store for $1000. Looks great - very sturdy - great value!", 
    "I got this bench to offset the Bertoilla style chairs around my dining room table at the cabin. It looks great, but I have little kids, and it is a little light weight and \"tippy\".", 
    "Great for entryway. Slim profile.", 
    "Stylish and durable. Even though it is narrow, it can still hold a lot of weight and is sturdy. Love it.", 
    "Great bench, the pictures and description for the bench on the site were very accurate. The bench is solid, study and had a very clean simple design. There is a little bit of texture on the top of the bench, gives a slightly rustic and warm look. The bench was delivered fully assembled in a large box with styrofoam, no assembly required.", 
    "Beautiful and I like the finish and the shallower depth. Great for an entryway or hallway bench.", 
    "The simple lines on these benches are what attracted me and they look amazing in my house. They are truly lovely pieces. The best news is they are shipped in one piece. You take them out of the box and put them in place in no time. I paired mine with an older Oak dining table and they work beautifully. I received many compliments. I bought two and wouldn't hesitate to purchase them again.", 
    "Exactly what I had in mind. Great bench", 
    "Looks beautiful, however tips easily due to the narrowness of the bench. easy enough to make an adjustment when you need to move it.", 
    "Solid, sturdy and exactly what we were looking for !", 
    "Nicely made - low profile and perfect for entertainment table for mounted flatscreen", 
    "bad color, Like the idea. I painted", 
    "Purchased this bench along with the reclaimed coat hook rack to create a mudroom entry area in our garage. The bench is strong and sturdy but not as heavy as it looks. The appearance is of an old wood board but is of a smooth material - no splinters. It is narrow in width which works well by not jutting out too far but serves well the purpose of seating to put on shoes.", 
    "The bench looks lovely, but it is not finished. It is very rough and if you sit on it in bare legs you'll get scratched and splintered and if you're in a fabric that's not tough like denim, it will pull.", 
    "is used at the end of a king size platform bed. The style is simple and the reclaimed look gives it texture. The color is toward the orange side and matches my maple baseboards and window trim. I will be able to use it for additional seating for the dining room table, outside on the patio or the hallway entry. It is narrow, sturdy, and comes assembled. I love it.", 
    "Ordered this bench to double as a table behind a low mid-century style couch. Also use it as a bench for larger dinners. Receive a ton of compliments on it! Looks great and is a nice weighty build.", 
    "I was so excited for this bench but when I opened the box I was sooooo disappointed. It was a very off color - almost orangey, and not grey brown as it was described. It was the perfect size and very sturdy but beware that's it an odd color.", 
    "This is a really nice looking bench, A little skinny, but if you buy (2) it is perfect.", 
    "I wish it were a bit deeper, but it is gorgeous!", 
    "Looks like real wood. Its beautiful in the entry and use it under our big window when we have lots of guests over. Looks great with beautiful throw pillows.", 
    "The bench had an orange cast on the finish. However, since it was a solid piece, I was able to change the finish on it to match our table. The length is great.", 
    "Cute bench for a mud room to sit and put your shoes on", 
    "I really love this bench- great for any room, I have had it in the entry & no wit's at the foot of the guest bed.", 
    "Purchased this bench for my daughter, who uses it in the area leading to the garage;her daughters put items on top of the bench, and she purchased styled containers for the bottom, where they place shoes and other items.DreamCatcher", 
    "Nice, simple wood bench, looks great in my entryway. I like that it's tall enough to fit baskets underneath.", 
    "Nice to be able to sit down and put my boots on", 
    "I use it as my coffee table. People love it.", 
    "Sits by the front door along the long foyer. Perfect place to sit and put on your shoes and/or set groceries as you're bringing them in. A few rough splinter spots but that should be expected. Recommend!", 
    "I bought this for our entry, but ended up too long so I used in our game room then eventually at our craft room table. It's very sturdy. In the game room, kids stood on it often to watch people play at the air hockey table. In the craft room, I've cleaned paint, glue, etc off it several times. It wipes up nicely and to my surprise hasn't stained or shown signs of wear on the wood yet. A great buy!", 
    "This is a beautiful bench. It is a little narrower than I was imagining (my fault for not measuring) and I have it on top of a plush rug so it makes it very unsturdy. However, I get lots of compliments on it and it looks great.", 
    "Bench is made perfectly and looks amazing in my living room.", 
    "Before the housewarming party, I was worried that I could get this but it was delivered in 3 days. Im looking for the cushion but kind of hard bc its only 10 inch wide. Anyway good quality bench!!", 
    "Very nice- heavy solid wood. My only problem is that I wish it had four legs.", 
    "Pretty much what I expected, bench has an odd texture but otherwise fine", 
    "The bench was as described- color as pictured and seemed of good quality. Didn't look right in the room so I returned it, but that is more about my room than the produce itself.", 
    "bench is perfect for additional seating at the table, and sits nicely against the wall when not in use!", 
    "Really nice piece which fits perfectly in our entry way. High quality.", 
    "Looks naturally weathered, very sturdy. Great for plants. We use it behind our couch... just the right length, height, and width.", 
    "Solid and great looking. No assembly.", 
    "I like the bench but the color is much darker in the pictures. The one I got has more of an orange tint to it. I'm keeping it because I don't want to go through the hassle of sending back.", 
    "This is a beautiful piece of furniture. My only concern is that it is too small (in width).", 
    "Very well made and perfect addition to my fitness studio", 
    "This bench made of planks and its weathered finish are very attractive. There are no splinters as reported elsewhere. Unfortunately, the bench is too narrow for its height and tips over rather easily. It really doesn't serve well as a surface upon which to place anything.", 
    "Love it. No bad things to say about it.", 
    "Very narrow and doesn't look weathered at all. Ok for outside here in Arizona", 
    "My husband and I are really pleased with this bench. It's very sturdy, very handsome. I saw that some reviewers were not pleased with the color -- the colors of the bench we received are in brown/rust spectrum. Perfect for our needs. Some other reviewers were commenting about the side of the bench -- again, no issues for us. It is the perfect seating for one side of our dining room table. Three people can sit on this bench without issue. Love, love, love.", 
    "happy with this bench, as described", 
    "the corners are not perfect but looks very nice overall.", 
    "This bench is great, a little narrow for a bench, but that is just what we needed for our space. It is in our foyer and everyone compliments and asks where I purchased it.", 
    "Nice and sturdy. Looks sharp", 
    "Solid, sturdy bench that is sturdy enough to sit on to put on shoes, etc. Love the distressed look that is has, looks great in our mudroom with shoes underneath it to get them out of the way. Highly recommend this product.", 
    "This is perfect to park handbags, umbrellas, etc on and shoes underneath. It works great with a coat rack above. Its a rather narrow bench so I wouldnt recommend it for seating, although it is sturdy. Mine has been subjected to lots of wet/dirty items and always cleans up well.", 
    "Adds a spa touch to our bathroom. Nicely made and good value compared to other 60 inch benches I looked at.", 
    "Is basic, looks good and does the work. and you do not have to pay a fortune.", 
    "This is exactly what I was looking for. I am using it as a plant bench.", 
    "I have a very long gallery wall that I felt needed a bench. The bench looks better than I expected, and the wall is so long that I'm ordering another one!", 
    "I use these benches in my entryway and occasionally as extra seating in my dining room. the look and depth of the wood is excellent and they're very sturdy, Even sitting in the middle, I don't notice any bow at all.I have two and get a lot of compliments on them - highly recommend.", 
    "The bench was purchased for one side of a table for seating versus chairs. It was a terrific value and very sturdy as well as stylish.", 
    "arrives put together and just place it where you want it. dimensions and appearance are as represented. Looks great.", 
    "I have received so many compliments about that bench, every one loves it and so do I.", 
    "Delivery was fast, bench already assembled! As pictured, but the description indicated wood & Metal - no metal however. I like the bench but not exactly what I was expecting.", 
    "The bench is a little narrow, it came assembled without any scratches. the finish is very nice, really distressed but not rough at all.", 
    "I got this bench along with two chairs to go with my dining table and couldn't be more pleased. I was looking for something that would not require assembly and looked sturdy, rustic, yet classy, and this was perfect. The only thing I wished for was for the bench to be a tad wider for slightly more comfortable seating. I am petite, so it's perfect for me, but my fianc\u00e9 is bigger, so he tends to gravitate towards the chairs rather than the bench. Other than that, it's a beautiful piece of furniture, and I still have no regrets getting it.", 
    "This simple and sturdy bench is just right...we placed it along a wall in the covered entry to our patio, where it patiently holds trays of dishes, buckets of gardening tools, and us, when we pause to watch the sun set behind the first blossoms of spring. Wish I could attach a picture of it in the space--very Zen!", 
    "This is a really nice bench. It's good for a narrow space and if you have a rustic interior. The color is more of a yellowish/pine look.", 
    "This bench is sturdy and true to its picture. The color is very earthy and the wood finish is very nice. It is very narrow and so it works as a good entryway bench. The only reason I say good and not excellent is because of the narrowness of the bench. Otherwise, it shipped in record time and it is one piece - no assembly required and looks very pretty.", 
    "It was hard to tell if it would match what you see in the picture...its a little lighter in person but it is a great piece of furniture. We love it.", 
    "This bench will give you splinters. And it doesn't look as nice in person. We were disappointed. However Overstock's wonderful customer service helped us with a return.", 
    "This bench is great for my kitchen table! My 3 year old loves to eat on it and she climbs on and off it, very sturdy! Looks like great quality too, and actually is real wood! Loved the weathered look!", 
    "I ordered one and rejected it...it was poorly packed and it arrived damaged..the second one they mailed me arrived damaged as well....again poorly packed..", 
    "Really solid, beautiful wood bench. Very simple yet elegant. I have it in front of my gas built-in fireplace where it is the perfect height for a \"perch\" next to the fire. It isn't very wide, but it was the exact width I needed for the spot. I use it as a type of lower ledge mantel for my fireplace area. It may be a little too narrow for comfortable seating. The quality is excellent as is the workmanship. No assembly! Yay!", 
    "This is a simple rustic design. The bench has been used for extra seating on many occasions.... It is really sturdy.", 
    "The bench is better looking than expected but it is narrow so its a bit unsteady. I bought it because my 5 yr old and friends were tipping on our chairs and we may have the same issue with this bench.", 
    "This was perfect bench to sit along our walkway. It's a great place to sit and put on/take off your shoes. It's a great bench to just put things down to gather what you might need before leaving the house. The best part is no assembly required it comes in a box you open it and use it!!!!", 
    "I bought this as a bench to go with my trestle table. The length and style work well with it.", 
    "This is a fabulous little bench. Very well made, Elegant modern lines. Packaged exceptionally well and arrived without any damage. I used it as a TV stand for a flat screen. Would highly recommend.", 
    "We've been looking for a dining bench and were pleased to find this one. Stylish, well-made and a fraction of the cost of similar benches. No assembly required!", 
    "Came quickly in one piece. I was so excited when I opened it up and saw how nice it looked. Set it on the floor only to realize that one of the sides has come apart (sloppy wood glue) and it was really wobbly. Customer service was top notch as always and was quick to fix the problem", 
    "Looks just like the west elm version of this bench. Perfect length and height for dining room table seating. I was worried about the shallow depth of the bench from the reviews, but I think it's the perfect size.", 
    "This heavy bench is the perfect size for our dining table and will be used primarily for the children. It will be up against the wall, which is a good thing because it's pretty wobbly due to it's narrow depth. I plan to paint it with chalk paint to match the dining chairs, otherwise I'd be extremely unhappy with the overall look of this bench...the \"reclaimed wood look\" is right on - it sorta \"looks\" like reclaimed wood, but mostly looks plastic-y. Definitely too pricey for what it is.", 
    "I bought this bench a year ago. It is in my narrow mudroom. I needed something narrow, that looked rustic, and could hold up to heavy use. Due the width, it is not the most comfortable place to change your shoes. But it is sturdy, and meets my needs. If I had the space, I would have chosen a wider bench for comfort.", 
    "Solid bench with reclaimed look. Little rough on top, but it has not been an issue. Comes completely assembled-bonus! Bought two to use with new kitchen table. Worried that they'd be too narrow- but seem to work just fine! Very pleased with purchase. Great deal too!", 
    "This is a sturdy little bench, rough looking as intended but no splinters and edges are finished smoothly. Am debating about staining it darker, but also like as-is. It could be used in many places but it's under an earth-toned abstract painting along an otherwise empty wall and looks great. It would hold a lot of weight but will not be used much for sitting in its present location. Due to its shallow depth, only children or petite people could use it for seating against a wall, but it would work for larger people at a table.", 
    "It looked more refined on the website than it is in reality but the weathered look is accurate. It isn't as smooth as it appears either but I am not concerned about splinters as others have reported. We are using it on a covered screen porch and it is holding up well.", 
    "This bench is a great size for a front entry. It is sturdy and looks more expensive than it is.", 
    "Nice bench, arrived assembled so you can use right out of the box. It's not quite as \"Weathered\" as I would like. No gray tones that you often see in authentic older peices. It is a nice looking bench though and the dimensions fit my space perfectly. It is the right height to use as extra seating around a dining table. Easy to move. It is light enought that I can pick it up and move it wherever I need it. Worth the money for sure. I've seen reallly rickety benches at a much higher price. Overstock comes thru again!!", 
    "We expected the color to be darker than what arrived. It's not completely bad, but we were expecting different. Make sure you look at the measurements because we only paid attention to the length of the bench and not the height. It's much shorter than most accent benches. I think the price is too much for what it is.", 
    "The bench is true to its dimensions, so make sure you'll be happy with the narrowness of it. I planned to use it one way and ended up using it another b/c it was narrower than I anticipated. Still glad to have made the purchase b/c it is the simple, clean bench I was looking for without an incredible price tag.", 
    "solid construction benches. stained them to match dining table and they look great", 
    "I wanted a bench with very specific dimensions to use as a side table between a sectional and a wall in our narrow family room. I had just decided we would need to make something ourselves - which we never seem to have time for, with busy jobs and two young children - when I happened upon this bench. It is exactly the right size and has some texture, which is also something I was looking for. The texture does look manufactured, which I think other reviewers have marked as a negative, but once I put it in place and got busy using it instead of looking at it, that was not very important. I'm sure that by the time my two boys have outgrown the toy-truck years this item will look perfectly naturally weathered - and in the meantime I won't have to worry about them wrecking the fine furniture. All in all, it has made a big difference in our room and I'm very happy with it.", 
    "This piece met all of my expectations. It is a piece that can translate into any room of the house (i have not yet decided where it will go:) Its one of those pieces you can keep for years and re-invent how you use it over and over again. I am considering it as a bench in guest bathroom for towels and candles. Also would make a great hallway entry bench because its not too deep and doesnt take up too much space. I currently have it in my bedroom with books and blankets on it. Could also make a great bench at the foot of a bed.", 
    "This bench worked just as I had envisioned as a more rustic, non-conventional stand for our wide screen TV. Great choice for our \"man cave\" TV room. Substantial construction and not \"tippy.\" TV sits in the middle with plenty of room for \"peripherals\" on each side. Only problem was all the wires that can be seen beneath, but camouflaged that with baskets and extra seating pillows. I love it!", 
    "I got this because the size was just what I needed for an entryway bench. We have since moved, but I still love this bench. Its sturdy! It's lighter than the picture, but I still love it.", 
    "I love this bench! It is the perfect height & long enough to hold 3 adults at the dinner table. It was a little lighter than I expected when i opened the box, but otherwise it's wonderful!", 
    "I needed a simple, narrow bench to place against the wall under my wall-mounted television to serve as a sort of shelf for other electronics. This served very well, and was a good value for me, especially since it included delivery. It might be a bit narrow for sitting purposes - only 10\", but perfect for what I'm using it for. Also, it came very quickly, very well packed and fully assembled.", 
    "Bought 1 bench to go in my graphic design studio nice and sturdy and was glad it came to me already put together. Highly recommend this bench. It was the perfect length. Good job!!!", 
    "I needed a narrow bench for my entryway to keep the clutter in check. This bench is perfect. I purchased 3 baskets for shoes, dog stuff & scarves, etc. They line up just right underneath. This is a solid bench, so there's no wiggle wobble when you sit to put your shoes on - gotta love that!", 
    "This is a very nice bench. Its narrow depth makes it ideal for hallways or any tight spots. As many reviewers said before me, the color on the website it totally different than in reality. The bench base color is natural/yellowish, and there is grey/black staining all over. The metal hardware mentioned on the website consists of two metal triangular bars that connect the seat with the legs from underneath - you cannot really see them unless you look under the bench. The reclaimed look is okay but you can certainly tell it is faux from a few feet away. The bench has lots of grooves but is overall smooth (someone mentioned splinters, etc., but this is not the case with mine). I am pleasantly surprised by its sturdiness. It also appears to be very resilient to heavy use. Great buy, but beware that the color on the website is not what you will see in person ;)", 
    "Overall, this is a great bench. The quality appears to be good, and the shipping and delivery was FAST and easy. It fits well for the space, but we will have to sand it and restain the wood in order for it to fit with the other items in our home. Even with the labor at home, it's a better price that we found anywhere else!", 
    "I purchased this for my office as a thin coffee table / foot stool in a room where there wasn't much room for a full sized coffee table. People love it. It adds great contrast in texture to plush seating and people feel comfortable putting their feet up on it.", 
    "We ordered this piece to try out in a private elevator lobby which is very modern and Zen in it's design. We were considering benches from very high-end suppliers, and decided to try this *** option first. It is a tad smaller than we thought, but very well made. It arrives assembled, which helps and it's corners are perfectly matched. It is a rough-hewn pine wood so if you are looking for smooth/slick presentation this wouldn't be for you. We are keeping this and are happy with it.", 
    "This will do the job in my entry way, but it is extremely light and narrow. I have it against a wall, and it overlaps an area rug. Because it is so lightweight, that quarter inch of thickness under one side of the bench makes it unstable. I put foam pads under the part of the bench that isn't on the rug to compensate. I would not call this grey; it is more \"dirty\" pine, with black rubbed into the very roughly textured surface. There are some flaws in the finish, but the bench is rustic enough so that the imperfections don't stand out too much. I would probably advise people to spend a little bit more on something that is heavier, a little bit wider, and made of better quality wood. In the end, I would be happier if I had done so. FYI, it smells HORRIBLE when you take it out of the box. Toxic smelling finish, like shoe polish or something. If you can leave it outside for a day or two, do it.", 
    "I read all the reviews and was concerned when everyone mentioned the color was off but I still ordered it. Agree the width of the seat is too small for my liking but it'll do. They need to add at least 2 more inches. Otherwise the quality and the price is great.", 
    "I have this as an entry to my bedroom. It can be used many different ways. As I stated, it does have a red tint, but not too much. Has a grain to it which I do like. I like that it is narrow and can fit in a narrow space. I have a large mirror hanging above it. And candles on the bench.", 
    "Happy with this product, the actual color shown on the site was a bit off to what i received. But overall, i am satified and would recommend it.", 
    "I have been wanting a reclaimed wood bench for so long! But they are so expensive until I saw this one on overstock! Ordered it right away and loved it! I get plenty of \"where did you get that\" from my friends! Happy I ordered it!", 
    "i love the bench - better quality than i thought it would be - too expensive for the money but sometimes you have to splurge", 
    "Initially I would have given this two stars but I decide to go with three because I'm not entirely disappointed and indeed, as everyone has said the shipping was surprisingly quick. I'm still deciding if I should keep it or send it back but I will probably keep it to avoid the hassle. Pros: Great size for a dining room table and matches my actual reclaimed pine table well enough. Nice clean look from a distance in terms of general design. Good hight for me (I'm 5'5'') Cons: Weathered look is clearly fake and actually cause some problem in terms of function Splinters are an issue but even more of an issue is when you drag any fabric across it, it catches. Very unfortunate. There are deep groves due to the \"weather look\" that will be hard to clean. One thing that is a bit annoying is that although there doesn't seem to be any damage it appears to be a return as someone poked four holes in the bottom - probably from floor protectors. Did I just buy used without being informed...? Overall as I said, I think I'll probably keep it which means now I wish I had two to actually use at my dining room table. Sadly, they have sold out. I bought it for my entry way but it is aesthetically better in the dining room due to how narrow it is.", 
    "These benches were cheaper than single benches I had considered buying at DWR, CB2, and other boutiques. I bought them to match my CB2 table and they look great. Communal, modern, and great. Three people can easily fit on one. Yah!!! Did I mention they arrived in two days, per-assembled?", 
    "My only complaint is that the finish to get the reclaimed look is very fake looking. Texture as well as color. I wish they would have just actually used a gray finish like you see at restoration hardware to give it a weathered look rather than make it look faux. I am debating on whether or not to keep it.", 
    "I like the bench. It's nothing special, but it's sturdy and looks good.", 
    "Fast shipment and all in one piece, which was a bonus since so many things come in pieces. It fits perfectly in my entryway. I am very happy with this bench.", 
    "I like the bench and its weathered reclaimed looked. It is a little tippy probably because of the design being a long length and narrow width of the legs.", 
    "This bench goes under an existing wall cabinet in our narrow hall. We place our shoes on top of it. Looks much better in there. The bench came put together and is heavy and sturdy.", 
    "The reviews were right on about this product. Very beautiful bench. Comes in a huge (I mean HUGE) cardboard box. Bench is very long, so read the measurements closely. We wanted to put it at the foot of our bed, but it was longer than our bed. So, we moved it to the living room, which is better since its such a pretty bench it should get more face-time.", 
    "LOVING this bench! I have placed it in a client's guest bedroom. It's long, and it was perfect for a lonely wall that was just screaming for a person to be able to put their suitcase or plop down and take their shoes off. I thought about putting it at the end of the queen bed, but was 2 inches too long. You will love this rustic, very simple bench. It's very restoration hardware but without the price tag!", 
    "I purchased a very expensive reclaimed wood table from Canvas. However, I wanted to have more flexibility in seating more people than the 4 chairs I also purchased. The benches looked very close in color and texture to my table. Indeed they were! The match exactly! I bought 2 of the benches and love them.", 
    "I was looking to add a little personality to an otherwise bare wall next to my front door. This narrow bench was just what I needed. I created a very natural, rustic vibe simply by placing this nice bench next to the door, added my own baskets underneath, and hung a few photos and wooden mirror above it. Voila, instant entryway. It arrives in one piece anchored down in a big box. Use scissors to cut it free and remove. I would suggest being careful of little clear silicone balls that can fall out of its holding container. They aren't easy to spot at first, and very tempting to ingest if you have small children and animals in the house. So just be sure to not have them close to the box, also not to turn the box over so the packaging doesn't fall out. Other that that, it's a quick, easy decor fix.", 
    "I am quite pleased with this bench. I love the clean 'modern' lines with the weathered look. I bought it to go at the foot of our bed and it fits perfectly. The only thing that I would have changed would have been the depth of the bench by about 4 inches. Other than that, I am happy that I chose it.", 
    "I love this bench! It's beautiful, sturdy, and just what I needed.", 
    "Love this bench! Its very sturdy and fits nicely with my dining table!", 
    "What a treat to receive my product so quick and earlier than expected (Bought it on Sat. and received it on Tuesday!) and also to just cut the box open and take the ready to use bench out. I love it! Bench is beautiful and it looks perfect with my reclaimed wood dining table. This was my 1st purchase from O.com and what a great experience! Product is amazing, service was excellent and I'm a very happy new customer that will keep on buying from now on. I did my research and because of great reviews I felt confident when pressing the \"place your order button\".", 
    "I was looking for a rustic-looking bench and this fit the bill perfectly. The finish looks like the wood is weathered, with an interesting, raised texture, yet it is smoothly finished. The construction is solid (all wood) and easily holds the weight of adults without any wiggle in the bench. I am using it as a dining bench and when not used for seating, I display some Shaker-style baskets on it.", 
    "Thought that this might be the kind of product that was nice to look at but not good to use. I was surprised to find out that it was extremely sturdy and good looking. No assembly!", 
    "I really liked the design of the bench. The dimension is perfect for a narrow hallway (40+ inches) since it takes up only 1/3 of the hallway width. I do wish the \"reclaimed\" look that the manufacturer tried to achieve didn't come with splinter hazards. Now, I have to find a way to prevent those... but if I add an extra layer of sealer, it will change the whole \"reclaimed\" look.... For the price I paid ($$$) for such a bench, I would expect it to be perfected. Recommend to a friend? Yes, for the design. No, for the practicality.", 
    "Great bench with reclaimed wood used. It is exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. I highly recommend this bench.", 
    "This is a great modern, vintage looking bench! Just as described and perfect for the space. I was looking for something skinny and long that would look built in. Was really happy with this Overstock purchase!", 
    "Very sturdy - moreso than expected. Came assembled - very pleased.", 
    "Overstock.com should delete any reference to the color \"grey\" for this product, as it is true to the picture, not the words -- it is a warm honey oak, with lovely graining.", 
    "Perfectly sized and priced bench for your small foyer or hallway. The color varies but I like what I got. Could be made at home with the proper saws and sanding but I'm thrilled with the price point for convenience factor. Got many compliments from friends at our last shindig finally they have some place to sit to put their shoes on and off.", 
    "This bench works perfectly at my dining room table and comfortably fits three people. The texture is not smooth and you can feel the grooves of the \"grain\", however it is not an issue for comfort and feels good to sit on. It arrived within a week of ordering in a very solid box and I did not have to assemble anything. I'm very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I ordered this bench to go with my rustic modern table, the color match was perfect. It is a great deal compared to similar benches at retailers such as West Elm. It added a modern touch to my dining set and I can also use it as a coffee table or put it at the foot of the bed. It's very versatile.", 
    "We love this bench! It fits perfectly in our entryway that is not very roomy. It seems well constructed and the wood grains look beautiful. We love it so much so we are ordering another one for our mudroom.", 
    "Excellent! The bench arrived only 3 days after I ordered it. It came in a box in one piece and therefore there was no assembly required. We purchased it for our dining table and it was a perfect height and actually quite comfortable. It fits in nicely with our urban loft. The texture of the wood is terrific. Great for dining tables in small spaces since it is not very wide", 
    "I ordered 7 of these benches for our churches foyer. They are really perfect for there. We wanted a simple, contemporary style bench. They look nice and sturdy. One did come in broken. Overstock refunded the money, with little hassle. These benches have a nice rustic, urban kind of feel to them.", 
    "I ordered 12 of these benches for our guest lodge and I am very happy with the results. They arrived on time and in good condition. The assembly was simple and easy to follow. Each piece is unique and beautiful. They are very special and look to be an old antique.I am very happy with ALL 12!", 
    "These chairs look like plastic, feel like splinters, are quite narrow and are not cut perfectly straight across the bottoms so they shift. Overall very disappointing- not a high end look as they appear in pics.",
