    "The chairs appear very similar to the pictures on the website, but the color is off. The color of the chairs when they came are much more grayish-blue than the distressed faded brown the pictures show. This unfortunately did not match the table I was purchasing them for and had to return them.", 
    "They don't really look it, but these are actually comfortable enough to stay in for a long dinner", 
    "They are a good rustic piece to add to your dining room. Not sure how durable they are, they are super light, but the color and texture of the chairs look rich for the price.", 
    "I purchased two sets. They're a bargain and fairly easy to put together. I assembled them as I watched TV one evening.", 
    "These chairs aren't the most heavy duty ones you'll find, but they are sturdy and a perfect match if you want a rustic or distressed look.", 
    "Great chair, especially for what you pay for them. A little tough to assemble and the tan clothe seats could be a disaster waiting to happen (food doesn't wipe off of them). Overall, I'm pleased with these chairs. They look nice and sturdy and have a pretty, rustic detail to them.", 
    "very happy with this purchase. easy to assemble"
