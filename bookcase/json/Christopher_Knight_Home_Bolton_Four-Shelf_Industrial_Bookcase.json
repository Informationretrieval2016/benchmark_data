    "This is definitely not a high-end piece of furniture, but for the price I paid, it's about what I expected. It's a great deal sturdier than the ultra-cheap plywood/veneer type of bookcase, but there are a few flaws. The shelves look inexpensive because they are faded along the edges and corners. There are screws which stick out about 3/8\" from the back, posing a threat to the wall surface. (I covered them with felt, and I think that will be fine.) That said, it was easy to assemble, even for one person working alone, and it lets your books steal the show. People won't see this set of shelves. They'll see what you put in them, and I like that.", 
    "I love love love this bookshelf! Fell in love when I saw it. Between the simple, modern design with the ladder sides, cross back and mix of black and brown, this was 100% perfect for my decor in my apartment. Great size, easy to put together, good quality, lightweight, and great price! Bonus (for me at least, possibly a warning for others), the black ladder sides are not a black \"wood\" but a shiny black metal. I thought the shiny added a nice contrast. I'm sure y'all are aware as well that the brown shelves are not real wood, but that light weight stuff that looks like wood. But, who's going to be analyzing your shelves? Not me. It looks perfect, and you're going to be filling it anyway! Hope this helps!", 
    "Easy to assemble, like the way the shelf looks.", 
    "This is a four-shelf unit, perfect for the space I wanted to fill. Extremely easy to assemble and appears sturdy. Good buy!"
