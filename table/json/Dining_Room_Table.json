    "It's sturdy, attractive, elegant, can be used as a dining room table or as a workspace--so I'll probably buy another for that purpose. It took me about 20 minutes or less to install. REAL EASY. My boyfriend really wanted to help put it together, but by the time he came back from taking out the garbage, I was done. There's a small nick on one corner, but it's tiny and I don't really care. The table doesn't stain either, no rings from glasses, no coasters!", 
    "I had to replace a glass top table that I already had chairs for. I loved that table (I got from Overstock) and the chairs were of such a high quality I didn't want to replace them. I found this table on Overstock and was shocked to find it perfectly matched the dimensions of my old table, was also made of oak, and had the same rich, dark brown color. The picture is spot on color wise, however it makes the table look like an end table, or a hallway table. It's not as small as it looks and it is a great quality piece of furniture. I am very happy about my purchase and will continue to look for home decor at Overstock.", 
    "We were so excited to get this table, which seemed like a great deal for something that looked really nice. Unfortunately, it arrived poorly packaged. There were actually rips in the box large enough that you could see the table through it. As for the table itself, one of the braces underneath the table was torn off at the screws, and one corner of the tabletop was smashed in so that you could see what it was made of under the coating, which I believe was some kind of laminate. Inside the table was something more like paper fiber than wood fiber. All in all, the table top seemed to be made of something more like dense cardboard than wood. Only the legs are hardwood, as we learned due to the damage. We do appreciate Overstock's policy regarding things damaged in shipping, in that at least we didn't have to lug this enormous package to the post office ourselves. And we appreciate that we would not be held financially responsible for returning an item that had arrived damaged. However, they said that they MIGHT send someone in ten days to pick up the table, and we needed to hold onto it until then to get our refund. For people who have a small living space and no storage, getting a large item damaged like this and needing to hold onto it for ten days without knowing whether they are actually going to come get it could really be a hardship. I have bought many smaller things from overstock in the past and had positive experiences. But I don't think I'll be buying any more furniture from this site in the future-- and from now on will be reading the descriptions much more carefully.", 
    "This was the SECOND table I received that was damaged - Not sure if damages occur during shipping/delivery but aggrevating! You need to pad these better - 2nd one had chip on top of table but I didn't see chipped piece in table and corner of table was damaged looks like from delivery so would say a combination of both but if you would pad these for shipment better, maybe they wouldn't arrive damaged. UPS boxes on all deliveries I have received have had cuts/holes and or damages to the boxes (creating damages to the product) they appear to be careless in handling your product. I am suggesting that if you would PAD your product better maybe it would help when they throw it around prior to deliver. Very unhappy w/constantly receiving damaged products. As far as my rating the product would have been fine had it not have been damaged (again not once but twice now w/this same product)", 
    "I needed a spare table for setting up in my art room for using a mat cutter but I wanted it to be nice enough to utilize as an auxilliary dining table for large dinners. I am very happy with this table. The wood is dark and smooth and goes well with my other mediterranean-looking wood pieces. It assembled easily and is not wobbly. The box did arrive with holes through which half my bolts & washers had escaped but a call to customer service righted that problem in less than a week so I have no complaint.", 
    "I am pleasantly surprised...the table arrived in perfect condition, in a timely manner, and has an expensive look to it.", 
    "The table wasn't carefully packaged but was still in relatively good condition. There\u0092s one tiny scratch on the tabletop and little scratches on one of the legs, but not serious enough to consider returning it. It was very easy to assemble and the color is a perfect match with my Parsons chair legs. Over all, I like how it looks in my room, and I consider it a good deal..", 
    "I recently purchased this product. I am very satisfied with it. It shipped really fast. The size is kind of small to fit 4 ppl, but it fits nicely into my apt space. It is very easy to assemble. It is a little heavy though. I suggest you get help when putting it together. It is perfect in every way for me!", 
    "I was disappointed that the shipping took longer than expected- the arrival date was pushed back----- BUT it was worth the extra wait. We are using the table in our breakfast nook area and it is the perfect size. We purchased chairs previously from another retailer and they match the table perfectly. Very satisfied with the quality, color, price, etc. Thank you!", 
    "Table seems fine. I will have to update it when I have it together as it arrived with no hardware in the box. Just a table top and 4 legs. Not for nothing, but like almost all of the reviews for this item, it is very poorly packaged. The cardboard is too thin for the weight if the item and the staples around the corners aren't long enough as the time it reached my door half of them were popped/hanging out. One of the corners was UNCOVERED as the corner stapled on piece was completely off. If my hardware was actually in the box, it most certainly fell out of the gaping hole in the box.", 
    "Nice, no very strong ,but look very elegant, I like the color also save space special for samll apartments. I recommend to a friend.", 
    "I was nervous about ordering this table, it was so inexpensive I was worried it would look cheap...but my budget was tight and we needed a very specific sized table...30 inch wide...so I took a chance! We LOVE it... It's a very simple but beautiful piece. The wood is nicely finished ...no rustic look here..it's a very sturdy and a good weight...a very high end look and feel. Very easy to assemble. It arrived with some holes in the packing but the corners were tripled protected and there was enough packing material around the interior of the box to protect the table...not a scratch on it!!! This is a fantastic buy!!! Get it while you can!", 
    "Overall, a great value for smaller spaces. The shipper has addressed the earlier customer comments by reinforcing the box edges. So, our box arrived in one piece and the table was undamaged except for scratches from one of the staples used to attach the reinforcement cardboard! This is a nice quality, very attractive table that could also function as a desk. It is a little small. We fit four chairs around it, but there would not be much room to serve food family style.", 
    "Its a good, simple table for someone on a budget. Not truly solid wood as one would picture, but compressed wood. There was a big chunk out of the side due to a combination in bad packaging and careless shipping. If it had arrived intact my review would have been 4 stars, but unfortunately the shipping damage revealed the less than expected quality.", 
    "Very poor quality product.joints already broken when i tried to move the table.", 
    "as people said in other reviews the packing is terrible.my box was torn and beat up but the table itself was fine. its a good table for a small space and not much money. i dont know why they dont use a better box for packing. i think there is a 50/50 change you will have to send the table back because its been damaged in shipping. i was lucky.", 
    "It is solid wood and very easy to assemble. It fits my purpose of a writing desk very well. I like the size. It is not too large nor too small", 
    "The description/attributes said that this table was supposed to be espresso finish wood, but it is definitely a dark cherry finish. I put the table with the espresso chairs to see if I could ignore it, and as a result, I had to send it back. It was packaged horribly. The box was super flimsy and had holes in it and the table had a couple of scratches upon arrival. I packaged it 10x better than how it was sent to me. Wouldn't buy this table again. It may be cheap, but you get what you pay for.", 
    "i purchased this dining room table to actually be used as an office table. The product arrived quickly and in excellent condition. It was well-packed and had not scratched or other wear. The product assembled in less than 10 minutes and included instructions and quality assembly hardware. The wood looks great and is an excellent value for the price I paid. I am very happy with the purchase!", 
    "I bought this table to stage a home, as I am a real estate agent. My concern was in the space between the legs on the long side and whether or not I could fit two chairs on each of the long sides, as the space didn't give me much room on the ends. It was absolutely perfect and lightweight enough for me to carry from house to house as I sell them. I cannot comment on how easy or hard it was to put together, as I had a helper do that. It is wide enough to hold large plates, but as noted, I did not buy the table to actually eat on it. I bought it to create a nice looking space that easily fits 4 chairs. I highly recommend it to dress up a small space in a condo or townhome very quickly and inexpensively.", 
    "detailed picture showed rounded corners; reason for buying- table had none. shipped from ca. to vt- skirt on bottom of table was cracked by the weight of the legs which had broken from ties on table bottom. ups had a problem delvering on promised date. 1 washer missing from hardware..", 
    "It took me approximately 20 minutes from box to standing. I am a woman with long nails and it was very easy to assemble. It is very sturdy and fits a small dining area well. It was delivered on time as stated. No one had a table this nice for the price, even other well known discount stores. Like my other Overstock purchases, I have been very pleased with the quality.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this table especilly give the price. This was my first time purchasing furniture on the internet, so I was unsure what to expect as photos may differ from the product shown. This table is much better than the pictured table. It is made of solid oak wood stained espresso (legs, sides, and table top); no particle board or rubberwood. It is beautiful and fits nicely in an apartment or a room with limited space which was what I purchased it for. Overstock delivered the table within days of my ordering it unlike other sites that I have ordered from in the past. I will definitely purchase other furniture items from Overstock.com for the quality, prices, and quick delivery, Who needs to leave home?", 
    "My order was shipped so fast, I had to call FedEx and have them store it until I returned from vacation.I love my table! My two teal parson chairs fit just right with it. Easy assemble, just right for me and my guest. Love OVERSTOCK!!", 
    "Received this table and am very pleased with my purchase. It arrived promptly, was well-packaged and had easy instructions (top, 4 legs, 8 washers, 8 o-rings, 8 screws) and (OH BOY) you can use a Phillips head screwdriver to assemble it as an alternative to the enclosed wrench thing....much easier on the knuckles.Did notice, however, only after I got it assembled, a small \"smush\" in one of the table top corners.....not enough of an issue to return it. This is a keeper. The finish is a rich, dark, espresso and has nice, clean lines. Is sturdy and should serve me well. All and all, a very nice table....Thanks, O-stock! Keep them coming.", 
    "lovely espresso color, sturdy construction, with a classy look. Better than what I expected. Looks wonderful with my espresso chairs. Good value.", 
    "Easy to assemble, sturdy enough-- this table is a good buy for the price. Only reason i'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars is that the wood was scratched in a few places. OS might have replaced it, but they're barely noticeable when you use a dark wood furniture mark up. And I didn't think it was worth the hassle.", 
    "I love this table. I have a small apartment and it fits perfectly in my dining area. It arrived very well protected and in excellent condition. It was also very easy to put together since it comes with a small tool to adjust the screws.", 
    "The assembly was very easy I put it together and had no problems. All parts and instructions were in the box. I am using it as a forward desk and it is working out great. Sturdy and cute.", 
    "Perfect table for 2 in our hearth room off kitchen. Very sturdy. Now using it as a desk with my desk-top computer. Very versatile.", 
    "Purchased this to go with the school house chairs in dark walnut. Works nicely together. Nice rounded corners and simple design. This table is a decent value for the price.", 
    "Beautiful but it came with a scratch on the edge with no paint :-(", 
    "It's a good, attractive table, but it arrived with a scratch on one side. I didn't want the bother of sending it back, so I just put that side against the wall. Aside from this, I'm pleased.", 
    "Fast delivery and the table looks gorgeous!", 
    "Ordered the table for our first house. The espresso finish is beautiful. Easy to assemble, and fits perfect in the nook.", 
    "I use this table as a desk and it does the job. Offers more space than an average desk, which is what I wanted, and looks good overall. Only downside is it sometimes feels 'wobbly' and top of it has many nicks and edges getting bruised. For the the money and how quickly it arrived, it's a good deal.", 
    "perfect table for a small apartment. use it everyday , have no complaints.", 
    "Worth what you pay for it.", 
    "I'm a single mom who's not the best in fixing things but assembling this table making me feel like MacGyver! Easy to assemble, sturdy and look really nice with or without tablecloth.", 
    "This is an okay table. Pros:+The right size for my apartment+Good price point for something you know probably won't lastCons:-not sturdy, might consider using extra hardware to make it more stable-Made of cheap wood that easily dings", 
    "I bought this table to use as a desk and I love it.", 
    "Nice table for the money. In my daughter's first apartment and worked well as a dining room table and study space table.", 
    "basically made of sawdust... but it was kind of what I was expecting for this price", 
    "Easy to put together. A simple beautiful design. Great table for the price.", 
    "WORTH THE MONEY I PAYED BUT NO MORE. LOOKS NICE IN MY OFFICE", 
    "Table was super wobbly. Had to return it as it just was not worht the money", 
    "I purchased 2. The item is not very sturdy and easily scratched. However, one can expect this from an inexpensive item (as compared to higher quality items pricewise). Just be on notice, you get what you pay for. With that said, the item serves the purpose for which it was purchased.", 
    "This table is easy to assemble, sturdy and a great buy. Exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "Great desk table - nothing fancy but gets the job done, sturdy and attractive.", 
    "they scratch very easily and the legs continue to loosen, trying to tighten them down I even broke one of the cross blocks that the bolt goes through, had to fabricate my own out of oak.", 
    "Great purchase! Heavy! It is not necessary to have 2 people to lift but, it will lessen the chance of marring the finish or damaging joints. Nice wood, deep rich mahogany color, easy to assemble, sturdy, looks awesome in the space it was purchased for! Looks more expensive than it was! Measurements are exact! This is important if you plan to have chairs fit under the table well.", 
    "Wonderful quality. It works perfectly as a desk in my small office.", 
    "It's a good table, sturdy. BUT arrived with scrapes and one side completely damaged. I can't eve return it because it would be such a hassle at this point", 
    "Husband hated my round drop leaf dining table so I looked for something that matched the legs on my nice leather dining chairs. I found this one, finish looks good and once put together and all tight it is very sturdy.", 
    "Came missing parts and scuffed. Be sure you measure! It can only fit four chairs around it, but a full meal with four people would be a stretch! Meant for two people or a one person desk.", 
    "The table looks for expensive than it is. It's heavy and real wood. Very easy to assemble. The only problem was the first table we received was broken. Very bad packaging. The return policy was simple and the new table is perfect.", 
    "Table is as described. Definitely a 2 seat table and not 4. Package delivered with some breaks in the box but didn't seem to damage the table. One of the legs was stripped of wood around screws for connecting. Although is not visible when attached. In one corner of the table there is an imperfection that almost looks like a small footprint. Polish takes away for short term but resurfaces. Overall serving the purpose but would not reorder. If didn't have the imperfections would recommend because for the price but a bad table.", 
    "Product was packaged well with no clear damage to box. Open box to find a side board was cracked and deep gouges along edges.", 
    "We just got our table today! It was packaged very well, with no damage or scratches. It was also very, VERY easy to put together! Literally took ten minutes from opening the package to getting it ready for use. It is very sturdy and doesn't wobble at all. The color is also lovely, a nice brown with subtle red undertones. Very nice. Sits four comfortably too. Overall, an awesome value for the $*** we paid!", 
    "Well made and looks great. Couldn't be happier. (To your 'nanny program that insists I say more: Please stop telling me how to write a review.)", 
    "The table is solid and of good quality. You must fasten the legs, but that is pretty easy: it took me maybe 15 minutes.", 
    "Needed a basic dinning table that wasn't bulky looking and would fit in a NYC apartment. This was perfect and can also be used as a desk. Easy to put together and nice color.", 
    "MOVED INTO A SMALLER HOUSE, HAD A LARGE DINNING ROOM SET. IT PRETTY MUCH OVERWHELMED MY SMALLER DINNING AREA. ordered THIS TABLE AND SOME CHAIRS, THEY ARE THE PERFECT SIZE FOR MY SPACE AND JUST THE LOOK I WANTED.", 
    "Bought this table to use as a desk for my computer and 2 printers in my small home office. Works great. Beautiful and easy to put together.", 
    "Perfect size for the eat-in section of my kitchen.Color was right for my area. Tool they includedfor putting the table together was not so good.", 
    "I love the color. The design is good. But beneath the table plate that looks just below the weak.", 
    "This table is a little shaky after it was assembled. I think it needed additional support for the legs. I am using it as a desk for my students (I am a tutor) and I wished that I had done some more research about the need for a sturdy and supported table. It is a good size but i think it is more suitable for less rigorous usage.", 
    "The table itself is solid, but the finish leaves much to be desired. It arrived marred with flaws (incomplete coverage of stain), and it scratches incredibly easy.", 
    "though it is a good size, the quality was less than I expected. When assembling, one of the cross braces that hold the leg in place broke, so I have a loose leg.", 
    "The Dining Room Table we purchased looks great, arrived faster than we thought and is a great bargain. Ideally, it would be a few inches longer, but we knew the specs before placing our order. It was much easier to buy this through Overstock.com than waiting for close-out or going-out-of-business sales for furniture.", 
    "I think that for the money, the table is stylish and attractive. Just the right size for my small space. The packaging took a beating in transit and some of the bolts which were supposed to be inside to assemble went out through a hole in the box... Overstock customer service is always great to deal with and replacement parts on the way.", 
    "Table was not well braced and remained unsteady no matter what I tried to do with the leg screws. The quality of each piece was very good but the mechanism for securing each piece togetehr was inferior to the quality of hte product.", 
    "We have had this table for 7 months and it has not stood up well. It has nicks all over the edges (mind you that we are not excessively rough people) and one of the supports has broken. We are left to fix this on our own and Overstocks customer service has been lacking as well. Overall, bad experience with the table and Overstock.com.", 
    "I ordered 2 identical tables. They arrived on time, and the tables were very nice at one time. But the packaging was very poor, so both tables were damaged. There is no way those tables could have shipped half way across the country without getting damaged. The boxes were clearly falling apart and had been taped and stapled to try to keep them together. In my opinion, this is the fault of the company that packaged the tables, NOT the company that shipped them. I contacted Overstock.com customer service and explained the situation. They were very kind, and said they would ship 2 more tables. The new tables arrived in the same poor packaging, and both were also damaged. At this point, I gave up and decided to use the 2 tables that were the least damaged. One table arrived with no hardware for assembly, and none of them contained assembly instructions. On one table, a corner brace broke when we assembled the table. We had to improvise.", 
    "This is a great work desk with a wide writing surface. It is perfect for work, school, and crafts.", 
    "We needed a large rectangle coffee table. We purchased this table and cut the legs off. It works perfect in our den so we are very pleased with it. It's not great quality but we realized that based on the price. But for the price, we got what we wanted and expected and are pleased with this purchase.", 
    "The table top material did not match the description; the material is not oak. The table arrived with shipping damage, which allowed me to see under the finish. The table top material appeared to be some type of fiber board. Also, the legs were missing. The return process was easy enough, but I did not receive a full refund until after calling customer service.", 
    "box arrived with some damage but the table seems to be ok. Easy to put together and the quality of the table is really good considering how inexpensive it is. i'm very happy with this table.", 
    "Took a gamble ordering this table as some of the review complained about the packing and that the table was damaged upon receipt. I had no issues. The package was intact when delivered and the table was perfect when I took it out of the box. It only took 20 minutes or so to put the table together. It's very sturdy and is a really great little table for a small dining area.", 
    "The table is very nice and simple. It's for maximum 6 people. The packaging was terrible. The table got here a bit damaged, but we needed a table, so we kept it. UPS treats certain boxes very bad. Not careful at all!:-(", 
    "I was really upset to unwrap this beautiful table, only to find the corner smashed in, the top scratched in multiple places, and dings on the sides. I took pictures, and have been trying to get compensated...nothing yet. Be careful ordering furniture from overstock.com!!", 
    "I was looking for a temporary desk since I will be moving within the year. This is the perfect size and I am glad I looked for dining tables rather than a small desk. It was easy to put together.", 
    "Wonderful solid wood table! I bought this for and office desk and I just love it! Easy to assemble and great quality and design. The price was just right and it looks great!", 
    "I bought this chair for my dining room. The architecture of my apt. is modern. The table goes flawlessly in my new home, plus, it integrates with the modern stainless steel chairs I bought. I wish this table were a little longer, but it works fine with six chairs (1 on either end; 2 on each side), so long as you don't mind your guests sitting really close to one another. But for the price, that's a small gripe.", 
    "As always - shipping was fast and cheap/free. Many folks noted that this product was damaged when received. The same thing happened to me. Several scratches and dents. I am sure Overstock would take it back, but I am using the table for a desk and I am not going to be able to find a table for any cheaper than this. A furniture marker would fix the table. If a really nice table arrived damaged - I would return it.", 
    "It's attractive enough, and goes with many types of decor. But I do have a few gripes with it: It is NOT easy to keep clean. It seems to take a lot of work to get smears and smudges off. You can only use Pledge Multi-Surface, or similar cleaner on this type of finish. Spray cleaners leave streaks, and some even take off the stain color. Greasy fingerprints leave permanent shiny spots on surface, no matter what method is used to attempt to remove them. If you love the low-sheen finish, this will make you insane. It gets superficial, swirly scratches very easily. It has scratched just from having a placemat down. Imagine what plates or pet cats will do with no barrier at all. Again, this also disrupts the satiny smooth finish that you will fall in love with when your table is brand new. I have yet to find a stain pen dark enough to cover deeper nicks and gouges. When the table gets a deeper scratch, it is very light wood underneath, and it is very noticeable. Still, and for the price, it's not all bad. Just don't expect it to look new for long.", 
    "I like this table but it is not as good a quality as I expected. It is also not very stable. The original product was damaged during shipment and replaced with another table that also had some slight damage on the corder.", 
    "I like the table. Assembly was easy and the piece is very nice. I do wish the finish was better (possibly another coat of stain. Overall I am very please with the table.", 
    "I had to repair damage to the underside of the table prior to assembling it. Otherwise I am very happy with the product.", 
    "The only complaint I have about this table is the poor packaging it comes in. The first table arrived broken beyond repair, but a replacement was sent quickly and that one had only a little nick in one corner. The table was so easy to put together, it only took about 10 minutes. Altogether, I am very happy with this table for the price and the quality isn't too bad. It looks just like the picture on the site.", 
    "This table fits my needs exactly. Unfortunately, it arrived with a nick in the table top. I went to ******* and fixed it myself. I can see it but I doubt that anyone else would. Also, O gave me credit for the damage. Go O!", 
    "This is an excellent product, and I am very surprised by the quality for the price. It has a nice matte finish and feel. I bought it as a desk, and it is the perfect size for my computer printer and desk accessories. I brought my friends over to show it off. Looks very classy in my office area.", 
    "Great table for my small apartment. The box was damaged and torn when it arrived. One corner of the table was broken off, like someone dropped it. The manufacturer should have used heavy duty packing materials and this probably could have been avoided. I have to return the table and get a replacement. The table is just what I expected. I just wish it would not have arrived damaged. This is a wonderful table for a great price. It looks expensive in my home.", 
    "We received the table damaged. It had a dent in one of the sides of the table top and one of the planks of wood running along the bottom of the table was snapped in half. It wasn't packaged very well at all and the box alone was in sad shape when it got to our house. The only good thing was overstocks understanding of how unhappy we were and their procedures to make sure they made it right. We got our money back fairly quickly and all we had to do was package it back up and put it outside for ups to pick it back up. The table was cheep so I know we should have expected as much.. But it was bad.. I'm pretty certain it would t have lasted more than a month before getting ruined by just using it to have meals on daily.", 
    "Table was delivered quickly, no damage and easily assembled. Could use this in small kitchen or dining room or as a desk. No complaints", 
    "This table works perfectly for me. When box was delivered, there was some damage to the edge of the table on one side, but I placed the table against a wall so the damaged side can't be seen.", 
    "I love this table -- great deal. Cute and small, perfect for a NYC apartment. When I say small, I mean it's a four-person table and fully accommodates the 4 people without feeling crammed. I paired it with four metal stacking Tabouret chairs from Overstock as well and the combination of silver + wood is really pretty. The first table I ordered arrived in very bad shape. Overstock was great about sending another one (thankfully I did NOT have to ship the first one back, they asked that I hold it several days until FedEx came to inspect and then to discard). The second table was in much better condition, although it did have a corner where the 'wood' was exposed; this time I didn't feel the need to contact Overstock again. It's a pretty heavy table -- I just wish Overstock and its distributors would package it accordingly so that it does not get beat up in transit.", 
    "A great solid table. Easy to assemble and light enough.", 
    "The table was exactly what I needed. I have a bump out area in my kitchen that we had a larger oval table that has been used by our family for years. Now that we don't have a family eating in the kitchen every day, I wanted a smaller table with some class to make a statement in that alcove as well as funcional. We have a dining room where our family gathers on special occassions and the kitchen area is just for my husband and I right now. The table is exquisite and the expresso color pops my decor. We now have meals together there and a show off spot in the kitchen. LOVE IT!!!!", 
    "The first table I received was damaged. What a disappointment! However, I contacted Overstock customer service, and they sent a replacement free of charge! The second one was beautiful, it looks great in my small dining room, and is the perfect size. I'm very happy.", 
    "I have just made my first two Overstock purchases - both are tables. This is my first review, and I totally loved this table. It is truly solid oak, and I have not seen a solid wood table like this anywhere. i am so tired of particle board, so I was excited about this one. The only problem for me was the manufacturer sent the table in a box held together with a weak tape, so the lid was torn off, and the table was damaged. I called Overstock about it, and they helped me right away. Terrific customer service! You should order this table if you want a solid piece of furniture made of true wood, not particle board.. The color is a rich, dark espresso coffee color, and has a nice subtle sheen to the wood. I think Overstock is going to ensure the manufacturer boxes this table with more durable packaging because truthfully, they made a gorgeous table, and it deserves great packaging. I did get another table at the same time, and it arrived in a perfect box, and it is gorgeous. Great customer service Overstock, and wonderful quality. I will definitely be buying more! I trust Overstock.com completely! ivre! I'm not afraid to order anything from Overstock based on this wonderful experience. The table was not damaged by Overstock, but by the manufacturer - yet the manufacturer made a lovely table. I am going to write another review on the other table I ordered that came in a perfect box - and it is beautiful. I am going to order more things from Overstock.com for sure! My new favorite online shopping store!", 
    "Nice table for the money, nice quality, easy to put together. The table did come with a small corner ding, but I used furniture scratch stick to cover the imperfection. The table wipes clean easily. I found that it was less expensive to buy the table separately and the chairs I wanted separately rather than buying a table and chairs set. It totally fits into the small dining space of my townhouse. I am very pleased with my purchase. .", 
    "This table is ideal for our conference room- it's light weight and easy to move around. The size is plentiful for 4 people and a little cramped for 6 people. I wouldn't recommend this as a daily dining table for a family with young kids- where it might get abused- but in a setting where it won't get heavy wear it's wonderful.", 
    "This was a simple oak table that my daughter was able to assemble in less than 20 minutes. She indicated that it did have small wobbles but otherwise served her needs very well. It was inexpensive. The delivery was prompt and shipping was free.", 
    "I have a tiny dining room with walls on three sides, so I needed something small, yet enough room to seat 4. Perfect!", 
    "It looks very elegant in our small house. We also ordered chairs that go very nicely with it.", 
    "Unfortunatley, a corner of the table was damaged during shipping. I contacted customer service and was immediately given a refund. I was happy to provide pictures of the damage but was told that was not necessary.", 
    "We were looking for a small dining table and everything we found was made of pressed wood, particle board etc. This is a solid wood table that has a nice weight to it, making it feel more expensive than it was. The color is a nice espresso. We're very pleased with it.", 
    "This is a great table for the price. We have 4 parsons chairs around it and they look great with it. The box did come pretty beat up and there was a small scratch on the side of the table but not very noticeable. Make sure to measure the space you want to put this in. We saw a picture of it with the chairs and assumed it was bigger than it really is. In the end, it's a actually the prefect size for our small apartment once we put the chairs around it. It's not the most solid heavy duty table in the world, but again for the price it is great and looks nice. It was a no brainer to put together as well.", 
    "I'm glad that I made this purchase, and you can't beat it for the price, I will be shopping from Overstock.com again very soon.", 
    "Matched our chairs perfectly. Well made. Sturdy. Arrived in pristine condition. A great buy for the money. Fits four chairs comfortably.", 
    "Delivery todk longer than expected. It was a gift and when opened was disappointed that table top side had a large area where it looked smashed. Did not return or complain since recipient didn't want to.", 
    "This is the perfect table for a small apartment. It can double as a dining table and desk. The dark finish makes it look more expensive. It is a quality table for the price.", 
    "Cute little table. Was scratched a little, but not enough to cause a problem. Over all I'm happy with my purchase.", 
    "Bought because compared to wood table at Walmart.com and table was better quality and also ended up cheaper with shipping and handling. Easy to put together. Came with all tools to put together.", 
    "Another home run from my Overstock... Thank you. Delivery was to the door, and expedient. Now, am shopping for chairs to go with...", 
    "arrived in a reasonable time and was easy to put together. Screws were not tied down and damaged the apron of the table plus some had fallen out of the box and were lost.", 
    "All parts were present, and the table was well packed. It is quite heavy. It was easy to assemble with the supplied wrench, and is very stable. The finish looks good and appears durable.", 
    "I use this table as a desk and it is very stable, seems well-made so far, is a beautiful deep color, and was easy to assemble. It looks very classy and could easily be a small dining table, too. It has very elegant, simple lines and good finishing.", 
    "Customer service was most helpful in assisting me when I accidentally ordered the incorrect table; table ordered arrived in good condition and was used in a breakfast area. Good size for three to four people; nice finish and well priced.", 
    "The table arrived extremely damaged. This table is NOT solid oak as the descriptions describes. I think is is made of rubberwood and is much darker than the photo.", 
    "I like this table for what it is. The right color and the right size. It s rather plain but there just seems to be little selection between the 36 square and the 36\"x60\" size range. The table arrived with a ding in one corner which I hid against the wall. There was also a crack in one of the supports on a short side. It's not too visible and the table it still sturdy and solid despite this damage. It was very easy to put together with the exception of removing the straps used to secure the legs to the underside of the table for shipping. They are still there. I ended up trimming them down as much as possible but couldn't remove all of them. For the price, it's an excellent buy.", 
    "The table arrived after several weeks. It arrived without the bolts necessary to assemble the legs. Also, the table was severely damaged. It also scratches easily.", 
    "table size-wise and color was just what I was looking for. Good space for 2 - possible 3. My biggest complaint was that chairs recommended to purchase with table did not reallly go. Their legs do not match table. Also darker chairs I already had went better. I think I would have been better off with a darker chair. Oh well. There was also a rather large scratch on the top edge of the table. For me not worth fussing about, as I have a cat, and perfection is out around here. Finally easy to put on legs, but needed a handyman to tighten, then table is very solid.", 
    "This table is only ok. I would not recommend it. It came chipped and is made of particle board. Not hard to put together. This table is SMALL! Read the dimension before you buy.", 
    "I have never in all my years of online shopping had something delivered to me that was so damaged. Not one corner of the table survived. One corner is so smashed in I can not even fix it. All sides have dings and scratches, including all of the legs. It looks like someone threw it up against a wall and then boxed it for shipping. The box it came in was NOT damaged. I will not shop on this site again.", 
    "The picture fooled me... I ordered the table believing that there was more of a thickness on the top piece.. and that the edges were more rounded... a bit disappointed... but decided to keep it anyway,,.. besides it would cost too much to return..... The table is a very nice table...and it goes very well... color and all with the chairs I'd ordered before the table.... sounds backwards right... I had a table and the chairs couldn't fit under it.... so I had to order a table..... that's why... Both match perfectly.... color is same.... The complete table and chairs look like they were purchased together......", 
    "This is the perfect table for what I needed. I use it as breakfast table.It's all you'll ever need for a small family. My son and I love it!", 
    "I have a very small area available for a dining table so I was looking for a small table to fit. I purchased 2 side chairs separately so this table appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. After reading the reviews, I ordered the table. It arrived in a very timely manner, all the parts were included, and there was no damage. Assembly was very easy - it took me about an hour to get it all together. The table is very sturdy. It fits my small area perfectly and I am so pleased that I found it. The only thing that I would change is the table edge. The edges are squared and I think I would prefer a more rounded edge. But that is certainly not a problem with the table or Overstock. Thank you so much Overstock. I will be back!", 
    "This is a beautiful piece of furniture. Very well made. Even more gorgeous in real life! I am using it in a casual setting, but it can be used in any setting at all, even elegant. I give this product a 10.", 
    "This table also fits my small space and I have room for chairs as well. The assmebly was simple and quick.The delivery was on time as posted by FED/X.", 
    "Table is very nice and the wood quality is great. The only problem is the table came with 3 descent size scratches on the top. Hopefully this can be taken care of with scratch remover, the box was well packaged, wondering if this was a defect along the lines. Anyways great product regardless.", 
    "This table looks nice in our tiny dining area and was pretty easy to put together. There is one tiny imperfection on the table top that is barely noticable, and because we got such a good price, it doesn't bother me. My only complaint is it is not as heavy as I would expect a table to be at times and therefore if you slightly bump it, the whole table will move, which can be annoying every once and awhile. Overall, good for the price/size.", 
    "I was hoping I'd be one of the people who got a table that was good to go. The package came a little damaged but it took me a good 5-10 mins to get all the packaging off so I was hopeful the table was going to be in tack. It wasn't, one corner was badly damaged...almost looks shredded--and a few minor scratches at the other end...if I could figure out how to fix that corner I'd keep it...I've emailed CS and awaiting instructions. I think the table is perfect for the homework room...hope I get a new one without having to figure out how to get this one back!", 
    "This is one Overstock.com purchase I'm afraid I have to say was a big mistake. I have yet to get the legs square on this table and it is very, very cheap and wobbly and flimsy. I guess I'll end up using it as a lap top table in a guest room. Sorry, just not even worth the money. It was cheap and it was still overpriced.", 
    "Ordered the table and it arrived in a damaged carton and the table had two places where it looked like somebody hit it with a hammer. Overstock shipped me a second table and carton was in worse condition than the first one and the wood had a split in a corner of the table. Got my money back. Overstock customer service was very good during this frustating process, but I definitely would avoid this table."
