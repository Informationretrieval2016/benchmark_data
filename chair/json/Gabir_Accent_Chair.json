    "I am not writing this review for a kick back coupon. I write reviews because they mean so much to me when I am ordering a product. I accidentally shipped this chair to my mother's address on file. All my fault. Well, my mother will not give me the chair! I guess I will have to order another. I like this chair and the fabric has a nice flair. Overstock has been good to me so I hope this review helps someone. Thanks for the chair. Love it!", 
    "This is a beautiful, well built chair and works perfectly as an accent piece. It is not comfortable therefore not very functional. Good value if you have use for an infrequently used chair. It is exactly what I was looking for so I am very pleased.", 
    "This chair fits beautifully in the space I wanted it for. The background color of the chair is much more muted than shown in the image. Also, the depth of the seat makes it uncomfortable for a person of less than average height (I'm 5'2\" and if I sit back in the chair my feet don't hit the floor.) Adding a decorative pillow helped. That said, the size, style, colors and print of the chair suits my d\u00e9cor perfectly.", 
    "I am 5\"7 and when I sit all the way back in the chair my feet do not touch the floor. The seat is very firm, so if you are looking for a soft seat, this is not the chair for you.The quality of the chair is good. The colors are pretty much what I expected. Overall good purchase.", 
    "Easy to assemble, color looks exactly like picture, comfortable and stylish. My daughter has already claimed it for herself. It is quite high so be sure the measure the height to make sure it fits in the designated room.", 
    "These chairs make a statement and are comfortable and functional to boot. Get lots of positive comments on the pair we have in our living room. True to picture.", 
    "From the picture, it looked like the background color was more of a yelllow hue. However, in actuality, it was more like a creamy beige color. The seat cushion is on the hard side. It may soften if it gets enough use. I like the nailhead trim around the arms and back -- gives the chair a more expensive look. This was not my first choice in accent chairs (there was an inventory issue with the ones I originally ordered), but it does nicely for a second pick.", 
    "I bought two chairs with pillows that looks same on the picture.However, First, POOR SHIPMENT when the shipment arrived,one chair had damaged leg and the fabric on the bottom does not fit well on the wood. The other chair was fine. Second, THE QUALITY the chairs are too high for me and so tide. My daughter said that she feels that she sit on the stone not a chair, it is not comfortable. I bought a desk chair from OVER STOCK and it arrived without any damaged. Third, I bought these chairs and pillows because it looks like the same color and fabric but in the reality they are not. So, I am really sad and not satisfied with these items.", 
    "As an accept chair this was perfect. Liked the style and the fabric. Super!", 
    "I was a little nerves about ordering such a large idem on line. Never had sat in this chair and the many unknowns. But I worried for nothing, the chair was easy to put together, came pack well, and sitting in it is great. It's is a little on the high side of sitting, but that was what I was looking for. So glad I did this and plan on keeping eye out on future decorating ideas.", 
    "I bought 2 chairs and they are okay, did not bring brightness to the room. The zipper handle underneath the chair is visible if you sit on the opposite side. One of the washer is missing. Assembly is easy but the packaging is very bad when I received it.", 
    "broke after 2 months but it is pretty but no one can sit in it. it holds my clothes only!!!!!", 
    "Bought this chair to complement family gray couch. Very nice and good quality. Only gave 4 stars because not too comfortable to sit in for long periods of time", 
    "Nice chair, comfy, and cute fabric selection. Good chair for the price.", 
    "The chair itself is very pretty and rather large, but the legs are not sturdy enough to support the chair. I moved it from a high traffic area to my office for occasional use because I liked it and didn't want to return it.", 
    "Chair is true to picture. Easy to assemble. Very firm and well made.", 
    "The chair looks beautiful in our living room but it is too deep for the average height person. If you sit in it, get ready for your feet to dangle. Again - beautiful but not exactly functional.", 
    "using in the bedroom that was tastefully changed. Nice size and fit just right in it's own corner...but comfortable for reading and relaxing", 
    "Looks great, but isn't comfortable at all. It's very stiff and rigid. It is a good seat for the cat, she loves it!", 
    "goes together easy.Well constructed. I need a higher chair than most because of my height and I was excited at how comfortable this is. If you are shorter this is not your chair. Great for tall people.", 
    "good for an spare chair in the bedroom to sit briefly", 
    "This chair is fantastic. The material is lesser quality and the finishing is not the best. But it's a bargain-priced chair; you're not getting high-end-store quality for 10% of the cost. The seat is long. I use a cushion in my lower back and that makes it great. The seat is also tall. I am 5'3\" and my feet hang about 4\" off the ground. However with an ottoman it's fine. I actually like how tall it is. The seat is also the perfect size and arm-rest height to sit diagonally and put your legs over a chair arm without anything falling asleep. The cushion is somewhat firm. If you're looking for a chair that will eat you when you sit in it, this is not the chair for you. But it's completely comfortable for extended reading times (and I'm someone who can read for 8 hours straight so I mean Extended...). The seat is also great for curling up into (as in tucking your legs up onto the seat or under you); super comfy seat size for a petite frame. Larger people will have plenty of room to sit but not to curl up on. The legs install super easily and there are little rubber pads on the bottom for feet so it won't scratch. It does mean if you flump down into the seat on a wooden floor it moves. On carpet, this shouldn't be an issue--flump away. It's not tall enough to rest your head back on unless you slump down. Not an issue for me. They don't show a measurement but the seat back from the top of the seat cushion is 21.5\" to the center of the back of the seat. The corners of the seat-back come up another half inch from that to roughly 22.25\" from the seat cushion. If you're looking for something that will last you 20 years, keep looking. If you're looking for something that will last 5-10 this is a definite catch! BE AWARE: the pattern is very pretty. It is super bright on the screen. In reality the base is kind of an oatmeal color. The green circles are pale greenish gold and the bright blue is a very pretty, sedate, dusky blue. It's still cheerful and fun but in a quieter, not so neon, way.\"", 
    "Love the chairs, but now I wished I would of gotten a solid color", 
    "No where was it labeled as made in China and has contents proven to cause cancer or other systemic conditions!!!!!!!!!", 
    "The style, the pattern, and how comfortable they are - just some of the compliments received. They match my office perfectly and wouldn't trade them for the world.", 
    "not as sturdy as I expected. Good for the price.", 
    "So Many complements. This piece will complete any living space.", 
    "The chairs are nice quality. Very firm to sit on.The only thing you need to do is put the legs on. Very Easy!!I got 4 altogether and they all came without any damage.", 
    "Got a great deal on this chair, and it's perfect for the bare corner in my living room. A good occasional chair, especially if it's used for extra seating for parties or family gatherings. It is not a cushy, mushy chair to sink into, and it is not meant for a very tall or broad guy, but it perfectly fills a need.", 
    "The chair is very attractive and compliments my d\u00e9cor. However, it is not at all a practical chair. When you sit on the chair, it's like sitting on concrete. My dog won't even get on this chair - I used to have an old comfy chair in the same place before I bought this one and that's where my dog slept. Again, it's pretty, but not at all useful.", 
    "I purchased two of these chairs. Overall they appear well made, especially for the price but both have flaws where the fabric was not pulled tight and there is subsequently an overlap which can easily be seen. The design and colors are great, I especially like the nail head accents.", 
    "Bought this item because of the coloring , and design. But was very disappointed with quality, and comfort level. It's like sitting on a broad, not worth the price.", 
    "Colors exactly as pictured. Super cool chairs for modern application. Solidly constructed. Nailheads were even and a nice finishing touch. As others have written, these chairs are very tall. I am a 5'8\" female and could not sit comfortable with legs crossed. An ottoman is needed. Also, the seat is very stiff - I like a firm seat but this was a bit more than that. I contemplated having 2\" taken off the legs but didn't bother and sold the chairs after just two months. Made me sad cuz they really are cool looking statement chairs.", 
    "This chair was ordered as side chair for my mother. It was delivered in good condition and in the promised time frame. It is very sturdy and comfortable. The material resists stains and easily cleaned.", 
    "I read a lot of the reviews before selecting the chairs and again I didn't imagine they be so gorgeous. The color probably due to the lightens made the chair look like a gold tint however true color is beige . I also found decorative pillows that are the same as the chairs which makes my chairs look very elegant. The only problem was one box came damaged so I hesitated about the acceptance but the chair was fine. The chairs are firm however it's okay because after several sits it will soften great fabric.", 
    "I bought this chair for my sitting room off my master bedroom. It was perfect. Not only was is super easy to take out of the box, screw the legs on and set up in my sitting room, it looks great and is very comfortable to sit in! I am sure I will enjoy many hours of reading in it!! Great buy!!", 
    "I do like the look of these chairs. They fit into my contemporary style very nicely. However they are very high and not really comfortable. I am 5'8\" and my feet barely touch the floor when I sit in them. I bought some gold lumbar pillows that match and that helps. I wish the seat was lower and the back was higher. The packaging was not good. They were not damaged but they arrived with the boxes all torn up and taped up so that the upholstery was not exposed. It is a miracle that they were not damaged. Overall, I like them but it takes pillows and footstools to make them really comfortable. Just FYI."
