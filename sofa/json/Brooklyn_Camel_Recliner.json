    "This chair definitely has some plusses and minuses. On the positive side, assembly was easy and quick, the chair looks modern and doesn't take up a ton of room, the fabric is a good neutral color (almost too bland, actually, but a colorful pillow helps), and the styling doesn't even hint that it's a recliner (a big positive, in my opinion). It's also fairly comfortable to sit in, either with the footrest up or down. Now for the big negative -- it won't stay reclined when you lean back in it. You have to kind of tense up your stomach muscles or press back with your head to get it to stay. Since most people want to raise their head to look at a book or the TV when using a recliner, this is most inconvenient. I would recommend this chair only if your expectation is to use it sitting up (not reclined), with the footrest up or down. One other concern is the durability of the fabric; since it is such a light color without any texture or pattern, it may show wear and/or look dirty fairly quickly. Probably not a good choice for households with little kids or dogs.", 
    "Recliner was ordered due to style, color and size needed for a small area. It arrived within a week from Overstock and was packed very well-no box damage and took very little time to assemble. I have mostly used the recliner in the upright reclined position due to space limitations in having it fully reclined,so can't judge it on how comfortable it would be to have it fully reclined for any periods of time. This recliner would probably not be the most comfortable one to purchase if you are a taller person due to it's compact size,but so far I am happy with the recliner.", 
    "Recliner was easy to assemble. I found the product is not at allcomfortable. Hard and stiff. No covers for arms.which is needed with the color being very light. Size is good for small room. Will not stay down when fully reclined. Would not recommend to a friend.", 
    "bought two of these chairs for waiting room in a small office. needed to be comfortable and luxurious appearing for patients who have a long wait - these fit the bill perfectly. they are up against a wall, so do not use the reclining feature. The recline would be easier with a lever, and it does take a little force to get it to recline, but it works.", 
    "This is a very nice middle-of-the-road recliner...good for a household with lightweight people. It is not made for large frame or husky people. Great for a retiree - some place where it won't get a lot of use.", 
    "I ordered these recliners with some trepidation....you just never know about furniture unless you see it and sit in it. What a pleasant surprise when they arrived (one day early!) and were everything I'd hoped for. The are comfortable, the correct beige-y color tone and have wonderful microfiber fabric. I would consider them a firm seat--which I prefer. I had help from my son-in-law putting them together (I'm really not good at putting anything together). But I bet I could have done these myself! One thing, they are larger than I expected. The seat height is higher. Small price to pay, since I had almost purchased two $650 recliners at a leading furniture store, I cancelled the deal at the last minute because I had doubts about the fabric choices. After a week of enjoying them my husband and I are very pleased.", 
    "Chair looks nice and is (relatively) easy to assemble. However, construction is cheap and done with the bare minimum of parts. Within a few months, the arms began to separate from the middle. Once or twice, the stubby feet have almost given out. Will have to add metal braces and bolts to repair. Would not buy again.", 
    "Nice-looking, neutral, mid-size chair for design purposes or in a rarely used room. But we are ALL uncomfortable-my skinny teen to big husband. In fact the good part is that this chair discourages us from sitting and watching TV too long! My name is mud though for spending money on it; I should have spent more to get a comfortable chair. Also, I don't think it could take a lot of wiggly kid action-would not last.", 
    "We needed two recliners, that did not look like recliners for our small living room. We only have one living space, so we need to be efficient with what we choose to put into our room. Big overstuffed recliners are so not my style. These chairs are perfect for the space and have a mid-century modern look, but not over done. Now here is the clincher.... If you are over 5'8\" these chairs will be too small for you when reclining back all the way. My Husband fits perfectly with his head at the very top of the cushion when reclining. The other thing is that the arms tend to have a bit of movement when pressed against. It's like they need one more bottom brace to keep them completely solid. The items arrived fine, but with beat up boxes (chairs were fine) and were easily put together with two people. I love the material and it hides cat hair well and is easy to spot clean. I hope they last for a long while to come.", 
    "Can't say enough about the style quaility and comfort of this recliner. Wish I could send a picture of how beautiful it looks in my living room. Have to shout out to Snoop Dog....for giving me the idea of buying furniture on the 'O'!!!!!!!!!!!! Ordering could not have been simplier, the customer service person was amazing....THANKS!!", 
    "Shipping was fast, setup was easy, but easiest with two people to help line up holes (Bought two,put back on one by myself). The legs weren't really in the picture instructions very clear so I'll just say take note: the smaller legs go in the back. This chair is firm, which I prefer. The back is a bit reclined that I've debated on getting an ottoman to put between the pair for sitting upright without reclining. The angle the back has is a bit reclined so I have to use a bit of a cushion/pillow behind my head (soft blanket hung over back) to be able to watch TV comfortably while reclined in first position. The chair does recline more but we haven't used it that far reclined as yet. It would have to be pretty far from the wall to use this way. The color is as pictured, a traditional Camel color. The buttons on the back are not tufted, they are basically there for a little style to the back. The fabric looks like a velvet but feels a little coarser but not too rough. The seat is wider than I expected at this price point. I'm not sure how long these chairs will last with daily use but find them to be a good value for our current needs. Overall these are an inexpensive recliner that look nice, sit well and are pretty neutral in color. We've only had them for a couple of weeks, I hope to get a couple of years use from them. Hope this helps.", 
    "The look is great and have gotten a lot of compliments. The beige camel color goes beautifully with my dark chocolate leather couch. However, the cushioning is way too firm, which I hope will softened over time and it doesn't recline all the way back. This chair is good if you just want to put your feet up. If you're looking for a recliner to really relax on and fully recline (body straight), then this recliner is not for you. Overall though, it's a nice recliner for the price. Just note, you have to put it together (legs and back of chair)", 
    "I liked it so much I ordered a second one, and now I have a matching set in my living room. The first one was very nice, and easy to put together. The legs were very difficult to get onto the second chair and there was a dent in the back cushion that never went away (i cover it with a throw). My son tried the full recline and the chair fell backward, so I recommend only using these with the bottom extended. These are fine for the price, but I wish both had been as good quality as the first one.", 
    "My father in law wanted a small scale recliner for his senior living apartment. This looked like it would be great. It had no padding to speak of and he refused to sit in it. I tried to add padding in seat and back to no avail. Paid have someone haul away v", 
    "seat is uneven, high on left side. sorry I bought it, A few bucks more and gone to retail store!", 
    "The chair is hard and not comfortable. The feet have never been sturdy and they keep coming off. It looks okbut not good quality,", 
    "Received just as pictured. Easy to assemble and really good looking chair. Firm but very comfortable. Nice size for small to average size person under 5'9\", but perfect for me. Love it.", 
    "Its comfortable, easy to assemble and a great neutral color. I would recommend.", 
    "easy to assemble and recliner works well. this is a very hard chair. i'm not planning on using it often but it's definitely not a super comfortable cushy recliner if that's what you're looking for.", 
    "Was excited to receive 2 of these chairs. They look great and the fabric is wonderful. However, after 2 weeks of using them, the wood cracked and makes horrible noises when we recline - like wood being twisted against metal. The arm rests are separating from the rest of the chair and they look like they could collapse at any moment. Very disappointed in the craftsmanship - shoddy and cheap. Nice to look at but don't sit on them!", 
    "This chair is ok but if you tip back to the first leg rise there is no neck support. I have to keep a pillow near by to put behind head when sitting in it. If it isn't reclined it is comfortable it sits firm and high.", 
    "I bought this chair for my 70 year old mother and she loves it! It's very comfortable and it reclines back to a great position. I highly recommend this chair!", 
    "I needed a recliner for my mother who uses a walker and needs arms on her chairs to assist. Firm seat cushion and good neutral color; fabric quality seems durable. It would be good for a medium sized person. The seat depth is a little too deep for my mom, so we have to use throw pillow for the back. The quality of the material seems good; the mechanics of the recline feature are a little clunky, but OK since we don't anticipate using the recline feature that much.", 
    "I needed a smaller size recliner for my space, this was just what I was looking for, however the color was not the muted camel I wanted, using it in another room, It is somewhat firm, but expect it will be better with use and a bolster pillow. Arrived well packaged and was very easy to put together", 
    "This is perfect. It's stylish, comfortable and easy to assemble. It is a perfect size for small areas.", 
    "Overall very happy with chair. We bought as accent chair to go with two leather pieces in room and really cooridnates well. Only thing don't like is the foam pokes (bent in the inside) on sides along with when the recliner is extended the back piece of product comes off the velcro but easily fixable. Not too confortable for extended sitting but if going for a certain look it is perfect!", 
    "A completely comfortable recliner ... Very stylish and fits my look perfectly. Could recommend.", 
    "Came 5 days after I ordered the recliner. Came ups, in a big box. Opened it up and there was minimal work in putting this together. Bought it for my husband who had a horrible accident and will be healing for about a year, hip and leg. He says its super comfortable and keeps thanking me for choosing it! That was a pleasant surprise, because I really didn't have time to go searching for one and took a chance ordering online. So overall, it's a hit.", 
    "This is an excellent choice and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "I love the fact that its not a rocker, they are hard to find at a decent price. I also like that its a perfect size, doesnt look to big for the room.", 
    "Chair arrived with 2 1/2 inch tear on right side:( Too expensive to send back... Placed chair with right side facing wall. Seat very firm as other reviewers had mentioned so not surprised. Built for average sized adults. My son is 5 foot 10 inches & this chair hits him in all the wrong places... Head rest too short & recliner/leg rest way too short. I'm 5 foot 6 & it feels pretty good.", 
    "We rec'd our chair in a large container & upon opening the box, we found the chair in two pieces & four screw on legs. It was wrapped well & was very easy to put together. I enjoy sitting in my recliner & watching TV most nights. It is easier to recline than our previous recliner which had a handle. I am quite pleased with this purchase & the price was right.", 
    "Excellent small recliner for small space in master bedroom. Very comfortable for my petite frame as well as my husband's 6'2 frame...Very easy to assemble...would highly recommend this recliner", 
    "I really like the chairs. Great deal for the price!", 
    "The recliner arrived very quickly, I was out of town so I had someone here to receive it. It is a very good looking chair and the fabric is quality as well, it looks very nice. It is a large chair, higher seat than my other recliner. The chair itself has a firm feel and is comfortable when reclined. I put fabric spray protector on the seat, side arms and the back. The quality of the workmanship will be determined after much use, no telling how any piece of furniture will hold up but it certainly looks nice. I will recommend it to family and friends.", 
    "I really like this recliner, I am using it in our bedroom. I like that it is a firm chair. It reclines nicely, although when you push completely back the chair doesn't want to stay in position. Love my new chair. Not afraid to purchase furniture online now!", 
    "First, chair arrived yesterday. Today on computer site, chair is $$ less than what I paid. What's your policy for fairness? chair arrived in good condition and easy for this elderly lady to put together. Fabric covering very thin and lighter in color. I have a pet, so I will use a throw over chair for everyday use. Chair mechanism works fine. Others reviews said chair too hard...I like it that way...it's comfortable. For a less costly chair, it's not all that bad.", 
    "I love this chair for me but I am only 5'2. A taller person would likely find it uncomfortable. When my 5'11 daughter sits in it her upper calves (almost to knees) hit the foot rest rather than her lower calves or ankles. She has very long legs but still I think this is fine chair for shorter people. It is quite comfortable, well padded and the tufting is very classic. I am quite pleased with delivery and ease of putting it together. All you do is slide the back on.", 
    "The Brooklyn recliner is a very comfortable chair. Living in Brooklyn i was looking for a recliner that would not take up much space in my bedroom. This is it. And the price is just right.", 
    "Great chair for the price. It is a little firmer than I was expecting but it is still comfy.", 
    "I love this chair! It was very easy to assemble. The material is soft.! I ordered it to match a brown sofa. It looks great, is comfortable, and will be enjoyed.", 
    "Perfect size for the room I was redecorating. Same for the color, love the neutral. Extremely easy to put together. No problems so far. The only reason for frour stars instead of five is that the chairs are a little stiff/hard. I like it.", 
    "I am very disappointed that overstock.com took my order, sent me a tracking number, charged my credit card, and then didn't send the chair. I attempted to track the delivery and after several attempts, I found out that they never had the chair I stock to sell me. While the staff who handles the tracking calls are very nice and try to help, it isn't their fault that overstock.com sold me something that they didn't have to sell. I ended up spending more more to purchase the same chair somewhere else. I think that overstock should send me the difference."
