    "I have been wanting this table for so long. At first I coudn't find it. Then I would find it from 600.00-900.00 dollars. Sorry I was not welling to pay that. So I finally found it on Overstock..great price even caught it with an additional 10% off. Great purchase I am very happy with my purchase..No shipping fees and arrived quickly of course it is overstock :) FYI I found it on Amazon for the same price but they wanted 120.00 for shipping....Yep` Never will I pay that!", 
    "I had to return to leave a review because i'm absolutely thrilled by how this turned out. Delivery was late, and packaging was filled with crummy styrofoam which disintegrates and messes up your floor with tiny bits, but overall the product made it halfway across to world to me in one piece. I was worried because this requires assembly and i have trouble assembling even the simplest Ikea furniture. We had to dig around to look for the instructions, which was also printed on a pretty crummy piece of paper. Everything from then on went great. The tabletop was made of solid pallet-looking wood, and to echo one of the other review -- The finishing is meant to be raw looking. You must be prepared for imperfections that are meant to enhance the \"character\" of the piece. The corners of the table top have been reinforced with heavy cast metal brackets. All you need to do is to fit the wheels on the axel, and fit the smaller wheels to the other 2 sides of the table. It was easy to drive in the screws with the supplied tools -- You do not need to have power tools or the likes of it. I was especially happy at how easy it was to turn the screws in. The holes were pre-drilled and filled with the metal screw holes. So you are turning the screws into a metal piece in the coffee table. It wasn't like Ikea furniture where you had to struggle to screw the screws into wood itself. Anyway, the entire installation took about 30 minutes, and the end result looked phenomenal. The metal pieces were really solid heavy. So glad i didn't buy the Restoration Hardware piece -- This is just as good at 1/2 the price!", 
    "I had been trying to get this table for a couple months. It kept selling our and out of stock. I finally was a ble to get one before they were all sold. Delivered promptly and with tons of packaging. It went together very easily and swiftly. I noticed one of the corners of the box had been dropped but it didn't matter to me because I was distressing it anyway. Took some chains to it and then stained it a little darker. It looks old, rustic and ABSOLUTELY beautiful! It is one piece that everyone talks about when they come into my living room! Thanks Overstock!", 
    "We got this within th epromised delivery time. The quality of the product is great..Just what we expected. the iron parts are heavy and have a rustic appeal . This is an ideal combination of modern and old school. The Table top is very smooth and looks great. The table is a great conversation starter. Try to assemble this where you intend to keep it and moving it later on may be a challenge.", 
    "Excellent price, I've seen similar tables for 3 times the price. The table is very sturdy, assembles quickly and looks great. It's rustic, so the table top surface is not level and the wood is flawed but I believe this adds character to the piece. Highly recommended.", 
    "This table is beautiful. It is a well made great piece and very unique looking. The box was a bit beat up when it arrived but the table was in perfect shape with no scratches. I was determined to find a coffee table in this style but they are so expensive $800-$1000+ so I was delighted at the price. I was a little shocked at how big it really is when we put it together, it is a very large table, not for small spaces that's for sure! However the look and quality of this table far exceeds the price tag. Looks perfect in our living room!", 
    "I was very disappointed in the quality of the table. I recevied a second replacement and had to return that one also.The wood is so warped that I felt if someone put a glass on the table it would tip over. I liked the rustic look but not the warped boards. As always Overstock was very accomodating.", 
    "I like the table and it matches well with my rustic decor. It was very simple to assemble and took less than a 1/2 hour to put together.One side edge of the table looks as if it was scuffed and the stain is splotchy instead of uniform. I would have cost way to much to return it so I kept it and turned that side away from immediate veiwing.", 
    "Love love love it. I've been debating for weeks, Decided I wanted it by christmas. SO glad i ordered it. Its got the rustic look i wanted. Looks great in our cabin. Did i say i love it .LOL", 
    "Great table but it always teeters left and right depending where i put my glass down. Would be 5 stars if it didn't rock.", 
    "My coffee table was delivered promptly, was easy to put together and is very attractive. I was very satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "One wheel was too thick on a part of one side, so that the bolt could not go on all the way. When the bolt was tightened as much as I could get it, the wheel could not roll. I put this \"crocked\" side on the inside so it does not show, but it did detract from the quality of the piece. Overall, I love this table, and only I know the wheel problem.", 
    "I had seen this coffee table everywhere from interior decorating to HGTV shows and it just really became a piece I wanted for my home. I actually used this as the inspiration piece for everything else when I decided to empty out my living room and start over. The room looks amazing and this table turned out to be the center of it. I like that I can put decorative things on it but if I want to put my feet on the table when I watch TV, I can with no worries. The table is extremely heavy duty - it's real wood and real cast iron. Both of these things make it very heavy so you'll probably want to build it wherever you want it permanently. I have hardwood floors so I used a canvas drop cloth underneath it to put it together. One good drop and a wheel probably would have put a good dent in the floor. The picture on the website doesn't really show the top very well. It isn't smooth wood. It is rough and rustic looking which is the look I was going for. It is also pretty dark wood - it isn't the light colored wood that is shown in the picture. Mine is very dark brown to almost black. All of the wheels roll and the two on each end swivel. I have mine on an area rug plus this thing is so heavy (I'm going to guess around 50-60 pounds) that you would have to give it a really good shove for it to roll anywhere. Also, you can adjust how tight you bolt the two large wheels on the side to the table. If the bolts are tight, the wheels won't move. My table didn't come with instructions but if you're at all handy, you can probably figure it out by looking at the picture. I contacted Overstock to ask a couple questions about how to put the table together and they said a customer support person would contact me. That hasn't happened yet. Also, it is helpful to have someone else help you put the table together. I put it together by myself but I had to use wood blocks to hold it to its finished height while I put the wheels on (similar to putting the jack under your car when changing the tire).", 
    "The table looks nice but it had a missing metal corner when I unpacked it.", 
    "I saw this table on another website for much more! I was thrilled when I came across this on Overstock! I absolutely LOVE the table and it fits perfectly with my farmhouse decor. I would recommend this to anyone who loves this look!", 
    "The table looks just like the photo and is very sturdy, but did not sit flush on the floor when put together - one of the wheels was almost 1/2 inch shorter than the others because the holes were not drilled accurately. Had to do some drilling through the metal to make it sit without rocking and get bigger washer to hide the original hole.", 
    "Table is what was expected! very solid and Beautiful", 
    "While I wish the table looked a little less manufactured and little more rustic, (one of a kind), I do love the table and the character it adds to my living room.", 
    "This table is great. Looks awesome with any modern or rustic decor. Easy to put together. Made in China. The only downside is if you have kids who like to sit or lean up agains the corner of the coffee table. The weight is not supported at the corners so it can wobble if something REALLY heavy is put there, like a person sitting. Otherwise, it's gorgeous. We get lots of compliments too.", 
    "amazing quality. This piece is awesome", 
    "Beautiful item, doesn't come all polished and perfect, it has that rustic touch to it. Very easy to assemble!", 
    "Beautiful table! Wood is nice a lovely stain and goes perfectly well in our living room. Great price!", 
    "love this table every body complements on it", 
    "You won't regret of getting this table, just like picture.", 
    "Looks attractive to our living room. Simply but elegant.", 
    "Love this coffee table so much! I can imagine it would look good with any design. The wood is very rich in color and it's so sturdy. Very good purchase for the money. Just beautiful!!!", 
    "Very cool, easy to assemble and sturdy! Love it.", 
    "Very heavy. But so simple to put together and looks so expensive!", 
    "I have been looking for a table like this for a while now at a price that I could afford. Thank you Overstock for offering this gem. I did have to wait a little while for the table to come back into stock, but it was well worth the wait. My table is a rich dark brown with wonderful black cast iron wheels and is exactly what I wanted ! This table is offered at other places for twice or more than twice this price. It is sturdy, was easy to assemble and offers rustic charm and style. I love it.", 
    "Beautiful and great price.", 
    "The table is beautiful !! Good quilty, only problem was those white Lilttle thingys spread all over the house when I open the package, took me hours to clean it off the carpet, nothing to do with the table quilty! only the packaging", 
    "Very sturdy construction and great style.", 
    "Our favorite coffee table ever", 
    "I love this table. I will recommend ordering from overstock.. The table arrived on time. Very easy to put together. The table is sturdy I love the way it looks in my livingroo. Thank You Overstock for very good customer service. I wished that I would have known about overstock a long time ago.", 
    "Easy assemble and high quality!", 
    "Beautiful coffee table and sturdy as well, i added accent accessories like vase and it looks amazing", 
    "very nice table solid construction and easy to assemble", 
    "I have wanted a table like this for some time now. Did not pass it up when I found this one and I recommend you do not either!", 
    "Great Rustic table. Great Quality!", 
    "This was my very first purchase at overstock, compared to another well known retailer, I saved nearly $1000.00. thank you Overstock", 
    "I had my eye on this table for a while, desiring something with a rustic style. This table has been everything I knew it would be. I always get compliments on it. It is easy to clean. The wheels actually work and assembly was easy.", 
    "fine sturdy looks like picture", 
    "This is such a unique piece of furniture! I love the look and I love that it is easy to move so you don't have to pull a heavy coffee table across the wood floors in order to clean.", 
    "This unique piece was just what I needed to bring a touch of pizazz into my living room. I love it!", 
    "Great weight, avoid if you have kids as may tip over.", 
    "It's prefect for my daughters home. And easy to put together.", 
    "I have this in my living room with my otherwise formal looking sofa and love seat. I like that this table tones down the formal feel of the room and is current and stylish. I have gotten so many compliments on this table. It was very easy to put together. Love it!!", 
    "Very happy with this table . Very sturdy .", 
    "Looking for something to stand out. Not the standard look that every living room seems to have. The build is good and quality seems good. The distressed look works for me. Just keep in mind to accept imperfections as they make the stand look unique. this table always get compliments. I like it!", 
    "I love this coffee table, the color is perfect and size just right.", 
    "Table is as appears in photo, its well made, and I'm pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Everyone loves my coffee table! It fits my rustic modern style! The wheels make it easy to move around! It has imperfect wood so I don't have to worry about scratches or scrapes, perfect for grandchildren. Most of my friends say would take it with them if it wasn't so big! It seemed very large when it first arrived , but it fits in perfectly now. I let it stand alone at the front door because it is so sturdy you can sit on it or load it with heavy packages. I just love the uniqueness, and versitality of my table!", 
    "I am sick that the wheel axle is not the correct size. It is 2 inches too short. I hope Overstock will send me the correct size wheel axle so I don't have to send the table back. The hardware is heavy duty and great quality. The table has a nice rustic look but not to rough.", 
    "I scoured the web to find the right price on this bad boy, and I did. Easy to assemble and looks awesome.", 
    "Other than some wobbles, we have nothing to complain about with this table - very durable and looks great.", 
    "For the money I paid turned out to be junk boards keep falling off wouldn't have paid $ cents if I would have know how bad the quality was", 
    "My husband and I both love this coffee table. It is pretty tough and looks so nice! We mix it with our modern white leather sofa and everyone loves it.", 
    "Love this table! I would recommend to anyone looking for a rustic industrial feel", 
    "Just what I wanted. Very beautiful and yet rustic and perfect for my great room. Sturdy and easy to assemble. Well worth the money.", 
    "Great love it it was easy to put together", 
    "I was obsessing over this table but being a bargain shopper I was always a little hesitant about the price. Finally I decided to treat myself instead of spending half on a mediocre table and it was so worth it! Firstly, It came extremely quickly, secondly it is so sturdy and stunning. There hasn't been one person who's come over to my apartment that hasn't complimented my table. It's heavy and well made, not to mention so easy to put together, 10 minutes at the most for assembly! I HIGHLY recommend!", 
    "This seems like a nice piece, but it is lying on my livingroom floor waiting for somebody from overstock to call or email they are sending all missing parts. It came with no nuts bolts or directions. I've online chatted with customer service 2x now. Haven't heard back from anyone it's almost 10 days", 
    "What a fabulous coffee table! Great value, many similar are $$$++. I got the grey, which I have not seen anywhere else. It gives that modern industrial look and looks very expensive. It is high quality. The metal accents and rivets are of high quality too. It is not a smooth finish but it adds to the rustic look. It was extremely easy to put together but the box is very heavy (due to the wheels). The top of the table is already put together you just have to add the wheels. I read some of the reviews which state that it is uneven and wobbly. I thought the same once I put it together but you just have to make sure the side wheels are both facing out which makes it stable. AWESOME PURCHASE!!!!", 
    "This table was perfect and added a touch of old world class to my living room. I just love it", 
    "I like the look and the wheels are very nice and made well, but the wood itself is basically a pallet. It should be better quality for the price.If it was cheaper price it would be a great buy. But overall my wife loves it.", 
    "I just LOVE this table! This table is so unique and classy looking. The quality is great and it adds such a nice flair to my den. I get compliments on it constantly. I placed a globe and books on it for decoration, and hung a cage chandelier above it for a rustic but modern look. This is my favorite piece of furniture by far!", 
    "Table not stable kept wobbling", 
    "absolutely love this table in my living room. It gives the modern rustic look! The only complaint is that the bolts fall off and need to be put back on (i also have children that push the table around quite a bit)", 
    "Well made, rolling wheels, sturdy, beautiful, and everyone (literally EVERYONE) comments on this table!", 
    "The table was exactly as described. Very well built and excellent price. PerfectFor our cabin.", 
    "Looks great in my beach house: have other rustic furniture,,,", 
    "This is a very handsome table and made to last. The table was easy to assemble and came with all the tools. Great buy!", 
    "The table was easy to assemble and looks exactly like the photo online. The delivery was great and now it's new home is in my living room on coffee colored hardwood oak floor", 
    "I've received lots of compliments on this table.", 
    "Love it. The table top has a rippled look which I didn't originally notice in the photo, and a little more trouble to keep dusted than a smooth surface, but the piece is so beautiful, I'll get over that. Easy to put together. The Overstock.com shipping instructions for oversized items said the person delivering the item would call us to set up a time for delivery and we were to inspect the item while the carrier was there. No one called us and we weren't home when it arrived. Everything turned out great in the end, so no issues.", 
    "this table is perfect for the industrial/train look I wanted . it arrived on time and was easy to put together.", 
    "Waited awhile to purchase this rustic cocktail table. Watched the price, then on Black Friday I bought it. Love it!!!!", 
    "I love this table! Would recommend!", 
    "I ordered this lovely industrial looking table for my family room. However, it was delivered to MN and I live in NJ. Overstock claimed it wasn't there fault and didn't see anything wrong with the order (HELLO!!). Needless to say, I never received the item, but it looks great on paper and I'm sure it would have been a great addition to my new FR. Oh well!!", 
    "This table brings life with a modern touch. I will keep it forever with any style or color scheme. I get compliments consistently. So happy with it", 
    "The best quality rugged yet very nice in the appropriate setting", 
    "Easy to put together, goes perfect with my decor!", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks nice. Lots of compliments.", 
    "This is a wonderful statement piece for my living room. The quality is great and it looks fantastic.", 
    "I recently purchased the table to go with our leather furniture and it worked perfect. I have recent several compliments on the table.", 
    "Looks good on pictures ..but some boards came worped an chipped an uneven when put together. ..wish I could return it but it was delivered 4 months ago before I had a chance to see it put together after s cross country move...so very disappointed in this purchase for the price we paid", 
    "Looked far and wide for this coffee table at a great price. Found the best deal at Overstock! Very easy to assemble, no problems with level wheels. Love, love, love this table!", 
    "Arrived quickly. Easy to assemble. Exactly what I wanted. Just as described.", 
    "This table looks great, worth the money, great deal.", 
    "It was easy to assemble and it looks like it is more than expensive than it was. That has been the talk of my guests.", 
    "Great heavy table. Easy assembly", 
    "Top is rustic looking but varnished and nice..many compliments on table..transitional piece thats goes with many styles", 
    "This well built and sturdy item was amazingly well priced and easy to assemble!", 
    "Looks like the one from RH but half price!", 
    "This is fabulous with my linen furniture. I got the Dark Brown. It is sturdy and very expensive looking. Assembly was easy and it was packaged very well. It makes my room.", 
    "Great quality, amazing price and very easy installation.", 
    "Really nice piece. Heavy and feels well-made. Interesting to look at and the price is affordable compared to similar name brand coffee tables. Easy to put together using the enclosed instructions. Slightly uneven slats for table top add character, but you can still set down a full glass of water without spills. Really nice...", 
    "very good looking piece, i like it in my living room", 
    "The wood surface is very unbalanced and rugged, and the wood quality seems rather poor. Neutral comment - the table is quite heavy so lift with caution.", 
    "this table is perfect for that one piece that everyone admires. aunfortunatley, it did not work for my small accommodations as it is a sizable table.", 
    "Amazing piece of furniture", 
    "Love this table. Very easy to put together. Adds a lot of rustic charm !", 
    "This table beat my expectations, especially given the low price. It's heavy, and well built. So much better than the boring traditional coffee table.", 
    "Very easy & quick to put together. Rocks a TINY bit when I put my feet on the table. Other than that, no complaints! It cost about $1000 less than the table I almost bought and looks very similar!", 
    "Was just what I was looking for!!! Great price, prompt delivery, easy to put together. Perfect addition to our family room.", 
    "Looks like the picture only better. Very sturdy.", 
    "This coffee table is rustic, we do not worry about putting our feet up on the table, it is large enough for laptops, table displays and a cup of coffee. The end wheels are a bit shorter than the center wheels so there is a little wobble, but a pad can take care of that. Assembly was pretty straight forward with both required tools included.", 
    "It's unique, well constructed, and does NOT roll (thank heaven). My husband put it together in a matter of minutes. It is very heavy and is not anything that my petite frame could handle. It is our main attraction in the living room. Great price for a unique table. And arrived on time!", 
    "Very easy to assemble. I have gotten so many compliments on this table!", 
    "just as pictured it fits great in my room", 
    "Unique and cool looking. Easy assembly. Looks great", 
    "Bought an industrial style cocktail table from a local furniture company then saw this one. Exactly what I wanted! I returned the original table and bought this one. I love it. Very heavy and well built.", 
    "Pictures do not do this table justice. It comes pretty much assembled. You just have to install the wheels. Have had countless compliments already!", 
    "This table is awesome. Just like the higher priced tables. Easy to put together.", 
    "This rustic cocktail goes perfect in our living room and was easy to assemble. It looks classy and well made. The only slight complaint we had is that one of the board on top is a little uneven, but we just chalked it up to be part of the 'rustic' feel. Great buy!", 
    "Love love love this table! Looks great. Very sturdy. My teenage son put it together for me!", 
    "I have used overstock for several of my decorating needs. This is one of the best. I saw this similar item at restoration hardware and their price was through the roof. When I received my table it was packaged well, easy to put together and most of all it looks great in my living room! Mission accomplished, the money that I saved I will use it at this site to purchase end tables. Thank you overstock for having a unique selection!", 
    "The 2 smaller wheels are not level so the table is constantly adjusting. Also it is not as rustic and authentic as it looked in the photo", 
    "Great conversation piece, unique style", 
    "If you are wavering on this coffee table, don't. This was the absolutely best purchase I have ever made on Overstock. High quality, very stylish. Definitely a conversation piece. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this table!!! I had no problems with splinters. The boards are uneven on top but not enough to cause an issue. True character added by the look of the boards and the black metal trim/wheels. Very heavy piece. Comes packaged very well. Styrofoam pieces sticking to the item was an issue, but was easily solved by using a leaf blower outside to the pieces before bringing them into the house. Came right off.", 
    "Exactly the appearance I wanted in my living room. As others have said, the boards are a little uneven, but I guess that's the effect for the \"vintage\" look.", 
    "Absolutely loved it!! Looks very sturdy and this table completes the look of our living room. Assembly was complete in under 20 minutes. Would totally recommend...", 
    "I would recommend this coffee table to anyone, I love it! Great quality material used and very durable. This table is beautiful and functional along with being the prefect size. I love the fact that it rolls out of the way for ease to clean under it or more out of the way temporally. This is an awesome table and totally worth it.", 
    "Looks even nicer in person than on the screen. Solid piece, sturdy... looks much more expensive than it was.", 
    "Purchased the TV stand with Cocktail table and I love them both. They were both easily put together and blend well in the room together. The wood and metal combination look great together. I would definitely recommend them both!", 
    "The first time around not all of the pieces were there. Instead of just sending me one of the missing pieces and screws, I had to box it all back up and send it back. I get several compliments on this table and it completes my industrial feel living room.", 
    "I saw this on Pinterest a long time ago and was so happy when I found it on Overstock for much less money than on other sites. The quality is excellent, very heavy duty. Easy to put together but best for 2 people since some parts are heavy!", 
    "Love this table! Unique and just what I was looking for. Have seen other replicas that looked phony and cheap. Size is great for my room; price was even better! Delivery was quick; item packed well and assembly was easy and quick. The long bar was bent and thought I'd have to call for replacement but continued putting it together and it worked. Can't see the piece and is not affected by it. I highly recommend Overstock! Glad I gave them a try!", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks great!", 
    "Very cool table. The axel came in smaller, which didn't allow for us to build the table but overstock took great care of us and send a full replacement. We were able to pull the needed part out of the new delivery and our table works perfectly. It's a really cool design", 
    "Very easy to assemble. Looks very nice in the seating room", 
    "I love this table. Its heavy and looks great. However, I was suprised that the table top is uneven to reflect the rustic look of barn wood being used. I wasnt prepared for that but I actually really like the character of it. Well made, easy to put the wheels on and the shipping was so fast! Love it", 
    "I Love,Love this table! My husband had no trouble putting it together :)", 
    "exactly as pictured, sturdy", 
    "I love, love, love this table! It is by far a much better price than anywhere else I looked and it is fabulous! SUPER easy to put together....it took maybe 1/2 hour.", 
    "I have seen this for twice the price so jumped on this when I saw the price and other reviews. We were looking for a more rustic and unique piece for a new condo we have in the mountains. These looks great. Love the accents and works well with the leather sofa.", 
    "I love this table! My living room has a posh elegant feel and I wanted to capture a Southern Country look that wouldn't clash and make the room more comfortable. This was a perfect selection! Everyone one that comes over says, \"wow, that looks great!\" I'm very pleased and would recommend this coffee table. It's sturdy, beautiful, and assembly is minimal. It's was very well packaged and arrived in a timely fashion.", 
    "Love this table and so glad I got it!", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for and stands up well - a couple of scratches but those are hard to see due to the finish.", 
    "Table is well-made and was very easy to put together. Love how it looks in our living room. Only problem is that I have three little kids and I really wish there was a way to lock the wheels. It's only a matter of time before they try to take it for a joy ride around the house.", 
    "We saw a table like this for $$$$ at a furniture store and wanted one like it, but were very skeptical to pay so little online for it. When it came it looked amazing. It holds up great and we are a rough-and-tumble family.", 
    "I truly love this table, however it is heavier than I expected.", 
    "OMG, got a lot of compliments on this table. It's an awesome wood piece in my den. A few assembly required, but it's very easy..I was done in minutes!", 
    "Just as pictured and very sturdy, but again, the shipping company ripped up the box. Nothing was damaged in the box but as we pulled it in the house, the huge wheel (solid metal) fell out and chunked up the tile. Again, not Overstock's problem, it was the shipping company.", 
    "My wife and I saw a table just like this at a custom furniture store that had been repurposed from a shuttered textile mill. They wanted $1200. When I saw this on Overstock I knew I had to check it out. Delivery was quick but I must warn you that it comes in a big, heavy box (BIG, HEAVY). Assembly was a piece of cake with the enclosed hex wrench and took about 10 min.It looks great and we couldn't be happier, especially considering we saved about $800!", 
    "This table looks wonderful in my living room. Great job overstock.", 
    "After shopping around on numerous websites I found this particular style on overstock. It was very easy to put together after opening the package. Approx. 15-20 min. The item was securely packaged and no shipping damage. Only wished the table was a little darker, so the photos are true to color. Of course you can't beat the shipping price..$0.", 
    "Love this table! Goes very well with the \"rustic classy\" theme going on nowadays! Very happy!", 
    "Good quality, nice looking and easy to assemble.....", 
    "Sturdy, well crafted, beautiful addition to my living, everyone loves my home and decor! this was a nice added touch!", 
    "Easy assembly. The surface might be warped/bent, this is just how these furnitures are fabricated given its rustic design. Everything worked for us, but do take this into consideration for your purchase.", 
    "I like this table. Good size and nice look.....wish it was a little more roughed up. Lol. My grandkids will give it character soon enough.", 
    "I would totally recommend this table to a friend or family member. The item shipped fast and it was free shipping. The Table itself is of very good quality and sturdy I would say it is the best purchase I've made so far on overstock. So very happy and pleased with the table!!!!!", 
    "Table is stunning and I receive a ton of compliments but it's extremely wobbly and unsteady. If you have a glass of water on one end and someone were to put their feet up on the other end the glass of water would for sure fall. The only way to fix it would be to drill new holes into the wood. Other than that, it's quite charming and has lots of character.", 
    "This cocktail table provided a very chic look to my living room, and was exactly the type of conversation starter piece that I was looking for. Assembly involved only screwing the wheels on, and took only a few minutes. The table and the wheels are very very heavy (80 lbs.) and it was a task to maneuver.", 
    "Just what I was looking for", 
    "Very sturdy, love it. Looks good with furniture we had.", 
    "There are eight boards across the top. Three are not even with the others but it gives the cart a more rustic look so I'm keeping it! Overall it's well made and assembly is a breeze. Fast shipping as always!", 
    "It is a lot bigger in person but adds the perfect rustic/industrial touch to my living room.", 
    "Excellent look for an apartment lobby where it gets high traffic", 
    "Enjoying the cocktail tabke.", 
    "Excellent purchase. It was just what we were looking for. The picture and description where spot on. Easy to assemble. Great quality.", 
    "If you want something that is low profile and sturdy and don't mind no drawers this for you. Plus, it a talked about piece.", 
    "Wow! This style tables from other stores cost a fortune! I bough it when it was on sale, and it is just perfect! Exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "Give splinters not what I expected", 
    "Matches very closely with description and pics. So get 4 stars straight.Package arrive without damage except very minor nick on one side which is ok as it matches with other distress marks throughout. Assembly didn't take much effort except that parts are heavy to handle.Reason I'm limiting it to 4 stars is to caution other customers that package was quite heavy to handle & assemble. packaging of one of the boxes was ripped although contents were intact. Also, a lot of thermacol padding was used to protect the parts and it sticks to the parts so be ready to clean up after. If it had to be returned for any reason, it'll be quite a task. Lastly, in my opinion, it is quite an expensive item. $$$-$$$ would have been an appropriate price.", 
    "I bought this coffee table for our living room. My husband loves this table! it has a nice rustic look to it. Although it is made in China, the table is sturdy.", 
    "absolutely everything you would expect..a little darker than pic but above in quality..put it together myself in minutes..heavy duty...just love it!!", 
    "Much darker than pictured. Welds broke within 3 months with no wear and tear. Had to have repaired locally.", 
    "I love this table and get many compliments from my firends", 
    "I had been eyeing this coffee table for so long. Everywhere else had it for triple the price and the knockoffs weren't as beautiful. I finally took the plunge and ordered it. After digging through tons of foam (make sure to have your vacuum handy) to get it out of the box, I put it together easily and it looks perfect in front of my sectional. Its very substantial, sturdy and eye catching. I smile every time I walk in my living room.", 
    "When I saw this, I just had to get it. It fits my quirky style. It's very solid. The wheels make it easy to move around the room. The picture makes it almost seem pine colored, but mine is a bit more walnut colored. It's definitely a hearty table. And heavy. Super easy to put together, but it might be wise to have someone help because it is solid and unwieldy until it's put together.", 
    "Well made, easy to assemble! Looks great!", 
    "It arrived in a timely manner, holly styrofoam, the mess was nutts, but putting it together was 15 mins. Love it, glad i added this coffee table, and i was happy with the price", 
    "beautiful table, good size, and easy to put together", 
    "I like this table, look so nice and expensive. Only one problem was when I got a delivery, package is poor and inside foam is broken and all over the table, it take longer time for cleaning than assembling.", 
    "We love this table. Not only does it add a lot of character to our living room, but the build quality and materials used are also decent. A good buy.", 
    "Table arrived timely and was a breeze to put together. It is substantial and heavy. Much larger than I expected in a good way. It is a statement piece in our living room. Love it!", 
    "Great table. Easy to put together. Great quality. Looks great.", 
    "Exactly what I wanted. It has created a warm feeling in my living room. Easy to assemble. It arrived promptly. I have received many compliments.", 
    "I don't usually leave reviews, but I am so pleased with this purchase that I have to let everyone know! First, this table is rustic. The top is not smooth, but textured pallet-like pine boards. Some boards are a little warped, but not so much that one cannot place a glass on it. If you are shopping industrial decor, than you are probably ok with imperfection - it adds character! The stain is similar to walnut. Warm, medium-dark but not orange. This piece is very heavy, sturdy (after a quick adjustment to the wheels), and easy to assemble. Great price, too! As others has stated, a drawback is the packaging. Styrofoam pearls everywhere....but if you have a vacuum handy and use the wand attachment as you unpack it is much less messy. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.", 
    "I wanted something different for my new hime. Not the traditional old coffee table. This table speakers to me as it represents a time in America when WE made things. Things made well by hard working Americans. They used carts like these to haul the items they made in factories. Sad to say, this one is made in China. I really do like it, very much!", 
    "It makes my man cave look great, Its a nice center piece for the room. When people come over they can't stop talking about it. I love it.", 
    "OMG! OMG! Love it!! I've never bought any furniture on line before until the last few months and then everything has been purchased from Overstock. I've been really pleased with all my purchases (there were some issues with a couple of items but Overstock customer service was superb on each and every occasion dealing with things to complete satisfaction) yet this table takes the biscuit! The color, quality and unique look of the table are all second to none, you will not be disappointed.", 
    "Absolutely perfect. Easy to assemble. Shipping was fast. Sturdy and well made", 
    "I have been looking at this table for awhile now and finally decided to order it. Shipping was fast, received it in less than 4 days.Both my husband and myself love how the table looks. Already have received compliments on it. Assembly was easy, less than 15 minutes. Yes there were little Styrofoam bits around after unpacking but the vacuum cleaner works well to pick them up. Well packaged. I would recommend this table to anyone.", 
    "It is gorgeous, big, very solid and sturdy and was very easy to put together (maybe 20 minutes from unpacking to finish). The finish is nice and the cast iron parts are beautiful..", 
    "Love this table, it is the perfect fit to my industrial living decor. Very solid. Great price. I was shopping for one and was finding them at $***.** and up. I would buy it again.", 
    "I bought this table along with other matching pieces for my daughter. It's sturdy, beautiful, really good quality and affordable. I love the industrial look of the wood with the black metal. This is nice, clean line furniture, not bulky at all. This is great furniture for someone just starting out in their first place, or retirees. It's timeless and lends itself to different styles of decorating. You won't be disappointed, it's even nicer in person that the pictures convey. The wheels on this table are just mega-cool...I love the entire look of this piece! We turned the end wheels inward so people aren't tripping over them and it still looks beautiful!", 
    "excellent value. beautiful in room. Everything we expected", 
    "We love the table. It was easy to assemble and looks awesome!", 
    "WE LOVE THIS TABLE. IT IS RUSTIC BUT YET VERY STURDY.", 
    "The cart table was as advertised on site and looks great in our living room. The price was the best compared to other online retailers. The product shipped in well packed box and arrived on time. The table was pretty easy to install. Having an extra pair of hands helps to put it all together since it is be a bit bulky.", 
    "Very good price and good look. A little smaller than standardBut good price. The metal piecesOn both ends caused a lot ofTripping. We turned them around,And although they don't look as good,People are not stubbing their toes and tripping. But I do like it.", 
    "Very happy with the purchase. Great price on a design that usually goes for triple of what I paid for. Sturdy, authentic-looking (def not a cheap knock off!)", 
    "I love love love my new coffee table! It was very easy to assemble and everyone says it looks good.", 
    "For a fraction of the price this looks just like the higher end table you find at that popular store!", 
    "I love, love, love this coffee table! This is a focal point in Living room and have received several compliments. It is real wood, and I enjoy how it gives a rustic/industrial feel to my living room. Highly recommended!", 
    "This table is breathtaking. I'm not taking anything off for the shipper delivering it damaged. Overstock handles everything appropriately and in favor of the customer.", 
    "Nice wood and iron. Unique and rustic. Height great. I wish it was a little longer. It is somewhat wobbly when you put your feet on it but not a deal breaker. Must note it is in it's natural wood. So it has roughness to it. Need to be careful when wiping. It has gaps on top die to it not being a solid wood top. Overall I am happy with it and the price. We make it work.", 
    "This coffee table looks so beautiful and there is nothing cheap about it. I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for something rustic, I LOVE it!", 
    "Easy to assemble, sturdy and perfect for the industrial rustic look", 
    "We had seen this table in ********** ******** for $$$$ and loved it, but their prices are so high. I couldn't believe it when I saw it at Overstock for 1/3 of the price. Love it and get lots of compliments on it.", 
    "Super easy assembly, looks just like the photos. The wood is a little 'softer' than I thought, but no issues with it at this point. I was a bit surprised to see that the table top was not connected by bolts from the top, but rather small wood blocks screwed to the sides underneath the table.", 
    "this was what I expected. Easy to put together. Highly recommend.", 
    "I've been looking for a table to put in my living room for about a year. I saw a similar table for about $$$$! I thought I will never own that until I saw it on overstock! The quality was just as good as the high end one and I didn't have to break the bank! I get a lot of compliments on my table!", 
    "I was not disappointed in this table in any way. It is exactly as pictured but even better in my living room. The price made it a little hard to believe that it would be as nice as it is. And, as usual, Overstock's service was flawless. Arrived in 3 days!", 
    "I've had my eye on this table for months. Saw it in Big Bear at a furniture store at a much high price. Put myself on the alert for the reduced stock and when overstock notified me the supply was low, I ordered it. Easily put together and totally changes the look of my living room. Beautiful, solid, and totally makes over a room. Outstanding buy Overstock.", 
    "This is the one piece in our house that everyone comments on. They are shocked when they hear that it was an Overstock purpose and even more surprised when they hear the price.", 
    "My husband and grown children absolutely LOVE this table. The packaging came slightly beat up and I was concerned that there might be damage, but fortunately there was not. It looks fantastic in our living room. We get many compliments on it from our guests. Love, love, LOVE!", 
    "Easy to put together. Love the look and get so many compliments. Beautiful color and details.", 
    "This is a great alternative to the refurbished $600+ versions of this table. It is made in China, yes but the top wood is uneven and has little imperfections that allows it to pass as a one off piece. The wheels do roll around very easily if its not on carpet, not sure why another review said this was very difficult. Perhaps it depends on how firmly you tighten the wheels. Its a nice heat off the floor, great buy.", 
    "This is a nice rustic table. I priced it other places and this was the best. I am already getting compliments on it. It looks like the picture shown.", 
    "I was a little hesitant ordering furniture online without seeing it in person first...but this table is awesome. Exactly as pictured...very heavy duty wood and metal. Took about 15 mins to put together, only need a couple of tools that were included int he packaging...and I didn't need a second pair of hands or anything. It shipped quick and arrived right when it was supposed to. It was packaged in styrofoam which protected it during shipping...so it showed up without any scratched or anything...but it got about a million little pieces of foam stuck to the table and throughout my apartment...took about a week or two finally rid myself of all the foam. I really like this table...it look great with my furniture...I am really happy with it.", 
    "Thanks it looks beauriful...easy to assmble n very nice", 
    "Great coffee table for the value. Solid and smart looking.", 
    "I have wanted this table for a while but only saw in it Restoration Hardware where I felt was a little bit pricey.Saw it on overstock.com and decided to order it. I absolutely love my table and I am very happy with the quality.It was easy to put together did it by myself. I recommend any one who wants this table to order one.", 
    "Heavy duty materials and east to assemble. Looks amazing!", 
    "If you're even slightly thinking about buying this coffee table, DO IT. It is a gorgeous quality, and the wood is even better in person. I'm in love with the rustic/industrial feel of it, and I have softened that with a tufted couch. All in all, another great purchase from Overstock!", 
    "I love this table it is very sturdy. The iron wheels and distressed wood makes for a original piece. The picture is true to color. My table top came damaged with a few scratches that need to be filled with stain, because of it being wood I don't think it will be a problem trying to match it.", 
    "This table is gorgeous, it really stands out on its own. The top of it is not even or smooth, but you can still use it for its purpose. The box did not have the instructions; however, it is super easy to assemble just by looking at the picture. I will definitely recommend this product.", 
    "Gorgeous piece of furniture and does not feel or look cheap at all. The color I received is more of a warm cherry color but it is beautiful. It is a definite crowd pleaser and I would highly recommend it.", 
    "Arrived in good time. It was VERY simple to attach the legs, the device for tightening was included. It is true that it's easier with someone to help hold it up while another is working on the legs/ wheels. It's very attractive as pictured, rustic and unique. I have had many compliments! II feel it's going to hold up well as its very sturdy and the rustic finish let's me and guests relax with usage of table.", 
    "The table is beautiful and almost indistinguishable from the RH version. Great buy!", 
    "This piece is unusual compare to other tables found in homes. I loved it.. People have to stare when they come to visit me.", 
    "We just finished our addition and wanted to go Retro-Shabby-Chic in our new Great Room. We re-purposed old crates as baskets, an old Singer Sewing Machine (left in the attic by the previous homeowner) was cleaned up and used as an entry table and we purchased this Vintage/Rustic Cocktail Table as our centerpiece. What a beautiful addition! The table is solid wood construction with wrought iron hardware and was super easy to put together. It is a substantial piece that looks much more expensive than the Overstock price. The wooden slats are not even (as stated in the other reviews) so you need to be careful when setting down a wine glass--but the boards are wide enough that you don't have to over think this. If you want something unique, well-built and vintage-inspired...you have found it here!", 
    "This rolling table is quite unique. It is incredibly rustic, seemingly bullet-proof, and a conversation piece. It is also very heavy (get your 2 brothers-in-law to haul it into the house!) The wheels and casters are functional and attractive -- and heavy. The iron castings appear o-l-d (vintage). The look is very realistic. The wood top is slightly uneven and exhibits planer marks which actually add to the vintage appearance. Mine is not so uneven as to make it unusable for drink placement. Splinters are not an issue. The wood is hardwood, I believe -- species unknown to me. But it is attractive and smooth. The wood top is thick which adds to the vintage appearance. Overall, the tabletop has the appearance of being made from the thick, wooden cross-members used to make pallets. My single (minor) concern is the precaution one might need to take to prevent the iron wheels and castors from leaving rust marks on a rug/carpet. Small squares of clear plastic solve the potential problem for me. This is a GREAT product...and reasonably priced. I highly recommend it.", 
    "I was very worried about making this large purchase online worried if I did not like it what would I do and if the return policy would be easy. So glad that I did not have to cross that bridge. We love this table so much all of it's imperfections and style is great. Overstock made the buy process easy and it was delivered on-time.", 
    "I love this table! I thought it would be smaller, but it is actually a pretty large table. I have two couches and this is perfect for the space. The surface is a little bit uneven, which is why I gave 4 stars. But I guess it's \"vintage\" and supposed to be a little roughed up. If you're looking for a unique piece for your living room, this is it!", 
    "My husband picked this table and I was kind of unsure about it but it is beautiful! !! I put it together with ease. It's heavy and very sturdy. We get many compliments on this piece!", 
    "It arrived quickly, was packaged well. May not be very good if you want to move it around a lot...will probably function well in stationary position.Assembly was simple and quick. Overall, good, solid product", 
    "Just amazing Great packaging Super quick shipping Brilliant price I am incredibly happy with this product and have ordered the \"matching\" tables & bookcase too..", 
    "Overall, the table looks very similar to that in the picture. Although I realize the table is supposed to look rustic, the quality is fairly poor, in that it is unevenly stained, has areas where it isn't sanded as well as the rest, etc. It is a nice \"fashion\" piece... just don't look too closely.As always, Overstock provides excellent service and replaced the initial table (which had an extra dent from shipping) quickly and without hassle. The price on this table is not as outstanding as most Overstock items but is fair.", 
    "The table is awesome. The iron items are heavy and well made.", 
    "Just opened the package and put my table together, it was so easy and looks great. I wasn't about to pay 500.00-1200.00 dollars for one. very rustic and good quality. I say if your looking for this style get it you will not be disappointed!", 
    "I always wanted this and when i saw this on sale i had to get it, and so glad i did. My husband loved it too!", 
    "This table is rustic, heavy duty and extremely movable. The planks are solid wood and the sand cast wheels are very realistic. You could probably use this as a real four wheel cart to move freight. Very easy to assemble!", 
    "This table surely is getting a lot of attention when we have guests around. We love it and makes its presense. Glad we bought this.", 
    "It's rustic so you don't have to worry ... Great for our family room ...", 
    "It took me (no lying) 13 mins to put it together. But 1hr to clean the styrofoam that came with the package. Very good package protected it very well. The table is heavy but the wheels allow it to move when you have to do cleaning. Looks of very good quality but I haven't had the need to move it around so there is no chance I could damage it that way. I love the look, everyone who has seen it does. I put a base with flowers on top and it looks just awesome. I love the look of the wood and the steel. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and considering the other pieces of furniture this company sells. Plus fast and excellent customer service from Overstock.", 
    "great piece for the money, very solid, people comment on it eveytime they walk in my house.", 
    "This table is perfect. To think I was willing to pay 1,000 for almost exact same table. Excited for it to be in our new home.", 
    "Very sturdy table, although the top is not even. Came in chipped on a corner while in shipping, but were able to fix it with stain. For some reason, men who see it in my LR did not give a positive opinion, and all the females are simply in love with it. I bought all the furniture from XX, so this piece matched the overall appearance.", 
    "I can't believe how beautiful this table is! It truly is stunning! The color is darker and richer looking than the photo. Very well made and sturdy. Went together easily and quickly. All I can say is I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this table.", 
    "Stunning! An interior designer friend of a friend could not believe I got it on Overstock and for the price I did.", 
    "Totally worth the value! Very nice quality, beautiful design and steady table is super unique for my living room! Easy to assemble, and I believe there is a reason for the table that is so heavy. One of the happiest choice of this websites!", 
    "We absolutely LOVE our new coffee table! It has just the right amount of rustic appeal and is so heavy and sturdy! Seriously, when the box arrives be prepared to do some heavy lifting. My husband had this thing assembled in under 30 minutes. Highly recommend this table! You will not be disappointed.", 
    "This table is exactly what we were looking for. Priced just right and easy to put together. It is made of heavy solid wood and steel parts. It looks great in our living room and isn't so pricey. So when we are tired of it we won't feel guilty getting something else. If we don't tire of it, it seems like it will hold up for years to come.", 
    "I love this table! Installation took about 15 minutes. It is extremely well made and an excellent value.", 
    "Got this for my son's apartment. It was easy to assemble, looked just like the picture (thank goodness) and fit the decor perfectly.", 
    "I like this table better than the more expensive ones! My kids crawl all over it, use it as a seat, a table...and it has held up great. The wood is real (not veneer) and the iron wheels are HEAVY.", 
    "Two months back I ordered this table and to date i'm waiting on the parts to put together the wheels. The item arrived with missing parts. Many calls later, Overstock parts dept sent us replacement only they were wrong parts again. Overstock customer service is awesome though and is trying to do their best but i ordered the whole tribecca ensemble and now am out of luck with the table. Bummer!", 
    "The table is funky and very cool. I have it in my family room where the setting is casual. I had a cocktail table that was actually about 4 inches taller. The room actually looks bigger with the lower height table. The stain was missing in some spots right under the top but it's not that noticeable from above. I didn't return it because the table is so heavy. I'll fix it another day....overall I like it.", 
    "This table is awesome , it is defiantly a conversation piece. It has that old vintage look but works great with modern pieces to. It rolls easily on the carpet so you can vacuum. Lots of room on top. Every one that sees it wants one to lol. I just say Overstock.com", 
    "Came just as pictured. It was not very hard at all to put together. It was just the right height for use on my outside patio. I absolutely love the rustic look!", 
    "This reproduction industrial warehouse cart is a really good value. THe quality of materials is very good. The wheels don't look as authentic as they do on a real old industrial warehouse cart, but they are a good quality and the look is good. Actually the top was nicer than you would see on an authentic cart. Some of the authentic carts have splintered wood and rough edges that don't make it entirely family-friently. It was easy to put together and sturdy. It isn't tippy like some of the authentic carts we've seen. This will be a nice rustic addition to our family room.", 
    "LOVE THIS TABLE. Bought matching end tables. Well constructed. Heavy, durable. Great modern rustic look at fabulous price point. Not difficult to assemble.", 
    "Totally satisfied with this table. Top boards do look warped but that's the style. It's suppose to look old. Very happy with product!", 
    "I really like this table and have bought the side table as well. My only complaint is that this table is not flat- instead some of the planks are raised. As this is more of a sitting room than daily use, i have kept in anyhow. I do love the look of the table.", 
    "'Ve been wanting this for a long time.The few authentic ones I found were too expensive, beat up or too low. This is the perfect height, perfect size, perfect price. It is very heavy and the wheels are very heavy cast iron. It looks perfect in our living room with our antique tribal rug. It can go with any style furniture. I tell everyone tp put their feet up on it and enjoy. I will distress it a little in the near future. Love, love, love it.", 
    "Table is rather large in dimensions, but makes a great statement piece in any room. Wheels are made of cast iron, so it is very heavy. But goes together in a snap and looks great.", 
    "It is well made.Easy to assemble and is a conversation piece.", 
    "Great table that fit exactly the look I was going forward. My husband originally didn't like it, but now thinks it's cool and everyone comments when they walk in our house and see it. GREAT buy and value compared to competitive products.", 
    "This cocktail table is being used in our family room/home theater.... It was easy to assemble...I was looking for something to encourage a casual atmosphere... this fills the bill! To take some of the roughness off the top, I applied a small amount of furniture polish... It helped to bring out the grain in the wood...as well... It has a unique look, which we enjoy....", 
    "Table arrived quickly and all parts in good shape. Attaching wheelbase and end wheels was a snap. All necessary tools included and instructions quite clear. I did it by myself (medium build female) and positioned it with no help. The end product is every bit as good as triple cost cousin over at Restoration Hardware. If the industrial style speaks to you, purchase this table with no hesitation. I highly recommend it!", 
    "The table is great. awesome construction... The shipping sucked, the box was destroyed! But the table all in tacked. I've gotten plenty of comments.", 
    "This is definitely a \"rustic\" piece - which is exactly what I was looking for. Great value for the price (especially with a 10% off coupon and free shipping!)", 
    "I have been searching for a similar table in furniture stores and online and they were hundreds of dollars more than this table for the same look. It looks great in my living room and functions well.", 
    "Different look that would work in a loft or less traditional location. Heavy duty, but assembles quickly.", 
    "I love my table! But it is heavy!!! My nice UPS man put inside for me...but should've waited for help during assembly. I managed...but an extra hand would've been nice.", 
    "Awesome table. I wouldn't recommend it for a household with children. although it works as a coffee table just fine, it's more for looks than use.", 
    "Bought this coffee table for my city apartment. Get tons of compliments. Its beautiful and sturdy.", 
    "Man, I wanted to love this table but... as good as it looks, it is nowhere near well made. The design is not good. Ends wheel are rickety and the wood that they are bolted into splits easily.We actually sent two of them back because they both broke in the same place. When we tried rolling it across carpet, the end wheels wouldn't turn, they caught on the carpet, and the wood split... on both tables. Bad design. Also, the large center iron wheels are supposed to roll between two plastic washers. Obviously, that doesn't work well at all. Bottom line... Overstock was great as always handling the problems but I would not recommend this table. Spend the extra money and go for the real deal at RH.", 
    "toatl junk wheels feel off the first night wood is split and falling apart, item is going back", 
    "I ordered this coffee table for my new formal living room. It seriously took me only 15 minutes to assemble and the table looks amazing. Truly a great value for the money. Gives that great rustic look to any room. A must buy!", 
    "This is a great table. Everyone who sees it tells me how much they love it, Since it is kind of rustic, if someone drops something or marks the table in any way, it simply adds to its character. Fabulous piece.", 
    "When it arrived I could not believe how heavy it was. When I opened it I was thinking oh boy this looks difficult to put together but wow was I wrong it was a sinch. It it of great quality in my opinion. I love an industrial look and it was just the perfect piece to accent what I already have. I bought the tables too and it all looks so good together. Great buy!", 
    "I love this piece, however the wood is darker than pictured with a redwood tone in it. it was easy to assemble, and wood has lot of character, I also orders their 40 in bookcase and end tables and they look great together", 
    "I LOVE MY Vintage Industrial Modern Rustic Coffee Table. It was extremely easy to put together. Looks even better than the image. The most authentic reproduction I have found on-line and I had been looking for quite some time. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "The table looks pretty rusti, which I l I ke, the wheels feel like iron and are heavy", 
    "Better than expected....LOVE IT! Quality is far superior than expected for the price. Do not hesitate to order", 
    "just want I wanted. it's big and solid but easy to move and unique looking.", 
    "Absolutely adore this table and receive a lot of complements on it! It is heavy though - so be ready for that.", 
    "Pretty and easy to set up. Much cheaper on this site than anywhere else I have seen it.", 
    "Assembled very easily. Looks beautiful, very on trend with our new industrial lighting in the room.", 
    "I've been searching for a table like this for a long time. This was the first one I found for under $1000. I'm extremely pleased with the product. Very sturdy and solid. I'm always getting compliments on it.", 
    "Easy to put together, better looking in person than on line.", 
    "THIS WHAT PEOPLE NOTICE THE MOST WHEN THEY GET INSID MY HOUSE. THIS TABLE IS A PIECE OF ART....LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT. CLASS, LUXURY, RUSTIC YET CHARMING. PLEASE GO GET YOURS", 
    "This is a fabulous table for a great price. Have seen similar elsewhere for much higher prices. It was easy to put together and it is very sturdy. Love the rustic industrial look. We also purchased the bookshelves and side tables for our living room and they look awesome together.", 
    "I have seen tables like this online for much more. The color in neutral and will go with other colors of wood. Best of all the instructions for assembly were great. I suggest two people, but one strongish person could put it together. Have had several compliments.", 
    "This is the addition to our living room to make it rustic and cozy. Its eye catching and we always get compliments. I would recommend this if you are looking for that rustic feel to your home!", 
    "It does come with assembly required but it is very easy. The quality is great. I had looked at similar pieces online for hundres more but am glad i found it on Overstock.", 
    "I couldn't of picked a better table in the store. Call it luck. I am more than pleased with this item and the price was better than going to Home Goods.", 
    "basically satisified I could have returned it but fixed it instead", 
    "I love it! the boards on the top look distressed and uneven - which is exactly the look I wanted.", 
    "being looking for several yeaaaaaaars for a similiar antique or like project...finally just deceded to get this when i was lloking at overstock.Not disappointed. I sprayed several layers of helm spar right after assembly as it is in my lake house subjected to potenial of sandy feet and splilled drinks . Assembly was very quick with no difficulties or missing part.Thanks overstock.fair product for a fair price. Made in China though ..could we try to support American industries?", 
    "I absolutely love this table. The height of the table in the picture appears to be lower to the ground, but in actuality, once assembled it's the perfect height. I've received lots of compliments. Negative: The instructions were missing from the box.", 
    "Absolutely LOVEEE this table! It was a bargain compared to the others I have looked at...yet it looks like a million bucks!", 
    "The first table arrived and the top was split so had to reorder. Overstock made all that go smoothly and quickly which I really appreciate. The second table came quickly and was well packaged. It is heavy. The wood is a bit rougher than I had hoped. I want people to be able to put their feet on it without a splinter. I am sanding a bit to accomplish that but it is not a big deal. Using it in the great room of our mountain home and love the look. Only thing I would change is to have some sort of 'brake' mechanism to keep it from rolling when you don't want it to. Some of this style of table has a pin to accomplish that, this one does not. For the price, I am very happy with it.", 
    "Easy to assemble perfect size for medium living room.", 
    "The quality of this table was poor. Wheels were scratched. There was a quite large chunk of wood out of one of the long sides down deep to raw wood missing. Obviously not done in shipping. It's a shame because this would otherwise be a nice looking table.", 
    "I too have seen this table in designer stores for double the price of overstock! We have received a lot of compliments ,and that's awesome where did you find that! The wood is great no splinters . No regrets here", 
    "I had ordered this table back in Dec., though unfortunately I missed the attempt in the deliveries. Then when I tried to re-order they were out of stock. I receive an e-mail stating the table was back in stock. I immediately ordered it. The day it was delivered, he came to the door first to insure that I was at home ( this table is quite large & weighs 79#+. So, even the UPS guy seemed to be carrying quite a load. I had to wait to get help to put it together ( I have leukemia & have many restrictions) So, I paid someone for what I could have easily done before chemo in a short amount of time. I was so very disappointed to see the damage. It appeared that either it was dropped on one corner or like someone took a hammer to it.(Not realistic just a comparison) Also, underneath there are 3 straps that are stapled underneath the table, though this troubled me regarding how it passed Q.C., each strap had 10+ staples and more than half of them were barely in the wood, many just one end of the staple. The 3rd strap, though there was about a dozen staples in the table, the strap as was all of them were extremely frayed on each end & this strap was not attached but laying on top of the large amount of styrofoam, almost like an afterthought. I have yet to learn what the straps are even used for. I called O and the C.S. agent was very kind and apologized. I was given a choice of a re-order or a refund. That was tough, but considering I had to pay someone for putting it together and it took about 2 weeks to even make those arrangements, I choose for a refund. O did give me a credit as well. The table itself looks great, though as I read in previous reviews, this is a very large table, but it really does make a statement. O, I have learned always wants to have a satisfied customer which is huge with me. The table is great & if not for the damage, it would be set up in my living room now. The important issue here is the way O will take care of their customers, and I will continue to buy from O.com for anything that I am looking for they are the first place that I will look. I still gave this table a GOOD RATING, I would have given it an EXCELLENT if its condition were different. And, yes I would also recommend this to a friend. I realize things happen, & when the table was turned over I noticed it does say,\" MADE IN CHINA\". Not sure if this means anything.", 
    "This is such a statement piece of furniture. It give great character to the room. It was very solid and well made, with gorgeous iron wheels. I was so pleased with this product", 
    "loved this table. Looked at quite a few that were alot more money and then I found this one. Exactly what I wanted and for half the price.", 
    "It's really an elegant coffee table, I really like the look and the big surface. Installation was quick and easy(less than 30 mins), and I love love this table. Both wood and metal look high quality. The packing still need some improvement, one side of my table was dented in shipment, but it was too noticeable.", 
    "The table looks amazing! When the table was shipped, the box sort of fell apart, but nothing inside was damaged. The wheels and hardware are quite heavy (70 lbs) so during delivery it was tossed around and the styrofoam packaging pieces were broken and were EVERYWHERE. The wood itself is quite light. The table is hollow beneath the side panels, but still looks high quality with \"worn\" detailing. It was easy to assemble (a few screws for each wheel). I spent more time cleaning up the styrofoam than with assembly. Be sure to measure, it is bigger than you realize but as long as you have a sense of how much space it'll take up. I've gotten a lot of compliments for the table and I've seen it on other websites and even in stores ranging in price from $$$ to $$$$ so this is a really great deal.", 
    "Ordered this table for my son who had seen a similar table at a store for a considerable higher price. It is exactly what he wanted and looks great in his living room.", 
    "I absolutely love this coffee table! It's definitely a conversation piece and comes with a lot of character! It was hard to get it inside (but the heaviness didn't bother me because of the quality) and it literally took me 30 minutes to put it together. And for someone who usually gets her husband to do these things, it was very easy and manageable to do myself! It adds character to our living room and I absolutely love it!", 
    "If shipped safely I would be completely satisfied.", 
    "I've been looking to purchase this table for a while and when I saw it on Overstock and immediately palced my order. IT LOOKS GREAT in our family room! I am thrilled!!!!!!", 
    "This is a delightfully cool coffee table. I bought it for my living which is undergoing a complete overhaul. Great conversation piece and different from what you see in all of your friends' living rooms. I love it !", 
    "I have been wanting this table forever. I put it together and its off balance. Its leaning and the wheels are not even. It rocks. I'm sure once I put down a rug it'll even out but I'm a little disappointed", 
    "Love it!! This is an excellent coffee table. Very heavy and sturdy, easy to put together, unique. The surface is rustic looking with the boards on top slightly uneven by design. Looks fantastic in the bonus room and will be put to good use. This table is not going to be damaged if someone puts their feet up or forgets a coaster. My only complaint is that the packaging for the wheels (which are VERY heavy) and hardware was totally inadequate so they were crashing around in the box during shipping, causing some superficial damage to the interior/underside of the coffee table. The damage does not show and in no way compromises this hefty table so there was no need to return it, but the packing should definitely be different. The wheels should be securely packed in a box within the larger box to prevent any damage.", 
    "this table is awesome. It's sturdy, heavy and very good quality! Bought the entire set, I'm not a matchy/matchy person and like that they all go together but are all a little different. highly recommend!", 
    "Arrived in 4 business days and was thrilled that packaging was not beat up like so many others had reported. It was well packed. All of the wooden parts were already assembled which was very nice. I was expecting it to be totally unassembled. Attaching the wheels and axle was easy. The wheels are very heavy thick Iron. Nothing cheap and flimsy about this table. The wood finish has a strong odor but like all finishes it will fade in time. LOVE this table and I am thrilled with my experience with Overstock.com", 
    "I was concerned about purchasing such a large, heavy piece of furniture for fear it would be delivered damaged. The box was a bit torn up, but the packaging protected the items from damage. The table arrived in perfect shape just one week from ordering, even during the holidays. I just love the rustic look. The iron parts are heavy and may require a second person to assemble. I am not usually able to follow instructions for assembly and had this put together by myself in about 30 minutes. A very nice table for a better price than I have found anywhere else. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "This table was exactly what I was looking for. Love it!", 
    "We have received many complements on the look of this table. Had seen a few, but this price could not be beat.", 
    "There is a formaldehyde problem that is very apparent when you open the box.", 
    "For my new home, I had been looking at this online for a couple months, trying to figure out the 'ship' time until I arrived at my new home. It all worked out and was an easy assembly, what a gem it is, just love the look of it.", 
    "Fast delivery. UPS left outside and I had to move up 3 stairs. That was quite challenging as it was heavy. Husband put it together without losing his temper. That was a good thing. It looks great and couldn't be happier.", 
    "Love, Love, Love, this coffee table. Didn't disappoint me one bit.", 
    "I am more than satisifed with the Myra Cocktail Table...looks great and a real conversation piece...I love it!", 
    "Everyone who walks in the house comments on the table. I saw it on another site and held off buying then saw it on Overstock for less! Delivered on time but carton was a little beat up. The Iron wheels had come lose in the box but did no damage. Very nice table.", 
    "The products packaging was dismal. The styro foam was shredded as the internal boxes had riped off the strings they had tried to secure them too and due to that the heavy wheels chipped quite a bit of the underside and edges of the table. I would have given it 5 stars if it had arrived in good shape and it did not have any damage. I would have no idea on how to return it for another so we're going to try and make this one work.", 
    "We love the appearance of the cocktail table, and it was super easy to assemble. It does however, have an unpleasant odor about it. We hope this will dissipate with time. We recently had the same problem with furniture we acquired from ***. I guess the Chinese factories are using smelly finishing products.", 
    "Beautiful table but the bar that crosses underneath came bent so the table shakes. Otherwise it suits my decor and I love it. If not for the shaking, its perfect. My mother ordered the same table and hers was fine. Packaging was in terrible condition so Im not surprised mine was bent.", 
    "This piece is fun and unique and wonderful for our new family room. Our 2 year old wheel obsessed son loves it. The only drawback is that it was machined unevenly and one side is a three quarters of an inch off from the other, so if you exert any pressure, it tips a bit. We'll have to be careful with our drinks. Excellent price - and is a suitable knock off of the original factory cart you can find online from another major retailer.", 
    "I was not disappointed when I received this table it is easy to assemble and a fun piece...my only complaint is it looks a little too perfect and not rustic, so the big scratch/ dent in the top of it when I received it was OK. Yes the packaging was terrible, the way it was packaged it was destined to be damaged. I was lucky not to have much damage so I didn't report it to Overstock Customer Service.", 
    "This is a very unique table that actually rolls, making cleaning under it very simple. It has a very unique look and will get noticed in any room you place it in. The quality of the wood is average, but since it is fairly rustic, any damage that may occur while you own it can be easily covered up with some simple wiping stain. I would recommend to anyone wanting this rustic look.", 
    "This same coffee table sells for a lot more at pottery Barn. I am a fan of overstock and the products they sell .", 
    "I love this table! Very rustic and industrial. The quality is great also. I have had numerous comments on how expensive it looks. The box was delivered and was so beat up I thought the table would be trashed. It actually was not damaged! Thank goodness! The table is very heavy and sturdy, I would not have wanted to prep for a return. I highly recommend this coffee table!", 
    "Its a really nice table! It was fairly easy to build but the instructions were torn in two pieces!! We had to stick the paper together and look at the instructions. It is a very good sturdy tabel and looks very good quality.", 
    "I really like this table. This is the second one we got. The first was damaged during shipping, but Overstock replaced it immediately with a another. It is a bit wobbly, which the first one wasn't, but not very noticeably. We have it sitting on a carpet which helps. Overall I am very pleased with this coffee table.", 
    "This was the first time I've purchased something this large on line, I bought this and an entry bench. Haven't opened the bench yet as I still have to refinish my floor, but the coffee table is great. I had seem similar tables but they were all really big and I needed a more medium sized table. The metal hardware is solid, (watch your toes), it has a wonderful reclaimed lood and feel to it. Really didn't expect to be so pleased with it.", 
    "I have seen this exact piece priced for over $500. I love it! It's a great look for a fraction of what one would expect to pay!", 
    "The table is great. It came damaged and you were very good about keeping in touch for a replacement part. The part wasn't available, so a small credit was applied. Great company", 
    "The box showed up in tatters--I was amazed that all of the components were still intact. Packing was very poor; this table is HEAVY. Fortunately, the furniture is rough hewn and the hardware is iron--so breaking it will-take some doing. I really thought I was going to have to send the product back, but the dents from the wheels bouncing around in the box are underneath the table so no harm, no foul. The table is really cool, but recommend that the packing get looked at again. The UPS driver told me to take pics and send it back.", 
    "I was sad to see broken and bent parts. The product looked cheap."
