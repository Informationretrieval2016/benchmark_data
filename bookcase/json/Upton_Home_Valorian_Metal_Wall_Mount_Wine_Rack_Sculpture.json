    "We needed a wine rack that would keep our wine bottles out of reach of our young grandson so we opted for 2 of these wall units. They are quite attractive on the wall- one on each side of the bay window. I would gladly have given 5 stars to this product except for one difficulty. There is no simple way to hang the racks perfectly straight on the wall. Ours are off just a little so that they move slightly when inserting or removing a bottle from the rack. This has caused small marks on our wall. I do believe that I can prevent this by placing small plastic stick on bumpers on the back and that may prevent the racks from moving when placing or removing bottles.", 
    "the metal wall mount wine rack is perfect for my wines. I have the rack hanging in the dining. All my friends remark how beautiful it looks.", 
    "OMG !!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this wine rack,I love the fact that it is made of metal and gives off the appearance of leather . My sister came over and had to touch it to prove it was metal .Certainly a focal point and a conversation piece *** would be proud ....lol .", 
    "I bought two of these one for each daughter. They were very well made and are very beautiful.",

    "Simple to install and friends love it. Great price and quick delivery.", 
    "Nice looking piece on my wall", 
    "Lots of color and functional. Easy to put up. You want to touch the individual holders.", 
    "Love it.... true colors.... lots of compliments on it", 
    "Purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband who has an \"Old World Themed Tuscan\" basement with a wine cellar. He mounted this unit on the wall close to the bar and has wine bottles in it. Many many folks have complemented it. It is exactly as it is pictured on the website!", 
    "Fits perfectly in my dining room", 
    "This is a unique rack but it is still in the box. I just don't know where to hang it so I can't honestly review the quality. I might end up giving it as a gift. The colors and style limit its use.", 
    "Nice but difficult to hang up", 
    "hides too much of the pretty bottles", 
    "Love this wine rack - I get SO many compliments on it, and have never had a problem with the weight of the wine. The first time I hung it I didn't even use anchors (I don't recommend that, at the time I just didn't know any better), and it held bottles in each space. But it's beautiful and fun, and again, SO many compliments!", 
    "It looks like wall decor and blends well with my decor.", 
    "Very nice color and easy to assemble.", 
    "The item itself is nice and matches the description. However the nails that came with aren't suitable for an inverted mounting arrangement off the wall. We substitute with a longer nail in the side that wasn't into a post and the other is in the post okay, but the heads of the nails barely go over the mounting arrangement on the wine rack, making it seem somewhat precarious.", 
    "Daughter loved it, decorative and functional", 
    "Very happy overall with this purchase. It is an unusual item and matches my d\u00e9cor perfectly.", 
    "Love the colors of this wine rack.. Gave it as a gift and my son loved it.. Fits well with any decor", 
    "space saver, great accent piece", 
    "This looks good on the wall even without wine bottles in it. The \"holes\" are even big enough for different bottle shapes.", 
    "Love this. I put it in my kitchen which has a little of a Tuscany theme.", 
    "Nice looking. The decorative value is good, quality is ok but much smaller than I thought it would be.", 
    "I saw this item pictured in a magazine while flying on a plane. I wrote the name of it down and was quite pleased to find it on Overstock! I love it! It is precisely as pictured, and is perfect for me because I don't use too many bottles of wine, so it is just the right size. It is a metal sculpture thatholds wine. I almost purchased another to hold towels, as shown in one of the pictures, but decided this was good.", 
    "This product looks great, was easy to hang, and came with the hardware. I love it!", 
    "Had to figure out how to hount it on the wall.. because of the weight of the bottles it had to go in a stud.I ended up using a piece of wood screwed it into the stud then screwed rack on the pieceof wood. How that its up it looks great!!!!", 
    "Nice conversational piece of deco item as well.... Love it!"
