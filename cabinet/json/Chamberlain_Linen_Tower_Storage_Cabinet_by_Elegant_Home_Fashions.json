    "Wow, if you want to spend several hours, improving your manual dexterity and fine motor skills, this is the cabinet for you. I bought two and it took almost an entire day to complete the assembly. You know you are in trouble when the first thing you see after opening the parts is a hardware kit of 100 or more parts.", 
    "First of all, I ended up having to get another one because the first one arrived damaged - the box was really broken up and 2 of the 4 legs were smashed along with some cracks in the drawer front. I got the 2nd one & put it together and it was ugly with a capital UG. I ended up selling it on CraigsList after putting it together. Oh, and it wobbled. Even though the second one didn't arrive damaged, the feet were still uneven. The color is not at all representative - was an ugly brown faux wood look. All I can say is the person who bought it from me on CL had bad taste. I sold it for more than I paid, too!", 
    "Iam very happy with this Item it looks and works well in my bathroom", 
    "Color is definitely oak and finish is more glossy than image. Fairly easy to put together but use your common sense when following the slightly incorrect directions. My door hangs a little skewed because the pilot holes weren't lined up properly but it's still very functional and attractive. It does come with a support strap to connect to the wall implying that it might not be completely sturdy. However, I'm not using it for anything weighty so it's been fine without it. I'm not planning on keeping this for a lifetime so all in all, I feel this was worth the money I spent.", 
    "My husband has assembled many things before without any problems. He told me this was a piece of junk. We had a fight about it. Save your relationship, don't buy it.", 
    "Tower looks nice, but is difficult to assemble. It comes with hardware that doesn't apply to this item. The directions consist of very poor drawings with no detail or actual written instruction. Pre-drilled holes to attach the door would have saved 50% of the assembly time. Also, the shelf that is permanently attached in the middle of the tower makes it extremely difficult to screw in the middle door hinge. On the plus side, it comes with a wall strap, and the unit seems very sturdy. Center shelf is stationary, but other 2 shelves are adjustable. Magnetic door closure is difficult to line up properly, but pre-drilled holes would solve that issue as well.", 
    "Fitted well with everything in room. Take your time putting it together. Nice.", 
    "The item could be a more sturdy for the price. It matched my decor but I wish it was less expensive or stronger.", 
    "After reviewing all parts inventory we did not realize that parts o and p are just the opposite (they face each other) and cannot not be substitued otherwise, they sent two \"p\" parts and no \"O\" part which is what we need to assemble the cabinet. This is not a reflection of the quality of cabinet, nor anything on Overstock. I have emailed the company directly & know Overstock will follow through on any Customer Service.", 
    "This cabinet was a little complicated to assemble. Once assembled it was a nice size for the small space I needed it to fit into my kitchen. It looks elegant and even though the oak color is darker than it appeared in the picture online it still works!", 
    "I needed a narrow media stand so with a few added cord holes in the back it worked perfect for me. It was easy to put together, total time was less than hour. Quality is not the greatest but definetly in the range I was expecting for the price. It has some cheap finishing but when it's all staged you can not really tell. I'm very pleased.", 
    "Assembly was a nightmare, we love it but hated putting it together. I would pay 2 or 3 times the price to buy it assembled You must be very handy or prepare to burn it", 
    "It's frustrating to get a product and there are no instructions to be found. You cannot find the instructions online and customer service can only deliver in 3-5 business days. So now I have an unpacked assembly required stack of parts n my living room until instructions come.", 
    "Good quality. Exactly what needed. Fit perfectly in area intended for.", 
    "I was disappointed in this purchase as the color was darker than pictured. It was also missing two components that screws were supposed to lock into so we improvised rather than deal with returning it.", 
    "One star is not for Overstock service at all...shipping time was quick and packing was fine. The item inside is simply garbage. The first piece we took out was a side panel and it was cracked and split. The \"wood\" isn't solid. It's like someone put it in a grinder and put it back together with spit. It's really the most low grade particle board I've ever seen. The next piece we removed was a drawer and it was split and coming apart. There was no possible way to fix it and try to make it work. It only took looking at the two pieces and we said forget it! Back in the box it went and requested a return label.", 
    "I really want this cabinet but it has arrived dammaged 2 times. Overstock has been outstanding in handling this problem. they paid for the return each time and I hope the 3rd time is a winner.", 
    "Luv the outcome but challenging to put together.", 
    "Looks decent. Assembly was easy despite the picture directions with no written explanations. Much better quality than I expected for the money", 
    "I purchased this item to store my fabric as I am a quilter and this is perfect, because you can see what's inside!", 
    "I purchased this to go into my home office. I will say it LOOKS good, but... I have assembled a lot of furniture and this was one of the more difficult. Sides are not well marked and ended up with door backwards because of it. Only defining difference in left and right side are the tiny screw holes for hinges that should be on your left as you face the front. Not super sturdy, but it will work for me in a use that is not everyday. I doubt it would hold together long if used as a linen cabinet that is used often. It is an OK piece but I was somewhat disappointed.", 
    "Fairly easy to assemble, great for holding bathroom \"supplies\" like soap, cleaners, etc, etc.", 
    "The screws didn't line up so we had to leave the door off.", 
    "I repainted this, really cute and a good size.", 
    "so the instructions are cumbersome. Took my wife and I 40 min. to put together. The color is not as seen in pic. It is more of a yellow tint. The pieces are hard wood and make sure to buy wood glue for the wooden dowels and on the surface around the dowels. This will make the piece much stronger and sturdy. I had read other posts about the piece wobbling. That is because the wholes for the wooden dowels are bigger than the wooden dowels, hens the wobbling. So use wood glue. Use a power drill on a low torque setting, that will speed your production time.", 
    "Easy to put together. It looks great with my current bathroom vanity. lots of extra storage and easy to see the items on the shelves. Bottom drawer is small.", 
    "Easy assembly; Well made and good quality \u2013 Would recommend.", 
    "It was NOT difficult to assemble.My husband had NO problem. The directions were easy to understand,you just need a little patience! The cabinet is simply beautiful!", 
    "This is a good piece of furniture. it was actually mistaken for a Homemade Piece from a local cabinet maker. Easy to assemble and looks great. Drawer sticks some but not enough to make it unbearable. Actually, gives it an antique.feel.", 
    "When I opened the package and began to remove the parts, the glass came out of the door, and the wood frame fell apart. I had to try several times to put the frame back together. The glass was heavy and made it difficult to glue. The glass was wonderfully strong and did not break. I am not wildly happy, but I am okay with the cabinet.", 
    "This Linen tower was a bit difficult to put together but doable. My husband put it together in about an hour. There was some trial and error. He had it partially built and had to rebuild after realizing he had some pieces backward. The directions are not super clear. Once built it is perfect for the spot I'm using it and the size is perfect for me. It doesn't sit perfectly on the floor so I got some felt to build up two of the legs so it would sit more evenly on the floor. I'm not sure if its the cabinet or my tile floor. Maybe a bit of both. Overall I would recommend this as a nice extra storage option.", 
    "I bought this for extra storage in my dining room. The finish color matches my dining set nicely. I put some pretty window film on the door to obscure view of contents and it looks great."
