    "My son picked this out for his room (along with the matching bookshelf). It is very nice and sturdy. A little time consuming to put together, there are lots of screws. Got the whole thing put together and went to put in the keyboard tray only to find that it wouldn't fit. Had to go back and loosen up a bunch of the screws, slide it in, and tighten everything back up. The metal is a dark gray flat finish. The wood is a medium/dark wood tone with a very light wash of gray over top. Overall more wood tone than gray. The desk top is very textured wood grain so will have to have something underneath for writing.", 
    "Love the look and size of this desk. Looks great in my son's room. My son has a desk model computer and the tower fit nicely in the adjustable shelves. Took my son and a friend 2 hours to assemble. It has a rustic look and the top has ridges which I like so it won't show wear and tear in a boys room as much. The only complaint is the bumpy top is not good for writing, so I will be adding a glass top to remedy this issue.", 
    "This desk is exactly what I was looking for. It is very sturdy and well worth the money.", 
    "My son needed a desk with enough surface to fit his homework and gaming needs. This functional desk fits his needs and also fits in the limits of his bedroom. The desk size is perfect, neither too small nor too big. It looks great, is very high quality and I may consider other pieces in the line when we upgrade his room. Only downside is that solid wood is very heavy. We took it to the second floor in pieces and assembled it there."
