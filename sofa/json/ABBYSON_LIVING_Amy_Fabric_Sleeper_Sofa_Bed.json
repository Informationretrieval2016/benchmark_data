    "This \"click clack\" sofa does not come pre-assembled as stated. It comes in two boxes / four pieces, with no instructions. Overstock couldn't help us, so we ended up telling them where THEY could find the instructions for How to assemble a click clack sofa. This isn't a big plushy sofa. The seat isn't deep. It is firm, and sits you up, rather than sinking down. It has a bench feel to it, which I won't mind. The storage box can't be opened unless you pull it out from the wall about 6 inches, so will only use that if making it into a bed. It has nice fabric that seems durable and easy to keep clean. I wouldn't recommend jumping on, or slamming down on this sofa. It doesn't seem as though it would hold up under a lot of abuse. Overall, if you need something that doesn't cost a lot - It seems like a pretty good choice.", 
    "This couch is poor quality. It really looks nothing like the picture. Think how a cheeseburger looks in the picture at a fast food joint versus the way it actually looks after you purchase and unwrap it. I was immediately disappointed. The fabric is nothing like how the picture would lead you to believe it is, and sleeping on it is not comfortable at all. I was holding off writing such a negative review, but a spring just broke as I was sitting on it (I'm under 150 lbs). To be clear, I didn't plop down onto it either. I was literally already sitting and it just caved in on me. I've only had this couch for 5 months, and now I have buy a new one. To be honest, I was looking for an excuse to get a new one anyway. Save your money, look elsewhere.", 
    "poor quality, poor craftsmanship, springs broken in 1 1/2 months...no backing on the back of sofa, hard as a rock [very uncomfortable]........no children in this household.....had to toss out after having this for 2 mo. use", 
    "I bought this sleeper sofa bed a year back. It is nothing compared to what is shown in the pics.The entire unit is fragile and the springs are of such poor quality that I had a spring sticking out of it in only 2 months time. It's been a year now and I am trying to sell it off. Well guess what no one wants to even take it for free. I would definitely not recommend anyone to buy this couch!!!", 
    "Used this as couch and bed the first day it arrived! It is very firm. The instructions left out the first part - had to study the pictures to get it right. But, it didn't take long.", 
    "We have had this futon for a few weeks now and we love it.I really wanted it for extra sleeping space. One thing I love is that it doesnt look like a futon, more like a sofa . Great setting and the brown color is beautiful!", 
    "Very disappointed. Didn't even get it out of the box. It is hard as a rock. It is a bench style, reminds me of a vehicle bench seat but extremely hard. It would also have a dip in the middle. If you like sleeping on rocks, this is for you! It says fabric sleeper but couldn't feel the fabric--couldn't get past how extremely hard it was.", 
    "This was a big disappointment. First, it is only suitable for children to sleep on it because the center is split and an adult will drop down into the crevice. Second, you must remove the arms of the sofa every time you want to use it. Third, it takes 3 people to put the arms back on to the sofa. The main thing is that it is not very comfortable to sleep on. Definitely not worth the money.", 
    "I was so disappointed in this piece of furniture. it is hard as a rock to sit on and im sure it will be the most uncomforator to sleep on. the service of scheduled delivery will make me think before I will order anything again.", 
    "This sofa is perfect for our spare room. Comfortable and converts easily into a bed! Love the Black option!", 
    "Very uncomfortable and hard to put together. It also is a very poor design as a sleeper. If you put any weight on the back, it tips over.", 
    "Excellent firmness for this futon. Exactly what I was looking for since as a futon is what I use it for everyday. Storage too is excellent."
