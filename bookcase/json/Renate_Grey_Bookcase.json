    "I bought this in the hopes that it would mimic a bookcase sold in a popular home catalog for 3-4x the price. It is the perfect depth, height and size for the space, and its dimensions are almost exactly what the other, more highly priced bookcase is. The quality however is not. These shelves are like a hard plastic with a stamped wood pattern into them, whereas the real bookcase shelves are like reclaimed wood. The metal on this is very dark, almost a charcoal steel, whereas the expensive version has lighter pewter colored metal. This one was very simple to put together, although the box it arrived in weighed a ton, so i had to take it upstairs piece by piece. Its fine for the price and I'm keeping it, however its in my front living room and can be seen by all entering the home, so I wish it looked more high end. Its a marginal foreign copy of a nice, more expensive piece. If its in a non-important location, its fine for the price. I would have preferred, with 20/20 hindsight, spending the extra money for the real version.", 
    "Great shelving at a wonderful price. Heavy pieces but once laid out, fairly easy to assemble. Bottom shelf is NOT marked so look closely at each shelf BEFORE assembling as bottom shelf has small screw holes in each side piece where leg/wheels fit in. I assembled upside down but requires two people to tip and then lift to upright. Might want to \"air out\" shelves in a garage or outside for a few hours or a day before putting in house as they do have a chemical smell.", 
    "After reading the other reviews, I was a bit hesitant in ordering this bookcase but, having had great success with previous oders from O.com, decided to chance it. Am so glad that I did! I had been comparing this one to similar items on two other high-end sites and the difference in the item price and shipping cost could not be passed up. When the bookcase arrived, assembly was a breeze (the hardest part was getting the bookcase into it's upright position, because it is heavy). Now I have it in my kitchen for additional shelf and storage space and it adds an expensive and trendy industrial look, which is what I was going for. Had I purchased this bookcase from store X or Y, I would have paid 2-3 times the amount plus $95+ for shipping.", 
    "I love the look of the shelves, and the size, but I wish we had not bought them because of the smell. Judging from the smell, they may need 6 months of off gas before we can use them. The design was a nice idea, but could have been implemented a little better.", 
    "I had been admiring shelves on another well-know furnishings site, but they were way over my budget. So I was thrilled to find these on O for less than a third of the price. They were easy to assemble, although very heavy - definitely need two people. They look just as pictured - although the measurement of width was off by over 8\". Overall the pieces look very much as pictured. However I ordered two shelves, and one unit has much lighter colored shelves. The shelves are rougher and it seems like they were just not finished with a topcoat. The other unit has one shelf that is also much lighter, but I figured that when they have pieces on them it will not be an issue. All in all for the price I consider them a great find.", 
    "I looked at this bookcase for a while and I bought it for my son's room. It arrived in a really heavy box and I had to wait for my husband to get home to drag it inside. The box was really, really dirty and banged up but the bookcase was undamaged. It took me a maximum of 1/2 hour to put the bookcase together, it is really heavy though and I did need help to flip it the right way up. The corner poles come in 5 pieces, each with a long screw sticking out of the end which you screw into the next piece (and shelf). It does not have 4 continuous poles on each corner, hope that makes sense? I asked Overstock before I purchased this item what the shelves were made out of- they are mdf, with a distressed veneer and a metal surround/frame. You only need a screw driver right at the end to secure the wheels. The wheels are functional and we used them to get the bookcase in the correct position in the room. I'm really happy with the bookcase and the quality especially for the price. The item arrived very quickly too.", 
    "If you're thinking that you are getting a \"greige\" look of cerused oak with a pewter tone metal, think again. It's black metal with a slight antiquing and a wood-like substance that has a \"blackwash\" over chocolate brown . Assembly was straightforward, but the box weighs 70 lbs. The finished piece is very heavy as well. I'm using it to hold toy baskets in a family room with a river rock fireplace and craftsman vibe, so it's fine. It's industrial, but not like a European antique. More like something made in China, which it is. It's OK for the price. I'd never pay the outrageous prices that other retailers charge for \"industrial\" furnishings. If I'm paying $1700 to $3000 for a bookshelf, I'd wouldn't buy a trendy reclaimed/industrial piece.", 
    "Whoever thought this looked 'plastic,' as one or person reviewed, doesn't understand this type of furniture or look. This bookshelf is beautifully executed and would cost much, much more in a high-end furniture store and 5X's more in a decorator showroom. Love, love, love this bookshelf. Just the funk I needed to take the cool edge off my more streamlined modernist furniture.", 
    "Easy to put together! Very heavy box. Really love this piece.", 
    "I am not sure what all the complaints are about. No piece of furniture is perfect and nitpickers are going to find something every time. If it's true industrial style you are going for, these fit the bill perfectly and they cost about a third of similar styles in several of the popular decor catalogs. Yes they stink a little due to the paint - that will fade, ventilate. No they are not perfectly square - nobody is going to get a level out and check all your individual pipes - we're talking millimeters here. Yes there's a chip in the paint here or there, but I think that makes them more awesome. They are so heavy and burly looking that you could actually picture these being used in a factory. They are not difficult to assemble, I did it by myself with some careful planning/placement. Yes the wheels work - albeit only L to R, but they do function. There was no damage to the pieces other than a few small chips in the paint, but I consider that a bonus. These are for you if you really want true \"industrial\" - if you want dainty little metal and wood racks pick some of the other \"industrial style\" shelving units on Overstock. That being said, I bet they will have imperfections too. This is my third \"renate\" set purchase for my office and I've been happy every time. The pieces look great against a hardwood floor, they are super sturdy, they look expensive IMHO, but they are easy on the wallet. What's not to like about that???", 
    "This bookcase is a very heavy, solid piece of furniture, but definitely has its flaws. The metal poles that sit between the shelves are not straight, giving the whole thing a crooked and awkward appearance. I was able to turn the poles so that the crooked pieces face the back of the bookcase which sits against a wall, so it is not as noticeable, but for the price I would expect a little higher quality. Easy to assemble but the shelves are heavy, it took two of us about 20 minutes to put together. I was disappointed in the way it arrived, all in one box, with the box ripped and falling apart. It is so heavy and bulky it would be better off shipped in multiple boxes. There was no damage despite the torn box when it arrived, however. It's a huge piece, I'm glad I have 10' ceilings and an open space, otherwise this bookshelf would overpower a smaller room. Overall, I'm satisfied but it is overpriced for the quality and I would not purchase the item again. If it weren't so bulky and heavy, I'd have actually returned it.", 
    "Easy to assemble for one person. Quality finishes. Some of the fittings are not quite straight so you have to work with it. Wheels do not move easily. Nice deep shelves that can hold big baskets for storage.", 
    "Great Bookcase - super easy to assemble. It's a little wobbly at times, not completely solid when put together but for the price it is great.", 
    "Very nice for the money but the wheels are not great", 
    "Achieves the rustic look I was wanting to present. Went together easy and is sturdy.", 
    "we own the bookcase and matching desk (I'm sitting at it right now) and I am so pleased with these pieces. We've moved them across states and they are still as sturdy, and beautiful, as they were when we bought them.", 
    "Great looking piece to match companion desk. Sturdy but wheels don't turn correctly.", 
    "Was searching for something different & unique & this bookcase is exactly what I had in mind.", 
    "Beautiful, perfect. Be aware it is quite large.", 
    "I ordered this bookcase last week and received what is clearly a bookcase that has been purchased, returned and resold without inspection. About 80% of the box my bookcase arrived in was beaten up: dented, tape coming off, pieces of styrofoam falling out of it and holes all over. Inside the box, the item had clearly shifted consistently throughout transit because all pieces of the styrofoam that are supposed to protect and keep the pieces still were broken and falling apart. The bookcase shelves were not tightly packed and were thrown on top of broken boxes containing the rest of the bookcase pieces. There are supposed to be 20 legs for 6 shelves, but my bookcase only arrived with 16. And the inside screw part of one of the legs I DID receive is stripped so badly that neither another leg nor one of the feet will screw into it. Eleven of the legs and all four of the feet have indentations in the finish where someone clearly tried to screw the pieces together previously. There are scratches in the finish throughout a number of the parts and the screw part of one of the feet was also bent so badly it won't screw into any of the legs, which makes it impossible to put this piece together. Surprisingly, the shelves were not damaged, but intact shelves are useless without legs to hold them together or feet to hold up the bookcase! Finally, the inside of the box was so disheveled that the assembly instructions were torn to shreds. The only part I could decipher was the list of parts that are supposed to included for assembly. I searched online for instructions, but could not find them anywhere so I did my best to figure out basic assembly, but have no idea where the screws/washers should go. It is clear by the shoddy packaging that this bookcase must have been re-wrapped in its original packaging, sent back to Overstock and then shipped out to me without any inspection whatsoever. That's the only explanation that makes sense for how beaten up the box and internal contents are, as well as for why screws would be stripped, why there would be scratches on a number of pieces and why I would be missing some of the pieces I need to put this bookcase together. The box is so badly beaten up that I have no idea how I am going to get the parts put back in the box to send back. I ordered the coffee table and side table to match this bookcase, but given the nightmare I've just endured trying to put this bookcase together with used parts and missing pieces, I am afraid to even open the other boxes.", 
    "This is NOT really on wheels. It is only able to move either left or right OR front or back. If the box had not been so damaged and i did not notice the casters were not 360 I would have boxed this up and sent it back.", 
    "beautiful, so easy to assemble, packaged very well", 
    "I got the whole set of Renate tables for my living room. This one is great and fit set well. Its a little bigger than I'd like but i can adjust the height down by removing sections. Its sturdy, very heavy, and super easy to build. The pipes don't look perfectly straight which is the only reason i wouldnt give is a 5-star rating but I'm very happy with the purchase and can prob work on straightening out all the pipes if i really wanted to spend the time on it.", 
    "For the money, this is fine. Delivery was super fast. Other reviews I read were pretty spot on. I bought this unit about 6 months ago. It did have a strong chemical smell for the first couple weeks - I would NOT recommend this where there is no ventilation. I kept the window open round the clock for a week or so and it still took weeks for the smell to dissipate. No smell at all now though. It is very sturdy/solid once assembled, and the shelf spacing is roomy enough for file boxes or tall books. Again, as another reviewer commented, the shelves are synthetic something, I like the brown/blue/grey tones, but it really does not look like wood. Other than this, it is pretty much as advertised.", 
    "This bookcase is a beautiful piece that combines distressed wood and pipe. It is incredibly sturdy and love the casters!", 
    "This unit looks as good in person as I had hoped. Industrial look which suited my kitchen with slate tile flooring. I had to mix and match the pieces a little to make it look straight, as each piece between the shelves screws into to shelves above and below. The finished product was great for the price and I intend to get another Renate piece or two to compliment it.", 
    "This piece is awesome easy assembly, looks great! !", 
    "If you are looking for a unique industrial look, look no further. This bookcase is a heavy solid piece. The distressed metal and reclaimed wood really make this piece. I put this together myself but I should have waited for help from my husband. It is not difficult to put together but it is very heavy.", 
    "I'm very pleased with my purchase . It works very well in my space, and it adds just the right touch of industrial chic.Best of all assembly was easy because all I had to do was stack each shelf and simply screw the legs in.", 
    "Fantastic shelving unit I use in my office to hold books, file boxes, decorative items and my printer. It was simple to construct, has a minor wobble, but is overall a solid buy. Reminds me of something I would have spent 3X as much on at Restoration Hardware.The casters are teeny tiny, but they do move the unit, albeit slowly.Overall, five stars to this item and the Renate line. I have a few pieces from it.", 
    "Great bookshelf. Arrived slightly damaged due to shipping, Overstock rushed me a complete new one and sent a label to send the old one back. Will recommend!", 
    "Very nice piece and works well in living room. Very tall, so I removed one of the shelves. Also, deeper than I anticipated so it did not fit where I had originally intended, but I found another wall for it. Easy to assemble - put this together very quickly with the help of my 12-year old. I am considering buying additional pieces to match.", 
    "I purchased the book case and two side tables for our guest room, and I also purchased two towers for our master. My husband assembled all of them this past weekend and, while they look good and seem to be sturdy (they are very heavy), they have a very strong odor to it. It smells like wet paint/spray paint. I'm hoping it will eventually go away but the odor can be very bothersome to sensitive noses. We are letting it \"air out\" in our living room before placing them in the rooms which are small and enclosed and will hold in the odor. The pictures of the products are accurate although I would not describe them as \"grey\" at all. The shelves have streaks of grey/silver which you cannot tell from the pictures but overall, the products are dark brown. We have dark brown wood floors, so the products match a lot with the floors which is why I was hoping there would be more grey to them. If these products did not have a strong odor, I would have given \"quality\" a 4/5 star.", 
    "I'm using for craft storage but would really be a nice display bookcase too. Needed two people to set up or one strong man.", 
    "Very, very well made. Well packaged, super easy to assemble (maybe 10 minutes), and sturdy. Though it is on wheels that do not lock, it's not going anywhere. Note: heavy box so ask for help!", 
    "I love the Renate desk that I ordered to go with this matching bookcase. And I love the look of the bookcase. The problem is how its put together. Each of the metal pipe pieces is separate and screws into the one next to it. In the end, there are too many points of instability and in the end the assembled piece is very wobbly and not straight. I tried to adjust it both during and after assembly, but it was still unstable and tippy looking. It was too much of a pain to try to return it and it wasn't actually going to tip over, so I used it for 6 months. But it bugged me to see the lines not being straight and feel it move when I took things off or on. So in the end I sold it for less than half of what I paid for it on **********.", 
    "Not worth the money! low quality with defects direct from factory!.", 
    "Overall this is a great product, I purchase this along with the matching Renate desk, definitely Restored style with much lower price. One thing I want to complain is the reclaimed look seems from a very thin paper-like veneer, it is too thin. Overstock's customer service is wonderful, best I know.", 
    "I do not recommend purchase of the Renate Grey Bookcase for three reasons. First, it is very difficult to assemble so that the shelf supports appear even and perpendicular. Second, the metal finish has a pink undertone that is unappealing. Finally, as others have noted, the shelves have a distinct chemical smell that, combined with the fact that manufacturing occurred in China, made me concerned enough about heath risks to unpack and wait more than a week to bring the unit into the house.", 
    "I have 2 of these with the matching TV stand in between (50 inch TV placed on this). It adds so much style to the room and was much cheaper that having built ins built by a contractor. I love them. They were easy to put together, took a little time but not complicated. I love them, looks great with grey walls.", 
    "I took out one of the shelves because the unit soooo tall, so one less shelf actually made it more doable for the space that I bought it for. I also flipped the shelves to expose the smooth black side of each shelf. I HATED the faux grain and the color combination on the shelves, so flipping them worked just fine. The smell of chemicals was overwhelming, not kidding. Be prepared to open all the windows for a couple of days, or leave it outside. I LOVE the little wheels on the bottom of the unit. I also love the vintage industrial look of it. It is a dead on knockoff of the *** unit on RH. Look at both at compare, it is a real value for the chic, upscale look that you get.", 
    "I love this bookcase, we have had it for over 8 months now and I still love it! Assembly was easy and relatively quick, but you need someone on hand to help as it is super heavy. I had difficulty with one piece which was slightly crooked, I had to file it a little to make it fit, but I am willing to overlook that as I love love love the look and the price simply cannot be beaten! As always shipping was super fast.", 
    "as other reviewers have mentioned, this is solid, sturdy well built and if you dont look too close is gorgeous. the poles between the shelves however are not engineered to be totally straight so if you look close you can see that it is a bit 'wompus'. still, with books on it it does look pretty good. it is heavy and sturdy. note: the wheels do not rotate so when it is assembled you can wheel it side to side but you can not wheel it forward and back. for the money this is a good deal.", 
    "Beautiful set of shelves - love the look and they are super strong. Much heavier than expected. The color of the wood is slightly browner than the photos, but otherwise exactly as expected. I'd recommend adding a bracket to the top shelf and connecting it to the wall to keep the shelf from swaying.", 
    "Bought this for my daughter for her new apartment in Oregon and she loves it. Was not too hard to put together either.", 
    "The only thing I can say is that I thought there was more space between shelves but I think that was just me. Quality is not top notch but then again didn't pay top notch prices. All in all will say I have not been disppountrd yet with all the products I order from os. The customer service is first rate.", 
    "Shelves deeper than expected but worked out fine. I bought two and needed help putting the first one together but the second was a no brainier so I did it alone. I looked for months for bookshelves and these suit all my neds.", 
    "I love the grayish/brown look to this bookshelf as well as the matching desk - they have a nice, clean, rustic but classy look and feel. Good quality. My only complaint is that our bookshelf did not come with directions - I was able to figure it out but did miss that one of the sections had special rods as a backup to secure the shelf. Besides that, it looks great - and you have to love the nearly free shipping charge vs ridiculously overpriced retailers. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "Very industrial chic look. The bookcase was simple and fast to assemble. I purchased when it was on sale to save an additional 10 percent. Something like this from a furniture store would cost twice as much as it does on Overstock. Shipping, as always, was fast.", 
    "We like everything about the bookcase, except that the color was a surprise to us. It was advertised as gray but it appears to be a brown bookcase that has a gray whitewash added to it. Other than that, it was perfect. And even though it weighted about 100 pounds, the shipping was as low as always.", 
    "Love the bookcase- using it in my living room with brown leather sofa, sea grass rug, blonde walls- love the whole look.", 
    "Couldn't be happier with this purchase. It came exactly as pictured, took less than 15 minutes to assemble & is a heavy, substantial piece. Looks just as expensive as it's more pricier counterparts. Didn't have any issues with discolored boards or a chemical smell. Plan on purchasing a few more pieces of the Renate Line.", 
    "I really love these shelves... I mentioned the quality being \"good\" and not great because each metal pipe is screwed in separately, which can cause them to be a little crooked and bothersome (hardly noticeable, I''m pretty picky)... I did my research and could not find anything close to this price with this type of look. The prices ranging from 600-1200 dollars, so to get this look for this price seems like a good enough deal to me. All that being said, I am very happy with the product, and have gotten compliments on it from everyone who visits my place.", 
    "This is a beautiful piece of furniture, was easily assembled, and shipped very expediently. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Truly Love the 2 bookshelves I purchased. They are good looking and very sturdy.", 
    "I would purchase again! Great quality - very sturdy. I had thought that once I put the product together (which was very simple) I would be able to roll it to move it around, but that really isnt the case. Never the less - it was exactly what I wanted and I have been recommending to my friends. A great space saver and beautiful piece!", 
    "If you get the style of this Renate Collection and have seen it at the \"other\" high end retailer then you are going to LOVE them. They are the perfect knock off and considering the other home store sells this style for three times this makes them even better. The wood on the shelves is one solid piece of wood that has been faux painted washed to look old, but it still looks very authentic. The wheels are heavy metal and make the entire piece. Ive read reviews that mention the smell, Ive used this entire collection for design clients and the smell goes away within a few days. Assembly is as easy as hand screwing the round poles together, the only catch is to make sure you find the actual \"top\" shelf and then work your way down and its a cinch. I read a review on here that said her husband thought it belonged in the garage, and that is the look these have, but thats the beauty of them, because they are part of that rustic reclaimed factory style. If you get that style then you will appreciate these as much as all of my clients have. DEF buy these if you like them!! They are an amazing steal of for the price!!", 
    "we bought the dining table that \"matches\" this bookshelf from a very pricey retailer - we love the table and needed a bookshelf for the adjoining room. this bookshelf from that retailer is 3 times the price! theirs is probably real wood where this one seems to be more of a wood composite but unless you are right up next to it you can't tell. it was very easy to put together, in fact i was able to put the whole thing together alone. assemble it where it will be going because you won't want to move this HEAVY piece once you are done!!!! it's well worth the price.", 
    "These shelves are beautiful and you can get a ton of books and decore on them. Color and quality is great HOWEVER again three of the connections we bent and a few of the legs were very difficult to screw into place! Its a work out to get these together as the shelves are heavy and you will need to muscle in a few of the legs and bend back the metal on a few of the connectors. No smell issue as stated in an earlier review.", 
    "this is a coveted look for a fraction of the price. i love overstock!"
