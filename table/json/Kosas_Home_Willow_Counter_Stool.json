    "The stools are the style I was looking for. One came with a broken rubber foot. I didn't want to send it back for that. It is usable. But moves on the base. The wood top on one stool has very deep grooves in the wood. I kept it because I couldn't guarantee that another wouldn't be the same. It definitely appears to be a second. I like the overall look and can live with them, but was disappointed. Will really think about ordering from Overstock.com again.", 
    "We really love these, they're just a bit scratchy. I wouldn't sit down on these if I was wearing dress pants or anything that would snag easily. They have rubber clings around the bottom which are a great help on the hardwood floors. Overall we love them, just have to pick and choose what attire might not be a good idea to take a seat. I'm sure some sanding might help if you really wanted to.", 
    "These stools are exactly what I was looking for. They are sturdy and level. There are 3 removable plastic pieces on the bottom of each stool. I stuck felt furniture pads (dark brown) on these plastic pads and it protects my new wood floor. My husband likes that the foot bar on the bottom is spot welded and isn't made with screws. I like that the metal is a dark brown color and not black. I ordered 4 stools and one of them has a rough spot that will sometimes pull the fabric of the towel when I wipe them down. It might pull your pants/skirt/dress if you had a delicate fabric on but it's fine with jeans, khaki, and wool dress pants. The height is perfect for our island. Everyone always compliments the stools when they see them for the first time.", 
    "The Willow Counter Stools are just what I had searched and searched for! The grandkids have no trouble climbing up on them....no tipping. I had a reservation as to how narrow they seemed next to all the others I looked at. But, they are sturdy and very well made. The rustic tops paired with the industrial base....great! Don't be afraid to order these stools. You'll love them.", 
    "perfect for what we were looking for. I was worried they would look cheap but deff. not. would buy again", 
    "These stools look great in my kitchen. The only thing is the floor protectors are white and I wish they were dark to match the stool.", 
    "These are nice we had large bar stools that were to bulky and hard to clean around. These are great light weight nicely made and very simple looking but yet sturdy.", 
    "EVBEYTHING YOU SEE ON THE PICTURE.. BUT BETTER .. HEAVY AND NICE", 
    "Love these stools. We bought two... just be aware that - because of the nature of this product (wood) - the surfaces look very different. Gives you a very rustic yet fancy feeling.", 
    "We are building a house and I saw these and had to have them! They are still boxed up as our home wont be completed for another month or so but cant wait to use them at our kitchen island for the kiddos. I cant say yet how much we like them because they are still all boxed up but looking forward to using them when the time comes :)", 
    "40 dollars cheaper at Homegoods. Great stool, though.", 
    "This is a very good quality counter stool. I am returning them because they are a little more rustic looking than the Photo depicted. The wooden seat actually has an unfinished appearance. and the waxed metal is very dull. I'm disappointed though since they are very well made.", 
    "Came promptly. Rustic stool as expected. Looks great at my cabin. I did not find the edges to be rough as other reviewers. Certainly not perfectly smooth but not a problem. Very sturdy. Ordering two more.", 
    "Great stool! Exactly as described", 
    "So in love with these.... They look gorgeous under the island and are really comfortable. I love that this 4'11 chic can rest her feet on the foot bar and feels so stable - only downside is I had to use felt stickies on the bottom of the chairs but so far working ok.", 
    "This was exactly what I was looking for after some more plush barstools kept falling apart. These are all one piece, extremely sturdy - although obviously not padded or plush. It was exactly what I needed and I'm so excited to not have to tighten screws anymore.", 
    "I purchased these for use at my kitchen counter, which is actually a bar counter so they work nicely in the small area.The wood is a bit rough on one of them. I used a piece of fine sand paper to smooth it out a bit and then used a wood marker to darker the areas that become light from sanding. Overall I am pleased with the style and price.", 
    "I love these stools, I am so glad I purchased them!", 
    "I have been eyeing these stools all over the web for the last year or so and Overstock has the best price! We bought 3 & they look great at our kitchen island!!", 
    "These were purchased to replace stools I brought from Overstock years ago. Initially, I was a bit skeptical if they would be suitable for my decor but after receiving them I was completely satisfied and happy that I had bought them. I like the eclectic/industrial design. A great addition to my kitchen. They are well made and sturdy.", 
    "Great quality stool, no complaints", 
    "Great quality stools. I've purchased 6 of them. All came in uniform color, no splinters in the wood as I had read in other reviews. Would definetly recommend to others. Also with the round bases it eliminates any lop sidedness", 
    "These are really nice but be aware if you want more than 1 that the wood will not be the same color.", 
    "Reading the other reviews, I was nervous about the seats being too rough, however they are really great. Sure they are rustic, that is the point of these stools. But the four I bought had nothing that would catch on clothes or anything. Besides you could recover these easily by removing just a few screws. Also they are fully assembled. Just pull out of the box and use!", 
    "Exactly what i was looking for...so much so that we redid our basement bar area so I could buy more:)", 
    "These stools are beautiful. Just what I hoped for.", 
    "Love it! Just perfect for a corner message center. The price was a pleasant surprise! Returned the one I had just purchased from TJ Maxx!", 
    "These are great solid stools. The wood seat was a bit unfinished for me but a little stain/poly blend product application and they were a perfect! Highly recommend.", 
    "These are sturdy and good looking very pleased", 
    "We were nervous about purchasing these stools online but the color and description accurately describe the item. We bought 4 stools for our kitchen counter and they work perfectly!!! The gray color stool also goes just perfect with our dark wood floors. They are really great quality and also already come assembled which was also a huge plus. If you are in the fence....Go for it!!!", 
    "Very good quality. Looks great in our kitchen", 
    "This stool arrived well packaged and looks very good at my breakfast bar. Note: this is a rustic item and the finishes are plain. Well built and sturdy.", 
    "These stools are absolutely perfect!! They are very well made, welded not bolted together like others. (the screws will never loosen or need adjustments) They also are real solid wood, which does leave room for added character. They are also great for my kids, there is no trip hazard because there is no legs to trip over. I have 8 of these and love them!!", 
    "This was my first choice but went with 2 others first because hubby wanted a 'back'. our breakfast bar is just the right size for 4 kids so not too big and ended up returning 1 set and selling the other set.They are more black on bottom and seats are perfect though I was prepared to put a clear coat on if needed. No need, smooth and perfect rustic look. Very sturdy. Perfect stools for our more traditional island with perimeter cabinets that have a touch of modern. Perfect combo with the metal and rustic seat. I LOVE these seats and which I would have listened to my gut first ;-)", 
    "very rustic and just what I needed.", 
    "This was a gift for someone, they love it because it fits nicely in their rustic country kitchen. Great color!", 
    "Like this stool but from the picture it looked reclaimed. It is just dark stain pine with no sealer. I wouldn't care about the sealer if it was reclaimer. Kept the stools because they are sturdy and okay.", 
    "Very sturdy. Iron base is flat black. Seat finish looks and feels a bit dry...might add a sealant. Great for narrow space seating. Love them.", 
    "Looks exactly like the photo very confortable and compact really like it", 
    "Nice and sturdy counter stool", 
    "These are great quality and look great! They feel very high-end. We get so many compliments on them!", 
    "We have five of these and we get so many compliments on them! They are comfortable and have a great flare to them.", 
    "I really like the style. its not rustic metal as the picture shows. I bought 5 but returned 2 as one of them didn't have them bottoms on it and one top was little bad. and I was able to get 2 same ones from the local store. so overall 3 out of 5 worked very well. if you like I would suggest you to order and the ones with defect you could most likely change it.", 
    "I love these stools. They were perfect for the rustic, farmhouse/beach cottage I was decorating. The wood on mine is distressed looking but smooth--I do not have the problem with them catching fabrics that other reviewers mentioned. They are very stable and I like the rung to prop your feet on.", 
    "Excellent choice for our newly remodeled kitchen!", 
    "Love these for our cabin bar counter. Unique and they don't look cheap at all.", 
    "These stools are fairly light, yet they have just the look we were after. I knew before I even purchased them that I wanted to paint the tops and then rough them up to make them look even more industrial/vintage, and they were perfect to do just that with!!", 
    "I really like these barstools! They were just what I was looking for. Style meets durability and comfort.", 
    "right size for our countertop", 
    "Stool was a little too small and an inch too short .", 
    "These stools came in one piece in box....no assembly required! That was great. Had to buy felt for bottom so they don't scratch up wood floor. The height is perfect and stools are SOLID!", 
    "Very sturdy and great looking. Ready out of the box. Tons of compliments.", 
    "I loved the quality of this stool. Very sturdy and attractive, however the color was not as pictured or described. The metal bottom was black and the wood was not a \"natural\" finish, but a dark reddish brown. Unfortunately, I had to return them.", 
    "I saw these stools at ************ and fell in love with them! They were only ****, but unfortunately they were barstools, not counter stools. Thank God I found them on Overstock, but had to pay a lot more than I had wanted. But, when I got them I was happy I spent the extra money. I will say they are a liitle shorter than normal counter stools, but I love the look of them.", 
    "I needed three small counter height stools for my kitchen island. The passageway way between the island and a cabinet is a bit narrow, so wanted something that was practical and looked great -- these fit the bill perfectly!", 
    "We bought these barstools for a house we have on an island in Maine. The stools would sit at a small kitchen bar looking onto to ocean. We needed something sturdy that would not take up too much room. These were perfect. The style is pefect for the house which has some old exposed beams. They do need some felt pads on the bottom so as not to scratch the floor, but that is no big deal. They are sturdy and well made for the price. We ordered three and liked them so much we ordered 4 more for our outdoor bar at the kitchen window. Overstock delivered fast too!", 
    "The counter stools design met family's need forQuality, style and function! Immediate delivery greatas well.", 
    "even though I love the look of the stool, it isn't very comfortable.....", 
    "I looked for a LONG time for stools and these turned out perfect. Arrived quickly and were well boxed. Very study, don't tip but yet surprising light. Great industrial design. The only thing I could pick at was the tops are a little rough, no issue when wearing jeans but may snag a lighter fabric.", 
    "Overstock provided quick and convenient service and delivery of excellent product! These stools are well made and sturdy and look great.", 
    "The stools are perfect for what I needed the metal legs are wrought iron versus the red that is pictured. The stool tops are great they're rustic looking but smooth to the touch and very comfortable. They are also very light which makes it easy for my kids to move the stools around.", 
    "The pine seat is rough and we actually got a splinter taking it out of the package. In order to be able to sit on these stools, we had to give them several coats of polyurethane. Unless you plan to refinish the seats, would not recommend them.", 
    "I love my new counter stools. Purchased 3 for a lake front home. The only thing I wish was a little different is the texture of the wood. I realize it is the look I wanted, but sometimes I worry that it will pull the fabric of the clothing I am wearing. Would definitely purchase again.", 
    "Ordered 4 for new counter, look great! Ordering two more.", 
    "Love these kitchen stool. They are both rustic and industrial looking and work beautifully with our eclectic decor. They are light but also extremely sturdy. Thanks overstock", 
    "We were looking for an \"industrial\" style and these are perfect. They are also very lightweight.", 
    "Purchased to use as dual purpose for a very small apt. Intended use for plant stands (purchased both tall and short stools), but will repurpose when company comes for seating as well as extra table space. Quality is absolutely worth the price......", 
    "I have never bought anything like this online before so I was a little nervous, but I was SUPER happy with my experience. The stools are gorgeous, sturdy and unique. They came individually packages and wrapped very well - they also shipped extremely fast. I was worried they would be uncomfortable, but they aren't! The only hiccup was one of the three stool I ordered came in with white feet. They were easily replaced that customer service helped me out with that by sending me the correct color feet right away. No big deal. They are now my favorite things in my house... but I just bought a huge rug off of overstock since my confidence level is way up.", 
    "I had never ordered before but took a chance and ordered these for my kitchen island. They are very nice and a very good value. They come with rubber stoppers so they won't scratch your floor. The wood is a medium oak (maybe darker than the picture) but not red at all. The metal is more like iron brown/gray, which is a great industrial look, without being too discordant in more traditional settings. The stools are sturdy and comfortable.", 
    "I love the look of these stools ,but the seat is not big enough. It is 13 inches ! When you sit on them you hang over. Are not very comfortable, as also hard. I ordered some bar stool pads to go with them, but didn't help the size. I am thinking about having someone cut out a larger size and then screw in onto the other one. Hate to as they were expensive , and don't really want to put anymore into them. I would have shipped them back, but it would cost an arm and leg to do that so am stuck. Like I said I love the looks, but that is all.....", 
    "Very nice stools. Legs have more of an iron finish vs. bronze like the photo which works better for us.", 
    "Every seat is slightly different since they are taken from slabs of wood, which I like. These will not tip easily, so good for kids, and can actually be used as stepping stools in a pinch. I am using spares as lamp tables in other rooms. Also, they take up only as much room as a traditional 4-legged stools."
