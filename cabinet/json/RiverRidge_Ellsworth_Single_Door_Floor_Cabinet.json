    "Easy installtion and looks nice too", 
    "I purchased this single door floor cabinet for my powder room because I have no space for extra hand towels & extra rolls of toilet paper.. not only was it a perfect fit but easy to put together. I would definitely recommend this cabinet if you need the extra storage space & don't have a medicine cabinet or other storage space in your powder room.", 
    "Fits perfectly in my new bathroom. I dont like \"paper wood\" backs though. should be solid wood like the rest of the parts.", 
    "Fits perfectly in the small space and looks way more expensive than it was.", 
    "I am so delighted with this little cabinet. It is perfect for my small bathroom. I had to look for some time before finding one that would fit comfortably in the small space I have. The color blends perfectly with my colors. Though small, the cabinet provides a good bit of storage. I love the design, too, as it allows me the storage space I need as well as just enough space to display a bit of decorative bric-brac. Love it!", 
    "Nice accent piece, easy to install, perfect for a small bathroom", 
    "This is not a fancy cabinet, but is perfect for the space in the bathroom. It was easy to assemble and came unblemished. I like it very much.", 
    "A cute little cabinet, priced right for the lower quality. Works great next to my toilet to hide the garbage can.", 
    "Guest bathroom needed a cabinet to put cleaning supplies and bathroom accessories in. Size is perfect - not too big and not too small. Love the one door cabinet where you can easily hide your supplies while making the bathroom look nice and organized. Cabinet is also very easy to assemble; directions are clear and straightforward. There are options to shelf sizing depending if you want which ever top/bottom shelf with more room. Highly recommend this to all guest bathrooms.", 
    "A little tricky to put together and is not that study when you do, but very nice looking. Just do not put real heavy items in it.", 
    "This was purchased as an accent table for a bathroom but upon arrival, it was very shiny, it didn't even look like wood. Kept it anyway as it was well made + I will find another use for it.", 
    "Love this cabinet. It fits perfectly in our bathroom and is the right size. The craftsmanship is really good and I just love the look of it.", 
    "Very good looking and simple style to display in any small room,so happy with that thanks overstock.", 
    "Powder room needed a place to hide some essentials. This is perfect. Pretty, sturdy and functional. Love it!", 
    "I have this next to my bed. It was two shelves good for my c pap machine and a clock.", 
    "Great for the price I paid", 
    "is not the best, but very good, I put it together by myself in 30 min. 48 years old lady having fun. is doing the job and it looks good.", 
    "I had to return as it was in very poor condition when well packaged box was opened. I called overstock and with little to no effort was afforded a store credit and a free return label.No the customer service associate did tell me that they had a number of issues with this company and Overstock word not be doing business with this company. I felt better as I was so disappointed that I had to return it. Not to worry I was told as I wasn't the first to return this item.", 
    "I received my package in good order love the color and it looks good in my bathroom.", 
    "I just received this cabinet and my husband put it together in about an hour with his power tools. I'm using this cabinet in our guest room on a small entrance wall. A great place for our guests to drop their keys, purse, etc. The 2 shelves are perfect for storing extra guest towels and toiletries for our guests.", 
    "All parts fit perfectly in assembly. Very satisfied even though I was surprised that the cabinet sent is not the one in the photo. Even confirmation and shipping emails showed that different cabinet. I was going to return what I received but it fit better in my bathroom than the one in the photo. Read carefully when ordering instead of relying on the photo. The written description matched the cabinet I received (louvered door) though the photo I relied on was wrong. I was lucky that my mistake worked out in my favor.", 
    "First off, the white item is what I thought I was buying. The brown style picture is what I received (in white). These are two different items pictured, look carefully. I took it out to put it together and so far, not working. It tells you to screw in certain bolts(pictured) and they don't screw in. The dowels fit better in the screw wholes. I had to walk away and re tackle it today."
