    "The headboard was easy to assemble, looks just like it shows in the picture and is holding up quite well, with no issues so far.", 
    "I received my headboard yesterday and am thrilled with the color and the quality of the product, we will be putting it on the frame tonight so we will see how easy it is to install and how it looks when the mattress arrives. First impression is great.", 
    "I love the this headboard. We couldn't attach it to a frame as there's not one so we hung it on the wall using hook & loop heavy duty tape. It's holding nicely.It was very easy to put together", 
    "Really like the fabric. Easy to put together.", 
    "Great finishing touch to a room. Happy with the quality & ease to assemble.", 
    "Loved, loved it. It gives our bedroom and different look.", 
    "I was so excited to receive this headboard...loved the way it looked in picture. And they mentioned the adjustable heights of 48\" and higher. I thought this would be perfect! But as they always say...read the fine print. When I received my box it was so 'short' I thought it was a mistake. I thought 'there is no way a headboard could be in this box...I mean the picture showed it with pillows propped up and lots of space above the pillows.' So I went back to the description and saw that it states the height was only 26\". That is just a tad over 2ft!!! You would have to be so short to be able to lean back and have your head actually be able to use the 'head' board. I am so disappointed...I want to cry. This is the first time I bought furniture online and have learned a lesson...read the fine print and know that the pictures are obviously doctored to appear to look better. Now to see if I can return it. Ugh!!", 
    "I was so excited to receive this piece and it is exactly what I hoped it would be.",

    "Great price and very well made.... Must buy!!!", 
    "Ordered this headboard and love it. It was easy to put together and looks great. It met our expectations perfectly.", 
    "This looks so pretty, the only problem I had was ttat it didn't fit properly with my bed frame!", 
    "We've had this headboard for a couple weeks and so far it's been exactly what I wanted. It's sturdy, doesn't move around a bunch and looks really elegant in our room.", 
    "Loved this headboard it kept my pillows in place , and is very confortable.", 
    "This headboard is beautiful. The color is perfect and the quality appears to be very good for the price. I just have two complaints. 1. The bolts that came with it did not fit with our bed frame. Not a huge deal, just a little inconvenient. And 2. I wish it sat a little higher. We are going to try to find a way to rig it so that it will, but just as is, my euro shams almost completely cover it. With that being said, my bed is on risers so that might make a difference!"
