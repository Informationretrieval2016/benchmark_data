    "The table came in 2 boxes. The bases are a total of 4 parts, the feet are separate from the pedistal but connect with 4 screws. The top is already put together in a separate box which is easy. The base (not the feet) seems to be made of some sort of hollow resin, not wood. It feels like plastic and taps like a hollow planter type of thing. The veneer on the top I guess is supposed to look rustic but there are no knots or anything like the feet and the edges of the table, it seems s bit miss matched. The delivery was great, packaged well and delivered right inside the house. Can't beet that! Overall I think it looks nice from afar, it seems sturdy and looks like the pictures. But I am now wishing I spent the extra $$$ and bought the one on *******. I guess you get what you pay for.", 
    "Three of the screws to attach base were stripped and table is a little wobbly", 
    "Before buying, I read other reviews about this table. I was a little concerned about the pedestal bases being something other than wood, and I was concerned about the stability. But I find this to be a great piece of furniture. I placed my order on Tuesday, the week before Christmas and expected to take delivery no sooner than 4 weeks. Two days later I received a call from the delivery service to make arrangements to have it delivered right into my dining room on Christmas eve day! We noticed that the box in which it arrived was a little battered, and there was some damage on the underside of the table. An online chat with customer service followed by me sending a few photos of the damage resulted in a very quick discount to compensate. The table was easy to assemble and it's very sturdy. Also, one really has to closely examine the pedestal bases to tell that they're not wooden. They look great. The table separates smoothly for easy installation of the extra leaf. I paired it with 8 Christopher Knight Home Ivory Fabric Dining Chairs in a tufted cream, purchased here on Overstock. They're very comfortable, and provide the perfect touch of soft elegance with this rustic table.", 
    "Looks sturdy and way more expensive than what it actually cost. Easy to put together and with the leaf it can seat up to 8 people comfortable and 10 tightly. My only complaint would be the delivery. Sketchy looking people delivered the table and I saw them kicking the box several times between the truck and my house. Packaging was done well but it was not meant to endure the worst handling ever. Once I opened it and put it together, I noticed one of the table corners had chipped. I just didn't feel like returning the whole thing so I bought a marker to match the color of the table and covered the chipped area. After witnessing how they delivered it I believe it was those guys who made the damaged.", 
    "This table is exactly what I wanted. Very sturdy and beautiful. It will take two people to handle the assembly as it is very heavy. Everyone loves it and no one can believe the price!", 
    "I absolutely love this table and received lots of compliments. Great quality, design and finish.", 
    "I was so nervous to buy a dining room table online but I absolutely fell in love with this table and the price. After reading the reviews I took the plunge and I am so happy I did. This table is gorgeous. I get so many compliments on it. Everyone assumes it was thousands of dollars because it looks so great. The finish is not quite wood- it feels a little different then wood but it doesn't create drink rings so I think it is better. It is very durable. Love this table!", 
    "Received the two boxes from CEVA in perfect shape. Delivery was excellent. Opened the smaller box with the leg pedestals first. Was so excited to see what they looked like. They were horrible! Plastic poly resin and had blemishes and form mold mistakes. Rough jagged edges not finished or smooth. Not at all what I expected. Now, I have to figure out how to return this horrible table. Don't bother purchasing this one. Thanks.", 
    "I was skeptical at first reading the others review because of the base being other material then wood( actually one peace cast plastic), but the paint job and details once is all together( about 45 min install) it is seemliness and matches very well. As other mention you will need help once is built to move it. Quick note: If one of the screws does not get tight unscrew it and put back in slowly.", 
    "shipped quickly, beautiful quality, very elegant looking, very happy with purchase.", 
    "The table is style is beautiful, although the table top stain was off. Returned.", 
    "dont think this is real wood. Looks good but perhaps only the top is wood.", 
    "Seats 10, looks great, like it will last for a while.", 
    "They lost the base to the table. Top of table isn't perfect but it took so long to get all the parts i let it go. Quality so/so.", 
    "Great quality. Exactly what I wanted.", 
    "Well built! Easy instructions and very durable! Impressed with the packaging - 2 man crew delivered right into my formal dining area. Very happy! Takes 2 or more people to upright the table once it is assembled due to the weight.", 
    "This table is a bit darker than pictured but looks stunning. It is solid wood and weighs it ;) I have a feeling it will last a long time!!", 
    "This is a beautiful farm table,the color is a warm brown no red under tones. The pedestal is not wood. I looked at many tables none had wooden pedestals,so that is not/never was a surprise.This was a wedding gift for my daughter and She was very pleased.", 
    "This table was my first purchase on Overstock and I am very satisfied. It was simple to assemble and looks beautiful! Great quality and very sturdy. I would highly recommend it. You can't beat the price! Enjoy!", 
    "I love it, just what I wanted. Im not sure If I should put a sealant on the wood because it's more of a matte finish so Im worried it might get damaged but it's supposed to be rustic so Im leaving it for now. It's very nice.", 
    "Love the table, size and look! Very easy to add the extension and easy to remove it as well. Beautiful look in my home!"
