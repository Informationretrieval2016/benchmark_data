    "packaging had a piece of tape across the top of the table. Impossible to get the tape residue off without damaging the table top.", 
    "The table arrived in numerous cardboard boxes and had to be assembled (took hours). The table top has a very rough feel, appears to be \"unfinished\". We will need to stain and seal. I did not expect any of this effort, especially given the cost. It is a sturdy table.", 
    "We love the table and all the carved features. It looks great in our home. The only negative thing is that it didn't come with any care instructions. The wood feels raw and not sure how to clean it or if we need to seal it.", 
    "I was nervous to order a table online but was very pleased once it was delivered! We were able to ask the delivery company to come on a Saturday so it was very convenient for us. The table had a film of grey dust as if it were just sanded which we had to clean off. The only way I've cleaned the table is using a damp cloth. I still pick up some grey dust when cleaning. The table has a raw finish but that is what makes the table have a vintage feel. Due to the raw finish, I don't know if I'd recommend this table for anyone who has kids or doesn't like to clean. If a glass of red wine were to spill it would most likely destroy the table. However, every time we have house guests we get a compliment on the table. If you are clean, I would highly recommend this table!"
