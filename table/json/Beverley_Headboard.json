    "I love this headboard, the legs are even upholstered, what a nice touch.I thought I read some people describe the colour as brown, It is beige and will go with any colour furniture, mine is brown. I love the studs. I think it is quite elegant, I'm going to enjoy it for a good long time.", 
    "This is a solid buy for the price. The nailheads are straight and substantial, and the upholstery has a nice linen-type texture. The tippy top of it was a little flat but not enough to be upset about. It was really simple to put together by myself and came with all hardware and parts. The legs and hardware are attached in a small compartment in the back of the headboard. I like that it has the look of one large headboard with legs as opposed to some headboards that just end where the top of the mattress begins. We have it in our guest bedroom-perfect price point and look for that space.", 
    "I love the headboard, adds a nice pop to my room. However the picture is deceptive. I thought this came with the rails and it didn't."
