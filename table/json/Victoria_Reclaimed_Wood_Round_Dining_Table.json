    "I got the table about a week ago and because of Holidays, I had someone else accept it on my behalf. I must say I absolutely loved the table when I first saw it. I am an internet junky but could not find a deal like this anywhere on the internet. With that said, I wanted a substantial table for my formal dining room so I ordered the 72\". I want to mention that the picture they have of the product online looks more like the 60\" or smaller because my table looks so much better than the one in the picture. The legs are more spread out and seem a bit thicker. The style is what I wanted. Vintage, yet refined. Not sure what the wood is, I guess Alder but they do some kind of brushing or something to show the grain in a different way. The finish is amazing, you can tell it is hand made and not run through some kind of machine. It has some degree of distress and natural flaws that make sure you know the table is real wood. This is a keeper!!", 
    "I saw this new product in Overstock and immediately felt in love with it. I am very very picky and always set the quality bar high on everything I buy. This table is amazing and the quality is excellent. The finish looks and feels to be be very durable, has some distress and is quite matt with no gloss. All in all the design is well balanced with the legs being just right, not too thin not too thick. To top this off my husband loves it too and everyone is happy!", 
    "I like the style of this table but I was surprised by how white it is. I thought from the description and internet picture that more of the brown wood would show. I would like to know if I can somehow make it less white. I'm having difficulty getting chairs to match.", 
    "Very well made and strong table. Item is exactly as described. Have some patience while they make it for you! Ours took 5 weeks to arrive.", 
    "Beautiful. It's the heart of our home and it's gorgeous. The delivery guys thought they would have to take it back because it's oversized and they assumed I didn't realize that. But it's exactly what I wanted. Actually exceeded my expectations.", 
    "Great Table. The 60 inch diameter is more than large enough to seat my family of five without taking up too much badly needed space in my home. The reclaimed wood style gives it the perfect rustic look we were seeking. The table is sturdy and very solid. The white glove delivery was excellent. All we had to do was have the old table and chairs out of the way. The deliverers unloaded the table from the truck, unpacked it, and very carefully put it in place. The deliverers were very careful both with my house and the new table. Nothing was damaged and I was never put in any fear that damage could occur. Finally, the delivery men carried away all the packaging. No clean up for me.", 
    "nice finish and perfect for your small square dinning room", 
    "Beautiful table! Well made and sturdy. Can't beat the price, especially for this quality!", 
    "love it. would buy it again.", 
    "great product & great service from overstock"
