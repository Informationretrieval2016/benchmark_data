    "I never thought I'd start a review like his but the packaging on this piece was really impressive. The box is large and heavy and was pretty beat up. I removed it and there was a second box inside the was in perfect shape. Inside that were the wooden pieces surrounded by styrofoam pieces Needless to say it was in excellent shape. It was very easy to out together IF you have a very short handled screw driver. There are only 3 or 4 pieces of hardware but lots of each - I think 60-80. The instructions were clear and it was impossible to get confused. It took less than an hour to out together and it looks so nice. I'm using it as a room divider as well as a bookshelf. The shelves are deep enough to put books on each side and I've got some knock knacks in the cubbies.", 
    "Perfect piece. Easy assembly. I did it in a couple hours. It was shipped in Triple boxes. Not a scratch upon delivery. Very sturdy, color true to Espresso, Love this piece.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Alot of options for display. We have it anchored against a wall. If you decide to use as room divider, I'd recommend anchoring also.", 
    "Takes a little time to put together. Wish they would have let you know you need a small phillip screw driver for the tight corners. Love the space to put books, pictures, nick-naks", 
    "Fast ship and great quality", 
    "i bought two to put side by side great quality", 
    "This fit perfectly in our retirement home that we've been renovating. We have some turn of the century cool Mad Men furniture and it fits right in.", 
    "I put it together by myself in about an hour and a half", 
    "happy to have it! excellent quality! extremely nice packed! it looks small in big open space;", 
    "If you want a bookshelf for actual books this is a poor choice. Within 1 year the shelves started warping and have started cracking to the point the entire bookshelf needs to be tossed. If you only want this for decoration items it might be okay. But where the shelves started to warp, there were no books on that section of the shelf.", 
    "I've never submitted a review, but this was worth it. These are so gorgeous, unique and modern. The height of the shelves easily fits all my old textbooks and 3-ring binders. The tallest of the shelves even fits my small but important record collection.The assembly itself is not mentally challenging - Furniture Assembly for Dummies - but there are 80 wood screws with blunt tips, and they don't screw in particularly easily. I suggest having a power drill ready and it will be much easier; if you don't as I didn't (mine broke on the third screw...bad timing), be prepared to put some weight into it. Also, another review mentioned needing a short screwdriver to do the corner bolts, and that is absolutely correct. Finally, I found it was easier actually to assemble it bottom up than on its side. I'm only 5'4\" and I did it that way just fine. In the end, it's very sturdy and I've got it stacked with books and am not worried about it at all.Overall, definitely worth it to have a great, versatile piece like this.", 
    "Looks beautiful! But this is torture to build if you don't have a small screw driver!", 
    "Missing parts, poor quality, I would return this, but I put it together. Do not buy this product.", 
    "The unit looks better in the picture. The faux wood grain paper veneer over a frame of engineered wood is evident. Some of the holes were too small for the hardware. I actually had to drill a \"missing hole\" in order to complete the installation. It will do for now.", 
    "Great piece for your living space and fairly easy to put together. We have tons of books so I can tell you, it holds a lot.", 
    "Looks very nice and is sturdy.", 
    "Loved the dark espresso. Goes well with our other dark pieces. We get compliments all the time. Once it was dressed it looked even more amazing. Very pleased overall. My husband built it and had no problems.", 
    "Really unique bookcase and good quality (for the price). I chose this bookcase because it's super functional, holds a TON of books, but yet you can still style it to be a little more trendy than just a typical bookcase. I'm in love!", 
    "I purchased this piece to use in my family room, beautiful piece of furniture and excellent quality. I would definitely recommend. Took a bit to put together but overall I give it a 5, more stars if I could have on this site.", 
    "Good looking design. Materials are a little better than ****. Good value", 
    "Loved this product. It looks great in the room and has such character.", 
    "Really nice furniture, good quality, solid wood and the color is perfect.Some pieces were not properly painted (faded color) but I pit those sheets down below. The assembling instructions are not that good, so you have to use some guessing/moving around the book case, and they should let people know that you DO NEED a short handle screw driver (without one you cannot assembly this book case), but other than that it's a GREAT product, go for it!", 
    "We purchased this item to add division in our living room and create a entryway without the room feeling closed off. The shelf adds character to the room. It was easy to assemble and the wood was in excellent condition."
