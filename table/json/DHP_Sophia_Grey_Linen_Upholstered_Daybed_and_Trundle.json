    "We purchased this as a guest bed for our office/guest bedroom. It Took my boyfriend and I about an hour to put together, directions were easy to follow. We purchased a twin sized memory foam mattress and it is extremely comfortable to sleep on. I would also venture to say there weight rating is slightly underestimated as I and my boyfriend laid on the bed together and our combined weight is close to 350 pounds, it held us just fine.", 
    "Good Price value for a daybed. Looks great. Set up took 2 people as described."
