    "Chairs are a tomato red color, a little bit more orange than my red Kitchenaid mixer. Great quality - stack well, all of the legs have the nice rubber no-scratch feet. The back and arms are nicely shaped, so the chair is comfortable to sit in. I use them indoors only, with a large wood topped dining table with iron legs.", 
    "These chairs are exactly what I expected. They're solid and sturdy, not too heavy, and shiny red. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because one of the chairs is slightly wobbly. Otherwise, they're perfect...and they were packaged very well to keep them from scratching or breaking.", 
    "I bought 8 of these chairs for my dining room. They look really cool, they are very sturdy and the fact that they stack is a bonus. The negative part about the chairs is that they are very uncomfortable for anyone who is over 5 feet tall and if you have a larger rear end, forget about it. They would be fine for sitting short periods of time, however my family likes to linger at the dining table, hence the larger rear ends!! LOL", 
    "I just received these chairs today and love them! They are nice and sturdy and exactly what I wanted They were packaged perfectly and no assembly required is a HUGE plus. The only thing I would mention to prospective buyers is that the arms of the chairs come out a bit and may not tuck all the way under your table, so if you are tight on space, keep this in mind. Luckily they worked perfectly in our kitchen and match the other red accents I have exactly. The color on the site is dead on.", 
    "After reading the reviews I made the leap to purchase these chairs online... who buys chairs online?? really?? Well, I am very happy with my purchase. They look great, the colour is right on and the customer service was awesome. As some reviewers pointed out, these are not the type of chair you would hang out on for hours, nor are they appropriate for larger people... but they look so good, you can excuse the other stuff.", 
    "We purchased these chairs after contemplating whether or not to spring for the more fancy, name brand, metal tub-style chairs for our casual dining room to go along one side of out 9 ft wooden dining table. Chairs arrived on schedule and are exactly as pictured-- a bright cherry red. They seem sturdy, but might be a problem for anyone with a big booty (width-wise). Minor imperfections as one would expect from a bargain chair; the most notable is on the leg of one chair there is a sort of \"raw\" sharp edge that could cut a baby so my husband is dulling the edge somehow. Beyond that, there is nothing that would be noticeable unless you were closely inspecting their underbellies. Overall, I'm glad we purchased these over the more expensive brand name ones, and I think they are a great purchase.", 
    "One of the chairs was delivered with a broken leg, and the next day the company had shipped me a new chair. Free of charge, no issues. They were great to deal with!", 
    "Unfortunately did not read the reviews, or would have known that these are more of a tomato red (a bit of orange in them) vs cherry red. My entire kitchen has accents of cherry red, and they are clashing pretty badly with the chairs. I also would have read the reviews stating these are a bit small/narrow and not the best option for those with a wider bum. I'm a size 16, and while I fit in the chair, the chair arms are uncomfortably squeezing my hips. That's ok though, going to re-name these my \"diet chairs\" and they will serve as a constant reminder that yes, I've still got some weight to lose. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "I bought these for my grandkids playroom. They are perfect for children playing with paint, chalk etc. cheerful red. Came out of the box in perfect condition. Heavy enough they don't tip over.", 
    "These chairs were delivered in two days from ordering and came so well packed I could barely get them out of the box, but they are in PERFECT shape--not a scratch anywhere! I am immensely pleased with them!! Another reviewer was right on when they described the color as more of a Tomato Red, but that's perfect for me as it is more of a mid century red and I love the color! They are incredibly sturdy and shiny, and a good seat size for dining. I have them around a glass top tulip base table and they really look stunning. I was considering ordering two sets, but wanted to see the quality first before investing, but now am definitely going to get the other set! These chairs are excellent quality for such an insanely low price, and the delivery and packing is just another incredible benefit. I've had some pretty severe misses when I've bought from Overstock in the past, but this is not one. I'm impressed!", 
    "Very pleased with these chairs, especially for the price. True to color, easy to stack and store. Bought over 9 months ago for a covered outdoor patio. Have held up well. Would recommend.", 
    "We've had these for a few years now, and I continue to love them. They stack when I need them out of the way, they're sturdy and comfortable, even when sitting for a long holiday meal. I also love that I can wipe them down when the kids muck them up.", 
    "No chips or dings after 3 years of owning them. I don't have kids though...They are beautiful, and very good quality chairs. I drag them out to my balcony when I have visitors. I love them. The only downside is they are cold to bare skin but that's to be expected, they are metal chairs. I love them!", 
    "These are my favorite chairs. We use them at our family game table, but I've had them in my office as well. For prolonged sitting, add cushions. They're easy to stack & store as well.", 
    "Good chairs, great price! No assembly required.", 
    "very sturdy and exactly as pictured online.", 
    "Super comfortable, great color. Keep inside and away from direct sunlight if you don't want the color to fade -- our chairs that are outside in the strong Phoenix sun are now orange, not red.", 
    "Heavy and well made. Much nicer Thani expected!", 
    "Great stacking chairs & affordable", 
    "Fun Chairs. And easy to stack with out damaging the paint", 
    "These chairs have a matching table and I got all of it for around $$$ awesome", 
    "These chairs are stylish, the perfect red, and truly in fashion in the best way. True workhorses in your kitchen, dining room, outdoor seating areas, you can't ask for better value and use out of the price you're paying. The only note I have is that they are (true to the original French fashion) slightly smaller than the traditional American seat. Some of your taller/larger guests are going to notice.", 
    "These chairs arrived quickly and in great condition. They are comfortable (for metal chairs) and add a nice pop of color to the room. They also stack.", 
    "i got these for my dining table and i really like the unique design and splash of color they add to my room", 
    "These chairs look awesome in my dining room with my wooden table. They look super retro!", 
    "Great chairs for a casual setting. Very comfortable if used with a medium thick pad. Arrived very well packaged and in a very timely manner. 4 stars because I seldom rave about anything.", 
    "The red chairs are beautiful, sturdy solid metal, and packaged very well. They arrived quickly; and I am very pleased with them.", 
    "Nice, sturdy construction. The only \"bad\" comment I have for it is that some of the chair's back metal piece is off center. Not on every chair, just on some of the chairs. Very hard to notice with the eye, but upon measurement, it is half and inch off center.", 
    "I live in a very old home with lots of antiques. I added these chairs to my oak kitchen table and loved it. So they are quite eclectic and would go with my antiques or even with a modern d\u00e9cor.", 
    "I love them! It gives a real ecclectic look to my home.", 
    "These beautiful chairs are used throughout my house. With four kids, they stand up to a lot of wear and tear.", 
    "RED CHAIRS, who couldn't love them. Sturdy and fairly comfortable adding color to the dining table.", 
    "I looked a long time for kitchen chairs that had style without a big price tag. Anytime I saw something that intrigued me, I was put off by the price, especially because I would need to order eight of them. These chairs are perfect; people notice them right away and rave about them. I love the design, and the red makes the space come alive. They're very comfortable and sturdy.", 
    "We've had these for 7 years now and love them. In fact we ordered a second set of 4 when we got a larger table. Everyone finds them comfortable, they are easy to wipe down when you have little ones, are sturdy but are easy to move around. They stack if you need them out of the way. All around perfect.", 
    "fun for guests at our parties, but they are narrow and anybody with a bum bigger than size 14 would have trouble sitting in these.", 
    "Chairs look great! No assembly needed and they look comparable to more expensive chairs found in stores. Great deal!", 
    "exactly what we wanted, made well,good color, great", 
    "I bought 4 of this red chairs n they look so beautiful,they r very strong n very very confortable my kitchen looks so elegant.", 
    "Durable, fun and although our kids complain they are cold in the kitchen on winter mornings they are fun for our casual '50's themed kitchen.", 
    "Great...comfortable, sturdy and easy to clean. Adds a nice pop of color to my kitchen.", 
    "In my industrial fit hen / dining room, I have eight around my reclaimed wood farm table. Love them. They're the only spot of color in a neutrals open concept room.", 
    "Great style, but cold and not very comfortable, even with a seat cushion added. These were bought for additional seating on our deck at our cabin. They faded terribly and need to be repainted.", 
    "They look good though and are sturdy", 
    "I love these chairs. They came just as appeared (stacked in one box but individually protected). We have them around our dining table and I use them frequently when I work from home sitting on them hours on end. I haven't had the same issue of others thinking they're too hard but perhaps I'm more padded than others. They're nice chairs, color is true to what I received, and they sit evenly on all legs. And if you need them out of the way, they stack easily. Highly recommend.", 
    "Sturdy and stylish, price is excellent. Very happy with our purchase!", 
    "These make great accents in our dining room! They look great.", 
    "I love these chairs. I was worried about the color being orange-y but they are bright, bold red. One of the chairs came slightly damaged (bent in the back) and I got online and chatted with a customer care rep and within 5 minutes we had finished our conversation and within 5 days I had a new chair waiting on my doorstep. I was very impressed with the product and the customer service. You know it will be a great product when Overstock is so willing to stand behind it.", 
    "Beautiful and a great deal. Love the color. A lilittle small if you are a large person it could be an issue, but they are fine for my purposes. Very sturdy and no assembly required.", 
    "I got these chairs to go with a dark wood and metal dining table, and I love them! They are super comfortable and add a lot of flair to my dining area. Good quality, sturdy, and comfortable, so it's a win in my book.", 
    "love the color it and old fashion red it matches all my antique kitchen stuff really love them . I am a heavy women and the size is good for me. I did clean the rubber chair tips with alcohol and then applied round felt to them so they move easy on my floors .", 
    "This chair is super comfortable, light weight and a beautiful bright red.", 
    "The chairs are good quality for the price point. They arrived stacked in a giant stacked box and we relatively well wrapped. One chair did have a minor ding in the seat, but nothing too major or something that we felt needed to be returned (as they would eventually all get used). The chairs are sturdy and very firm. The arms are ergonomic and guests have lounged in them for quite some time. The color is bright, and has more of a red-orange hue (not the red of most kitchen products) - this was not an issue for us, as I like the color a lot. Recommend!", 
    "Chairs arrived promptly before our out of state move. We didn't get to open them until we were in the new house. When finally broke open the box, I was very excited to see the chairs were just as pictured. Bright, shiny red. Very sturdy, although not the most comfortable to sit over for long periods of time. Very satisfied with the purchase and goes great with our reclaimed wood table.", 
    "I ordered these chairs but didn't need them for a full five weeks, so waited to unpack them. That was a mistake! One of the chairs has a deep gouge. It doesn't seem to have gotten worse this week, but I worry that the finish will chip where the flaw is. Lesson learned!Aside from the flaw, this is a great design! I have these in my breakfast area and my kids eat on them daily. Heavy enough not to tip, easy to clean, and stylish with my shabby chic table.", 
    "We had one chair that the paint was flaking off the left front leg. I called the manufacturer and was told that a shipmen;t would be coming in about a month. Have about another week to go. Really like the chairs - just want them to be in good condition.", 
    "Fast shipping, good quality. I searched several sites for this type of red chair. This was by far the best deal. The chairs came packed in excellent condition. The chairs are super thick and sturdy.", 
    "bought 2 sets of the red ones. can you beat the price??!! they added just the right touch to make my outdoor wooden dining table farm chic. i wanted to make my long farmhouse table eclectic and rustic with this pop of color and industrial touch. they are perfect. everyone raves about them and can't believe the price when i tell them. surprisingly comfortable and safe for toddlers to sit in as well.", 
    "Ordering was easy, arrived earlier than expected, packed very well & color was true as showm. There is a scuff mark on one of the chairs but not noticeable enough to return.", 
    "great fun chairs we use at the kitchen table. With 3 kids they are easy to clean and seem quite durable.", 
    "Very comfortable good-quality would definitely recommend to a friend. Totally satisfied with this purchase", 
    "These chairs were exactly what we wanted, and at a great price. I was afraid they would be flimsy, but they are sturdy and solid. In a cold room, they get very chilled, but we placed sheepskins on them (a cushion would have the same effect) and they are very comfortable. They also stack nicely when not in use.", 
    "I was very pleased when the chairs arrived. The color in the online pictures was very accurate. The chairs are comfortable and well made. One of the chair's back panel is slightly curved (hence the quality rating of \"good\" instead of \"excellent\") while the other three are straight, but no one would notice but me. It does not detract from the looks or comfort of the chair. Overall, I'm very pleased with the product.", 
    "I ordered these for a cheap dining room chair. They were exactly what I expected. The color is a prime red. They are stackable and easy to move. Also great for kids because they don't show dirt and wipe easily.", 
    "I got these as extra chairs for when my sons come into town and I needed extra seating that is very durable and easy to clean. I live in a very small apartment, so the fact that they are stackable and look so beautiful is an additional bonus. They are very strong and can easily hold 175 lb boys who are bouncing around playing board games or just for extra seating anywhere in the house. I get comments from everyone who sees them about how beautiful they are. Everyone wants a set now! One of the best purchases I have made in a long time.", 
    "This is a beautiful looking chair. Sturdy, Beautiful color and style. Only drawback is this chair is meant for a medium to average size person, not someone a little larger. The side railings do not allow a larger person the freedom to move. Otherwise a great chair for a great price.", 
    "I could not believe these (4) chairs came in one box. No a scratch. The color is bright, beautiful and just makes you happy....", 
    "Great chair. However, you better be a person under 130 pounds. The chair is very narrow. Not recommended for larger person.", 
    "I shopped around for similar chairs and found these to be the best deal. They arrived already assembled and are sturdier than I expected. Great vibrant red color and very comfortable. The only negative is that they don't slide all the way under my table, but otherwise I'm very happy with them.", 
    "I just got these chairs in and am in love. I bought 8 to go outside on my screened in patio with a dining table and they look amazing. The only problem I could see with these chairs is that some people may not fit in them. With the way the arms are shaped they are pretty narrow, my husband is a pretty big guy so I made sure he could fit in one before I unwrapped the rest of the chairs.", 
    "Love them. They're not perfect but they add nice color and design to my dinning table.", 
    "Although the family has not sat around the table in these, they are quite attractive. The color is more of a tomato red and they look narrow, however my husband says he can fit in them....They can initially feel cold to the behind, but warm up.", 
    "I love these chairs. The perfect color of bright red and quite comfortable to sit in. They arrived quickly and when I discovered one chair was damaged, Overstock replaced it so fast! Great customer service, as always. The one downside is that the arms don't fit under my dining table so I can't slide them all the way flush when not in use. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but my dining room is quite small and connects the kitchen and living room, so we are always walking through it. Because of this, I will be selling 4 to a friend and using the remaining 4 for our outdoor dining on the covered porch. Great value!", 
    "Great product for the price. We are using these chairs for our outdoor table, although we do bring them inside when it rains because we want them to last for a while. Comfortable, as far as a metal chair goes. Might not use them for every day dining, but they work well for outside!", 
    "just what I wanted> plus didn't have to assemble. add the right touch of color>", 
    "they are great, and the delivery was fast. I've been thinking about ordering 4 more. thanks for being such a great source.", 
    "Would like to having a matching table to go along w the chairs.", 
    "The first set I ordered came damaged and Overstock sent a new set at no charge, obviously. (The chat feature is so much better than calling on the phone!) Unfortunately, the second set also came w a bent chair. I received a discount in lieu of sending it back, because despite everything I do really like the style/color/comfort of the chairs. Also the delivery company was supposed to pick up the first set during a 10 business day window, but didn't, which means we must dispose of them ourselves. In this case, the damaged chairs are still usable, despite the damage, so I'll just keep them for extra seating, no big deal. So overall: really like the look of the chairs, very good price, seem to be easily damaged in transit, the replacement/return process is a bit inconvenient and lengthy.", 
    "We bought these chairs for use in our kitchen at our kitchen table. We have two small children and they're holding up great to the daily use. They're very sturdy and durable. They also look really nice. I get compliments on them from almost everyone who visits my house!", 
    "these chairs look great and are a fab bargain but even for average sized people are not very comfortable, especially if you are sitting for a long time. we added some cushions. on the other hand, they are no less comfortable than the average folding chair and far better looking. we might even order another set (or two) to use when we have big parties. and maybe a set of stools to use as both end tables and extra seating. these colors are terrific! we are using them for dining chairs in the garden and after a month they still look perfect.", 
    "I love the chairs the color is very similar to the web site. They are sturdy and very well packaged. They arrived no scratches in very good condition. I love them and I'm not a small lady but my huband who is a very large muscular man says they are uncomfortable and his hips are too wide for the seat. So maybe not a great purchase for someone with a large posterior but I love them.", 
    "I loved everything about the chairs. The only problem I would see is that the chairs are a little narrow for a larger person.", 
    "We love our new chairs. We bought these stylish metal chairs to bring a pop of color to our kitchen while providing a stylish, modern look that was more child resistant than our wooden upholstered chairs. We got just what we wanted. These chairs are comfortable, but not plush. They are very solid, absolutely no creaking or give. They come fully assembled. The chairs have arms that are comfortable at the table, but too short to use without being pulled up to the table. The arms make the seats slightly narrow, but not extremely so. I'm of above average girth and I have plenty of room. I definately recommend these chairs.", 
    "I have been looking for a long time for just the right chairs for my small table. I wanted red and these are just perfect and they give a brightness to the room.", 
    "Love these chairs. Wanted \"eclectic\" decor in my dining room (informal dining room) and these chairs really set the tone. Was nervous about the size but they are comfortable and even work well with my parsons table. Color is a bright tomato red. Highly recommend the product, very well made!", 
    "We love these chairs!!! They are so stylish and durable, especially for how low they cost! I searched for a very long time for chairs to match our new farmhouse style dining table and these are absolutely perfect!!! The table is amazing too, check out www.carpenterjames.com for superb quality farmhouse tables! Love these chairs, don't hesitate to buy them!!! They are great for our very young family of toddlers too..they have arms so i don't have to freak out about the kids falling off them all the time :)", 
    "Very fun and durable chairs! Color is very vibrant and they have held up well with the kids!", 
    "Love, love, love these chairs! They are exactly what I wanted and really amazing quality for the price. They came well packaged, were delivered right on time, and the color is just what I was hoping. They are welded construction rather than nuts and allen screws, so they are really sturdy and don't seem like they will fall apart. Highly recommended!", 
    "Very pleased with these chairs. Great price, great product. Would suggest to a friend or buy again myself.", 
    "I love these chairs. They are beautiful, very shiny and just the right size for my dining room table. They are however metal chairs, so that being said, they are hard and cold. However, my family is perfectly comfortable and all of us are very pleased.", 
    "I was very nervous about buying chairs online without having sat in them first and seen the color with my own eyes. but these look every bit as beautiful as their pictures, and have the added benefit of being very comfortable! Very satisfied with them, and would recommend them highly!", 
    "Great, fun chairs. Quite comfortable, even if they're a little on the small side. Look great with a farm table.", 
    "We ordered these chairs to go with a large \"farm\" redwood table that is outside but under an overhang. The table is a huge redwood slab that is 36\" by 12 feet long and 3 inches thick. These chairs absolutely made the table \"pop\". I made 3 small arrangements of red/orange roses with cranberries covering the stems and our table and chairs were magazine worthy! I purchased 8 and I am going to buy another 8!", 
    "When I finally received these chairs, I was very pleased. The first chairs that arrived were silver bars tools, so the order fulfillment department could use a little work. However, customer service was excellent and sent the new chairs out immediately. That were packed very well and each chair was perfect. I love them and they lend a little modern edge when placed around my antique farm table. They aren't the ones from France, but four from OS cost less than one of those, and have a similar look and really great quality. I'm very pleased!", 
    "I love these chairs! Obviously this style isn't meant to be cushy and comfortable, to sit on for hours. But, I bought these mostly for the style and color and I'm very pleased. Sturdy. Looks like they'll last me a long time.", 
    "Very happy with the quality of chairs received. They look great around the dining table, and have nice little pads on the bottom so they don't scratch my wood floors. Would def buy again!", 
    "Love them! Will definitely by again in the future if I have a need.", 
    "I ordered these chairs to go with my reclaimed wood dining table. While i like the way they look, I'm not sure they are exactly what I want to do. Good news is that I have plenty of uses for these chairs throughout my house. Two of them are now in my office bringing some sassy red into a boring room!", 
    "These chairs are just what I was looking for! They go well with my medium oak table and dark wood floor...gives the room an updated contemporary look! I like them so much I bought another set of 4! Shipping was very quick...they were packed very well with no damages. Thank you Overstock.com!", 
    "I love the utility and appeal of these chairs! They are modern looking, efficent (stacking option is essential in a small apartment), and they're fun! I really enjoy them. I only wish they were a little more comfortable to sit in for long periods of time.", 
    "Chairs are great! One arrived with a scuff on it, but Overstock promptly took care of it and sent a new one. Comfortable without pads added.", 
    "I am very pleased with this product. The chairs require no assembly and come in one box so just unload, upwrap and set them at your table! The legs were individually wrapped to protect them from scratching, and there was material between each chair. They are surprising comfortable as well. I cannot attest to how sturdy they are for bigger people, but I weigh 165, and they did not falter under my weight. I would highly recommend this product!", 
    "I was really happy with these chairs- I love everything about them - color, style and price! And to get them shipped out as quickly as they were for the minimum shipping cost of $2.95. You can not beat that! Thank you overstock!!! I love you!", 
    "These chairs are great! they look just like the picture and are very comfortable. Things to keep in mind: 1) They are metal, but they are still comfortable. 2) They stack really nicely with very little effort, but they are a bit wider than the typical chair because of the are rest. Overall, great purchase!", 
    "I love these chairs. We have them paired with an IKEA table, and they were the punch of color we needed on our patio, and priced lots more competitively that other websites.", 
    "I have 4 of these chairs on my screen porch and they are looking great! I have had them for 2 years, and there is no rusting and the color has not faded a bit! Great buy!", 
    "These chairs are great in my kitchen, very excited about them!", 
    "Love these chairs!!! I bought eight for the dining area in our great room and couldn't be happier with my purchase.", 
    "These chairs are pretty and confortable. They are small so if you are a big person you may not like. They are strong enough to hold a big person.", 
    "The chairs are just as pictured on the website. The color is gorgeous, the finish is very nice, and they had no defects, scratches, or dents. The packaging was very secure and took awhile to unpack as each piece of the chair was covered with cardboard and/or plastic wrapping. I was worried that the chairs would not be comfortable and was considering cushions, but they are very comfortable and look sleek and modern by also vintage in our cottage on the Cape. Great price!!", 
    "The chairs are exactly as I expected and came so well packed that it was unbelievable. My husband was very impressed. I love the chairs and have many compliments. My friend asked if I would mind if she bought a set.", 
    "these chairs are perfect if you want to go with a more industrial look. I have them paired with an IKEA table and I originally bought 4 in the red color, and was lucky to find the exact chairs in the silver color on craigslist as well and now I have a set of 8. great and extremely durable chairs.", 
    "loved these chairs, i really wanted them....lately i'm obsessesd with metal chairs.....they just didn't work with the table1", 
    "I love these! I put black chair pads on them and these are comfortable to sit in for some time. I get compliments on them all the time. They are a nice punch of color in my kitchen, and my puppy can't chew on them like my last ones made of wood.", 
    "i bought these 2 years ago. still look great, very sturdy. The legs are slightly uneven lengths, but great overall.", 
    "Excellent chairs - love them, shipped without a dent. They are good space savers. Great if you have lots of company and need extra seating.", 
    "Love them, would recommend this type purchasing to anyone. Loved the free shipping. Came in good time.", 
    "We are very pleased with our purchase. Definitely a good value for a sturdy, indoor outdoor chair. They are comfortable to sit in and stack easily. The powdercoating seems to be a good quality as is the weight of the metal. We got some of the stools as well and they go great together. They have a funky retro look and work well with a mixed interior.", 
    "I just purchased 8 of these for our farmhouse table. They add to the vintage appeal of our home style and the red color makes for a bright happy statement against the raw wood accents in our dining room. The quality of these chairs seems decent and they were shipped quickly and packaged very well. The only thing I'm concerned with is that the metal is cold to the touch (duh, it's metal) and may not be very comfortable, especially in winter. Cushions would likely make them more comfortable, we'll see if it comes to that.", 
    "great chairs. color is nice, shipped without a scratch. they are metal, so a little cold don't forget. but i love em.", 
    "Really like these chairs. They were exactly what I wanted!", 
    "They arrived quickly, shipped for free, and delivered what they said.", 
    "Fabulous chairs! These are just perfect for my \"contemporary cowboy\" look.", 
    "These chairs are awesome! They shipped super fast and were packed so well...not a nick or a scratch on them. I've gotten so many compliments. The color is great and very vibrant; they make my old dining room table & china hutch look hip, retro and stylish. I can't recommend them enough...especially for the price! Such a deal!", 
    "Love the chairs. Exactly as described. Well worth the money. They look great! I have told others about the chairs and where to get them. O.com/Overstock.com is a wonderful place to shop!!", 
    "Amazing quality as I was assuming for the price that the chairs would be light weight and flimsy. . . Not the case, these are a great weight and very good quality!", 
    "Great chairs, similar chairs on sale at world market for over 2x the price so this is a great deal too!", 
    "I have these four bright red chairs at my black dining table, and they really look great! Very comfortable to sit in too!", 
    "These chairs are great, good price for a high quality product. They are very sturdy, comfortable, look great in my kitchen. I am very pleased.", 
    "Overstock needs to take more vibrant pictures of these chairs because the photos available do not do them justice. Just like every other reviewer says they are an excellent value especially at the price I paid (1 5 4) They allude to that high end pricey chair without the tackiness or cheapness that other products usually have when they try to emulate a classic. Very satisfied and would purchase them again in a heartbeat.", 
    "You can't beat these chairs to spice up a room and still look chic. Great value for money", 
    "Bright, attractive, sturdy set of chairs. Looks great in our dining room!", 
    "I am very happy with this set of chairs. I used them to replace some old kitchen chairs and needed something strong that can withstand kids. The only thing is that the seat area isn't that big, so a very large person may find it uncomfortable to fit between the curved armrests.", 
    "These chairs are great! The color is beautiful and they are so comfortable to sit in. I would recommend these chairs to everyone and the price is great.", 
    "These chairs totally exceeded my expectations. Great design and quality. You can't beat the price. I'd highly recommend. The only comment is that they are not for really big people. It works for my family but we had a guest who was large (+200)and he could not comfortably fit in the chair.", 
    "Sturdy steel construction, well packaged so no scratches on the paint finish, exactly what I needed and wanted to match my decor. Fair price for good quality. This is the fourth or fifth thing I've bought from Overstock and I've been happy with every item so far.", 
    "An awesome little set of chairs, and once you consider the price, it really can't be beat. They come assembled, which makes them worth their weight in gold alone, plus they are sturdy, funky and a nice scale. I love them.", 
    "These chairs are solid and comfortable. The finish is glossy; so if you are looking for something really industrial, go for the ones without color. I love the vibrant red.", 
    "I'm pleased with my purchase. The chairs arrived quickly and in good condition. The only \"negative\" is that the chairs are a bit of an orangy-red, I was hoping for a bit of a deeper red. They work though and keeping them clean from all the grimy little hands in this house will be a breeze!", 
    "These are really good looking chairs! For the price, they are an incredible deal (and nothing to assemble!) I highly recommend these, I love mine.", 
    "I have been searching for some \"transitional\" dining room chairs for awhile, not ready to buy the expensive wood ones i love i figured i would give these a shot. The color is great, they came fully put together, and are as sturdy as they come! I was especially pleased to see very similar chairs for sale in ****** for $**** a piece!"
