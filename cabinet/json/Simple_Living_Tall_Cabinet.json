    "I ordered and received the product listed. As another posted, it was much lighter in color than expected (absolutely not as shown). The assembly was not easy to assemble (though not impossible with a little determination). Just so that you know (in term of the asembly) some of the \"pre-drilled \" holes did not exist and I had to create them. In terms of the quality of the wood, it wasn't bad. At least it was real wood and not this fake/composite/pressed wood that most things are made of these days.", 
    "Needed extra pantry room. The size, color and style of this cabinet is just right. The top of my refrigerator is now clean and clear. Assembly was a snap. Parts were numbered. Took about 2 hours including plenty of breaks. The hinge holes were a little off but easy to line up the doors perfectly once the cabinet was standing by putting a cardboard shim under the two doors to make sure they were the same height. Screwing in the twenty some screws for the back panel took the longest even though it took no skill (Hint: the silver screws are for the back panel and the black screws are for the hinges only. will save you double work). Overall, one of the easiest pieces I have ever assembled.", 
    "As a very frequent visitor and buyer on Overstock's site, I found this item to be the very first product that was a complete disappointment! There was a large crack in the front panel and the wood was split in the back. I did like the color, however, but was sorry the pantry itself was not made of quality wood. Because of the weight of this product, I chose not to return it...", 
    "The actual color is much lighter than pictured, at first I thought it was unfinished. The wood is pretty soft, be careful when assembling not to screw hardware in too tightly. Have a power drill ready, you'll need it to attach the back piece since there are no pre-drilled holes there. My shipment must have come straight from the factory since the wood was so freshly cut the smell was almost overpowering. I washed inside and out with Murphy's Oil Soap, let it dry all day, then applied lemon oil. Much better.", 
    "I live in a small apartment, but I needed storage space for my herbal supplies. This cabinet fit the bill exactly. It's just the right size to fit my supplies. Also, the color is much better than what I had anticipated. It looked a little light on the picture, which I was willing to live with, but the actual color is closer to what you would expect from something labeled as \"weathered sage.\" It's lighter than a hunter green but not light enough to be a pastel. It took me about 2 hours to put together by myself. It probably would have taken about 20 minutes less if I had had a power drill to attach the back panel. Overall, I'm quite pleased with my purchase. I find one of the key things to getting satisfaction from Overstock purchases is to make sure the dimensions of the piece fit what you need. The pictures can be deceiving. This piece is perfect for my room, but it could easily get swallowed up in a much larger room.", 
    "It's a cute little cabinet - LITTLE is the most important word. Although I did look at the sizes listed on the site and they were accuarate, I don't think I realized how smaill it would actually be. if you have a small space, I highly recommend it. You will need a power drill for the doors as the pre drilled holes either do not line up properly or don't exist at all. It took several hours to put it together.", 
    "TERRIBLE, VERY SMALL, GOOD FOR SPICES THATS ABOUT IT. HARD TO PUT TOGETHER TOOK OVER AN HOUR. HOLES DONT MATCH UP. TERRIBLE PROCUST. PARTS WERE MISSING THEY MADE GOOD ON THAT PART WITH A DISCOUNT. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR THE PRICE AT ALL", 
    "I really like the fact that the cabinet is not too big. It fits perfectly in my kitchen for extra food storage without taking up too much space. I like the color, the size, and the ease of assembly, but I do have to say that the holes for the door screws were drilled slightly off. I have had to redo them, so I can close the doors properly. If you have the right tools, it is easy to do, but it is a bit of a pain to have to do that. Overall I didn't have a probem with it, and I am happy with the finished product.", 
    "This cabinet is perfect for our needs, although it's much smaller than I envisioned, but still holds enough to allow me to store all the snack food that was previously sitting on my counter due to a lack of storage space in my kitchen. I am considering purchasing a second cabinet as they'll look great standing side-by-side. My only criticism is that the sealant used on the cabinet has a strong odor which we only notice upon opening the door after its been closed awhile. So far, we are just trying to leave the doors ajar so this smell can dissapate.", 
    "I originally received my cabinet with a part missing, a little hassle and 2 weeks later I finally was able to put my cabinet together. It is sturdy, made of real wood not lamenet. The color is a slight off white but doesnt look too noticeable next to my all white kitchen cabinets... The entire cabinet is smaller than I was expecting but overall I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "The entire thing is super weak, which I expected for the price. However, the tipping point is that half of the screw holes are not centered! For example, three screws for the hinges but only two fit for two of the doors because the holes were drilled wrong. Awful, cheap piece of junk!", 
    "These cabinets definitely look better in the picture than in person. They are made of fiberboard that is just a bit stronger than cardboard and the finish is sloppy. I'm using them in my workshop. I definitely would not put them in my house.", 
    "This cabinet is very nice and a very pretty red.... Mine was not lighter in colorthen shown in picture. It is sturdy if put together properly (back board is in twopieces, it has a connector that has to be placed right in center to hold it together)if you don't connect those two boards in back, the doors won't shut properly.Was it hard to put together...? Not really, you just have to make sure you don'tput the doors on backwards or upside down ... The finished product, I love it..!Adds a color to my kitchen... Plus, several large boxes of cereal will sit on topshelf... probably second shelf also... Very bottom part of the cabinet, is greatfor items you don't use often.... (because you have to stoop down...haha)It's not real wood, but then for this price you wouldn't get real wood... It's verynice looking, its sturdy and it serves it's purpose.", 
    "It fits perfectly into a niche in my kitchen and provides much-needed additional space for all my baking products. The size was perfect, and the cabinet provides a surprising amount of space. I assembled it by myself, very little effort needed. I truly like it, and the style blends so well with other pieces.", 
    "If you're looking at buying this cabinet and it's over *** then you're paying too much. They used mediocre partial board that will bend/warp if you're wanting to storage objects more than 15lbs. The paint job is very average and the paint isn't the best of quality. Also, having wood glue handy is probably the smartest when putting this together! The wooden pegs that come with this piece just wiggle in their designated holes. I'm using this piece for storing light-weight food products and I might use it as a linen closet. Structurally, it is sound but the doors don't completely close for an even appearance because the pre-drilled holes for a wooden beam are set too close to the doors. All the parts and pieces came with the package. Found no cracks in the pieces sent to me. And the real kick in the rear? I come back to write this review and see that the price has gone down by *** from what I paid and I still end up with a bitter taste in my mouth because it's not of a quality product. If I only paid *** for this, then I wouldn't feel robbed for my money.", 
    "After reading the reviews on this Tall Cabinet, I was pleased to note the package arrived in excellent condition and the contents were wrapped to assure no damage could occur during shipment. Unwrapping the carton, we noted each component was marked with a number or letter that corresponded with the enclosed list and directions for assembly. We counted all the parts, were assured that each one was present and accounted for and then began the construction of our new cabinet. To avoid any possible distress to the wood, we assembled the cabinet on a blanket covered kitchen floor. From the point where we had everything laid out in prep through the assembly process took approximately two hours. Some of that time is attributed to the one fact that many reviewers mentioned, the back panel (cardboard backing) did not have associated holes drilled to accommodate the included screws. Once we set up the completed cabinet in the spot where it was to reside, we could not have been happier. The cabinet doors aligned nicely once we adjusted the magnetic closures and the entire unit was plumb and sturdier than imagined. We are using the cabinet as an additional kitchen pantry and the adjustable shelves did make a difference. I was able to set it up to allow for large boxes of cereal and bottles of vinegar and oil to fit without an issue. The cabinet size is deceptive, it holds way more than I thought it would. I was able to empty two large base kitchen cabinets and a table full of canned tomatoes (58 jars) into the cabinet and still have room for more groceries. We are happy with the style, size, color and configuration of this item and might consider coming back for another to use in the hallway or entry.", 
    "For $*** I was expecting a little better quality, but overall it is a nice piece in our kitchen. Would be great as a linen cabinet too. Some of the screw holes weren't in line and made it slightly aggravating to put together.", 
    "The cabinet is really small compared to what the picture shows and how it is described. The cabinet is difficult to put together because the holes for the screws and the pegs did not match up. The holes for them were bigger than the pegs and we had to glue everything in place to get it to hold together. It was so tiny in width that my jewelry box would not fit into it. It was a ripoff! I wish I had my money back!", 
    "First of all, they are not white. They are a beige/tan color. I wouldn't have ordered them if I knew that because my kitchen is white and they look white in the picture. Very disappointed, but keeping them anyway. They are also smaller than they appear in the picture.", 
    "IT IS SO CUTE. PERFECT FOR WHAT I NEEDED IT FOR.COLOR WAS ON POINT AND WASN'T THAT DIFFICULT TO ASSEMBLE.", 
    "easy to assemble, I thought it was going to be a little bigger but it looks great in my space.serves the purpose I bought it for", 
    "I should have known since there were no measurements in the description. I assumed this would be a \"tall\" pantry type cabinet but it is only about 5 foot tall. It does not fulfill our needs by any means, but my husband had it already put together by the time I came home and I wasn't about to disassemble it and send it back. Waste of money.", 
    "I am just thrilled with this item. I live in a co-op with little storage space and this was the best purchase I could make,however the instructions were not clear enough. It took some help from my friends and a few hours but in the end I am truly satisfied with it.", 
    "What a beautiful addition to my bathroom! Easy to put together and just gorgeous.", 
    "Have had this cabinet for 7 years. It's needed some reinforcement for the back panel over the years and some tightening of the knobs but it functions well, doesn't take up much space and can be moved easily", 
    "I purchased this to go in my tiny laundry room in my small beach home. It was tedious to put together, but past experience helped me with the assembly. It was the only cabinet that fit this shallow to the wall. It looks great, like the picture.", 
    "Stay away from this one. The quality is poor to say the least, and you will see that the color advertised is not even white but rather an odd off beige/white. The wood is weak and it comes chipped in several parts. The knobs that come with the doors are of the worst quality ever. To add to the situation, when I contacted Overstock with my complaints, I was offered a 10% off the price or they also gave the option of un assembly the whole thing and shipped again. So another waste of time; in spite of sending them pictures of the item, they wouldn't offer anything more reasonable so I took the credit and promised to myself that I would never order from this site again.", 
    "I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT ON TIME, I was very pleased with it, it fit my needs perfectly.Everything went together like a charm.I would reccomend this ptoduct to my friends.I would also buy other things from overstock again.", 
    "After reading some comments about hard assembling, I was buying this cabinet with a little fear. But I really liked it on the picture, and I decided that it worth it to try. The cabinet arrived really fast and in the perfect condition. I assembled it myself during 1 hour with breaks. The assembling instruction is clear; all of the holes are present. The assembling is easy. The cabinet is great looking. I bought the red one. It\u0092s a little bit darker, than on the picture, but lovely any way. The only thing wasn\u0092t perfect in the whole picture \u0096 the dimensions of the cabinet are a bit different from the description on the website. The actual dimensions are: 21.5W, 11.25D, 48H.", 
    "Had nothing but pegs to hold together the whole thing very poor construction design . Had to get long screws to drill my own wholes in order to to put together very disappointed in product .", 
    "I am very happy with this cabinet! I bought it to go in an empty space in my newly remodeled kitchen for storage of pet food, cookbooks, etc. I had read several reviews that mentioned it was small--but it fit perfectly in the space I had measured it for (based ont he Overstock description). It was easy to put togehter and I did not have any of the issues others had described before about misaligned holes. The only thing I did notice that was described by someone in a prior rreview was the strong odor--varnish or paint? I am leaving it optn for a few days in hopes this will wear off. The most impressive part was the speed with which Overstock got this item to me! Thanks Overstock!!", 
    "We really like the cabinet but it is anything but tall! We like the color and quality just not the size. We didn't take the time to look at the measurements just read \"Tall Cabinet\" so we were suprised when we put the cabinet together and it is so short. We plan to keep it anyway but wish it was about 2 feet taller. My advice to any consumer reading this is to take out the measuring tape and see if it is what you want.", 
    "I use this in my kitchen. I thought it would be a bit bigger than it is but I do like it and have it filled with supplies that don't fit in my cubboards. Cute cabinet. Well made.", 
    "I really like my cabinet except that the predrilled holes for the hinges were off and we had to drill new ones. Assembly was not that easy and took quite a bit of time. However the end product is very nice and exactly what I wanted and was looking for.It was packed well in shipping and arrived in excellent condition. Only complaint is that the drilled holes been done better.", 
    "sturdy cabinet. A little smaller then what I expected but over-all nice and easy to put together.", 
    "I rated this satisfactory because it was needed for little items such as sugar, small trays ,and crackers. The bottom park of cabinet had to be adjusted smooth out with my floor. the price was right.", 
    "I love it! It saves space... In style!", 
    "Nicely built. A little smaller than I thought it would be. Some screws missing, quickly taken care of by Overstock staff.", 
    "Very small and the installation was challenging with screws that were very small and easy to strip", 
    "Not quite as well made as the Virgo cabinets, but still very nice. The hinge screws used don't go flat to the hinge.", 
    "this cabinet worked perfectly in our kitchen for extra's. It went together easily, looks great, and was well worth the money. I added new knobs to match the kitchen cupboards.", 
    "Good quality. Easy to put together.", 
    "Exactly the right size for the space I had available. Looks good. Instructions don't't have any words, just pictures, which makes the process a bit slower than necessary. Would like different hinges so the doors could open wider. All in all, it will do the job.", 
    "Great Grocery cabinet..It can be used for other storage also...", 
    "Nice red cabinet. We had to realign the holes for the top magnetic door,but other than this was easy to put together.", 
    "It was good. I liked it.", 
    "This is really very solid. The materials are much better than I am used to for items I need to build myself. It's paint job is really excellent. It's cute, it holds a lot, and it's great for my little awkward space I had in my kitchen. It's really perfect for a little additional pantry space, which is what I needed. I love it.", 
    "This is a cute cabinet for extra storage. It has very small screw and I can see why some of the feedback was negative. It's not a sturdy durable piece of furniture I would recommend around children. But for an extra storage space it was exactly perfect.", 
    "was small...didn't hold al the items i wanted to store away.", 
    "Great cabinet.... Only complaint is it was missing a hinge for the lower door", 
    "Nice for a small extra storage space", 
    "A little smaller than it appears, but okay.", 
    "I have a small apartment, and this fits perfect. Plenty of storage.", 
    "My wife purchased this item and is so disappointed. There were no specs on size so we tried to judge by the picture. We looked at the height between the baseboard and the point on the wall where the top of the cabinet reached. It looked fairly large. Boy were we wrong!! Picture is so deceiving. The cabinet is so small both in height and width. It looks like a child's play cabinet. Price should be half of what was charged.", 
    "Took me forever to put together (and I actually enjoy stuff like that). Its crooked and cheap - but, you get what you pay for. It serves its purpose. Mine didn't come with the instructions, but Overstock immediately emailed them to me as soon as I contacted them!", 
    "none of the hinge holes lined up with the hinges.", 
    "For tight space in an apartment with not enough storage for a bottle of laundry soap in the closet with a stacked W/D!", 
    "I love my tall cabinet! It fit right in the spot I had envisioned. I found it easy to put together, and I'm not usually good at assembling furniture. I decided to use it as a linen cubbord instead of a pantry, as I has originally planned. Already, I've had several compliments from my friends. Highly recommend this piece of furniture.", 
    "Love this little storage cabinet! Reminds me of an entertainment center for a doll house or a tiny condo which is where we live! It is neat looking and fits well kitty cornered. My husband and step son put it together - my husband is pretty handy but he said the directions said a job for two and he appreciated the help.", 
    "Put it together fairly easy just wish it was bigger", 
    "This cabinet is great for a small space. Did had to have my husband put it together. A lot of pieces.", 
    "Worked well for the d\u00e9cor in the kitchen. Ordered white knowing I was going to repaint it - took the paint fine without having to prime. Also changed out the hardware to match existing cabinets.", 
    "Not very heavy and cheaply made. Wouldn't want it for a main piece of furniture but ok for storing dog food in the mud room.", 
    "True to description and picture. Very happy with product", 
    "Got this for my small utility room to store dog food & 2 liter cokes & it works perfectly & not too large", 
    "Like the cabinet...wish it had been taller. Wasn't hard to put together. All parts were there and there was no damage when received.", 
    "This is an \"OK\" cabinet. The hinge holes are not in the correct place on one of the doors, so it sticks and there is a large gap at the bottom of that door. It also has a terrible smell, so if you plan on putting things like towels in it, you will be disappointed because they will soak up the smell. I've had this for quite awhile now, and the smell is still just as strong. I wouldn't buy it again.", 
    "This was exactly what I was looking fine when I ordered it. It came looked great but over time the paint has chipped off, the doors do not stay closed. I now use a hair tie!", 
    "really like it. use it for crafts. could be a bit larger", 
    "This is made of press board and isn't deep enough for any significant storage. It fit the measurements of the space we needed it for and the hardware on it looks decent. It's definitely not worth the price, but if you need a small storage unit to accommodate a small area, this might be right for you.", 
    "It is not very sturdy, but it is worth it for the price!", 
    "First purchased this for my daughter's office which is perfect. She recently had a baby and turned her office into a nursery. I took the doors off and turned it into a storage for her cloth (colorful) diapers. Looks so cute in the corner!", 
    "Even though I measured the space using the provided dimensions, this still shocked me by its size. It's rather small and, frankly, I have no clue what I'm going to be putting in/on it. It also does not seem sturdy at all and I have it on linoleum flooring in our dining area. I wish it came with hardware to mount it to the wall, I'm afraid it's going to tip over. I'm hoping once we weigh down the base, it won't pull forward when we pull the upper doors. We'll see..", 
    "Basic quality cabinet. Sure tidied up the bathroom with towels and TP put away.", 
    "I left the word \"tall\" out of my review title because this item is not tall in anyway. The measurements were as described but I guess the title threw me off. The red is not a red...more like a maroon. It has some brown/grey hues. Lots of pieces to screw in but I finished in under and hour.", 
    "I have a country home and I had been looking for years for a perfect cabinet to place against a small wall between the living room and the kitchen. This cabinet is PERFECT. It wasn't too hard to put together, and it holds quite a bit of stuff. This was a great addition to my home decor.", 
    "This Simple Living Tall Cabinet isn't very tall but it is perfect for what we needed. It looks great & holds all items I need it to hold.The directions were not very good as they were drawings only, need some actual written directions or better yet a video. Took awhile to complete but it looks great, quality for the price. Packaging was great with no damaged pieces. Very happy with our purchase.", 
    "None of the pieces matched up. The box got destroyed while opening it to get to the product so it would have been a real hassle to return. I held onto it for 6 months trying to diy it together, but eventually just threw the whole thing out.", 
    "Looks nice once we put it together, but was a bit challenging to assemble. Took almost three hours to finally finish.", 
    "Cabinet came well-packaged. It takes a little time to put together but now I have a pretty place to hide all my clutter! Communication with the delivery was great.", 
    "We purchased this cabinet in red to use as a pantry. The red color is beautiful and not too bright. It gives our sun room a nice splash of color and a cottage feel.", 
    "I am an elderly lady, so I had to hire someone to put this cabinet together for me which added to the cost. The paint has already come off one of the door pulls. However, I still get compliments on the cabinet. I really like to be able to \"hide\" things behind the doors.", 
    "It was exactly what I wanted. However, the materials leave a lot to be desired. The holes didn't match up (IF they were drilled at all), the camber locks were inferior and some broke. Definitely not worth as much as charged.", 
    "I ordered the black cabinet and it was smaller than I expected it guys together well and if you only this small covered it works great but I wanted up giving it to my mom because I need to something larger... Again I would recommend for anyone news looking for something small that works well in your kitchen and the quality is good as well.", 
    "Little disappointed in this. It looks nice except the knobs had chipped paint on them and it is not very sturdy. We are using it for storage containers and light weight items so it is ok, but it very light wight construction.", 
    "Nice looking, but not for heavy duty use. Good for clothing, but not for heavy items such as china. Most, but not all, pre-drilled holes for screws are properly aligned. And, better not lose any of the screws supplied - there are lots of them, but no spares!", 
    "Needed extra pantry for baking supplies. Not meant for heavy use.", 
    "Great product , but took some time to put together", 
    "I ordered the red one 3 years and it still looks brand new. Use as a food pantry in a busy hallway. I will buy another one. Very sturdy, lacquered but not shiny. Just as pictured and color is exact. It takes some time to put together but well worth the effort. Just pace yourself. I'd recommend this purchase. Definitely won't regret it.", 
    "Quality is poor. NOT ORIGINAL WOOD. IT'S ENG WOOD.", 
    "Cute but flimsy. The directions didn't tell you what nails to use where and eventually the back section fell off.", 
    "I purchased this after moving into a new house for extra storage and it couldn't even stand for 2 minutes without crumbling. Very low quality materials.", 
    "We needed additional storage in a corner of the kitchen. This design was perfect. It went together easily. The material is a bit lightweight for everyday use. The red is very striking. The only fault: the paint on the knobs peeled off before we put it to use. That is very disappointing. Not worth a dismantel and return.", 
    "It has worked for now two years.. that says a lot. Good Buy.", 
    "This is not a tall cabinet as the product title states. Check the measurements before buying. Assembly took a while.", 
    "This is not nearly big enough or sturdy enough. The shelves fall out if you shut the door too hard. Not to mention I had to go to Home Depot and buy dowels because they forgot to include them in the hardware.", 
    "nice addition to my Kitchen.", 
    "Very pleased with this cabinet overall. It is sturdy, well made and very nice looking. Fairly easy to assemble except that the right side piece only had one row of holes for the adjustable shelves and we had to measure and drill the other row to secure the shelves.", 
    "This cabinet was shipped fairly quickly and was packaged well. This directions were not great for assembly and about six of the screws stripped almost immediately. My daughters husband had to redrill holes to make the screws grab the composite wood. If it wasn't for him helping I would not have been able to get the cabinet assembled due to a bunch of the screws stripping. I am very disappointed in the quality of the cabinet and caution anyone thinking of purchasing this. It will make due until I can find something to replace it.", 
    "We ordered this product in red to add some color to the room and while putting it together the paint already started to chip off - especially on the knobs. This shelf is much smaller than I had pictured even with doing the measurements, I had expected it to be more. I would not recommend this product. This isn't worth more than $$ bucks. Very disappointed. I would send it back but because we opened and assembled it, we would only get a partial refund. Very bummed. I have ordered other furniture items from Overstock before and those were GREAT. I will think twice now.", 
    "Great value for the price, easy to assemble", 
    "This cabinet is perfect for extra space in a small kitchen. The red color is pretty. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "Easy instructions. Very pleased with cabinet!", 
    "Looks good and is functional. Only problem is some of the holes were slightly off and one completely missing for the front hinge screws which there are a lot off.", 
    "I love this piece. It was not hard to assemble after taking a moment to organsize all the pieces and steps. It fits in my space very well.", 
    "Very easy to assemble.Love the color red it makes my pantry look very chic.", 
    "Not an heirloom piece, but certainly functional at the price point. Works great for a mudroom cabinet.", 
    "Perfect space saver....great buy!!!", 
    "Great quality for the price.", 
    "WAS ONE OF THE EASIER PROJECTS DIRECTIONS WELL ILLUSTRATED, ALL PARTS THERE, MATERIALS SOUND. LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURE AND IS STURDY AND FUNCTIONAL. COMMENTS FROM ALL WHO HAVE SEEN ARE COMPLEMEMTARY AND PLENTIFUL.", 
    "This is a great piece for the kitchen to add a little bit of cabinet space. Very sturdy..", 
    "I use this storage for my laundry items. its perfect for any storage use", 
    "This cabinet is adorable in red. However, it is among the poorest made pieces ever designed. All of the screws that should hold things together are too small for the holes drilled, thus, they do not hold. The instructions for putting it together only show pictures when written explanation would have helped to make it clear. The design is poor, and it is doubtful that the piece will hold together if actually used. I can't recommend this product to anyone except an actual cabinet maker with a desire to make corrections to it.", 
    "This product is made up of very cheap materials. After assembling the cabinet, it was so unstable. I could not imagine storing anything inside of it without it leaning to one side or just simply falling apart. Invest your money in a better quality cabinet!", 
    "We are very Satisfied with this product we got it for are camper and the size is perfect for the use we intended.", 
    "It didn't work for me, to short for stand alone and to big to put over the commode.", 
    "It looks good but falling apart so I constantly have to fix it.", 
    "I BOUGHT THIS CABINET FOR MY NEW BATHROOM, IT LOOKS GREAT IN IT.", 
    "recently I purchased your 10 inch memory foam mattress because my 15 year old mattress needed to be replaced.I am 87 years old and have the usual aches and pains that go with old age. Yes, I ordered the SOFT one and I am so happy I did.Right from the start I was very pleased.The fun part was when we put the mattress on the bed to open it up. I wish I had taken movies because it was so exciting to watch it grow to full size right before our eyes, There was no bad oder, and we were able to sleep on it that very night . I like it.", 
    "This gives the home that country old look!! Built solid and easy to put together.", 
    "We use this as a shoe cabinet for the back entry way and it works quite well.", 
    "I love the cabinet and it was easy to put together, but the paint is coming off one of the handles already. Is there any way you can send me a small amount of paint to repair it? Pros: Great cabinet Cons: Paint is chipping away already", 
    "I have a large bathroom and my vanities do not have any drawers (go figure). This cabinet holds everything and more that I need. I have the black one.", 
    "This little cabinet looks nicer than I expected it to. It serves its purpose & is very cute. We did have to super glue the knobs on, but that was no big deal. Very pleased with it & it looks more expensive than what I paid for it.", 
    "Totally cute but obviously not great quality. Perfect for what I needed it for- as small bathroom cupboard. It's very small but the dimensions listed are accurate. Good buy if you aren't looking for a high quality piece of furniture.", 
    "Nice cabinet . Smaller than what I had invisioned. it Thanx", 
    "wobbly, stand is not level; cheap construction", 
    "The cabinet came as advertised but I drove myself mad putting it together. It was alot of dollhouse sized screws. Over 50 and my eyes were crossed. But all in all I love the cabinet.", 
    "Decent cabinetKnobs lost paint immediately", 
    "Bought this cabinet for storage in the kitchen. I did put a heavier appliance on the bottom shelf, but use the top to store cereal, crackers, and other lightweight items. Looks cute when assembled. Take your time so that the screws go in straight.", 
    "perfect size for small kitchen", 
    "Perfect size\u2026..exactly what we needed!", 
    "It's not the sturdiest cabinet but it was good for what I use it for.", 
    "Fortunately my husband is great at assembling stuff like this or I might have thrown it out the window, but since I didn't have to personally handle the frustration, I love this little cabinet. It is small, which we wanted because we have a tiny NYC apartment, but it has just the right amount of space for minimal office supplies, files, other miscellany. Looks nice, too!", 
    "Not made well, doors never lined up correctly. The pain is already chipping & we don't get into it on a daily basis.", 
    "If you follow the directions it is not hard to put together. Everything is lettered and number;, just lay the pieces out on the floor and match them up. I get lots of compliments on this piece. I have a small apt, and it looks very elegant.", 
    "The quality is very poor. I was sent a damaged piece twice.", 
    "Quite a lot of screws to install. It's hard to tell the different sizes and where they go so take the time needed to make sure that's right. Putting it together took about six hours so you'll need to devote an afternoon with it's assembling. I like it but not love it. I use it in my kitchen for storing extra linens and other small items. It's quite a bit flimsy.", 
    "I ordered two of these, one came with several scratches on the front and the other had damage to the base piece. not worth the money.", 
    "This is a small yet beautiful piece of furniture. I got mine on black and have received compliments from everybody. It provides the pantry space I so much needed without taking to much space.", 
    "The cabinet is the size I was expecting and the appropriate color. I was disappointed that the door magnet is not very strong and there were a few scratches, dings, and imperfections.", 
    "IS ALSO AS IT LOOKS IN THE PAGE AND THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH IT IS THE HANDLERS LOOSE THE COLOR WHITE", 
    "The unit does not fit well together once it's assembled and i'm having to try to tweak it to get the doors to close and stay closed. Also a piece was missing from the package. Overall, I'm disappointed in the quality of it.", 
    "Easy directions to put together. Wish it was a little bigger but it holds ever thing I need it too. Definitely plan on getting another cabinet.", 
    "some parts are color chip off , and the top cabinet doors are not pair up same level.", 
    "I got this cabinet in red as an accent color for my bathroom. It exactly what I needed to finish my white, gray and black room!", 
    "Had two 'helpers' to put the cabinet together after reading other reviews. It still was not an easy or efficient process and took us a couple of hours. the instructions (pictures only), leave something to be desired. Once assembled, the top cabinet doors do not meet in the middle and do not line up exactly with the bottom cabinet doors. A little wobbly until I loaded up the shelves. It will do and fits the space perfectly, but disappointing.", 
    "THE ONLY WAY THIS WAS ASSEMBLED IS MY HUSBAND FOUND SCREWS FROM OUT HOME TO MAKE IT WORK, THE SCREWS INCLUDED HAD ALREADY BEEN USED TRACES OF WOOD IN THEM,STRIPED THREADS,PAINT TOTALLY SCRACHED UP,NOT WORTH HALF OF WHAT I PAID,BUT A ITEM LIKE THIS IS TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO SEND BACK,AND THE COLOR IS NOT \"RED\" MORE OF A BURGUNDY,SO TO MAKE IT MATCH MY KITCHEN,'''I WILL HAVE TO REPAINT IT AS WELL,\" NOT HAPPY AT ALL\"'' I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND IT TO ANYONE!", 
    "I've had this item for less than a month. The knobs have fallen off, and the paint is chipping everywhere. It's also MUCH smaller than I expected, but that's my fault because I didn't check the dimensions. I will be replacing it unfortunately.", 
    "I bought this for extra storage in the bathroom. It is the right size and fairly easy to put together. I was a bit disappointed in the colour. It is not a true white but more of a winter white.", 
    "This was a great cabinet for the money. It is not to big so it works well if you have limited space.", 
    "The cabinet appears taller in the picture. Guess I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. However, It fits well in my bathroom which is where I want it to store towels and bath accessories. After having it for 2 weeks the paint chipped off of one of the door knobs so yesterday my husband replaced all four knobs that we bought elsewhere.", 
    "I first used this piece for kitchen pots and pans, and now I use it in my guest bathroom for extra towels and bathroom supplies. It is a great piece. I love it!", 
    "I purchased both the white and red cabinets. It takes a long time to put together, but that's not the problem. The coat of paint is already coming off after only a month of use (not even intense use). Would not buy again.", 
    "This is a nice little cabinet when (eventually) put together. As with other reviewers, this does take some time to construct and not all of the holes are where they should be. That being said, with a lot of determination, a power drill and sheer luck at times, we managed to build it and have had several compliments on it.", 
    "Happy Customers make a happy world. In the search of red cabinets exactly what I was looking for :) Thank you Overstock !", 
    "Very attractive storage cabinet. Trendy style, inexpensive price, and small size fits comfortably into a small kitchen or dining area. I'm pleased with it, especially since it was ON SALE! Thanks, BIG O! I rarely shop elsewhere!", 
    "this item was too cheap in construction the red paint was chipping", 
    "The color (red) is a beautiful, deep red. It works well as a kitchen cabinet, but it's not very big at all. Very satisfied overall.", 
    "I purchased this to put bed linens in. It arrived quickly with all pieces and nothing broken. My husband put it together in 30 minutes. The color seems more of a creamy white not a stark white which is nice. However, after he put it together it will be too small to store my linens. If you were to use it to store shampoo or any other type of bottles it would work but not for large sheets and blankets. I am going to keep it as it is cute but too petite for what I have. Also, the back side is made of a cardboard type material that you nail on. I thought it would bother me but it doesn't after seeing it put together. This looks like it would look good in a childs room or a bathroom. The front, sides, doors and shelves seem to be made of wood and are heavy.", 
    "Good piece of furniture for our purposes. We don't have a pantry so this will work well for now. Can see this being used as a small storage unit in a hall or bathroom as well. Doors don't latch as well as I'd hoped.", 
    "This is a very nice cabinet that was pretty easy to assemble and looks great. Attractive storage for anywhere you need it.", 
    "This was reasonable to assemble. All the parts were there and I followed all instructions. The piece came together looking like the leaning tower of pisa...distinct lean to the left. I am not going to take it apart and re do it. The cabinet is also smaller than I assumed, but should have paid more attention to the measurements in the description.", 
    "I got this in red. It is cute and handy but not fancy. It's very nice for the price.", 
    "The cabinet just ok. The knobs were stripped within the first few days and barely using it. It will suit it's purpose but I'm not overly impressed. Would have rather spent less money for quality of product.", 
    "We put this together to give more cabinet space in our small apartment. It fit the open wall space we had perfectly, and has come in handy to hold extra dishware. The style is classic and blends into our existing kitchen well, but I agree with some reviewers that this isn't the sturdiest of furniture, so those with children who like to climb or who need something that can hold a ton of weight may want to look elsewhere. For our needs this was great- inexpensive, not incredibly difficult to assemble, and nice to look at. A good substitute for ****.", 
    "We love our cabinet! It took my husband A while to put it together because the directions were \"picture directions\", not words and the pictures were insufficiently descriptive. That being said, it is exactly what I wanted.", 
    "Nice cabinet,right size and not too small. Fit a lot of items in it,good storage cabinet,used it for my bathroom.", 
    "SO CHEAP-Don't buy-Not worth the hassle. I should have known not to order a cabinet off of internet -", 
    "I received this product promptly on Oct 15, 2014 and found the one hinge missing and 2 duplicate sides making it impossible to assemble this cabinet. Promptly that same afternoon I emailed (as instructed in the assembly brochure from Simple Living) to request the correct replacement parts. This has been a very slow process to no avail as of now 11/6/2014. The person that I am corresponding with is being pleasant but cannot tell me if the parts have been shipped(after one time this person told me that they had been shipped) and cannot supply me with the tracking # for shipment. The person is still checking and says that by this evening he/she will have that information for me. Why do I feel like they do not have any intention of sending the parts to me. The cost of this cabinet has been charge to me and as of now it is useless! I hope that I will have some positive response in regard to this soon and receive my parts!", 
    "Bought this item a few months ago and let me tell you it was a pain to assemble! it literally took hubby and I 4+ hours to get this thing together! We have assembled a lot of pieces of furniture in the past so it wasn't us. It took so long mostly because we had to re-purchase a lot of the hardware that came with the piece. The wooden dowels kept braking and the cam screws (which are made out of flimsy aluminum) kept bending which made the cabinet wobbly and unsteady. There is a pretty wide gap between the doors and the unit itself it TINY and not made of solid wood. It is compressed particle board - so for me, it certainly isn't worth the cost. I also replaced the pulls because the ones that came with the cabinet made it look even more cheap. The piece serves it's purpose, but is not something that I will keep for many years. I've been looking for something a little sturdier to replace this unit (we currently use it to store linens - which barely fit in it). This will probably go in the garage or craigsllist at some point. Save your money people!", 
    "The frame itself is a little wobbly (or mine was) however I just layed down a strip of wood glue in all the creases while the unit was upside down and then a second layer the next day and everything tightened right up and the wood glue is in the upper creases of everything so you dont really see it. You get what you pay for of course. The doors of course are not perfect but they are not far off from where they should be and everything functions correctly (I dont have any stuck doors or anything).The unit is cute once its put together and it has a nice depth to it (I am using it in my bathroom) so I would say for the price this is a pretty good storage unit.", 
    "This item is very difficult to put together--I work in retail and have put similar items like this one together--This Simple Living cabinet is verypoor quality. After trying to get the lock nuts to work the whole thing fell apart--worked 4 hours and gave up. I will not order anything from your company again--I'm pissed", 
    "Holes for assembly were all off and had to re drill. No holes for one of the shelves. Doors do not fit properly. Misaligned. Door knobs were chipped. Does not stand level even after shelves were filled adding weight to cabinet.So sorry that I bought this. To heavy and costly to ship backNot even worth one star", 
    "I have ordered two of these cabinets (identical, in white), and I am happy with the finished product. As a student, I have put together numerous shelves and desks having similar quality and sets of instructions.While the finished product of these cabinets were ultimately worth the time and effort, I do have complaints about the user-friendliness of both the instructions and the quality of the manufacturing. The tools and mechanisms to put together the cabinet were not adequate to properly secure the cabinet. I had to go to the hardware store and purchase 12 L brackets and matching screws in order to properly secure the cabinet so that it would not sway from side-to-side.", 
    "Easy to assemble, and does not look cheap. I put it in the bathroom as I have no cabinets, and it is perfect there.", 
    "I bought this cabinet to use for extra toy storage for my daughter and it is perfect for that. I thought it would be a little bigger then it actually was but it serves it's purpose. It was very easy to put together and I think it's pretty decent quality for such an inexpensive piece of furniture.", 
    "Overall I am happy with the product for the price I paid. It looks great and I use it for extra storage in my kitchen. The most frustrating thing is that it was missing a piece (the lower front trim board) and instead had an extra of another board similar in size but without predrilled holes. I decided to put it together and I modified things myself instead of calling and waiting for the correct part to be shipped. Otherwise, easy but time consuming to assemble.", 
    "This piece is a great value for the money. It was very easy to assemble and looks great. We use it to store DVD's in our living room.", 
    "The cabinet setup not stable. It keeps pulling apart during setup. It needs more stability rather than having only wood and bolts, because it cannot hold together. The style, however, is excellent. The setup is just not up to par with what I expected.", 
    "I bought this based on the look it had on the site but was disappointed when I saw what I got. This is that really cheap ******** type item of pressed wood held together with a paper coating. The two top doors did not match up at all with the pre-drilled holes so I had to re-drill holes to get the doors to look half way decent. Every piece is low grade either plastic or junk metal and the door knobs are chinsy wood that I know I will have to replace. Do yourself a favor and walk away from this one.", 
    "extremely difficult to put together. had to purchase l-bolts to hold the cabinet steady. pre-drilled holes did not align with hinges and one of the doors dragged to where I had to sand off a little from the bottom of the door. the magnet housing broke when screws were screwed in. would not recommend his to anyone", 
    "Assembly was a little tricky, it took 2 of us to line doors up and screw into place. I purchased this for groceries---for a pantry but it is too short and the shelves are not strong enough. Its re-purposed to hold my arts and crafts supplies and is perfect for that. I should have looked closer and checked the measurements against where it was going to be placed before I purchased it.I would recommend this for medium to light item storage. Heavy food cans will promote warping of its materials.", 
    "Cheapy looking, hard to put together, not stable. Returned.", 
    "Even though I like the finish project, it was not easy to assemble. Some of the holes were in the wrong place which required drilling. Since I have put together many tables and cabinets, it was no problem for me but might create a problem for someone not as experienced. In the end, the cabinet looks nice for the money and is really quite solid. I have it filled with casserole dishes. The taller cabinet makes it much easier to gain access to them.", 
    "The cabinets were good quality and other than a few areas where the paint was rubbed off on one of them they were in great shape. The only hard part was the instructions on putting them together. They were drawings without much direction. It took 3 hours to put the first one together and only an hour on the second one. I would definitely purchase this product again.", 
    "I had been looking for a storage unit with these dimensions and style for quite awhile. I purchased the black one and I love it. The only negative isn't with the product itself but with the fact that it shorted me a magnet to keep the bottom doors closed so I need to purchase one and one side panel has a good size spot of damage that I will paint to camouflage. Overall I am happy with the unit and would recommend. Took a couple hours to assemble, but very doable.", 
    "The cabinet is much smaller than what I planned to use it for (dimensions were given, but my visual-spatial skills are lacking). Without missing a beat I put it to use for something else. It looks very nice. The doors swing shut automatically, so I have to keep pushing them open until I am ready for them to close. Assembly took some work, but was very manageable.", 
    "For the cost,it's really a very poor item. It's flimsy,hard to put together and not sturdy at all. I grazed a corner on the corner of my couch and a chunk came off. It was like cardboard. The cabinet doors keep coming open with the slightest tap to the cabinet. Believe me I've put many,many things together,but this just didn't line up right. On a good note,it holds quite a bit,doesn't take up too much room,and looks nice.", 
    "I do NOT recommend this product. The paint is coming off everytime you touch it. We bought the red color and the red color comes off any cloth we use to wipe and on our hands when we touch the doors. Hopefully this color is NOT hazardous to your health.", 
    "Not as tall or as big as expected. Was an easy assembly but would have been easier with written directions instead of just pictures.", 
    "After having to have damaged parts replaced, I put together this cabinet. Directions were pretty straight forward. However some misaligned holes, caused the doors not to close correctly. So after having to drill new holes myself, it is closer, but not perfect. It is a nice looking cabinet, but quality leaves a bit to be desired.", 
    "This was a perfect addition for our kitchen. We needed the extra storage and we didn't want it to be too big which makes this pantry perfect.", 
    "Very small cabinet and very yellow. Not at all what is sounds like in description. Only 36 inches high. Expewnsive for what you get.", 
    "To start off this is a put together item. My son assembled it, he wasn't happy at first. The pieces were easy to do though. The quality of the item is great though. It fits perfectly in small corners.of my house for extra storage. I love them. I changed the knobs toa clear glass with silver center to make them look more expensive and that worked great as well. Overall for the price it is a great deal. Just have to have patience to put tit together.", 
    "Nice looking. Many many screws,bolts, etc...Need to follow directions given with item... Would have liked product better if some of it was actual \"wood\"....I'm using it in kitchen, so once I put items inside, it did feel more sturdy than when empty.... Overall, I'm happy with the cabinets I purchased...", 
    "This cabinet was just what I was looking for and I am very pleased. The only complaint I have is that the magnets that hold the doors close are not strong enough as sometimes the door(s) open.", 
    "The cabinet went up in a hour. It does smell ...ive had it for a few weeks now and the smell is staying. Other than the smell i like everything about the cabinet.", 
    "Bought this for extra storage in my bathroom and it's perfect! I finish isn't wonderful and I replaced the knobs when it chipped off but otherwise it is serving its purpose nicely.", 
    "Product arrived with a large dent on one of the corners. The doors don't match up evenly, nor do they close properly. Very disappointed.", 
    "Magnets are not strong enough to keep the doors closed. As expected for the space I needed it for.", 
    "It was very easy to put together. The only issue I had was 1 or2 of the holes for putting the back on, didn't line up properly.", 
    "Love this hutch. I don't have a great deal of cabinet space and this has been a great piece for the dishes. Really have enjoyed having it.", 
    "went together well, some door alignment problems, plenty of storage space. No missing parts, and instructions were somewhat easy to follow. Great storage for my needs, and love the height, and has 2 adjustable shelves in upper part of cabinent. No shipping damage and delivered to the front door by FedEx. Great utility storage for my collections of trains, and will use cabinents to support a model rr layout.", 
    "Cute little hutch that goes with everything. Not too hard to put together.", 
    "like the product, fits in the space I needed it to fit. one major problem, the holes for the screws to attach the back to front were never per-drilled after we went out and purchased a drill, it went together fine", 
    "Wonderful choice for small kitchen space. Just what I needed, great vaule for the price. Would highly recommend this product.", 
    "I order the item without measuring myself for the size. products okay but price wise, I don't think its worth of money I paid for.", 
    "Perfect size for my needs. Adjustable shelves are a definite benefit. I order flat box furniture often - the slight imperfections are within the norm. Overall I am very satisfied with this product", 
    "I really like the size and the design of the cabinet. All the hardware and parts were there, but the finished cabinet looks cheaply built. I will be looking for a better quality replacement in the future.", 
    "A nice cheap pantry for those of us with tiny kitchens. I assembled the first one of the two I ordered and am looking into swapping out the insufficiently painted door for one in the unassembled package and sending the rest back.", 
    "I have this cabinet in my kitchen and it has all the cereal and pancake mix and snacks in the three shelves and in the bottom I keep my onions and potatoes. It holds alot of stuff. I wish the hinges were different and the doors opened all the way back but for a few bucks at the hardware store you can get the right hinges which is what I am going to do.", 
    "This piece of junk is still in pieces on my dining room floor. It has 'HUNDREDS\" of screws and very complicated directions. I spent half an hour on line before I bought it while the operator hunted for something that would be \"easy to put together\" because my husband and I are not particularly handy but manage with clear directions to put most things together. The price is appealing, but it requires a drill and hinges etc. are cheap and easily damaged. We purchased another cabinet that worked well so when we unpacked this we threw away the box so I expect we may end up throwing the whole thing away--wasted money and time.", 
    "It's a small cabinet and I'm a 65 year old female who likes to put things together so it took me two hours. I have no complaints but I would not recommend it to anyone unless their looking for a small cabinet for an extra cabinet. It looks just like the picture.", 
    "This cabinet is pretty cheap. But it will serve our needs for extra kitchen space. will probably put cereal and other lighter items in it rather than cookware. The paint job was shabby, not quality work. But for the $157, it's pretty much what we expected. Had to re drill one hole. Fast delivery from Overstock. Great customer service.", 
    "I was looking for a small cabinet for my dining room. After I read the other reviews I decided to measure. It did surprise me that it was so small because it looks much larger in the picture but, it was just the right size for the space I wanted to put it in. It was very easy to put together. I was worried because the reviews said the back needed to have holes drilled in. I decided to try just screwing the screws in and it worked out fine. No drilling was needed. Everything was in great shape when it arrived. The only thing that bothers me is I would like the doors to open all the way to the side but I think I could change the hinges if I want to.", 
    "The cabinet is nice and exactly what I needed but the knobs re a lighter color red, it's not a big deal it still looks nice but I'm going to change the knobs.. Otherwise everything is great I love overstock!!", 
    "I live in a small apartment with limited kitchen space. I use this cabinet to store my food. It fits perfectly in the corner of my dining room and has cleared up my other cabinets for pots and pans..dishes etc. I ordered the off white to match my furniture; however I think it would be very easy to paint one of these cabinets before you assemble it for use in a nursery or childs room.", 
    "Overlall the product was delivered in a timely fashion. All parts and screws were delivered. The top portion came with minor scratches. Not able to cover them with: red color stain or red marker. Suggest product should come with a furniture color stick to cover visible scratches. Using the product and like the color, design and basic function. I would recommend this product.", 
    "Missing 1 hinge, but Overstock.com took care of that quickly and easily. Good quality, we use it for a kids' craft cabinet and couldn't be happier.", 
    "A nice cabinet for the use of this cabinet. It will be used for glasses and will free-up kitchen cabinets", 
    "So far this cabinet is perfect for what we were wanting. We needed a place to store our games. It is sturdy and looks nice in our home. There were several small screws missing for the hinges, but it wasn't a problem. Each hinge has three holes for screws, so on one or two of them I just used two screws.", 
    "This product fit my needs perfectly. We have downsized and have moved to a small home. It does not take up alot of room and looks very nice in my small dining room. I put it together with no problems whatsoever. I'd recomment to anyone looking for a small size cabinet for extra storage.", 
    "Ended up to be too small. The color was perfect but would have liked it to be wider and taller.", 
    "The cabinet is very useful for extra storage. However, It is a lot smaller than what you think it is going to be.", 
    "A nice little cabinet with more room than you'd think.", 
    "quality is what I expected. size perfect for an apt. need the added storage but not too large. BUT it had 170 screws and nuts to build..... ridiculous!! I would never have purchased this if I had known.", 
    "I have assembled almost all of my furniture and am the queen of the cam and dowels. I like putting together furniture. This piece was a pain and still isn't quite right. The colour is strange. It isn't so much white as a very pale greenish white. You know the colour of glow-in-the-dark toys? It is that colour. The cam locks are cheap and didn't close nicely and the dowel holes are not quite the right size. The starter holes for the hinge screws are carelessly placed. The doors still don't close right. The directions are entirely pictures. There are no words at all. I have done this before so I managed it but it does make it more difficult. The worst was the backing piece. As they usually are, it was two pieces attached and folded together. The tape they used to attach it was a strange orange colour and the pieces seem to have been folded together with the paint still wet. I had to pry them apart leaving half the paint ruined. Fortunately, no one is going to see the back because it is pretty ugly. It will work for what I needed (if I can get the doors to close) but I would not recommend it to anyone else especially at this price. Stick to ***.", 
    "I love Overstock.com and this is only the second time I have not been satisfied with the quality. This cabinet is described as a tall cabinet. This cabinet is not tall, nor is it deep. I bought three to use as linen cabinets in my bathrooms, but it is not deep enough for towels. It would be deep enough to use as a kitchen pantry, but this cabinet does not hold much. i am returning two cabinets unopened because it isn't even worth the time it takes to put together. I do not recommend this cabinet especially for the price.", 
    "It arrived quickly and was easy to put together. The finish is cream rather than white and easily skuffed. It will serve the purpose for which I purchased it but I wouldn't put it someplace where it would be used often. I don't think it will hold up well.", 
    "Assembly was difficult and the manufacturer pre-drilled holes were properly placed in a couple of cases. I had to drill new holes to make the magnet atop the cabinet door catch the two top doors.", 
    "We were so pleased with our first cabinet we ordered a second one immediately. Assembly was straight forward and directions were easy to follow. the backing had predrilled holes but we did have to drill into the back of the frame. we used the predrilled backing holes as the template for the holes. was easy. Love the cabinet.", 
    "This cabinet was much smaller than I expected, although I took measurements, it still was too small for my needs. I opened the box to find that the holes that were pre-drilled were not lined up properly anyway. Not really worth the time/effort involved. I may have kept it and used it if it were under $40, but definitely not for $100+. I called Overstock and they immediately sent me a shipping label to return. So although I would not recommend this cabinet, I recommend Overstock. Great customer service.", 
    "Easy to put together. Love the red color. But It is not as big as I expected it to be.", 
    "Over the years we have assembled many pieces of furniture: some difficult, some easy. This one had major problems. Everytime we tried to tighten the connectors they wouldnt stay. After many tries...for the first time...we gave up and returned the item.", 
    "I loved this! I needed something that had alot of space for all my canned and boxed goods and this does the trick. It fits perfectly in the space that I needed it for and it wasnt too bad to put together. It is a great deal and great quality. It was also shiped to me very quickly. I might buy another one for a different room in my house.", 
    "This cabinet went together fairly easily but would prefer a word description as well as the pictures.It does have an odor which I hope will lessen over time with the door ajar. Shipping and delivery were timely.", 
    "I'm very pleased with this piece, which I placed in the dining side of my country kitchen. Because of the beautiful deep red / burgundy color, it works very well with the touches of oriental accesories in my house.", 
    "This is perfect for storing the overflow of canned goods that got buried in my pantry so it's easier to see what I have before I make the mistake of buying more of what I already have. It is easy to put together. Check your height needs before you purchase. It is 48\"....perfect for what I needed but I would not label it as \"tall\". The very slight tint of green in the antique white cabinet is only noticeable if you put it next to another \"antique white\" piece. I don't think you can ever perfectly match a color anyway and I had the flexibility to place somewhere else in the room that I wanted, just not right next to another piece. I am pleased with purchase and do recommend it.", 
    "Furious as I have just received this - it is NOT pine, it is a lacquered MDF piece that I would not have purchased if I had known it was not wood. I loathe MDF. ( I own the extra tall version of this and that cabinet is actual wood).. Might keep until I can find something better, but this is a lot of money for compressed sawdust. Hope it doesn't look too cheesy when together, and it definitely isn't a weathered finish either, looks just like lacquered MDF. Too bad a lot of furniture seems to be going this way - stuff that was once wood is now made of sawdust. Overstock service was good, but it will be a long time before I buy anything else.", 
    "Quite satisfied with the cabinet. Fairly easy to assemble, fits description. And real wood is always so much nicer than particle board...", 
    "We needed sturdy, thin cabinets to fit in my laundry room and hold supplies, etc. I ordered 2 of these cabinets and they're great. Took a little time to put together but it wasn't difficult. I've used them daily for 6 months and they are working just fine - no problems.", 
    "Love this cupboard-great cplor-easy to put together-looks more expensive than was paid.", 
    "This was just what I was looking for..right size and color! Very easy to assemble, except you will need a power screwdriver for the back so as not to wear our your wrist with all the screws. If you are patient and read the instructions, should go together in about 1 hour. I love the solid wood and is solidly made. LOVE IT!", 
    "Just like the reviews before mine... this \"TALL\" pine cabinet is in this case really short. It's okay, I was able to use it for something I needed and it fit well in the little space i have. Works for me!", 
    "This image is not correct for this item. it is WAY smaller than it appears in the image, I imagine that this image is for the next size up. This item is very small. Measurements listed in the product description are correct, however the image is deceiving. The overall piece is great though and luckily the small size did not affect our use for it too much. Quality is very good and the color (weathered sage) is very nice in person.", 
    "I love the cabinet. The color and finish are very nice. There were two lugs missing, but I was able to buy substitutes, and the cabinet went together very easily otherwise. It arrived in perfect condition, and is very functional and charming.", 
    "This cabinet went together pretty easily. We at first thought they'd left out the magnetic closure but found it loose in the bottom of the box. It is small, and misleading to be advertised as a \"tall\" cabinet. I wish they did make a taller size, but this is good for what it is, nice sage-ish color, a dusky blue/green. A fair amount of room inside, and for my very small house, a good organizing solution. Looks good in our living room. If I had more space, I'd probably get another. Good value for the money.", 
    "Bought for my Utility Room. Works great and fits a small area. Using for large warehouse detergents, and cleaning materials . Assembly directions could be more professional, appeared xeroxed numerous times", 
    "I needed a smaller cabinet to put towels and wash clothes in for guests. I needed it in a hallway beside the bathroom door. It was perfect. I don't know why people complain about the name or the size, that is why the dimensions are posted. Assembly was a little tricky at first. Directions could be more clear. Color was perfect. It is called weathered sage, so make sure you realize there will be some distressed areas in the paint. The front doors are already assembled, and has a gap between them that could use some improvement. For the price it is a perfect cabinet that I could not find in any stores. I would consider purchasing another one.", 
    "This is a nice little cabinet for the price. I find it funny that it's called a \"tall\" pine cabinet when in fact it's not that tall at all, but I guess you would know that from reading the dimensions. Putting it together was a bit of a chore and the back part didn't really fit right. Where you would think the back part would just slide in between the two side pieces, it actually overlaps on one side. But, since it's the back part and you don't ever see it, it doesn't really matter. It looks great sitting in my kitchen with a nice plant on top and filled with groceries, wine glasses and cat food.", 
    "Why would they name a cabinet tall if it is only tall if you are lying on the floor? I have no idea! This cabinet is anything but tall! It is cute but far from functional as it won't hold anything but maybe DVD's! It is not worth the price and should be titled tall for midget pine cabinet!", 
    "This is a great little cabinet, but it should not be titled TALL. Even though you can clearly read the demensions you still expect something different because of the wording. It's a good LITTLE cabinet.", 
    "Very cute yet pratical...was expecting it to be smaller after reading the reviews but it actually is roomier than it looks...easy to put together, did it by myself in 1 1/2 hours ...the ONLY problem with the instructions is you need to be really careful to remember to line up the holes for the magnetic closures correctly the first time, otherwise its too late to go back!! Would buy another and it is nice that its real wood too!!!", 
    "It is a wonderful cabinet but it could be a little deeper.", 
    "I was so excited to order this cabinet, it was just what I was looking for for my tiny apartment kitchen with no storage! The reviews were great, so I thought it was a sure win. When I opened up the box, I was a little bummed to see that the paint job was botched on the front door and top. I have assembled a ton of furniture before from other companies, so it wasn't lack of experience that effected this assembly. There are huge gaps between several parts of the cabinet, the dowels and screwed wouldn't completely match or fit, and even after putting together and putting it back together twice, it still wasn't a right fit. Because of this, the back panel had to be screwed on funny and isn't flush either. The whole process was very frustrating and a major disappointment.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for my daughter's kitchen for extra storage. I put it together myself with just a little assistance from her. The instructions could have been clearer, the pictures were too small, but still managed to complete it in about 2 hours. It is very attractive, well made, solid wood and a very pretty shade of red. I was very satisfied with it and my daughter loves it!", 
    "Bought the Extra Tall Cabinet in Honey Pine. Love the weathered finish and hinges! Lots of shelf space for its size - perfect pantry for our small kitchen. Will probably buy another for linens, etc. Assembly needs 2 people for some steps. Very happy with this handsome cabinet!", 
    "We purchased the Extra-Tall Pine cabinet which is similar to this one except taller. It is just what we were looking for and fit perfectly. The cabinet is good quality and sturdy. One door had a crack but Overstock customer service was quick to resolve the damage issue. I would recommend this cabinet to anyone interested and the customer service \"O\" gives to their customers is worth 10 stars at the very least they do an awesome job for their customers!!! Thank you \"O\"", 
    "We searched high and low for a small cabinet to store small odds and ends for the four legged children of the household. This cabinet fit the bill, the size was perfect for our small dining room. It is made of solid wood and was easy to put together. I will say that most of the dowel holes seemed a bit large for the dowels, but a little extra glue filled the space. On the subject of glue, a small tube of white Elmer's glue is included. I would recommend using some yellow wood working or gorilla glue. The cabinet is lite but well balanced.The only thing consumers need to know, and I am not sure if it was just our computer screen, but the cabinet is a brighter red then what showed up on our screen. But it is just a perfect little cabinet.", 
    "We love our new pine cabinet. We ordered in the Weathered Sage, and the color was exactly as I was hoping it would be. My husband assembled it without any problem and we were very happy with the appearance and workmanship of it. Really a cute piece!", 
    "This cabinet looks great, but the quality of materials isn't the greatest. While putting in a dowel by hand, it went straight through and splintered the outer surface. Also, you need to put something heavy in the bottom of the cabinet or else it's not the sturdiest of cabinets. It's alright for the price and we definitely didn't want particle board with veneers.", 
    "I love this cabinet and its just the right size to put can goods sugar, flour what ever, and very easy to put together.Great for other storage also.", 
    "The quality of this cabinet is excellent and it is very well desinged. It is also very easy to put together. As other reviews state, this cabinet is much smaller than it looks in the picture, however if you pay attention to the demensions you should not be too dissapointed. Before buying the cabinet I measured out the exact dimensions in the place I was planning to place the cabinet, therefore I knew exactly what i was getting. The only thing I didn't like is that there is a little spot of white paint and a little spot of red paint on the front door. Not sure how this may have happend but it is not very noticable since I got the Weathered Honey. As many of the reviews state, the color is much lighter than it appears in the picture, so just be prepared for a lighter color if you choose the Weathered Honey cabinet.", 
    "THIS CABINET IS A GREAT STORAGE CENTER THAT CAN FIT INTO SMALL SPACES. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO PURCHASE A PIECE MADE OF REAL WOOD.", 
    "I received this cabinet as a Christmas present. When you look at the picture online it looks like a country blue color but when it was received it is definitely green. I'm not returning the cabinet but am disappointed that I will now need to paint it.", 
    "This cabinet arrived quickly and was fairly easy to assemble. The only problem I had with it was it is smaller than I had pictured in my head!", 
    "The cabinet looked like as pictured. But \"tall\" claim is definitely not founded. It was skinny and small. I will not be able to use it as I planned , but, it will work okay as a video disc cabinet. Assembly was okay, but, missing some screws.", 
    "Very pleased! Item arrived in good time. Hubby gives it a 2 thumbs up. He had it put together in about 2 hours. All parts were there and we had no problems whatsoever. It is so nice to have a \"real wood\" piece of furniture at a reasonable price. I am thinking about buying another one. As stated in other reviews this is lighter than I thought it would be but that is not a problem. I may restain it sometime in the future. Hats off to Overstock on this one.", 
    "Assembly was relatively easy. Cabinet could have been taller for my pur\\pose, but it is OK.", 
    "Overall this is a nice little piece. I was able to put it together by myself without too much frustration. :o) The color is kind of ashy, not as honey colored as I expected. But it fits very well in a small smace. Look at the dimensions closely. The title and picture make it look taller than it is. The shelves are good for storing canned goods, etc. The bottom section is big enough to hold a small toaster oven. Overall I would recommend this for extra storage in a small space.", 
    "We are very pleased with the product. Stretched our storage while looking very nice.", 
    "I have been trying for 2 days to put this product together. I have had to give up and not my home is covered with the random pieces of this cabinet. Could have provided better instructions", 
    "Good quality. Solid. However, much smaller than it looks in the photograph. Bathroom size. Wish you had a larger one, I would purchase it right now. It is very nice looking.", 
    "This was exactly what I wanted & what I expected from the picture and description. I have it in my dining room & it is a very practical addition. My husband assembled it without a hitch, and it arrived without a scratch. I am very satisfied with this tall cabinet.", 
    "Way to small , we had to get another Big cabinet to fit all of our goods", 
    "Again, the 2nd item I looked at within your listings appears to provide an image for the cabinet in question that does NOT match the physical description concerning dimensions. The image appears to extremely larger than the stated dimensions. Waste of my time an effort in trying to find items that what I would need. GOODBYE"
