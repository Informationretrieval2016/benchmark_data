  "reviews": [
    "These chairs look great, and are comfortable to sit on (as comfortable as a fully metal chair can be). They honestly look and feel very much like some more premium versions of them which cost around $* a piece and up. The only place you might be able to tell the difference, if you get really up close and look at the welding on the metal - it's not quite as seamless as the Tolix branded chairs. I don't know the long term durability of these vs. the more expensive, but I can't image it's that different.", 
    "Everything about these are great minus the tiny area for a normal bum.", 
    "These chairs are a teeny bit narrow at the base, just hugging your hips a bit, but neither my husband nor myself find it to be a problem. And we are both tall and athletic. My kids love them and they are so easy to wipe clean. I will say they are cold in the mornings, so blankies always come to the table with the kiddos.", 
    "These chairs came packaged very well, I was impressed at the quality also. I was looking for industrial type dining chairs and they fit into my decor beautifully. The only thing that I would say about the comfort of the chair, is if you spend time at the table after eating to visit, they can be a bit uncomfortable but cushions would fix that. I love them!", 
    "These were a great purchase for the price. They are in a lot of the trendy restaurants and in magazines right now. Shipped to me right away and perfect out of the package. Of course they are metal so your tush will hurt after a bit and would be better with cushions. Overall good purchase.", 
    "I'm very happy with these chairs. We use them at our farmhouse dining table and they are quite comfortable for being a metal chair. They aren't wobbly, the metal is 'soft', as odd as that sounds. The finish on them makes them super smooth rather than thin, loud metal. They are smaller, but I knew that prior to purchasing. The measurements are accurate and they arrived like the promo picture.", 
    "These chairs were the perfect compliment to our industrial wood table. The chairs are sturdy and wont damage the floors. They also compliment our stainless steel appliances.It is true to color, not almost black or painted silver. Very happy with my chairs!", 
    "Looked for small comfort chairs for some time so these were a welcomed find. Stylious, simple and artsy all in one. Allowes for much more room on the lanai then the chairs that came with the table. Perfect blen of color.", 
    "Completed my look, rustic", 
    "Was really excited to find these chairs at such a great price. Thought they'd go perfect with our farmhouse table and they did. Arrived promptly, well packaged and no damage or rust. The chairs are slightly on the narrow side but that worked perfectly to fit 3 on each side. I would recommend them.", 
    "Excellent product, good value, packaged really well during shipping", 
    "These chairs arrived quickly, well packed, and in great condition. One of the boxes was damaged but the chairs inside were fine. The chairs are exactly as advertised. I would recommend them if you are looking for a casual, industrial look.", 
    "The chairs looks great; one concern would be for larger built ppl as the chairs narrow in the back.", 
    "These chairs are really cute. Perfect for a farm style wood table, as I did. They were a little wobbly on the feet, but it was an easy fix but adjusting the legs with some pressure.", 
    "Great for the price. I had to return a set because they had rust on them. But overall a great price and well made product.", 
    "I bought 4 to spruce up the look of my antique wooden kitchen table. I was slightly concerned with the size, but they're plenty big for my family. They are so chic! An exact replica of the galvanized metal from Restoration Hardware that retail for hundreds more.", 
    "We got four of these chairs for our dining room table. They're surprisingly sturdy and well built. We were worried that the finish was going to look \"faux weathered\" but it looks good, like authentic metal. One of the chairs arrived with a decent amount of rust on the seat, but it wasn't enough for us to return. They're really comfortable seats and they look great, I'd highly recommend them.", 
    "Great for the price, but very small. Returned.", 
    "Just what I was looking for!", 
    "Damage in some areas. Not as nice as expected.", 
    "Best price I could find on these type of chairs. The gunmetal works well with our stainless steel appliances. Chairs are great for our kids. On the smaller side, which is what we needed in the space but adults can fit just fine in them as well.", 
    "we ordered some of these chairs and some of the larger chairs from RH. Some commenters noted that the seats are smaller size than RH, but I think these are perfectly fine. I like the gunmetal color, not painted bright shiny silver, but natural clear-coated steel.", 
    "These chairs have a comfortable seat, they are stylish, fit in with most designs, they are a bit darker in color then they appear in the picture!", 
    "love the look of the chairs! They are just a little small in stature. Great for a kitchen table."
