    "Good looking chair. Not the most comfortable chair ever, but as a side chair in a living room for occasional seating, this works great. I also love the adjustable levelers on the legs.", 
    "This chair is just what I was hoping for and was very easy to put together.", 
    "Packaged poorly. Construction shabby. Had several areas where the interior was pushing the fabric out. Leg insertion point was nothing more than ridiculous.", 
    "Out of a total of 4 benches received, the legs only fit properly on 1. I was able to get another one together after working with it for a couple of hours. Frustrating...", 
    "Not the most comfortable chair,however, it looks good and the price was very reasonable", 
    "Purchased for new home, will know next summer how comfy they are. Still in box.", 
    "The chair arrived in perfect condition and looks like the pictures. It's not the most comfortable chair, but it's comfortable enough to serve as extra seating in your living room. The fabric and color are very attractive but I feel like they could've used a nicer finish on the legs. Very easy to assemble. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product."
