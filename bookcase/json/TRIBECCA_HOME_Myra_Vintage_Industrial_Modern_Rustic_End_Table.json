    "Wood thickness & quality of the wood were a concern until delivery. No problems! If the dimensions & architecture suit you, buy it!", 
    "I have been looking for rustic home decor and most of the items are extremely expensive. With two young children at home I'm not willing to spend that kind of cash for end tables. The table is durable, sturdy, attractive and in style. Some people have complained (poor reviews) about the wood being warped and not flat. To me this is the character of the table and expected with the rustic style. We love it!", 
    "Love this end table. Is rustic or industrial looking without going over the top. Fits in with my less rustic furnishings. I didn't want black legs, so I spray painted them oil rubbed bronze and turned out great. Very solid, would buy it again.", 
    "Ordered two of these for my living room end tables. The look is exactly what I was going for. They aren't pottery barn or restoration hardware quality but they also are not flimsy. The distressed wood look is great, though at times hard to clean as dust collects in the rough texture of the wood. Overall, very happy with these.", 
    "The table is very solid and easy to put together. Material wise, it's good quality. However the colour appears more orange in real life than in the photo. Also it didn't quite work that well in my space once I got it in the house.", 
    "It is very nice. Easy to put together. Solid wood. Screws should be just a tad longer though.", 
    "Very sturdy and full of character because of the wooden slatted top. The iron is coated and hollow, but is still sturdy. Super cute addition to living room!", 
    "Very rough finish, top is bowed, legs are not solid", 
    "Made in China. Overstock needs to carry more USA items! I like the look of the table. Seems pricey to me but looks good as an end table.", 
    "Great product and easy to assemble. The end table was just what I was looking for and it was the perfect match for our center coffee table.t", 
    "Way overpriced for what it is.Wood is joined ok but very rough in places on top surface.Will need to buy a pc. of glass to cover top.Made in China so directions are pictures.In which top appears to be routed on bottom side for \"side frames\" it is not,also shows side frames drilled in 3 places top and bottom and they are not.2 screws top and bottom for ea. side frame and BOTTOM SHELF takes LONG screws.NOTE There are 4 small indents on under side of top that show where to screw in top of side frames to underside of top.Line these up with predrilled holes in top edge of side frame.I predrilled with 3/32 bit but just to make it a little easier.Assembled table appears just as pictured.It is very sturdy as a table.Wood stain is of poor quality and applied thin so any scraping may expose natural wood color on edges.If they were sold 2 for the current price instead of 1 I would give them 4 out of 5 stars.Shipped on time and well packed.", 
    "I really like this table. It's kind of industrial because of the wrought iron, and rustic because of the wood- exactly what I was looking for! It's a good size, too and comes right up to the level of our couch. We bought too and I love the way they look in our room!", 
    "I bought three of these tables for my basement living room. I think they are the perfect mix of rustic and modern. I love them and would highly recommend them to others. I get a lot of compliments on them.", 
    "It's the perfect look for a masculine space. Just moved into first home with my boyfriend, and this is a good look to please both of our tastes: linear, clean, neutral colors. The table is visually \"lightweight\" - the metal legs are thin and you can see a lot of wall space through the table. So if you're looking for a heavier, statement table, this is not the way to go. We have large, overstuffed couches, and this table was a good foil/complement to them. Assembly is quick & easy. Assembled two of these in an hour.", 
    "Even though I really liked the style of this table and it was solid wood, it was of very poor quality. I ordered two tables but didn't even bother to open the second box. The first piece I took out, one of the the wooden pieces, had an extremely rough spot on almost half of the board which didn't even match the rest of the wood. The place where the two boards were joined was not even, one was higher than the other. Also, there was a large crack in one of the boards. Even though this table is supposed to be rustic, this was beyond that. I would not recommend this table.", 
    "Great table for the price. Quick & easy to assemble. Love how the wood has a rustic barn wood look to it, matches my decor perfectly. The size is also great. Plenty of room to put a large basket for storage in it. I searched for a table like this for months and finally found this one. I'm very happy with it.", 
    "I am so pleased with these tables. I worried that the wood would be rustic in a shabby way, but I was so happy to see the rich color of the wood, and the high quality of how it is all put together! And what a great value. Easy to put together.", 
    "This table was described as weathered and I fully expected and wanted a rustic look, but what I got was just unfinished and unacceptable. I literally got a half dozen splinters in my hands just unpacking the pieces-- a tabletop cannot be untouchable! I had to spend a week sanding and refinishing the tabletop and shelf before I could even use this piece. Even now one of the screws won't stay in... While i do like the look of the (newly) finished table, it was pretty poor quality and workmanship for the price...", 
    "Have to be built but easy to do...sturdy and useful", 
    "Looks like RH. Real easy to put together.", 
    "Bought this for our screened in porch!! The rustic look goes perfectly with our black wrought iron chairs and firepit!!", 
    "Was looking for printer table to match desk.. this works. Assembly in minutes. Decent quality. Love it.", 
    "This table has a great industrial look. The color is dark and rich, but be aware that the boards making up the table top are not even - it's a bit of a primitive style in that way. The one disappointment is that while the table is wood, the quality is not great, and it has been varnished/coated to the point that no grain appears. For an inexpensive piece of furniture, however, the style is really nice, and the table is sturdy as well as attractive.Some assembly was required, but it was not difficult.", 
    "Absolutely love this table, purchased two of them. Shipped super fast, did not take long to assemble, looks like something similar in pottery barn or restorationhardware which was the look I was going for. Received many compliments on them. Five stars.", 
    "so easy to assemble, really elegant looking and the wood looks really cool.", 
    "This table was easy to assemble, and fits perfectly as a 2-printer stand that I needed for my office. I love the rustic look and the solid structure.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Went well with my bamboo floors", 
    "I purchased this side table to go with the 3 piece TV stand set and it looks very nice. The mix of wood and back iron is a great look, casual with a bit of a modern/industrial look. I like that it has a lower shelf, we put magazines and books on it, but it is high enough to display a piece of art as well. I recommend this product.", 
    "Love it and the rough looking wood", 
    "the screws for the secon layers do not really work, but not really affect the use.", 
    "I returned this item. Looked better in pix. Its a resin wood vs a real wood. I should have read the specs better. Would make a good table for a vacation rental or kids room as very durable. Just didn't get right feel or texture for my home office.", 
    "I bought this for my husbands man cave and he loves it. It's the perfect cross between rustic and industrial and looks great in our finished basement. We'll be purchasing a few other pieces from this collection", 
    "Looks geat and easy to construct.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Just like the picture", 
    "We purchased the tv stand and two end tables. They were easy to assemble and the are quite sturdy. A great value for the price.", 
    "I purchased three of these end tables about 3 years ago. They were easy to put together and look gorgeous in our living room. There was a bit of a chemical smell from the wood when they were unwrapped but we let them air out on the patio and haven't had any issues since. They've held up beautiful during that time (with 3 kids, a cat, a dog and lots of entertaining over the years!)", 
    "Looking for something to stand out. Not the standard look that every living room seems to have. The build is good and quality seems good. The distressed look works for me. Just keep in mind to accept imperfections as they make the stand look unique. I like it!", 
    "Great quality and easy to put together.", 
    "The top of the tables are too rustic even for our taste. They look scratched and like the stain was missing in spots.", 
    "This is a great looking table in my living room. Quality wood and simple to assemble.", 
    "Sturdy, easy to put together and looks great!", 
    "Sturdy & modern at same time .happy with it somuchcheapermaterials for similar price.so really enjoyed this & was the perfect fit for our office", 
    "I use this end table for my printer and it goes with the bookcase and table/desk. Great grouping for a rustic office", 
    "This table matches the desk/bookshelf set (TRIBECCA HOME Myra Vintage Industrial Modern Rustic 3-piece Desk Bookcase Set) perfectly. Very easy to assemble. Looks great!", 
    "Just got a pair of these tables for Christmas and I have to say I am extremely disappointed. Not only am I disappointed in the tables but I am disappointed in all these good reviews. I count on these to help me make wise purchasing decisions and they really let me down on this one. Table is not of high-quality build at all. The picture makes it seem like it will have a rustic look to it but the first thought after I took it out of the box was \"plastic\" and \"fake\". I put one of the tables together and it sticks out like a sore thumb in my living room. It is not sturdy. The cut of wood for the bottom shelf does not fit well and leaves gaps. Not sure what the return policy is at overstock but I will definitely be looking to see if these can go back. For $$$ a pop I sure was expecting a bit more...", 
    "just as described easy to put together", 
    "I really like wood/metal contrast furniture. But this wood appears to be fake/plastic.", 
    "Definitely worth the money. A great table.", 
    "It's cheap, looks nice, but wobbly and not the best made. I bought it because it matched the table and tv stand I purchased but I'm a little disappointed with the quality.", 
    "I have the desk, 2 bookcases, console table and an end table. They are sturdy, and very handsome.", 
    "This was easy to assemble and looks great. I am very happy with it.", 
    "The size goes great with the Kennedy Lazyboy sofas. Give the open yet substantial look I was going for!", 
    "It was a booger to put together but it does look nice. Looks about in line with the price paid. Kind of racks side to side if pressure put on it so not made to hold too much weight. Colors are a good mix and it does look industrial.", 
    "This table is beautiful and so easy to assemble! Took about 8 mins to put together!!", 
    "I got two for my living room, and have gotten multiple compliments. Really great quality for the price. Looks very sharp! Very easy to put together (single gal, and did it all by myself with zero issues....just grab a beer and you'll have them together before your'e done =)", 
    "This table looks great with the coffee table! Highly recommend", 
    "They were easy to assemble and look great!", 
    "great price for great looking item. this has held up perfectly even with 2 small boys spilling milk and climbing on it!", 
    "I am very pleased with this table. It has a nice shelf on the bottom that is great for photo albums or a nice basket. The only downside is that there were no holes to screw the bottom shelf in however the shelf is safely able to sit firmly on the iron frame without it being screwed in.", 
    "Beautiful tables something different love style and the color gray bought the set of 3 the coffee table in the end tables I think it was a goodbye", 
    "I was looking for a nice end table and this one fit the bill. It was a little darker then the picture", 
    "I love this table. I get so many compliments on it!", 
    "Love how these look in our space! Easy to put together, the size is just right, the wood is great and they look perfect!!", 
    "It was easy to assemble and very nice table!", 
    "Very cute, easy to assemble. It's pretty evident it's not real wood when you take a close look at it, but it's still a good looking piece.", 
    "The table was easy to put together and I guess it looks OK when it sits next to my furniture, but up close it looks like plastic. I was expecting finished wood, but the table tops are actually pine covered with resin of some sort. They seems sturdy, so time will tell. Not really what I expected for the price.", 
    "Love this end table! Looks great with my dark leather sofa and love seat!", 
    "had to return one of my two end tables because the wood near the cut out split", 
    "This table is sturdy, looks great, was easy to assemble and easy to clean. A perfect addition to our family room.", 
    "We are pleased with the quality of this end table. It is sturdy, and the colors are accurate. We've had it for years now and it holds up great having kids around the house.", 
    "These are little gems, easy to put together, sturdy, and I have gotten a ton of compliments on them.", 
    "We had purchased other tables (from another website) - and trying to put them together was horrible - nothing lined up! These were perfect - I love them - I have received so many comments about them. Great tables!", 
    "Perfect for my sitting room", 
    "Good inexpensive option for a cute \"Restoration Hardware\" look.", 
    "Easy to put together. Not as rustic as I thought but like it. Works great in living room.", 
    "Serves its purpose. Nice looking.", 
    "I love this table! If you're looking for a bit of industrial to add to your decor, this is a great piece. It's ships fast and well, assembles in. Injures and is a great statement piece.", 
    "These tables are a perfect fit for my Family Room. Very sturdy. Putting them together was a snap.", 
    "I don't know if the wood surfaces on this are hand distressed or if a resing type treatment was applied to give it a post apocalyptic look, but whatever they've done is great.Metal bits are sturdy and equally well distressed and finished.There is no \"distress residue\" like oil or powder or odd acid smells to this unit.Great piece.", 
    "So I returned it and Got another style table sofa table", 
    "Very well built industrial looking end table", 
    "Love the color of the wood - it is very sturdy and big enough for all your accessories - easy to assemble", 
    "The table was easy to put together. The quality of the table is good. It has the rustic look I like.", 
    "I have purchased a new condo - downsizing. Furnishing the guest bedroom. I needed night stands that would not be too expensive. I could not find a traditional night stand - so I found these end tables. They are perfect. Airy and casual - a nice addition to the guest bedroom. Good quality and easy to put together.", 
    "Bought the end table, coffee table and entertainment stand and it all looks great", 
    "Nice solid table. Easy to put together, looks awesome in our new addition, love the black metal legs and the wood is durable. Looks expensive, good value.", 
    "i bought the matching tv stand also. these items look really good in my living room. about 20 minutes to assemble and it is sturdy.", 
    "This is an awesome piece, high quality, very stylish looking. Larger than what I actually thought it would be but not too large. Definitely recommend!", 
    "I bought this end table to serve as a printer stand. It goes perfectly with the rest of my Tribecca Home office decor (I have the desk and bookshelvs). I ordered on Monday and it arrived on Wednesday. Very pleased!", 
    "Very sturdy, I use it for a printer holder , it's sturdy and fits my office very well", 
    "Some assembly required but overall very good quality", 
    "I purchased two of these tables for my living room. They were easy to assemble and look GORGEOUS! Great quality. Great look. Great price.", 
    "Easy to assemble and does what I purchased it to do.", 
    "This table came with all necessary screws and good directions. I put it together in about 15 minutes with no help. It's very sturdy and very attractive. Also, I shopped around and Overstock had the best price. Very satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "It is nice, but not very heavy duty. Looks good paired with the coffee table.", 
    "Very easy to put together if you read the instructions, only took 5-10 minutes and the result is beautiful. Really fits in with my \"industrial chic\" living room!", 
    "Love this side table, rustic wood, easy to assemble.", 
    "this end table is incredibly easy to assemble, looks great and is just what i wanted. looks exactly like the picture.", 
    "The wood is absolutely beautiful !!! The legs as well. I absolutely love them. Also, heavy and sturdy. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "Well matched with the coffee table. easy to assemble.", 
    "Oozing with detail and the bottom shelf is functional for additional storage space. This table is a home run.", 
    "Great little tables for the price compared to elsewhere. Not too difficult to put together. The only negative was one of the screws was stripped. Need to have hubby fix that. But love the look and was what I expected.", 
    "This is a nice table. It isn't smooth on the top, so if you are wanting a smooth or should say straight smooth top this isn't for you. The top is slatted and is off. Other than that nice table.", 
    "Good end table, very rustic, so rustic one of the boards were coming undone from the rest. Good thing I had some clamps and glue.", 
    "I bought the book shelf, desk, and end table. Super easy to put together. Sturdy. Looks great. Love it!", 
    "I received the table and was able to put it together within 30 minutes. The piece is elegant and rustic. My only issue is the fact that the would was cracked. I was going to return it but decided not to because the crack complemented the look. Overall, I am happy with the product.", 
    "Poor quality; came with broken iron. Returned for refund", 
    "looks amazing ! easy to assemble.....", 
    "Very easy to assemble, and looks great in our living room.", 
    "Perfect balance of cozy and industrial. has held up well after several years of ownership.", 
    "Really easy to assemble and quality. Very sturdy!", 
    "I must admit I hesitated when I came across this table on Overstock. I was looking for a couple other types, but this one caught my eye because I had a place that was begging for a table with this design.I have antique (1910s & 1920s) furniture and this table is perfect between two high-back chairs.The whole table has this weathered charm. The metal from and the wood shelving go great together. The shelves have a rough \"weathered\" finish.It was delivered in good time and in excellent packaging. There were no scratches, dents, and it's obvious that care was taken when boxing it up. It was also very easy to assemble with no missing parts.I recommend this table for anyone looking or needing one of this design.", 
    "Nice looking end table, looks like the picture and easy to assemble.", 
    "Not much I can say. The assembly was super easy. We purchased this as a rustic set in our living room so everything worked out.", 
    "Definitely worth the price & looks much more costly than it is. It arrived within two days & my husband had it assembled within an hour. It's a great addition to our tv room where we already had the Myra bookcases too. I really like this line of furniture & will probably be back for more pieces!", 
    "This looks good but is cheaply made.", 
    "Have used this in my office to put my mini fridge on. Great not to have to bend down! and I can store coffee and supplies on the bottom shelf. Keurig on top of the fridge and everything is in one spot!", 
    "I originally purchased the 26in wide bookshelf and loved it, easy to put together and it really popped in the room. The end tables are equally as eye catching (I purchased two) and we love them. I've gotten many compliments on the pieces. I just ordered the 42in wide bookshelf today and can't wait to get it.", 
    "Its exactly as described/pictured. I have the other taller bookshelf as well and love them both. Easy to assemble!", 
    "nice, easy to put together, looks great - good price.", 
    "table top and bottom shelf solid great texture and appearance for an affordable rustic table. Unfortunately the metal frame looks extremely cheap and welding at the joints is horrible with holes showing. I'm returning... sometimes when you buy cheap you get cheap", 
    "Goes well with the desk. Using for the printer", 
    "TRIBECCA HOME has never disappointed me!", 
    "Great sturdy table. Easy to assemble and looks nice in our industrial chic living room!", 
    "I love all about this table. Great style, great height, very well made and love the bottom tray...I stack extra throw pillows on the bottom for more color in my room and as backups.", 
    "High quality and stylish, definitely recommend", 
    "LOVE THIS TABLE!!! EASY TO ASSEMBLE AND LOOKS GREAT", 
    "We use this along with the bookcases in my husbands home office. Rugged yet classy. Very well made. Would recommend", 
    "Love this rustic end table. It has a very nice reclaimed wood top and metal supports. The table was 50% of the cost of other tables that I considered with the same quality.", 
    "Makes our room perfect. Great accent piece. Unbeatable price.", 
    "Thought I'd be clever and create a dual-end-table-coffee table with this, but it sits higher than the arms on my chair. Works fine as an end-table, which is what it's marketed as, so no big deal! The square shape creates a lot of storage space, and looks great flanking my couch!", 
    "Using this as a tv stand in our home office. Easy to put together and is very sturdy.", 
    "This table was easy to put together and looks great!", 
    "Looks great and easy to put together.", 
    "I wanted it to be for our living room sofa end table but it was too wide. It's no fault of the table though. My own measurements fault. But we made them be nightstands surrounding a queen bed and they are perfect!", 
    "Easy to assemble. Useful.", 
    "Love the rustic and wrought iron. The end tables will go with rustic or a mix of mod and rustic.", 
    "Holds considerable weight without issues - looks great and as held up very well.", 
    "Love these tables. If you are looking for a rustic but stylish end table this is it. The top is a little rough and uneven but that was the look I was going for.", 
    "Delivered on time, easy to put together, sturdy. Overall, a great table. This coordinated well with a coffee table I had purchaseed elsewhere.", 
    "Table was very well made. I used it for two computer printers and it is roomy and sturdy enough. Pleasantly surprised.", 
    "I bought this table along with other matching pieces for my daughter. It's sturdy, beautiful, really good quality and affordable. I love the industrial look of the wood with the black metal. This is nice, clean line furniture, not bulky at all. This is great furniture for someone just starting out in their first place, or retirees. It's timeless and lends itself to different styles of decorating. You won't be disappointed, it's even nicer in person that the pictures convey.", 
    "I was hesitant about buying the table because the pics of the top were not very clear. I wasn't sure what I would be getting and feared it was going to look much to modern and worse yet, cheap. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the piece up and saw that the wood was EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be. It has a great distressed looked to it but the finish itself is top notch. I only wish I had bought the console that goes with it at the same time because it was ***$ off during the black Friday sales! I didn't and really missed the boat on it. Will be watching to see if it goes on sale again.", 
    "I like it. Well made and easy to assemble. The wood has a rough surface that was fine for us.", 
    "This table looks like *********** ******** but at a fraction of the price! Very easy to assemble (seriously -- 13 screws and my husband and I had it together in 10 minutes). It fits our space perfectly and adds a nice rustic touch.", 
    "Good looking table. Purchased tv stand first and liked enough to get the matching end table. Wood looks great- metal frame isn't authentic (I prefer \"real\" iron or metals ie antiques) but looks good and not cheep looking. It very much updates our tv room an still keeps a rustic / eclectic look.", 
    "The table was very easy to put together and very sturdy once assembled. I had previously purchased the sofa table with three shelves and they matched perfectly.", 
    "I am super in love with this end table. It looks even better in person and was easy to put together. I wish there was a coffee table that matches the style of this table.", 
    "Sturdy piece of furniture. Top gets a little rough so have to be careful when dusting.", 
    "True to size. Love the blend of rustic wood with the black iron. Can go with modern or traditional style.", 
    "I love the look of this table. It is very roomy. It was a great price.", 
    "Love this table. Great design. Easy to assemble. Very happy with my purchase", 
    "I purchased 2 of these tables for my family room. They are exactly what I was looking for. They were easy to assemble an look perfect! The style is very similar to a table I was looking at in an upscale catalog at about 1/3 the price.", 
    "The only reason I kept this table was it was on sale and I had a personal discount which made it worth it. It looks much better on line. It is a laminated style wood with a high shine. The top part of the table is not level had a few dips and ridges which makes it a bit dangerous if you put a glass on it just right it will tip. Again I kept this table as it serves the purpose I needed it for but would not recommend this if you want a higher quality item.", 
    "This is a fun end table. I like the basic yet unique style. It blends very nicely with a wood and iron coffee table from **** *** and our 1900s tiger oak piano. It feels very sturdy.", 
    "The paint on the metal legs chips off if you're not careful when putting on the bottom shelf. I wish the wood were \"real\" but it still looks good if you're not looking to something really expensive.", 
    "I guess you get what you pay for. Table looks cheap and inexpensive. More of a hassle to send back so I decided to keep it for now. Holes did not line up and required a lot of manipulation to put together.", 
    "Perfect end table, great price, rustic feel is just what I was looking for.", 
    "The table has a nice finish on both the wood and metal parts, and having a bottom shelf is a plus.", 
    "Assembly was easy. Style is updated. Price was just right.Nice and sturdy. I bought this as a nightstand for my sons room. I did not want to spend a lot of money on something he would ruin anyways. Now I think I might buy more matching pieces for the rest of the house.", 
    "Really love these tables. I didnt put them together so I cant speak to the ease of that but the tables look great and are sturdy. Also were a great deal!", 
    "I love this table ~ it's beautiful, well made with superior quality!!", 
    "This table is beautiful and sturdy, and it was very easy to put together. It blends well with my other furniture tables without having to match.", 
    "Gorgeous table. Rich feel. Like I bought it at Pier 1.", 
    "Kind of expensive, but it is exactly what I was looking for. Great product.", 
    "Got this table to match a coffee table of similar design. Nicely sized and stability was good. Only complaint was about directions. READ them carefully and they lay everything out first. Made the mistake of using wrong screws for top and put four small holes in top of table. Since it is rustic, I filled them with wood filler and touched up with a furniture pen. It would not have happened with more specific directions, and I am no novice at this! Overall I was satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "Very nice product, easy to put together. These fit our space perfectly.", 
    "I also bought the bookshelves and t.v. stand to display picture on and the coffee table. I love the look and the look like I paid more for them. have gotten a lot of complements from my friends", 
    "Good product. Sturdy. But expensive for what it is.", 
    "This end table matched the coffee table we also ordered beautifully! My husband was going to put together but I decided to do it. Very easy!! We are beyond pleased with this table.", 
    "This piece of furniture is perfect for the purpose for which it was ordered. True to colour in picture. It was very difficult to assemble - requires 2 people. One of them should be someone who is good at puzzles.", 
    "I bought two of these tables to use as nightstands. They were simple to assemble, appear to be well-built, and the wood parts look great - none of the cheap-looking fake stuff. I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for an industrial accent piece to add to their space!", 
    "This is a nice looking table. It is large enough without being too big. It is rustic, but more industrial and modern just as the title says. Well worth the money and very quick and easy assembly.", 
    "We just love these tables! there is a little assembly required, so we weren't sure if the quality would be there. But they are made from solid wood and wrought iron, and they project a beautiful rustic elegance that we are thrilled with. Just perfect for a modern-retro look.", 
    "I ordered 2 of these tables. I like the rustic look and the solid feel of them. They are nice overall. One however is so much better quality than the other one, like day and night. One is made of solid pieces of wood and even though has a rustic unfished look to it, seems more \"together\". The second one is close to be dangerously unfinished, where you wonder whether your tetanus shot is still valid every time you come to wipe it with a cloth. Give 3 stars: 5 for one, 1 for the other one.", 
    "Beautiful, timeless piece. Looks great in our family room, which is a modern d\u00e9cor. Easy to put together. Shipping was quick as well.", 
    "My husband and I love the look and feel of the Trivecca Home Myra Industrial pieces. We purchased the desk and bookcases along with the end tables for our family room. They are exactly what we were looking for, however we were disappointed because the attachment screws on the bookcases and end tables strip easily. We are also concerned as all the pieces are off gassing a terrible smell that burns our eyes. We have been wiping it down with vodka and vinegar in hopes it gets better. I highly recommend the furniture if you have the time to off gas it in your garage or outside in the sun.", 
    "Nice looking end table, rustic/iron style that looks warm yet modern. Great fit in my family room. Price was great, I've seen similar styles for much more $, very easy to put together. Glad I purchased it, then all of the furniture pieces from O have been nice buys!", 
    "These tables are large. The tables are rustic and that's what I wanted but the tops are not level making it hard to place glassware on them. I had to return one because it had a whole where a knot had come out underneath the top piece, causing that board to warp. The new one has a hole where a screw goes that is to small for the screw. It's metal so I have to figure out a way to make it bigger. They look nice at a distance but not very well made. **Overstocking is excellent to work with though. No complaints with them.", 
    "Easy assembly and fairly well constructed. Name is a very good description - Vintage Industrial Modern Rustic. Wood may not be as hard as you think and will dent but just adds more character as opposed to damaging it. Boards have more wave to them than expected. Can\u0092t beat the value for what you get however.", 
    "I love this table, I use it as a sofa table behind my sectional. I work at a high end furniture store that has a table just like this one, but I could never afford it, even with my discount. This table from Overstock was a quarter of the price, and looks almost exactly the same. I got it at an even lower price because I got it on Black Friday for a steal. It was super easy to put together. The metal legs feel a little flimsy during assembly but once all the screws are tightened everything is very sturdy. High style at a very low price. I love it so much that I just ordered the matching end table.", 
    "This table was a great find. I wish they still had them.", 
    "Very nice, very sturdy and compliments our living room furniture perfectly. Priced right and it was easily to put together. You can't go wrong with this purchase. I can see this table lasting atleast half a decade for me easily (if not more).", 
    "Love these tables. They are rustic but in a kinda modern vintage way. You can sit glasses on them and don't have to worry about water rings ect. I would recommend these for any one that wants a change at a reasonable price", 
    "These tables are well constructed. Heavy, durable. Rustic tops. Modern base. Great if you are going for that rustic modern look. Good deal especially at the price point.", 
    "Looks great. it's a good sturdy table. Easy to assemble.", 
    "I have rustic type scraped wood floors and love the way this side table matches the feel of the room. I have just ordered the vintage coffee table to go with it and am excited to complete the look in my family room. Shipping was fast and the table was well-protected.", 
    "Nice looking and goes well with my other furniture. You have to like furniture that is not traditional.", 
    "love the side table. great quality, well built, sturdy and everyone loves it. i am completely satisfied with my purchase. took minutes to put together", 
    "Great tables at a great price! Very easy to put together. They are very rustic, the top is not completely flat but I like that look.", 
    "Fits perfectly in my living room. It arrived quickly, packaged well, and assembly? very easy!! I love shopping at overstock!", 
    "A very sturdy and attractive table for the price. A bit tricky to assemble, but worthwhile.", 
    "What a great table at a great price. The tables are very sturdy and substantial, the metal legs look great (I've seen plenty of metal furniture that does not look this nice and well done), and the wood looks rustic but finished. The wood color of my tables is between a medium and dark brown, not at all orange or red as some other reviews say. Maybe I just got lucky. I love the height with the 18\" seat height on my sectional and they are big enough to place a table lamp, accessories and a drink without looking cluttered. By far the best Overstock purchase I've made.", 
    "This is a great end table. I love the style. It arrived unassembled and was easy to put together. Looks great, without being too heavy.", 
    "Love the style of this end table and the size. The wooden top and shelf are a little lightweight.", 
    "Super fast delivery, thanks again Overstock. After reading the reviews I decided to make the purchase, no regrets. The rustic wood is solid and nicely finished. Very easy to put together (15 min tops).", 
    "Great for a loft or man cave. Heavy duty but easy to assemble. Ships well because it's almost indestructible.", 
    "We also have the complimentary coffee table with the same rustic design. Easy to assemble, is sturdy and reliable, and great value. Fits the room perfectly and adds a rustic feel. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "So absolutely in love, yet again. The first time around I had ordered two towers after requesting them to restock as they were out. Once they came in I jumped right on it, and I'm so glad I did. After ordering those, I ordered the end table. I truly wish that I had room to order the entire collection, because I would not hesitate one bit. It's solid. Has that clean industrial, modern look that I was going for a fraction of the cost of restoration hardware, or any of those stores with the same if not better, quality. NOTE: The wood is together like planks and hasn't on even sort of finish. You will get some spots that are a tad bit rough. If you are looking for a flat smooth piece of wood, this is not for you. If you are looking for that industrial \"RECLAIMED\" look, you will love it. I'm seriously going to knock out a wall in my apartment just so that I can order another table, and another Tower. That is how much I love it.", 
    "Nice tables for the price. Pretty easy to put together. Some of the holes didn't quite line up but made it work.", 
    "This side table is perfect. Sturdy, good quality, unique finish. Assembly was straightforward and took 10 minutes with an electric screwdriver. Materials are of good quality. The price is unbeatable, as it sells for a lot more on other sites. Too bad Overstock does not carry the media stand anymore...", 
    "Hard to find rustic/industrial style for this price. Bought two and perfectly satisfied.", 
    "These are easy to assemble, and they look great, only problem is wood is darker than pictured.", 
    "Easy to put together, seems sturdy, fit perfectly with what I needed it for. Looks like its picture.", 
    "These are perfect in our living room. Brings everything together! I have been searching 2years for the perfect end tables and finally found them", 
    "Love it, also purchased the coffee table and tv console, love the look, great quality at a great price.", 
    "We purchased these end tables, along with the bookshelves and table for our living room. The whole set looks great and is very sturdy. I had more trouble getting these end tables together than the other products in the line. One of them required some effort to get the base piece in, I think it wasn't cut 100% accurately which made it tricky but my husband was able to force it in. These tables are quite large compared to a lot of end tables which I love.", 
    "We purchase this end table along with the desk 3 piece set and the large bookcase. Sturdy, stylish and functional. Arrived pristine and was super easy to assemble.", 
    "Product is nice, except the wood color is just a bit darker. I would call it a medium cherry/reddish tint. It is nice if you don't mind that. Overall construction and quality is good.", 
    "The table was easy to assemble, had simple instructions and is pretty sturdy. It looks good", 
    "love this table and the rustic look. It is very sturdy.", 
    "The table had a very strong varnish smell for a week after we opened the box but it eventually went away. The table is made of slats of wood and has a rough finish. I didn't expect that. One of the slats had a natural knot with a hole on the top of the table. It fits for what we wanted it for.", 
    "Bought these tables to go with the coffee table in the collection, Ended up buying two more for a bedroom side tables.", 
    "I really like this end table. Not sure if the top is real wood, but i don't really care. The mix of metal and wood tones works perfectly in my family room. This table seems like it will hold up to daily use.", 
    "Exactly what we wanted and expected, based on the description and picture!", 
    "Very nice sidetable that was purchased for a client. When it arrived, the bottom shelve was broken. Have no fear when you purchase from Overstocked, as all it takes is a phone call and great customer service to get the part replaced within a week. They are awesome!!", 
    "nice table, rustic looking and fairly easy to put together. The nail holes were difficult to find but once found was pretty easy to assemble.", 
    "These end tables are really attractive. Nice, open and airy with plenty of room for books and other items. I'm very happy with how they look in my living room next to the sofa. They had a weird odor that lasted a few days but is now long gone. They were very well packaged and easy to put together, and you can't beat the price.", 
    "Beautiful end table. Great quality, especially for the price.", 
    "Bought this to match restoration hardware knock off coffee table. Your site re commended it. It does not quite have the presence of the coffee table but for the price . It is smaller than I hoped but my couch is huge so that might be it.", 
    "I bought a reclaimed wood and metal coffee table from a well known store for over $800. This table is very close in quality for a fraction of what their end table costs. Very rustic and casual which is the look I want in my family room and any knicks or scratches will just add to the look.", 
    "I ordered this table for our living room. It goes well with our style- mostly from", 
    "great quality, sturdy. bought this entire set...love it! beautiful and looks very expensive!!", 
    "Easy to put together. Literally took me about 10 minutes; however, you will need help from a friend to hold on of the pieces for you!", 
    "Purchased 2 end tables, put them together myself, was very easy, love the rustic look of them!", 
    "I needed an end table for our upstairs den and wanted something casual and rustic for the area. I love restoration hardware furniture but it was a bit pricey for this area. This table is perfect! the style reminds me of the restoration hardware furniture I love without the high price tag. I have received several compliments on the table and would definitely recommend it as a \"buy\"!!", 
    "Bought 2 of these end tables and just put them together. So far, so good. They are a great price for the quality. Wood is rustic looking and that's exactly what we wanted.", 
    "This is a great little table for the price. Easy to assemble and matches the cart coffee table perfectly.", 
    "Love my new end tables. I was looking for that rustic, yet modern look and found these tables. Got them on sale for a great price, Overstock shipped them out very quickly, and when they arrived they were beautiful! Super easy to put them together. Probably took me less than a half hour to assemble both tables I bought. Not a \"high end\" table, but I would have paid more for these tables. They are beautiful and well made.", 
    "I was skeptical about ordering furniture pieces online, but I am glad I took the chance. I am very happy with the product. I had been looking for months at furniture stores for exactly this style. I needed 2 end tables and at $$$ plus they are a bargain. I found almost the exact style and make at an upscale store and they were double the price. Sure glad I checked on overstock! I could not be happier with the purchase! I recommend these tables if you want the rustic charm!", 
    "I get many compliments on these. I liked the first one so much, I ordered two more for another room.", 
    "I have seen this piece priced much higher elsewhere. Great look and I can't believe the price!", 
    "This is made in China. The quality is ok for a rustic table. The metal parts are hollow and not the best looking. One of the back rods was missing a drill hole."
