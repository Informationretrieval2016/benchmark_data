    "I was disappointed that the brand advertised was not the brand received (Fulton advertised and AC Pacific delivered). I believe the workmanship is substandard because when not reclined, there is a gap between the bottom of the right seat cushion and the foot piece that flips up when reclined. There is also a gap between the backs of the two seats. The outside edge of the top of the flap on each side is stitched so that it does not lie flat as it should.", 
    "Have been looking for furniture that was high enough for my husband to sit and get up easily. This was perfect. I no longer have to help him."
