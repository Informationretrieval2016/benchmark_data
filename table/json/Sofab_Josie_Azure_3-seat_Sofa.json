    "I was SO worried about buying a \"couch in a box\" but to my surprise the couch was a beauty! One thing to keep in mind is that this couch is MADE IN THE USA! I have found that furniture made in the USA is sturdier and lasts longer. It was very easy to put together. Just a few simple steps. I was able to do it alone in 45 minutes, but the instructions stated it should take two people only 20 minutes. The material is very nice, and looks just as the photos do. The cushions puffed right up. I am so happy =)"
