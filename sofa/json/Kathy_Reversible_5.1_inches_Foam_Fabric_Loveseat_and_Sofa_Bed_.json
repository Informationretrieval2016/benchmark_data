    "The love seat serves its purpose for extra sleeping arrangements, but if you order the yellow, it will be green, a nice spring green, but never the less green. Thought you should know.", 
    "The description says 3 foam layers but in reality, the top layer is actually wood. It is not very comfortable, but at least the color is true (gray). For a couch it's great but if you want to use it for occasional sleeping purposes, I would look into something else.", 
    "I love the color. The comfort is ok when it is pulled out to a bed, but it needs more back support when sitting on it as a couch. The pillows on the back are only supported by a small rise up on the back.", 
    "I don't really care for our new loveseat. We bought it for our game room where my husband has his nice TV and all his video game systems. It looks nice enough but is not very comfortable. The back is as low as the sides, with just the pillows shown to \"support\" you when you lean back. The seat tends to slide out towards the front of the couch due to the accordion style cushions. I find myself having to constantly tuck it back into place. It worked fine for our overnight guests to sleep on but I wouldn't recommend it for a lounging couch, which is what we wanted it for.", 
    "I ordered this item for some extra sleeping space when all the kids come home. I like its compact size and the ease of unfolding into a bed. The quality seems good. The grey color is very light almost a blue. I actually like the color more than I thought I would.", 
    "This came in a big box with everything already together, which was great. It's pretty comfortable pulled out, or so our first guest tells us. :) It's a little difficult to sit on it with two people, as it has a low back and its back is against a brick wall in our apartment. But it works for a smaller space, and I love lying down on it sideways with a couple throw pillows. Would definitely recommend this loveseat/sofa bed if you're trying to furnish a guest room or spare room on a budget like we did.", 
    "We use this in the baby's room, for reading stories or for a parent to sleep on when baby is sick. It's not very comfortable for sleeping, but you can't ask for more for the price. I like that it's small and light weight -- easy to move around and it doesn't take up too much space in the small nursery.", 
    "Just what I expected. Absolutely no disappointments. Just the right size for my small room.", 
    "It looks great in our teen daughters' bedroom, and perfect for their sleepovers. Well made too.", 
    "The fabric was gorgeous, with flecks of gray, white and black, which gave it an overall gray appearance. I was impressed with the appearance and comfort of this love seat. It's the perfect attractive and functional piece for a small space. This sleeper love seat will provide a great solution for an overnight guest when the need arises.", 
    "Bought this for my office and to use for when my Granddaughters spend the night. It worked perfect for that.", 
    "Nicely made and comfortable", 
    "good price, serve the purpose.", 
    "Such a great buy. Just as pictured. Teen loves it.", 
    "We bought this sofa in grey for our yacht. It fits perfectly and is useful when we need another sleeping area for a guest. The color is very muted, so you can use a variety of throw pillows with it. My husband couldn't believe we didn't pay hundreds more for it when he saw it. A great buy if you need extra temporary sleeping in a smaller area.", 
    "We purchased this as a replacement in the sunroom. It will rarely be used. We want supplemental sleeping besides our guest room and didn't want to spend much.This sofa is very small, almost child size. It's not very comfortable, the back is low and doesn't support the pillows.It will suit our needs.We ordered gray, it is sort of a graphite gray. The fabric seems durable.It's good for someone who has a small space and needs a sleeping area.", 
    "Kid or dorm room suitable. Not plush st all.", 
    "modern edginess but not hard looking. tucks away in old bedroom to bring in huge antique chest. works!!!!", 
    "This was exactly what I wanted. It is a small space sofa. It is not a comfortable couch for tall or large people. More of a child sofa, but I'm an adult and I like sitting on it. It looks adorable in my little space I put it in and it's nice to have an extra bed when needed.", 
    "nice size to add to a spare room - love the fabric and color", 
    "Bought it as a gift for my daughter and she's pleased with it."
