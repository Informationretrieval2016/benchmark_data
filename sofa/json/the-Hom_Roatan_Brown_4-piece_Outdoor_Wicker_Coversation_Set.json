    "Putting together these items took a while, but forget the hand tools... use a drill bit to tighten the screws!!!The sofa and chairs are extremely solid, and look like they will last a long time... however we are already considering purchasing new pillows, as the ones that come with it are too thin to be comfortable... the back pillows do not go high enough, and when relaxing you have the back of the sofa/chair digging in your back... they are certainly not 'deep fill' cushions as with other brands...Overall it is very nice, but be prepared to spend a couple of hundred dollars on top to get new cushions...", 
    "Firstly, the box came with NO assembly instructions and only a small bag of 8 screws. This was just enough to put the tiny table together. I contacted Overstock customer support to get a copy of the instructions emailed to me. The chat support said my \"replacement part\" would be shipped in 3-5 business days. I only requested a copy of the instructions, because at the time I didn't realize I also didn't receive the necessary hardware. Now, regarding the product itself, it is TINY. Get out a measuring tape and measure it out. Very, very, very small. If anyone paid full price for this set (more than $1000), I can only imagine the disappointment they must have felt. It is NOT worth the $*** that I paid for it, but I don't have the time or the energy to send it back. Spend the extra money and get something nice - this isn't it.", 
    "Great set especially for the price", 
    "This is a great patio set for the price, the couch is a little smaller than i would have hoped, probably a little tight for 2 people.", 
    "Great furniture sturdy super comfy", 
    "When we started looking for a patio set we were looking for a small size set but definitely a comfortable one. After long research I found this item is exactly what I am looking for. It contains one 2 seater sofa and 2 single chairs. Cushions are pretty comfy and Spacious enough. Only drawback is I did not like the Centre Table as it is not very strong.", 
    "The colors were good. Arrived on time. Happy with the quality of the furniture. Cushions were okay. I would buy additional cushions. We are petite so its comfortable. But for bigger people it might be a tad bit small. The only downside is assembling. Every piece of furniture took atleast an hour to fix.", 
    "Looks way better online, Not worth the money, cheaply made, glass don't even fit on the table. Cushions are cheap, made with cheap material. Bad choice.", 
    "The box arrived on a palette. Be careful when taking the individual pieces out of the box, it is packaged very snug! Other than that, the assembly was easy and the set doesn't take up a lot of space. The quality of the wicker is okay. It is not fancy, but decent and durable enough for outdoor furniture. My husband and I were happy with the purchase!", 
    "This four piece set was purchased for our new sunroom. I was a little dismayed when all of it arrived in one box but soon found it was easy to assemble. It is sturdy and comfortable as well as attractive. Excellent price as well.", 
    "Been looking for set for a long time. Very happy with this set.", 
    "The set itself is great, but packing was terrible - the plastic bag with the hardware was broken and all hardware was scattered all over the packing box, and, of course, some were missing.But Overstock been very helpful and compensate it.", 
    "It was a little hard to put together at first, directions are SLIM to none, but with a little sorting through objects and figuring out what goes where assembly wasn't too bad. would recommend two person assembly. overall SUPER happy with purchase, looks GREAT on my patio!", 
    "Roatan Wicker Set looks better in the picture then in real life.It is smaller, not as sturdy as I expected, so I was disappointed and was not worth the money I paid for it. This was my first disappointment with Overstock, for all the other products I have bought over the years, they were exactly as pictured and worth the price!"
