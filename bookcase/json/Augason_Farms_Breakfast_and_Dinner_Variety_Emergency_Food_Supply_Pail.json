    "Be the proverbial Girl Scout; prepare for the worst and hope for the best...but know that everything will probably come somewhere in between. This product was exactly as described.", 
    "Five dads went in and purchased this variety pack. When we were searching for reviews, it seemed no one actually tasted the food. We didn't want to order emergency food that tasted bland and only supplied nutrition without flavor. We wanted the best bang for our buck. This variety pack offered the most calories per dollar. But, we needed to test it before ordering a large amount. We opened 3 packages and and gave our opinion - Maple Brown Sugar Oatmeal, Cheesy Broccoli Rice, and Instant Potatoes. We were all in agreement these 3 items tasted great. The Oatmeal was as good as the little boxes you would buy in individual packs at Winn Dixie. The potatoes were a little (repeat a little) chalky. They were delicious and full of flavor. We believe we did not add enough water. The Rice was as good as the Oatmeal. Individual taste preferences will vary. Some people may want a bit more salt or seasonings. It's the same in real life. When you sit down to supper, some people grab the salt and pepper while others opt for none. These foods are in line with everyday meals. During an emergency situation, we do not believe we will be missing out on nutrition, variety, or flavor. Things to keep in mind - some meals are to be mixed with water, others need to be boiled for several minutes. Plan accordingly. Buy a small propane stove. Make sure you keep a large pot available for mixing. Have plenty of drinking water on hand. Overall we were quite pleased with the value and the product itself. We are going to place a large order for each of our families.",
