    "This pillow looks just as pictured. The thing I couldn't tell about it in the picture was it's feel. I purchased this pillow for my family room sofa. In my opinion, this pillow is better suited as an accessory for outdoor furniture due to the fabric its made of. It doesn't feel fluffy and soft. It has a thicker, water resistant feel to it, the way fabric on outdoor furniture is (I'm not saying it's water resistant- it only feels like it might be suited for outdoors) If that is what you are looking for, then you'll like it. I was hoping it would of had a softer, comfy feel to it for use on my family room sofa.", 
    "I ordered several throw pillows for my room, and this one is my favorite (in large part because the colors tie the room together perfectly)", 
    "I thought I could put these in my loved bedroom. Pillow are nice. I only scored low because they weren't to my liking", 
    "Arrived quickly and is exactly as pictured. Very full and plump with beautiful colors.", 
    "I was expecting much fuller from the picture... there's not enough, or perhaps the wrong kind of stuffing in the pillow. The fabric is beautiful though!", 
    "Colors are gorgeous and they brighten up my dark would chairs. Nice and firm too for back support.", 
    "Love the pillows. They look exactly as pictured and coordinate well with the area rug I ordered earlier. They add color to my beiges and browns and brighten up the room a lot. They are very firm and note as \"comfy\" as I hoped but they look amazing.", 
    "These are excellent pillows! The size and pattern match perfectly with our home. High quality too."
