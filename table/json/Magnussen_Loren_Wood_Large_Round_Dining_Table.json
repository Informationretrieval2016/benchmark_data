    "I have had this table for about 6 months now. The table is as beautiful as it looks online. Although it doesn't have the same mechanism shown in the photo for adding/removing the leaf, it is easy to do and fits well. The only problem I have with this table is that it scratches VERY easily. It arrived with grooves/scratches on the edges that were stained and sealed into it. It was made in Vietnam. Are these scratches their idea of giving it an antique look or did they damage it and then try to cover it up? Don't know. Anything you put on this table must have protection under it - a placemat, trivet, etc. It WILL leave a mark if you don't, and the surface can't be polished out or fixed with a stain marker or other such product. The table is beautiful and solid and I've had several compliments on it, but upkeep is difficult.", 
    "This table is just as described The color is deep, rich brown. It was not difficult to assemble. It does need protection from excessive sunlight and hot items. But that is easy to accomplish. We are quite satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "BEAUTIFUL...THICK AND STRONG....LOOKS GREAT"
