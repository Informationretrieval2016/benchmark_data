    "This table set the tone for our beach cottage. It's got a great rustic look that goes well with our shabby chic decor. It is very heavy so be forewarned. Also, while it is meant to look old the finish on the table top is actually easily scratched and water stained. It isn't actually a picnic table that needs no special care. We use placemats and coasters. We loved the unfinished side of the top but unfortunately the hardware is attached to it and so it cannot be reversed. Very happy with this table. We use a bench on one side and 3 chairs on the other and it accommodates them all very comfortably.", 
    "Love this table. So heavy and rustic; perfect for our screened in patio. My only complaint was I had did have to seal it with wax so that the stain did not rub off when I wiped the table. This has worked out just fine. The wax seal that I applied also seals out moisture from glass or spills.", 
    "the table is very nice, everyone likes it. but it is the size and height of a picnic table.....on the low side, not a bar top size table.", 
    "Assembly required - need at least two people because top is heavy. But well worth the effort!", 
    "So rustic and beautifully made very heavy Love the quality of the wood"
