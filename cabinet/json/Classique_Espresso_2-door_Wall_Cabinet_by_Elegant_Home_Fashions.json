    "This cabinet came well packed with all necessary pieces. It was quite easy to put together, requiring only a screwdriver. The edges all matched up correctly and all hardware works just fine.", 
    "Lots of work to assemble this cupboard. After about a week of use, the entire cupboard collapsed and fell apart on the wall. If there was an easy way to return it, I would. My husband has fashioned some better supports to clamp the pieces together. Have not hung it back up yet and still not sure it will hold together. Poor design.", 
    "We bought this cabinet to go over our toilet in our mini powder room. It fits perfect. Since I have a small powder room I need something to put essentials in. This cabinet looks very well and keeps a nice supply of essentials for the powder room.", 
    "Looks good in our bathroom. Is very dark..almost black. Good quality for the money. We also bought the matching medicine cabinet. Fairly easy to assemble. Was missing a page of instructions and I called the company. They were very helpful and quickly emailed me the full instructions.", 
    "just what i'd been looking for. shallow 4\" cabinet", 
    "I needed a small wall cabinet for my bathroom to store toiletries and toallow my small bathroom counter to be less cluttered. Arrived quickly, good quality, color as shown and easy to assemble. Nice that a small package of extra screws, bolts and pieces are included. I needed one that was missing.", 
    "Assembly was reasonably easy.", 
    "I purchased this product because it seemed to match my style, however the product wasn't manufactured in the highest quality. It took over two hours to clean/prep/install. When installed the doors didn't align evenly, the paint wasn't applied evenly over the different sections (leaving almost a fade to the wood slightly exposed), and it fell off the wall. Once I got the piece installed properly, I noticed the doors were uneven. I tried to drill new holes, however, it still didn't match up properly. When I hung the piece on the wall (using the screws provided), it fell off after trying to open one of the doors and broke a piece off the back of my toilet.", 
    "Bought this as an accompaniment to the bottom cabinet purchased earlier. Great color. Easy to assemble and good value.", 
    "the cabinet was cheap looking. some hardware was missing. some of the wood was knicked allowing the whiter wood underneath to show. i want to return it but it has already been put together and i don't want to take it apart. the cabinets at *** would have been better and wouldn't have cost me so much.", 
    "It looks great and is the right size for the space over my toilet. I can't comment on how easy it was to put together because my boyfriend did it for me but everything fit snug and the doors close evenly. It's just the right size for my small bathroom.", 
    "The back did not provide any support and the quick lock parts did not tighten well. No metal plate was provided to allow the doors to connect to the magne to keep the doors closed, The packing material was sticking to the pieces and had to be vacuumed several times plus wiped with a cloth, The glass is held in with screws and small washers and the glass rattles the doors when you open and close them. There were reinforcement plastic corners that did not do much to make it stable.", 
    "Wood cracked easily, wood pegs did not fit properly. Had to insert wood glue. Also smaller width than expected.", 
    "This cabinet looks great in my kitchen and gives my wife much more room that she had, this was easy to put together.", 
    "Perfect size, easy to assemble!", 
    "Very nice with the 2door floor cabinet. I wished it was a little larger in size.", 
    "Looks great and easy to put together. My only negative was that the stickers labeling the parts left residue which was hard to remove. Some color came off when I tried to clean it off.", 
    "i needed an end table to fit between my couch and the wall. i looked and looked everywhere --almost impossible to find something less than 8\" wide -- and ended up buying this cabinet. i just didn't put the doors on. it works great.", 
    "Using in my wine bar setting", 
    "After reading some of the negative reviews, I didn't know what to expect but thought I would take a chance and still purchase it. I was very pleasantly surprised! It was extremely easy to put together and came with a template to fasten it to the wall making it very easy to hang. It looks very expensive and I'm very, very pleased. I've already received numerous compliments on it. For those who stated it fell apart, all I can say is you must have not put it together properly. It's very sturdy and compliments my new bathroom in just the way I wanted! I heartily recommend this cabinet.", 
    "Easily assembled, pretty piece of furniture, and if you keep your cabinet organized in the bathroom it looks very nice.", 
    "Easy to put together, sturdy and looks good. It holds more than I thought it would, I'm very pleased with it.", 
    "Easy assembly.....easy to hang as well.", 
    "This piece is smaller than I anticipated but that's on me not looking at the dimensions before buying. Looks great with the double-door floor cabinet. Didn't take long to put together.", 
    "color is about right as the image, its made of cheap wood-like materials, the hardware does not assemble tight, I had to use additional fasteners to keep it together, the wall template to drill the holes in the wall did not match the hangers rivoted to the unit (so go off of the unit itself and dont use the template).", 
    "This is a great cabinet in the bath room, I've purchased 2 now and have been very satisfied. Easy to put together.", 
    "Bought this for my daughter and son in law to use with the matching floor cabinet for China in their dining room. They love it. The floor cabinet had 2 broken parts but they were replaced in just a few days through Overstock", 
    "Great piece! Looks great with the floor cabinet.", 
    "Very nice cabinet I wanted to put over my toilet looks great. Wish it was a little bigger but I am happy with my purchase ..", 
    "very easy to assemble love it in my bathroom. I was surprised how nice it was for the price", 
    "Was just what I needed. got what I expected the advertising was spot on.", 
    "Looking for a match to our allready purchased vanity...Match was perfect. Achieved the look our bathroom needed. Purchased on a 12% off day made the purchase a little sweeter.", 
    "When putting this piece together, the back didn't match up correctly. The back was a tad too high for the piece, however, my husband got it to fit together okay. When he went to put it on the wall, the piece fell apart and fell. My husband is EXTRA HANDY, builds speakers, built our theater room, etc., and he was so frustrated with this piece that by the time we got done with it, I just threw it away. This is really the only Overstock purchase I have ever given a poor rating to. I did purchase the floor cabinet that goes with this piece, and that is fine.", 
    "The color is a very dark espresso that has a semi-shiny finish to it. Everything else was as expected.", 
    "I bought this cabinet based on the reviews of what others had written. I'm happy to say the color and quality met my expectations. I would recommend this to anyone that wants an inexpensive cabinet.", 
    "I bought this piece for my salon. It is definitely worth the money, excellent quality, rich color. Highly recommend this piece! Very fast delivery.", 
    "We bought this for our powder room since we have a pedestal sink and no storage except a little wire stand in the corner. My husband put it together with no difficulty. It is stylish and is a perfect fit on the wall above the toilet.", 
    "I bought this and the floor cabinet that matches it, at the same time. They are nice cabinets, fit right where I need them. As for putting them together, follow directions exactly. We did not have a problem, but we followed the directions.", 
    "We are pleased with this purchase and would reccommend it to others. Color, construction and style are fantastic. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "I needed two bathroom cabinets (medicine with matching wall cabinet) fast and didn't want to break the bank. It was surprisingly difficult to find two matching cabinets, and these looked to be the best value for my dollar. I did not expect high quality, but I am pleased with what I got. Easy to put together, and relatively easy to install. Looks very nice with it's matching sister medicine cabinet.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for a young lady friend and helped her assemble it. She was very happy with it.", 
    "Sturdy cabinet, easy to put together and mount. I would suggest gluing the dowls for extra strength.", 
    "Nice looking cabinet, but disappointed with quality. Will need to be very careful not to ding these up when using. Put frosted square contact paper in glass doors to provide screen for stuff kept in cabinet and that looks nice.", 
    "is a little big for the area but we'll get used to it. There was a hole in the wall for a fit-in medicine cabinet but we couldn't find one to fit so we got this one to cover the hole. matches our vanity perfectly. I love Overstock - everything we have purchased has been great.", 
    "I'm happy to finally have the cabinet installed. It took a long time to assemble it. It looks dainty especially with the glass window look and fits in the narrow wall space in our bathroom. I would recomment it for apartment living. I like the fact that there is sufficient height between the racks, so I can store long shampoo or lotion bottles.", 
    "Perfect shelf for over our toilet. Great size and storage space. Easy to assemble and mount. Color matched perfectly to the site description (dark, dark brown - almost black) and coordinated well with our new bathroom features.", 
    "The cabinet was easy to put together, and easy to hang. It's solid and nice-looking, the color was as described by other reviewers. It's a good product for a good price.", 
    "Product is well-constructed, easy to assemble and very pretty. Nice weight (not flimsy at all) and fits very nicely. All parts were provided as well as clear instructions.", 
    "Great product....although it's really a matte black in color. Easy to assemble. My husbank and I did it together. I did buy a can of spray frost & frost out the windows so you couldn't see everything in it and that helped a lot!", 
    "Good price for a decent cabinet. Many pieces to put together. No written instructions but they give you picture instructions.", 
    "This cabinet was easy to assemble and is beautiful in my bathroom! The finish seems very durable. I recommend purchasing better anchors than the ones provided and/or mounting to a stud on one side, just to be safe.", 
    "The cabinet comes in pieces but is pretty easy to assemble. Looks good, good deal for the price. I really like the hardware it comes with. However, the mounting holes are in the completely wrong location - there is no way to get a screwdriver to them, so plan on having to drill new holes in the back before mounting on the wall.", 
    "This is a reasonably priced cabinet which contains good storage space for shampoo bottles, etc. The assembly was pretty straight forward and took under an hour (2 people). We had no difficulty with the holes lining up or uneven doors which I saw in the other review. It is a VERY dark color - virtually black to me, so it may or may not match other \"espresso\" items exactly. We have not hung it yet, but don't expect any difficulty as the template is included. For the price, it is exactly what I expected, so I am pleased with my purchase.", 
    "Very disappointed...I knew it was going to be bad when the directions for putting it together included glue. Very poorly constructed. The pre-drilled holes don't line up properly so the doors were uneven. I had to return it.", 
    "Lets face it, you dont buy this collection for high quality however its not super cheep so I expect it to be perfect! It came with a few scratches and digs in it and the doors do not line up correctly! I have to say I was dissapointed! When I do look beyond those inperfections it is a pretty piece and looks great on the wall but again its going to have issues!"
