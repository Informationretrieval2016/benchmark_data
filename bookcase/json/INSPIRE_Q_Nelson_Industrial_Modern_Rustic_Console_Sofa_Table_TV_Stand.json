    "I got this product and it looked as if it had been thrown from a moving truck (shame on you Overstock for sending it at all). Plus, it looked as if someone else had returned it then they sent it to me (shame on you again, Overstock). The shelves are cheap coated particle board. I knew because mine had large chunks torn out of them, the metal parts are cheap, and the coating is not high quality powder coating as it appears in the pictures. (Great job by the photographer making a piece of trash look so good.) Really not worth the price. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! Now as for the return service by Overstock, they are wonderful and quickly took it away and returned my money. The person I dealt with was professional, apologetic, and did what she said she would. They even made a follow-up call to ensure everything was OK. I still love Overstock and their staff.", 
    "Very well made. Sturdy. Pretty. Looks great with wicker storage baskets underneath n", 
    "Love this TV stand. Middle shelf is high enough to accommodate large baskets and bins. Very solid and stabel.", 
    "It looks great and was easy to put together. Instead of decorative wheels, they should have made them real with a lock. It's somewhat heavy so being able to roll it once it's put together would be nice. Also, it would be better if it had some kind of backing to hide TV cables. Other than those two things it fits the industrial look I'm going for and I get compliments on it all the time!", 
    "We purchased this piece as a TV stand and filled the bottom with the receiver, speakers and baskets. I love it. It's very sturdy. Our TV is mounted on the wall though. It definitely adds more to the room.", 
    "Couldn't have chosen a better piece for my TV stand. Fits my 55 inch TV perfectly, and has adequate storage space for my cable box, wifi router. I've added a few decorative pieces on the shelves, and the whole set really just pops!! absolutely love this.", 
    "This piece is beautiful and large. It holds a lot of materials for me and still looks good in my kitchen.", 
    "Matches my new desk and I love having my office look so cooooolThanks!", 
    "East to assemble, good weight, very functional, good looking.I wish the wheels actually worked but not a big deal. Great Value!", 
    "I use this in my dining room and absolutely love it, so does my hubby who was a little skeptical about how it was going to look, now he loves it.", 
    "It's ok. Not my favorite.", 
    "Love this console! It is just as pictured, easy to assemble and low maintenance!", 
    "I had purchased an Inspire Q Nelson coffee table and end table from a local store and wanted a TV stand to match. The pieces I already purchased are made of real wood with a sturdy metal base. This TV stand is not anywhere near the quality of my other pieces. It is not made with real wood and the metal frame even looks kind of cheap. Its just OK - would not buy it again though.", 
    "Bought for my sons room, he loved the industrial style, nice quality for the price.", 
    "Love, love, love this piece of furniture. It was very easy to assemble and was packaged extremely well! Using it as a TV stand in our grandson's bedroom and couldn't have found anything that would work better! Very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "I like the way it looks, but some of the screw holes didn't match and the wheels are just decorative.", 
    "Be sure to measure anything you want to put on the shelves before ordering...they're pretty narrow and had to sit my receiver on top.", 
    "It was super easy to put together and looks so well-made. It was just like the picture", 
    "Used this for a guest room. Easy to assemble and is decent quality. Exactly what I expected.", 
    "great TV stand, looks great, easy to put together. My wife loves it!", 
    "We are using it as a tv stand in our tiny Brooklyn apartment. It works great - it's a nice way to add storage and also hold your tv.", 
    "I purchased this console table for my office. It came well packed, in a very heavy box. I put it together myself, and it was not hard, but took a little manuevering! You assemble it upside down, and all the bolts are tightened with an allen wrench that's provided. You have to make sure not to tighten up everything until the pieces are in place. Directions are good enough to figure it out. Looks very nice holding my printer with paper storge underneath and room to layout documents. Love my table!", 
    "I've seen similar pieces for over $1000 - this is a wonderful piece at a wonderful price. It's very sturdy and was easy to put together once my husband bought an Allen bit for his drill.", 
    "Arrived perfect and looks great, only wish is that the metal was thicker, more substantial.", 
    "It,s high enough to see even from the kitchen plus enough room for all the extra game boxes the kids have", 
    "Love this! Easy to assemble, looks amazing!", 
    "TV stand was easy to assemble and looks very nice in my space. It is a good value for the price. Seems sturdy and fits in with my living room perfectly. The finish of the wood is slightly darker than pictured. Not a problem for me - matches the other Nelson pieces I ordered. My tv fits perfectly.", 
    "Beautiful TV stand. Easy assembly nice quality. Holds my 42 inch television nicely.", 
    "It wasn't really hard to put together. I love love how it looks in my living room! The quality is great and seems to be very durable.", 
    "We are extremely pleased with this sofa table. Aside from one screw not going in, the assembly was simple, straight forward and very easy. Be sure not to tighten any of the legs before putting on the additional shelving. We ordered the 65\" piece and it is very well built and sturdy. The height and length are perfect for the platform bed in the Master Bdrm.. We are very pleased with it,", 
    "I bought this piece because it was taller than most consoles and I needed my TV to be at least this high off the floor. I easily put it together myself in just a few minutes, and it's sturdy enough for my new 50\" TV.", 
    "High Quality and a great value", 
    "This was a great purchase and very easy to put together. Looks great in our dining room as a display table.", 
    "perfectly described. easy to assemble,", 
    "Very nice easy to assemble.Wheels are static, wish they were real", 
    "Sturdy and easy to put together! The wood is nice, more of a chestnut brown than grey brown seen in the images but I like it even better than the photos. Great but for the price!", 
    "I bought the entire set of Inspire Q Nelson furniture and it looks amazing in my new house. It was a breeze to put together and is super heavy duty. We used this piece specifically as an entry way table and love it. Such a great accent piece when you walk through the door.", 
    "It's gorgeous. Matches the desk. see my review with desk though for info...", 
    "I was looking for an entry table and this one fits the bill nicely. It is sturdy and has a great industrial rustic look to it. A nice feature is that the wheels on the bottom are actually only decorative, this does not roll...which works great for my entryway and it comes with pads to stick on the wheels to prevent scratching your flooring.", 
    "Sturdy stand that does the trick. It holds my 55 inch tv with no problem at all.", 
    "It's OKAY. It's pretty sturdy. The wheels don't swivel. It came with came with an odd stench (similar to that of Chinese food).", 
    "I bought this console along with the two bookshelves and the coffee table. They are all easy to put together (it took me about two hours, by myself, to unpack and put everything together). They are good quality for a great price! The only downside is that I'm still trying to figure out how to hide all the TV cords...", 
    "While it's not as rustic as the pictures, it's still a great piece especially considering the price. Very sturdy as it currently holds an old 50\" flat screen and some video game consoles for me. Though time consuming, it's easy to put together.", 
    "So far, I'm loving this TV stand. Putting it together was not difficult and it gives the room a nice, clean industrial look -- if that's what you need. It was higher than what I expected, which was a welcomed surprise.", 
    "Very good buy just one problem with this item the wheel are welded and will not roll.", 
    "Love the casual and chic look, easy to assemble and good price. Love it!", 
    "This piece is lovely. It's an incredible value. High quality & very attractive. Everyone who visits seems to just love this piece (& the bookcase). We get a lot of compliments. I'm pleased w this purchase.", 
    "The table was a little challenging to put together but worth the effort. The cost of the table justifies why the top is not real wood but the style is very attractive.", 
    "sturdy, good loooking, easy assembly!", 
    "Great product. Very well made and sturdy. Looks great. Only complaint is that product was advertised to have 2 real wood shelves and it does not. However, once assembled it works out. Would buy this piece again and others from this line. Was also very easy to put together.", 
    "I needed shelves in my home office to organize supplies. This style lets me organize into stylish baskets that I can easily grab when needed. It's not boring like your basic cubby shelves. It came quickly and with no damage. Hubby says it was simple to assemble. I'm very happy with the price.", 
    "I got the console table for my sun-room a few months ago and was searching for a similar or same one, since we ended up using the first one in the kitchen. It added a super chic rustic view and quite a lot of functionality to our kitchen. It seems to have a lot of space so we put candles, vases with dry flowers and some pictures on it, and it also has place on the other 2 shelves for fruits or other stuff you'd like to store or display. I guess if I didn't start searching for another table like this, I wouldn't see a review from an angry person who claims that the picture is fake. I don't mind putting my own picture to prove the point, if needed, but the table does look like the picture. Besides, it is sturdy and is made of a good quality wood. If you buy, the only thing to take into a consideration is that since it is wood, it doesn't like water and hot drinks. So use coasters or get a pencil from Home Depot to conceal the white stains. The matching coffee table is nice too, by the way, I got both of them a while ago and I couldn't be more satisfied. The last thing is that the lower shelf is made of iron, not wood, and the wheels don't move, they are for decoration purposes only. In short: sturdy, nice, modern and good for the price."
