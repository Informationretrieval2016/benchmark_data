    "This is not a chair you sit in for hours to read 'War and Peace\". This is an accent chair, a slipper chair in a bedroom, a chair to fill an empty space in an office. I ordered it yesterday in the afternoon, it arrived TODAY in the afternoon. I'm shocked! It was easy to assemble with the allen wrench provided. It is an off-white fabric with taupe script. Another similar chair on another site was described as beige with brown script. This is a true taupe...gray/tan. It has a deep seat, great for an accent bolster pillow. I'm very pleased with this chair. It is now in my black and taupe bedroom, but would easily go in the living room or hall. The fabric is very neutral. Great price and sensational delivery.", 
    "I bought this chair to replace another one in my bedroom. I wanted something feminine but not too girly. The chair fit in my room nicely without taking up too much space. The chair is really soft and comfy to sit in. Because the chair is so nice looking it has forced me to keep clothes off it for long periods of time. I'm happy with the purchase.", 
    "Very nice chair for the price. Nice quality material. the script fabric looks fine. Nice accent chair for my home office.", 
    "This little chair is perfect for the price. Similar ones in store run big bucks. It took about 10 minutes to put together. A few of the screws were difficult to thread but with a power tool and two people it worked. It's a very light cream color and the print is grey.", 
    "I ordered this product as an accent chair for my bedroom. I am happy with it for the price. The color is true to description & looks good in my room. It is also, more comfortable to sit in than I expected. The directions were a little confusing to assemble, but once I figured it out it was easy. This is the second item I have purchased from Overstock and have been satisfied with both. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs an accent chair to finish off a room. It is an eye catching addition to my decor.", 
    "Love this chair. Its comfortable and very chic looking!!!", 
    "easy to assemble, great appearance!!!", 
    "Bought this slipper chair for our French Country guest room. It is perfect. You will need to put it together, but very easy!", 
    "This is a nice looking piece, but I don't think I would buy it for heavy use. The fabric seems like it could be easily damaged.", 
    "but needs to be rethreaded :-( Fort. hubby has the tools! I don't want to return it!", 
    "Looks good but sits low to the ground and unsteady. The screws keep coming loose.", 
    "Chair works perfect at a desk", 
    "Good purchase. Legs didn't match up too well. Husband worked with them and it worked great. Chair looks good in my mud room. Great slipper chair. Not a real comfortable chair, but a good buy.", 
    "exactly what I was expecting. Cortesi Home customer service was great", 
    "I like these chairs... I bought 2 of them. They were lower and deeper than the picture looked, but I really like them. They are firm but because they are deep, they could use a throw pillow on them for support on your back. The pattern is very pretty with a cream base.", 
    "Love these! Very easy to put together. Only one small issue is that one of the front legs on one chair is slightly short so, it doesn't stand on all 4s and wobbles a little. But, not a huge deal. They're comfy and I added a cute red lumbar pillow to step up the style even more!", 
    "It was perfect to go by my fireplace! Sets comfortably and all you had to do is screw the legs on! Love it!", 
    "Love the chair. Color as described. The script writing is grey. I bought a grey pillow at overstock to go with it and looks great. Not a chair to sit on for hours, but comfortable enough. Also, it was very easy to put together.", 
    "Easy to put together and then we scotchguarded it to make sure that there were no messes. Looks cute, although I wish the words were a little more muted.", 
    "Love, love, love my chairs. For the price you can't go wrong. Easy to put together and really simply beautiful. This was my very first purchase from O and I must tell you I was thrilled. Arrived in 2 days to boot!! Comfy cute Cortesi!", 
    "This is a really cute chair for my guest bedroom. I don't think it would hold up to a lot of usage but it works for an occasional reading chair in a guest room. I wish it were build more sturdy because I would love to put it in the corner of my living room. If you are wondering about the color, it is linen with gray lettering.", 
    "This chair does complete the look of a room but is not great for actual use. Feels a bit cheap and not very sturdy.", 
    "Beautiful chair and very sturdy!", 
    "I love my chair. It was really easy to assemble and it looks great", 
    "I bought two of these chairs.They are sturdy and comfortable and attractive. Color is just as pictured.", 
    "very pleased with this product", 
    "I needed something smallish to stage my sitting room but wanted the chairs to be functional to go with me when I move. I love the size and scale of these!!! I like the fact that they are armless as I will sit in one to do needlework on a floor frame. They are comfy and the right height for me - I'm 5'4\". One star reduction as one back bolt just would NOT line up right and let me tighten it completely. :(", 
    "I have a small living room and this accents it very nicely. Super easy to put together, maybe 10-15 minutes, tops. The chair is probably not for everyday use, but I love it!", 
    "Easy to assemble, Comfortable, and adds a nice touch to the room.", 
    "I was very pleased with this purchase. It came well packed and with mostly clear instructions on how to put it together. The only thing that was not clear was whether you should use the longer screws to attach the back or the legs, however, upon looking at where they screwed in it became obvious the longer screw were needed for the legs. I am 72 and I easily assembled it on my own in 15 minutes. Their is not much padding on the seat but I do better with firmer chairs. As I am only 5' 1\" most chairs are too big for me but with this chair my feet are comfortably on the ground and it is my new reading chair. I would recommend it.", 
    "The chair looks cute but was not tall enough to use with our living room furniture. It looked oddly short, so we are using it in a guest room instead. It's not a very comfortable chair, but I wasn't expecting too much at this price.", 
    "This chair is a great buy pricewise. I purchased it as an accent chair for my guest bedroom where it will not receive a lot of use. I would not use it in a family room sitting where it would receive daily use as it seems light weight. It is definitely not a \"child friendly\" seat as I don't believe the linen fabric would stand up to children. I was disappoint though with the color. In the picture, the color appears to be a pale beige or off white. When it arrived though, the color is a \"warm\" beige, definitely not the \"cool\" color I was looking for. Because I love the style, I am going to make it work.", 
    "worth the price. good value. I have the matching ottoman in my living room. They look great together"
