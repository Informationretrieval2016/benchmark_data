    "Nice cabinet but it took my husband about 3 hours to assemble it. It had smell for a week or 2 but not anymore. Fits about 18 pairs of shoes.", 
    "This is not the color I wanted but I waited too long and the color I wanted was no longer available. However, the features of this item is just what I need. It fits well at the corner of my entrance and now all the shoes are organized and hidden in there. The vented door really help to air out my sons' shoes. It took two sons to assemble the cabinet, takes longer time and more awkward doing it alone. There is a piece of wood between the drawer and the door that is raw, not painted black you can see it when the door closed, not sure if my son didn't turn the other side out or it came that way, so I painted it with my black pain from my art kit and it looks just perfect. The drawer is used to keep my coupons handy, or misc. items. The price went down $** after I bought it, but it worth having the item that is just right for my house. This item is highly recommended!", 
    "This cabinet is made of poorly finished particle board that damages easily. When constructing the cabinet, tightening the screws resulted in the particle board splitting and pieces of the exterior flaking off. The kit has plastic covers to cover the screws and luckily the cover was big enough to cover the part that flaked. The board that is between the drawer and the doors is visible when the cabinet doors are open. The board is not finished along the edge, so when the doors are open, you can see the non-finished edge of the particle board. There were two similar pieces of board in the box, however, neither of them had a finished edge. The back of the cabinet is a flimsy piece of cardboard held together with clear packaging tape. The stickers on the cabinet door indicating the piece for construction tore the espresso finish when removed. This piece of furniture was not worth the listed price and the quality level is something I would expect from a discount store.", 
    "It looks great! Great quality! the directions could have been a little more clear but fairly easy to assemble. Holds my 16 pairs of my size 12 shoes.", 
    "I just received this shoe cabinet. The legs are made so that they do not align with the outer edges of the cabinet, so that it is fully supported on all four sides.Also, the third hole (at the top of the triangle), of the floor of the unit, does not align with the hole in the top of the leg. This is how the floor and leg are screwed together.I am angry that I have to return the item because it is not made well for assembly. I am returning it."
