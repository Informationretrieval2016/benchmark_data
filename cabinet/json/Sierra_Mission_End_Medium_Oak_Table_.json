    "okay looking, small scale, but problems with assembly. the cam screws do not fit into the place provided, I still do not have the top on securely", 
    "I guess you get what you pay for. It is a nice looking end table. However, the quality is a little lacking. My biggest complaint is that one of the upper cross pieces that the top lays upon, has the screw holes on the wrong side. So one half of the table top is secured to the base and the other is not. As long as no one tries to pick it up by the top, it should be ok. But, how do you \"screw\" the hole placement up? My recommendation is a qualified \"yes\".", 
    "Four different people have tried to attach the bolt locks. They won't lock, and one broke in the attempt. I just have the top set on, and I hope no one tries to lift it. I purchased the coffee table too, (same problem.)", 
    "Don't tighten up all the screws until all connectors are in place. Smaller than I thought it would be but sturdy and usable for the price. Good finish and solid wood.", 
    "Excellent quality, easy assembly", 
    "wrong color. didn't match any of the other mission furniture.", 
    "Packaged really good, no damage in transit what so ever. Went to get easily and looks magnificent!", 
    "It is worth the price, however, I should have pursued getting the height of the product, it would be helpful if overstock would add dimensions. It is too short for my purpose as an end table. The cam nuts work but hard to screw in place. Took a lot of strength to attach.", 
    "This wood and finish are pretty, and look just like the photos. Assembly directions are clear, but some steps are more challenging that they should be. The locking clamps did not work well for us, so in the end, we kept the product, but the top is not fully connected to the table. It works fine that way for our purposes, but would not be truly strong for some purposes.", 
    "the table is nice wood but the way to attach the top of the table is terrible. the cam locks will not tighten the way they are supposed to, no matter how firm the pressure is applied...my husband is a strong man and works with all manner of tools and he could not get the top of the table to attach properly per the instructions. We were very disappointed.", 
    "Once I finally get this assembled, I will give it a higher rating. It is a very nice solid table and looks nice. The only major problem is that the pre-drilled holes on one side of the top are not in the correct position which will require me to have to drill new holes in order to attach the table top.", 
    "Looks just as pictured, easy assembly. A good value.", 
    "Looks great! Right size and blends right in! Love it!", 
    "Very well built.....just shorter than I thought they would be", 
    "Easy to assemble and nicely finished.", 
    "These are real wood and easy to put together the quality of the product is excellent. They have a nice weight to them and are the prefect size for my family room. The color is a deep honey tone and looks great with dark or light furniture.", 
    "I am so pleased with my self..I put this table together and did not have any bolts or washers left over. It is beautiful and I got it so I could display my daughter and her rescued dog and it works just the way I wanted. This is a beautiful and heavy table and will be used for a long time.", 
    "The tables were well packaged and the pictorial instructions were easy to follow. The cam locking tabletop were a bit of a challenge. OVeralll assembly time for 2 tables 20 minutes.", 
    "These are nice looking tables with one big flaw - the cam bolts which are screwed into the table top before it's placed on the frame and locked into place by the cam locks have to be a very specific length to work with the locks. Unfortunately fully screwing them in is too much so the locks don't grab them. Since there is no direction or guidance about how far out of the table top they have to stick, I had to play an awkward game of trial and error. A simple instruction; or, better yet, a small block of the right length, would make the assembly much easier and quicker. With that improvement they'd definitely be worth the price.", 
    "I got this End table to make a chess an checker table. I added Marble tiles in black an white 2\" x 2 \" marble squares to the top an made a marble boarder around the chess squares . Turned out very nice. The table was exactly 20\" x 20\" on the top an my marble squares was 15\" plus my boarder was 2 1/2\" around the marble squares. PERFECT !!", 
    "We originally purchased two of these tables for end tables but found they were too low for our sofa. We ordered two taller and returned one that was not assembled with no question or problem from Overstock. We kept the one that we assembled and since our space is limited we use it as a coffee table.", 
    "This end table is very small and too short to be used beside our couch. Unpacking it, we noticed a strong chemical smell, so we set the entire box outside to allow it to \"out gas\" there instead of in the house. Later in the day, my husband assembled the table. As others mentioned, not all of the holes aligned properly. Also, it may be \"solid wood\" but it is definitely NOT solid oak. Once assembled, it was FAR too small/short to use in our living room. We decided to set it there just for the night, while we figured out what we were going to do with it. Within an hour I had a sore throat and a headache because of the fumes from the table. We suspect it was from the laminate glue. We had to put it in our garage for the night and open the windows. It was that potent. This was a horrible purchase.", 
    "I bought two of these and was able to assemble them myself. They were certainly worth the money.", 
    "My fault for not paying attention to the height, but this is very small for an end table. It was fairly easy to assemble with the exception of the top. The cam style fasteners that attach the top to the base were difficult to use and I could only get 3 of the 4 to engage. Overall quality is pretty poor.", 
    "I love Mission Furniture and I am very happy with product.", 
    "I didn't have any trouble putting this together. I looks good with the rest of my Mission tables too.", 
    "This is a Great Affordable end table! Cannot be beat for the money."
