    "Love our table! So happy with this purchase, the table is super sturdy and solid. Well made. Don't get the matching chairs, they are light as a feather and I regret purchasing them. Table was a great deal though!", 
    "This table is perfect size, color and VERY well made, solid wood and extremely heavy. the color is a little less washed than the picture shows but still perfect, Im just going to hit it with a little white chalk paint wash... could not be happier, this table will last a very long time. its nice to see that company's still use real wood. AND this is a sustainable item so its good for the envionrment. win win...", 
    "I just received my table by special delivery today and it is awesome!!!! Great table for the price! It's heavy and sturdy....I put it together myself. I can't wait to get my chairs later today to make it complete! I usually don't even bother to write reviews but this table is so awesome!!!", 
    "very sturdy only thing it does stain easily but that just adds to the character", 
    "Beautifully crafted piece of furniture. Real wood and only the legs needs to be attached and you are ready for dinner ! the color is like a greyish with blue running through it. I have blue chairs and my kitchen is now complete.", 
    "This table is very nice with the antique brownish/gray finish and the spindle legs. It's small (60\" long, I think), but we have a small dining area, so it was perfect for us. There are very subtle streaks of blue running through the table, which is exactly what I wanted, because I purchased four of the La Mode 4-button Stitched Fanback Candice dining chairs in the blue fabric to go with it. The top of the table is ridged, rather than smooth, which hasn't been an issue for us. Assembly was very easy and only took about 15 minutes. The only thing I was unhappy with is that one corner was damaged a little when it arrived, so we just sanded it and used a furniture marker to blend the colors as well as possible, instead of trying to return it.", 
    "Table is very well made and easy to assemble! Solid wood with a dark brown finish and light(very little) whitewash overlay. Nice table that I paired with the Elements Weathered Oak Cane Back Dining Chairs for a nice French country, mismatch look. Very pleased!",
