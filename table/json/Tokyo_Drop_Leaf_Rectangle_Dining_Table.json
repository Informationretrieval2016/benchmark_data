    "I'm going for a minimalism but stylish look for my home and this table is exactly what I was looking for. It's unobtrusive design fits great in my home and It can be folded and moved off to the side so easily just in case i need to convert my dining space into a dance floor for a party ;)", 
    "This table has it all, it's functional, it saves space, it looks lovely and artsy. It stands very solid and doesn't shake or wobble at all. What really sold me on this table is the great design and space saving features.", 
    "If you are looking for a piece of furniture that will look great and be versatile at the same time, this is the choice. I was actually looking for a console table for my apartment\u0092s entrance. I found this piece that not only had what I needed it for my apt, it also converts into a nice size dining table. I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this table for anyone interested in a beautiful piece of furniture with great price and versatility.", 
    "I've been searching for a fold away table that I could tuck away to accomodate my studio apartment. I love the idea of having a dining table, but just don't have all the room to fit a traditional style. What's great about this piece is that I can put both leafs up to host a party of 4-6 comfortably, or put only one side of the leaf up for a more intimate setting. Once I'm done I can lower both leafs and slide it behind my couch for next time. The espresso finish is beautiful and compliments my other furniture. It easy to handle and just the right size.", 
    "I chose this table for its rich appearance and space saving design. I can move it to open up space for a party or it can be used as a dining area. It is very easy to adjust for whichever occasion I need it for.", 
    "We live in an apartment, so space is limited. My kitchen isn't huge so finding a table that's big enough to sit a family of three, but still small enough to fit in our kitchen was tough to find. I rarely invited guests over because I didn't have enough available seating. However, that has changed with this table. It's seriously the only table I could find that sits four people comfortably, but could also sit 2 more people at the narrow ends. Right now, we have it half opened against the wall since it's just my husband and I using it. My toddler (13 months old) sits in his high chair still (Graco Contempo). I can pull his high chair under the table, on one of the narrow ends, and he can easily reach the table to grab his sippy cup. BTW, the table is easy to clean. When the table is fully opened, it looks like a regular dining table. I have no complaints about it. It's sturdy whether it's half or fully opened. I love that I can fold it completely down for storage if I ever need to. I love the color (expresso) and smoothness of the table. It's beautiful. It arrived well packaged. That's something I worried about. However, it came well wrapped and protected, so nothing was broken or missing. As stated on the description, it is already assembled and ready to use. I'm now going to buy 18 inch barstools (ETHAN HOME Salvador Saddle Back 18-inch Stool in Black Sand-Through (Set of 2) to go along with this table, which I plan to buy from overstock.com. It'll be easy to slide the barstools under the table. Great space saver ;)", 
    "After conducting a lot of research, I bought this product because I have no space for a conventional kitchen/dining room table. It fits perfectly into the small space that I have allocated for an eating space and looks elegant as a console table when not in use for dining. It matches my decor perfectly. I live alone and do not cook/entertain that often, so this table's dual purpose is greatly appreciated. I loved the fact that the table came completely assembled. I would certainly recommend this table to anyone who has very limited dining space. I couldn't be happier with my purchase !!", 
    "It converts into a smaller piece of furniture very easily. It's been really helpful for entertainment and then shrinking up next to a wall.", 
    "Great table. Exactly what I need for my newly renovated apartment. Thank you OS.", 
    "I eagerly waited 12 days for delivery, and knew something was wrong the minute I opened the box and several screws and spacers fell out. One leaf of the table had somehow pulled off. The leaves were bashed in on the corners. Packing material was random -- styrofoam was on the OUTSIDE of the box, and almost no packing inside. The packing material was clearly not designed for this item. As for the quality of the table itself, the design is nice, but the legs and central table piece are black matte metal, which had rusted and dented in many places. Even if the table wasn't damaged, the quality of the metal and the way in which the two leaves are attached would have quickly resulted in damage with normal wear/tear for a table that is supposedly designed to have those leaves raised and lowered on a regular basis.", 
    "I just purchased this product and i'm in love with it. Serves exactly for what i needed.", 
    "If you are in a small or multiuse space and in need of a collapsible table that can work equally well as a dining table ( fully open), a console table/breakfast bar ( half open) or can be folded flat for storage then this table is a lifesaver. It's great that it comes fully assembled and folded flat, ready to use right out of the box. There are two caveats though: 1) It's made of metal and a smooth, woodgrain like surface that is not real wood. This is perfect if you are going for a modern look or using it in a home office or corporate space. However it probably will not work with more traditional d\u00e9cor. I wanted this look so I selected the charcoal, the espresso might go a little better with traditional furniture. 2) While it folds down to nothing it is quite heavy because of the metal frame. So I wouldn't count on moving it around frequently and there is a good chance it might come to you damaged in shipping because of the weight ( the FedEx guy was really struggling to maneuver it). Mine came undamaged. This table is not supposed to have scuffs or scratches and I guess you should return it if yours is damaged in shipping. The vendor seems to have done what they can and there is lots of Styrofoam padding but the box itself had dents and holes I assume because the delivery guys had to drag it.", 
    "This was my first order with Overstock, and I had a fabulous experience. Thanks to everyone for your product reviews. Upon arrival, one of the levelers (guess that's the right part name) was cracked. I called customer service on a Sunday and received a new part via priority mail on Thursday!! The customer representatives were more than helpful and let me know that they were tracking down a new part. I'm already a loyal customer. Thanks again for all of your help! The table is perfect for my needs!!", 
    "This is a great table for the price. Great for small spaces!", 
    "I love this table! It fits my needs perfectly. I have a nice sized apartment but my living/dining room are a shared space and my former glass top dining table just took up too much walking around room. This table can actually seat 2 more people Than my other table! I am very happy!", 
    "First table arrived damaged. Second one was fine. Living in a small apartment this is the best choice! It folds flat and goes behind my couch so it is very narrow and works like a shelf behind couch to display small items. The reason I gave it 3 stars is function. Once folded it doesn't stand up at all and it's pretty heavy. I am a young and strong woman but I struggle to set it up since I have to move it from behind my couch and open up at least one leaf so it will stand on it's own. I recommend 2 people to set it up. Also leaves being so big and heavy you can not use it a lot. They are held on by some flmzy screws that are not strong enough for everyday use. This table works fine for me as I set it up twice a year but if you plan on using it more often I do not recommend. It will never hold up.", 
    "I loved this table, but twice it was shipped to me damaged. I now have a damaged table, but it still serves its purpose. This table must have been damaged in the factory because it was packaged and wrapped very well.", 
    "This table is great since it can completely fold up and I can slide it behind my couch until needed for big occasions. Will seat 4 when opened.", 
    "Great product. My only complaint: the black finish on the metal frame looked smudged, as if it came in contact with something while it was still wet. I wouldn't care so much, except that it's the part between the two leaves that is really obvious. Still, there is no other table like it on the market that's suitable for a small condo like mine.", 
    "the description said grey...so, I thought the table all grey but, it is only on the top grey...this works for me, but the next buyer should know that the table is black and grey... this is soooo perfect for my small apartment", 
    "I bought this for for function, downsized from a table that seats 10-12. This fits a small space perfectly .", 
    "Wish it was a bit higher but it's so gorgeous. I don't have much space so dropping one leaf or folding it down is a great option. Oh also it's a solid table.", 
    "This table is just as presented. It has a sturdy metal frame and two wood leafs that fold up to become a sofa table with one leaf or a small dining or crafting table with both leafs up. It is very narrow when folded down and will store behind your sofa or te back of a closet. Handy to have and well made for the price. Unfortunately, although well packaged, mine arrive with a dent in one of the leaf panels, I'm told the item is no longer in stock and they couldn't send me a new leaf. They did give me some credit toward future purchases, though, but honestly I would rather have had a repair. It would have been a four if not for the damage.", 
    "The table arrived very quickly - less than 6 days. It came already assembled (folded down) - and packed extremely well. All I had to do was un-package it and slide out the two extension legs and DONE. My table had no flaws on it whatsoever. The table top had not one scratch or ding or chip. The metal leg frame is sturdy metal painted with a semi-glass paint. I didn't see any hint of rust anywhere. I can't even imagine how rust could even develop unless the table was kept outside in the rain for a month or two. Either these are all cheaply made flimsy damaged tables of which I happened to receive one of the odd well put together copy, or ...???The table has a good weight to it. So when fully extended as a full table - it sits very stable. The extended tabletop leaves sit very level and stable on the two leg extensions. No wobble or sag.I had three guests over on Super Bowl Sunday and the four of us sat comfortably over dinner.A very well designed and smart looking little table. And the price can't be beat. I hope Overstock restocks them so that I can buy a second one.", 
    "-It makes a nice decorative side table, but is very short for a table.-It's pretty sturdily built-One of the seams at the end has no paint on it which makes it sort of an eye sore when the rest of the table is espresso-It arrived completely covered in a mix of strange plastic fibers and dust. It was covered top to bottom even the underside of the table.-I have yet to use it as a table, because I dont have any seats short enough, but I eventually will. It looks great as a side table or shelf the legs are configured uniquely when the table is only half raised.-Using it lengthwise like the picture leaves the legs of the table directly between your legs which is awkward. It seems more ergonomic to use the table perpendicular to the way the picture displays it above.Overall it's not too bad I guess", 
    "Here the BAD: I was disappointed to see a big, ugly dent at the end of the metal center piece on the table top. This doesn't affect the functionality of the table, but it is darn UGLY. And one section of the wood table doesn't sit flush with the metal part, so a plate would wobble if placed on that section. Visually, the table looks poorly made and on the cheap side. I know $*** is not a lot of money, but geez, I didn't expect to see a big dent and uneven table top... Just like another reviewer said, the table was packed VERY well, so the damage to the metal wasn't caused by the shipper (FedEx). Here is the GOOD: Love that the table came fully assembled! Just removed it from the shipping box, opened the leafs and voila....a table. Love the clever, simple, design...just like the product description said, you can have the table fully open, half open, or closed. It is VERY easy to open and close the 2 leafs. The table is a tad heavy because of the metal \"skeleton,\" but it is still very easy to move around, since it is so sturdy. Visually, the table looks cheap, but when you touch it, put pressure on it, move it around...you can feel how sturdy it is, due to the metal skeleton. If I could exchange this table at a real store for an undamaged table, I would. But since I don't want to go through the work to ship it back and since it is an awesome design and size, I'll keep it. I'm going to try to fix the big dent in the metal by pounding it down with a hammer and then hopefully find a matching paint color. For the unevenness of the wood with the metal, I'm going to try adjusting the metal brackets that join the 2 pieces together...", 
    "As other reviewers have said, this is a perfect table if you are low on space. It looks great, but the middle section is metal, which I didn't know prior to buying. It's not a bad thing, but just means that the table is heavier than you might think. It opens up nicely to a good size table that fits 4 comfortably. Otherwise, it is a great small table for 2 or so. I would recommend!", 
    "Table arrived in a timely manner, usual with \"O\" orders, and packaging was fine. The table is very well constructed so I gave it five stars. However, the only issue I have is it was much heavier than I thought and not what I had in mind. I needed a table for my guest cottage that could be pulled away several feet from the wall and popped up for meals. Not this one. The style and structure is perfect for such use, but It's way too heavy and should be used so that it does not have to be moved much. All is not lost though, my daughter is taking it,", 
    "I was so excited when I received my order. So modern and sleek. I love to combine high-end items and great finds like this!! People think I paid a million bucks!", 
    "No frills here and that's ok. The table sets up and takes down in a snap, is versatile to turn into a 'desk' and is decently made. I recommend it.", 
    "Great for apartment living. Seats 4!!!!!!", 
    "Love it love it love it. Looks awesome! I've already had it up in fully opened then closed against the wall and back up to full table. it worked and moved very easily", 
    "Love it! Great for smaller spaces but big enough to fit 6 around it if needed.", 
    "This is a perfect table for a smaller dining area. It is well constructed and comes assembled. It is sturdy and doesn't wobble, but the top and legs are not as thick as a regular table. I love that it's easy to move and can fold down to a very small size for convenience.", 
    "Eu sei que isto \u00e9 uma mesa, mas eu realmente us\u00e1-lo como uma tabela quando voc\u00ea caminhada na casa para colocar rapidamente as chaves e outras coisas de dist\u00e2ncia. Eu desejo que poderia teve gavetas , mas ent\u00e3o seria funcional desde que ambos os lados v\u00eam para baixo para armazenamento ou que nunca mais voc\u00ea quer fazer para", 
    "The table has a solid, beautiful finish. The style and space saving construction are superb. Do know that it does not stand alone when both leaves are down. Can't say enough about it'simplistic beauty and design. Martha", 
    "This table was delivered today, I am extremely happy with it. It was delivered fully assembled (always a plus), it's very heavy and stable for it's size. A good sturdy table!", 
    "Folded the flap will make noise if the floor is vibrating (I have wooden floors and walk quickly) easy fix with little plastic drawer dampers. Functional easy to clean can seat 8!", 
    "I love this table because it doesn't take up much space, particularly when closed.It is also beautiful and looks elegant with the white leather chairs I selected to offset the dark table. Great price and nice, sturdy table.", 
    "Love this table. Very contemporary and fits snugly against a wall untill needed.", 
    "I love this table but it came with a large chunk out and a scratch. I am lazy, so I don't return. Would love this table in good condition", 
    "This inexpensive table is pretty flimsy and we couldn't get the screws aligned to stabilize one side. It will serve the purpose for a while, until l find something a little more substantial. It will fold away nicely and be handy to use for big gatherings, I suppose.", 
    "Perfect for a dining table that will only be used for that purpose a few times a year and the rest of the time it's a sleek looking sofa table that holds a lamp, a plant and some family photos. Great buy for the price.", 
    "Absolutely love it!!! I have been looking everywhere for a table like this. The table was packaged extremely well and arrived in perfect condition. It is a beautiful table and you can't beat the functionality. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "love that it folded! Beautiful!", 
    "Another hit. Perfect table for my small apartment. Right now, I'm using as a console table. When I have guests, I'll open it as a dining table. It's strong, sturdy and very attractive. Exactly what I was looking for and wanted. I bought the espresso color one", 
    "This piece is perfect for entertaining. It is a beautiful piece when the leaf is down and serves as a perfect extension for parties. I will buy another.", 
    "This is the third time Overstock has requested a review. They must think I am going to change it. I am happy with the table after I went to '**** *****' and bought a nut and screw to repair the movable leg. The tables leg screw came un-done and the nut was missing. It was not in the box. The '**** *****' person couldn't find a nut to fit the screw. So I bought a new screw and nut. Table works fine now. Looks great. It's more than what I wanted but still a big pain in the butt. I should have sent it back just to be difficult; but that's not my nature.", 
    "This table was purchased for a new home with a multi-purpose eating area. It is well-constructed with a metal frame and attractive leaves that clean easily. It sits beautifully yet compactly as a console table, and quickly converts to seating for 2 or 4 people comfortably. I especially like the large thumb leveling screws on the table legs, since moving it into differently positions creates no problem with variations in floor level.", 
    "This table was a great find. Because of a challenging space configuration, I needed a drop leaf that dropped on the long side rather than on the ends and this table fits the bill perfectly. It is a good, sturdy quality and raising and lowering the leaf couldn't be easier. Nice, rich, espresso brown color. Love it.", 
    "Great table when you want to place it against the wall with one leaf open most of the time yet want to open it up completely when you have a need to seat people or work on a craft project/puzzle/sew etc.I have placed in in my office. I occasionally need to spread a project out.I bought the espresso color, and it's a very dark brown. It is heavier than it looks, so if you are not strong, you may want to have someone with you to help you unpack the table and stand it up in place.Nothing to assemble!! First one was damaged in transportation and Overstock was very customer focused and sent a replacement. This second one was perfect.", 
    "This table was perfect for my apartment. It also gave me more space in my kitchen and now my kitchen doesn't look super crowded. This table also matched the chairs that I bought. What I love about this table is that you can expanded it to make it bigger when you have family over and easy to put it back together. Simple furniture.", 
    "I was waiting for months to purchase this product and it finally was re-stocked! This is such an amazing and unique dining table. I'm impressed by the quality, style and versatility of it. The color is exactly like the photos online and it is very sturdy. I use it as a console table most of the time and when I have guests over for dinner, I use it as a dining table. THIS IS A GREAT PURCHASE! DON'T HESITATE TO BUY IT; YOU WON'T REGRET IT!", 
    "It took us several weeks to buy tis product because it kept selling out and now we know why. It's the perfect table for a small apartment since it doesn't take up much room with the dropleaf down, but it can be opened up to sit 4-5 dinner guest. We were thrilled with the product, with the exception of a small scratch that we didn't notice until we put it together. We decided not to bother exchanging it for a non damaged one and really enjoy this versatile and attractive table.", 
    "I needed a table I could use for dining, but which wouldn't take up all my space. This table fits the need perfectly. When I have people over, six adults can eat. When not being used for dining, the table serves as a sideboard. The table is super easy to move, close, and open. It arrived packed well, but did have one minor \"scratch\" on the top. Actually the finish wasn't scratched, but the wood was marred/indented slightly. As I always have a table cloth of sorts on it I wasn't bothered, and you really have to look to see it anyway. Overall, I'm very happy with this table. I wasn't able to find any other table that was a flexible for anywhere close to the cost of this one. It isn't \"high end\" furniture, but it is super functional, sturdy enough to last, looks nice, and provides very good value for the money. I would buy it again and would definiitely recommend it to others.", 
    "NOT MUCH ROOM IN THE SHOE BOX CALLED APARTMENT. NOW IN A BIGGER SPACE BUT KEPT THE TABLE, STILL LOOKING SEXY AND STYLISH....", 
    "Would have rated this as Excellent were it not for the \"ding\" (tiny piece of wood broken off during transit)Nevertheless, it suits my small space NY apartment very well and the table arrived promptly.", 
    "Very large and heavy and difficult to handle. I would not order again. I thought I could use it in my sewing room for cutting.", 
    "This table is amazing for an apartment sized dining room. I love how it collapses and it was so easy to put together. The color is true to the image. Couldn't be happier!", 
    "Very nice table to have since it is very versatile, you can fold it against wall until it's needed. Very easy to set up. Perfect for our office area with limited space.", 
    "Love it and use it all the time as a buffet table 1/2 open or full sometimes against the island in the kitchen when guests arrive. Otherwise, It rests behind the sofa and can be pulled open to have a meal. In the 4\" mode the table stands on it's own but not very sturdy. Needs to rest against something for stability especially if you have kids or animals that will bump into it. Yes, for my needs in my loft space it is perfect and a good price. It was packed well and arrived flawless and with a little wood polish every now and then it looks great. I read the negative reviews and quite honestly I did not experience their complainants. I would recommend to a friend (even though I want to keep it uniquely mine among friends)..", 
    "From the photo the item looks immaculate! boyy were we in for a surprise....the table was flimsy, cheap and to top it off it was damaged with scuffs, scratches and wear. The MOST \"distinct\" scratches were covered & \"repaired\" by markers. -____- Called and I should be expecting a refund (although, what disappointed me most-they tried to claim FedEx was at fault when in fact it was the manufacturer's). Don't be fooled by this product, you can definitely find something online for better quality. The concept and size is PERFECT, material and quality-complete failllll.", 
    "STRONG BUT UGLY, I did not like", 
    "I wanted to replace a lightweight drop leaf table that we use folded as well as extended. This table cannot be used unless at least one leaf is extended, otherwise table will fall over. It is long and heavy. It can easily seat six; I will have to keep shopping.", 
    "it arrived damaged. overstock handled a refund very smoothly and quickly. however, even in good condition, it's not a good table. definitely don't recommend it.", 
    "This table came complete with a nice 1-2 inch scratch right in the middle of it. Also, the photo makes it look like it could comfortably sit 2 chairs at the ends but there would be a bar between your legs and you would be too far apart. There is a little space between the middle bar on the table top and the 2 wood panels too. I'm a bit disappointed; I don't think I will be ordering anything expensive from this site again.", 
    "This is the absolute perfect console table turned dining table. You could definitely fit 4 people very comfortably and up to 6 people at this table. The table was delivered collapsed in a flat box but completely assembled-so no assembly required. The quality of table is very good-it is sturdy and wood and overall look is nice and modern appeal; I was afraid the wood look cheap or distressed but it is even better than photo. I leave it folded as a console table on one wall and it looks fabulous. LOVE the flexibilitye and you cannot beat the price; it is a steal deal.", 
    "I would have given an additional star if the table had been delivered smoothly. The packaging styrofoam MELTED onto the black metal in the middle of the table and so it was basically useless. Overstock has been great and has refunded me right away. I am not sure if I will re-order it though because it didnt seem very sturdy. It seemed liked a great deal though for a dining table that you didnt need to assemble + it was a good size for my city apartment.", 
    "all four corners are really esay to bent and shaking when putting dishes on it."
