    "It is just like the picture and quite attractive as an end table or chair side table. It's a little on the small side to be a nightstand, though, in my opinion. The finish is nice and glossy and the base is oh so elegant! Easy to assemble as well.", 
    "These are really nice. I have 2. They are much bigger than I thought they would be. Gorgeous accent pieces", 
    "I am not sure this is the quality that the description provides. Piece is heavy and steady on its base, but not made of solid wood. Not sure what the other materials are, but there are areas where the material looks like some kind of putty filler or plastic material and is painted over-- looks great, but definitely poor materials were used here.", 
    "Base came cracked on the bottom and it wobbles a bit but we fixed that. It is just perfect for our space and I didn't want to send it back.", 
    "I'm so pleased with the size and quality of this side table! It is very heavy, has just a bit of distressing (but not too much), and makes a perfect accent piece where I needed to create a warm and welcoming reading nook in my bedroom.", 
    "Gave to my daughter for their study and it looks good.", 
    "Solid and sturdy construction, easy to put table to base and heavy. Great and elegant and so happy I bough it. Has textures of dark mahogany and black."
