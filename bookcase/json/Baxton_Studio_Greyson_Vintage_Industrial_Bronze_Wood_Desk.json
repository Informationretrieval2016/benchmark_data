    "I looked at quite a few other desks on Overstock and other sites, and decided on this on, since its just for a computer room and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I typically would look over the reviews, but there weren't any, so I took a chance and ordered it anyways. The box says \"dining room table\" and I feared I had ordered the wrong table. After I opened it, I realized I had the right table. The table top is really cheap looking. It reminds me of really bad 70s wall paneling. I was hoping for a more vintage look as the description stated. This is not it. I also had a hard time lining up the screws with the metal legs and other pieces. I would most definitely be sending this back if the returns were free or at low cost. The table top is pretty heavy, so I'm sure it would be a hefty return cost. This will most likely end up in my basement. Im really disappointed, but I suppose I learned the lesson of \"you get what you pay for\".", 
    "it would be perfect if the shipment package is better so the corner of the table wont be dented. We ordered two as home office tables, they are not exactly the same dimension when we put them side by side, and the assemble process could be hard for people who is not handy because the measurement of the parts to parts is a little off. And it does smells for few days. After all, i still love the tables because i feel it is sturdy enough and it look exactly like the picture.", 
    "We purchased 6 of these and every one of them was damaged upon delivery!The packaging is not secure enough to keep these from being damaged in transit.Disappointing.", 
    "Was able to assemble in less than 30 minutes, so far this desk seems to be holding up. Since the top/slab of wood is made out of mdf it does have a slight chemically smell but other than that its a great desk!", 
    "Great products and amazing customer service!", 
    "I really like the industrial feel of the table with the metal legs and frame. My only gripe is that all the corners were slightly damaged. Overall, it is a nice simple and attractive table."
