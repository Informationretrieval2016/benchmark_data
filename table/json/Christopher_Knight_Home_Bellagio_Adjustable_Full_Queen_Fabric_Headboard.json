    "I couldn't be happier with this headboard. First of all the quality is amazing, especially for the price. The fabric is a heavy linen look. The nail heads are large, about 5/8\" diameter in bronze. It is beautifully upholstered. But what I was really impressed with is that the back of the headboard where the legs attach is recessed so that even though it has legs the headboard fits flat against the wall.", 
    "We were pleasantly surprised on the quality, the color and everything about this headboard. We LOVE it! We would absolutely recommend purchasing this.", 
    "We ordered this headboard for our guest bedroom and it absolutely met our expectations. Instructions for assembly were clear, and my husband put it together quickly. I was worried that for such a low price the fabric might be cheap looking or rough feeling, but it really is quite high quality!", 
    "I would have given it a 5 star rating, IF the legs had been a similar color to the headboard. Being black, they really stand out!At some point, I will likely remove them and spray paint them.Super easy assembly, nice quality, color exactly as shown, no complaints!", 
    "The headboard took about a week for delivery. It was easy to put together, looks very nice, and was a great price. It's exactly what I wanted and after shopping for a headboard for a while, I'm glad I picked this one. I would definitely recommend.", 
    "I adore this headboard! I love all the details of it - from the nailhead finish to the scallop shape. I purchased it not quite sure if it would fix perfectly on my standard queen sized bed, but the legs of it are adjustable and fit either a full or queen size bed nicely. It really gives my room a luxurious feel and was a great price too!", 
    "Excellent - love it - well made - easy to install - just what I was looking for.", 
    "Love it! Great fabric & color. Also, it was easy to mount.", 
    "For the price it was good and simple to put together. It gave the room a really nice face lift.", 
    "Receive so many compliments on headboard! Love this item!", 
    "When I purchased I really wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. It's beautiful and I got it for a great price. I would recommend it.", 
    "very nice and looks great in the room not to fancy and not to plain", 
    "Ordered this for Mom. Wasn't sure about the velvet, thought it might be too much - but it is very nice.", 
    "Well made, easy to install, I did paint the metal brown metal legs to match wall before installing. Other than that, I am very satisfied.", 
    "I was skeptical about buying online from just a picture, but the actual product is very nice, and it makes my room look inviting. I am very pleased with this purchase, and the customer service help I received after forgetting to put my coupon code was fabulous as well. The price was too good to pass up!", 
    "The assembly instructions could use some improvement but were easy enough to figure out. The headboard itself is very nice, but it is much smaller than I imagined based on the picture. Very pleased with my purchase overall.", 
    "This headboard is worth the price. The color and texture are exactly what I expected both to be and it matches with the rest of my bedroom decor. I panicked for a brief moment while setting it up according to the instructions outlined on the sheet of paper - the poles were marked 'left' and 'right' - and after attaching the left side to the bed rail, about 4 inches of space jutted out from the right side, way past the hole in the bed rail. Then I realized that the written instructions for 'left pole' and 'right pole' did not conform to the direction the bed was positioned in. So after unscrewing and reversing the process, I was able to attach both poles to the bed rail and my bed was complete! I highly recommend this headboard.", 
    "Came in on time. Seems durable and great for my guest bedroom considering I have a full bed", 
    "Nice headboard. For the price it is a good quality piece that we would definitely purchase again.", 
    "The headboard was easily assembled. The texture and color are very pleasing. It looks fabulous against our chocolate accent wall!", 
    "Very nice headboard. Well made.", 
    "looks very nice in my bedroom. good quality, nice price", 
    "The height on this is adjustable but it is only for the visible portion of the headboard with metal legs holding it up. To get the look in the photo the bottom of the headboard basically touches the top of the mattress so there is a gap there when sleeping. We use ours in our guest room so its not a major problem for us, and it makes a great first impression. We added a mattress topper to close the gap. Very sophisticated for a great price. Just what we needed for our queen bed.", 
    "Love this headboard. Very good quality.", 
    "Very nice headboard, especially for the price! The holes on the supports didn't quite line up with our bed, but we drilled holes to make it work. The canvas is beautiful, although slightly darker than as it appears in the pictures. Definitely would recommend.", 
    "This a heavy and beautifully constructed headboard,, I love the feel of the velvet I bought it in the golf creamy color ..It blends and adds a sense of immediate elegance", 
    "I ordered this for my new house and am very satisfied with the product. It is exactly what was advertised and looks wonderful in my bedroom.", 
    "The shape of this headboard is great, but it is a dark beige/gold and super shiny. It's not what we were hoping for.", 
    "This headboard is in my guest bedroom and looks great. Looks better than I expected it to look for the price.", 
    "The fabric and studs are very durable and looks great", 
    "This headboard arrived exactly as promised. Easy to assemble. Love it!", 
    "This headboard was just right for my sons room. It looks so much better in person", 
    "Very nice, easy to put together (says it takes 2 but I did it by myself w/ no trouble). Looks more expensive than it cost. Color me happy.", 
    "It was just what we were looking for!", 
    "Very nice, and fits so well with other bedroom items I got, matches color scheme perfectly.", 
    "Looks great, well made except the part that adjust to my bed need a little more support. I like it.", 
    "Looked great in my daughter's room! Very nice, especially for the price!", 
    "This headboard was a great find for the money. Very easy to put together on existing bedframe. The color is great, a true champagne color and the fabric is soft. I would recommend this, looks and feels wonderful.", 
    "Beautiful detailing....studs add a bit of elegance. This was a christmas gift for my daughter, which she loved!", 
    "Arrived as expected except for a couple of bolts which had to be hunted down and purchased. A good value compared to other headboards. It looks elegant", 
    "I ordered this headboard for my sister. She loves it. Now her bedroom looks complete!", 
    "This headboard is wonderful for the money! Just as it looks in the photo....a little darker in person. The only downside is the bed frame is wobbly....going to add additional hardware to the back and hope for the best! :)", 
    "Was delivered on time. Easy to assemble and attach to bed frame. You can adjust the height of the headboard. If you have a pillow-top and it needs to be higher you can adjust it easily. What a great price for this piece of furniture.", 
    "Like the looks of the headboard, but it arrived with no hardware with which to assemble it (neither pack A nor pack B). So I'm waiting for that shipment and then I'll let you know what I think! Disappointed that it was not a complete shipment.", 
    "This headboard looks quite elegant. It was easy to put together but we had a little trouble attaching it to the bed frame. The screws it came with were not long enough. No problem after we purchased the right kind.", 
    "Love love love this headboard - easy to assemble and connect to the bedframe. Love the plush look and feel of the velvet.", 
    "Love this. Would absolutely buy again.", 
    "I've been looking everywhere for a headboard and finally found one to meet my needs and budget. I got luck and got one of overstocks door buster sales and got this thing half price!! And free shipping I was sold. This this is beautiful. It's sturdy and the material looks like it will last a long time. I love the deep inset of the studs. The colors a nice medium caramel brown color. Kinda burlapy. It was the perfect neutral color I was looking for since I change my bedding a lot. Goes with a lot of different colors. Very happy with my purchase!!! :-)", 
    "Beautiful quality. Looks better than the picture.", 
    "It's exactly like it is in the picture!Easy to assemble an well made.", 
    "It is a nice neutral color. The headboard went together easily with basic tools.", 
    "Very classy looking and perfect color. The price was good too.", 
    "This headboard is so elegant!! I have the Velvet beige color and it looks so much better in person!", 
    "nice headboard and a great bargain. well made", 
    "We love our new headboard. Excellent buy for the price!", 
    "Very happy with this headboard. Exactly as described and pictured. Great price compared to local stores. Quality too.", 
    "Headboard with just the rails isn't as stable as I would like for it to be.", 
    "This bed looks way more expensive than it is. It was delivered quickly and on sale for a great price. My only issue is that the hardware to connect the bed to the frame was too large to fit through the hole. It was easy after a quick trip to my local home improvement store. Happy with the purchase.", 
    "The posts were not wide enough for my queen size bed. I will have to get someone to attached a wooden brace and attach it that way. I think this one is really for a full size bed only,", 
    "I was so impressed when I opened the box. I couldn't believe the quality and how well made this headboard is for the price. First it arrived in excellent condition and was very easy to unpack. The color is true to picture and even more so in person. The stitching, padding and nail heads are of excellent quality. Attachments for the assembly is easy and very well made. This will have me coming back to the Christopher Knight Home collection.", 
    "It completed my room beautifully , love it.", 
    "Very happy with this headboard. Bought it for guest room. It is very stylish. The directions were accurate, all hardware was included and the tools to install. It was packaged very well. Would definitely reccommend.", 
    "Absolutely love this headboard! It really updated our bedroom. It's very well made ! Don't hesitate to buy this if you like it!", 
    "will buy again.........................", 
    "Headboard is great for the price. I also bought the matching storage bench and they look very nice in my bedroom.", 
    "Absolutely beautiful. Lots of care with details. Curved frame, padded, and made to last.", 
    "What a great headboard for the money!", 
    "The quality of this upholstered exceeds my expectations, great value too!", 
    "Matches with the HomePop Nailhead storage bench and signature Ashley Caron lamps. They all blend really well together. Elegant together.", 
    "For this price, what an amazing quality headboard! I was thrilled with the shipping process in that it was delivered right to my 3rd story apartment door. I was so glad to see that all of the required materials were packaged so neatly and were all included. I would recommend this headboard to anyone on the hunt for one. Looks great on my Queen sized bed. The material and the studs look like great quality.", 
    "I thought it would attach with the proper screens, now I find myself search high and low for a way to attach it to my bed. such a hassle.", 
    "Love the headboard. But, a mis-aligned drilled hole with metal screw socket insert required extra work with a dremel tool to get the bolts attached to the headboard. Now that it's together, I love it.", 
    "My husband and I both tried to make this head board feel sturdy with no avail. It looks like but I wouldn't buy this again.", 
    "Second headboard needed, perfect fit!", 
    "The headboard itself is ok. The fabric is nice but was untucked under one of the studs. However, when you attach the cheap metal legs to the bed frame, it is very wobbly. When you get in and out of the bed it shakes and makes a creaky noise. I will be replacing with something much more sturdy. Not happy at all with this purchase.", 
    "Great, couldn't be more satisfied, and it went well putting it together. Accurate image, like it even better in person.", 
    "This head board is wonderful for the price! I am very happy with the color and craftsmanship. I have received many compliments on it. The velvet is soft and makes it look very expensive. Love it.", 
    "Looks exactly like pictured. Very nice quality. Adds character to my bedroom. Very easy to assemble. Love it!", 
    "Great product! I'm very satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "Very nice headboard and well made. Really happy with this purchase!", 
    "I bought this headboard for a guest room. The quality of the fabric is good and the nail head trim is even, but the overall headboard doesn't have a nice finished appearance. Either the headboard wasn't padded enough, or the fabric was stretched unevenly before it was secured, because the seams are \"off\" and wavy. The other big drawback to this headboard is that the fabric doesn't cover the legs, something I just didn't pay attention to when I ordered it. I had planned to use an open shelf table on one side of the bed, so the exposed metal frame was glaring. I'll either recover this headboard (and the legs) or replace it.", 
    "I am thrilled that I purchased this headboard, I will say it is smaller than the picture shows though.", 
    "I purchased this headboard for a guest bedroom. The headboard did arrive and looks just a pictured, but I happen to have a smaller, glass top nightstand beside the bed, so the lower part of the headboard is exposed. The fabric part only goes down so far (as pictured) but below that point are metal arms that connect to the bed frame. Not exactly the elegant look I was going for, but you can't beat the price on Overstock. It is well made and sturdy. A good value. Just make sure you can cover the lower half. :-)", 
    "I absolutely love this headboard, we have had it a few months now and we got it for such a great price!! Its adjustable and it's just what we needed to make our bed look nice. Well this and our comforter set.", 
    "This has added so much charm to our guest bedroom. Its sturdy and was very easy to assemble.", 
    "This item was a great addition and terrific birthday present. Very nice piece of furniture.", 
    "Love the classic look ! Highly recommend", 
    "someones greasy fingerprint is on my headboard. tell me how to fix it or ill complain to manufacturer....", 
    "Love the look of this headboard. It didn't come with enough mounting hardware which was disappointing.", 
    "Looks even better in person", 
    "I ordered and have been using this headboard for several monthsnow. It worked out perfect and have had many compliments on it.THANKS!!", 
    "We did have some challenges hooking this up to our bed, but they may have been caused by user error. The headboard is very nice and is a good compliment to the bedding.", 
    "I purchased this and my boyfriend assembled it. It was an easy assembly and the only drawback is that it is not too sturdy, but I think that it is due to my bed frame. Color is exact as the one shown and value is utmost.", 
    "I bought this after shopping and comparing, It is well made and the price was very good,", 
    "Nice headboard didn't like the fact that it doesn't quite match up to the rails nor the fact that it isn't as dramatic in size (height) that id like but I did keep it I'm sure I'll switch it out in a year or two but it's perfect for a guest room bed.", 
    "There is a spot where the velvet is brushed the other way and it won't go away. For the price, it's pretty and decent quality.", 
    "Great buy and very pretty", 
    "Great quality, sturdy fabric, strong adjustable legs, easy to install,", 
    "We received the headboard very quickly. Condition from shipping was excellent. From a distance the quality is very nice. It's sturdy and well made for the price. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that up close there are quality control problems. At the top of the headboard, the pleat does not line up. For very detailed people, this will be an issue. But, since this was for a guest bedroom it wasn't worth my time and effort to return. The second problem was that it did not come with the screws to assemble it, even though the instructions stated that the screws were part of the shipment. I called customer service and they shipped the screws out immediately and I got them in a couple of days.", 
    "This headboard enhances room and was easy to install. Delivered right to my door in perfect condition.", 
    "Looks a lot more expensive than it costs. Neatly finished and sturdy. Easy to attach to standard metal bed frame. Height is adjustable.", 
    "Beautiful headboard for my guest room. arrived well packaged. Directions were reversed for a queen bed, had to play around with the post positioning due to the bad directions. I would have given this 5 stars but i am disappointed in the quality of the fabric. Fabric is a cheap looking velvet material, NOT tan, more of a yellow tan. Studded edges are not well done, some nail heads are sticking out of the headboard. I would have returned this but I was expecting guests and needed something.", 
    "Very happy with the headboard. Easy to put together and looks great!", 
    "Very happy with this headboard. After doing a lot of comparisons, this definitely looks more expensive then what I paid. Easy installation, good quality!", 
    "I love this headboard. It is very stylish and sturdy. Easy to put together.", 
    "I love this headboard! Very pleased with my purchase. The fabric has more of a sheen to it than it appears in the photo, but it works perfectly in my bedroom.", 
    "I was very happy with the quality of this piece. It was not difficult to attach to the bed frame. It's very sturdy. I would buy again.", 
    "This headboard is a really good bargain. My 12 year old and I put it together very quickly and installed it on a metal bed frame. Easy. It looks classy. The back is not finished- covered in black mesh type fabric that looks professional and secure. Mine is against the wall so the back doesn't matter. I like that the height can easily be adjusted as my mattress is a 16\" pillow top. I was initially worried that the whole thing would be hidden by my thick mattress, but it turned out not to be an issue at all.", 
    "It is good for the price I paid. The directions leave a little to be desired, but we persevered and attached the legs then the legs to the bed rail. There is no way to tighten the legs enough so that the upper part of the headboard isn't somewhat loose. We are going to put bracing on it if we can figure out how to do it. I really like the look of the headboard, and I think it looks like a better quality than it probably is. I use it in a spare bedroom.", 
    "i love this headboard ! It has such a nice look. It's well constructed and ties my. End room together so well. Great deal for the price. Found similar products ran almost twice the price.", 
    "I ordered this and have to say it didn't look like the photo. The color is dark dark - dark tan i guess with a green tint to the fabric. Also threads sticking out at the seams. Not good. The seam was crooked too. Not everywhere but in the corner so it was visible and sloppy.", 
    "This headboard was easy to attach and good quality. I am very pleased with my purchase and have had nothing but good luck with orders from Overstock! I recommend shopping on this website.", 
    "Beautiful headboard and easy to put together.", 
    "Really like the look of this headboard. Matched the picture and the description.", 
    "I do wish this was a little taller.", 
    "Quality fabric, well finished, sturdy construction, and all the screws were included with a handy wrench. Easy squeezy. It is heavy (70#) so I needed help moving it upstairs.", 
    "It was what I needed for a guest bedroom. Looks great and quality is good for the price. I am happy.", 
    "When I first saw the headboard, I was not sure about the color but it is very stylish and my daughter loves it.", 
    "This far surpassed my expectations. As the price was less than most, it was fabulous to find the quality was great. The champagne color was perfect to give a neutral balance to our bedroom decor. The nail heds also are a nice touch. Very pleased with this product! It was adjustable height wise, and easy to attach to our current frame. Hardware came included.", 
    "This is a beautiful piece it is now the main attraction to my bedroom and it adds a touch of glamour but not too girly for my husband he really likes it too and so simple to assemble, I did it by myself in minutes. Delivery was quick surprisingly especially to the last Frontier only took 7 days. Price was reasonable and worth the shipping cost. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "This headboard is a beautiful focus piece for my bedroom. The velvet feel of the material is elegant. The color is one that won't easily show dirt or aging. I love it!", 
    "First of all, this headboard's quality is even cooler than in a picture!! The material is so weird and amazing, its kinda shimmery and velvety!!! Caught me off guard. Our master bedroom is kinda manly, so this adds a perfect touch against our wooden rustic wall. I'd recommend it to anyone! Looks super classy!!!", 
    "Purchased this last year for my parents guest room. The color perfectly matched a beige/tan colored bed spread and has held up well over the past year.", 
    "I purchased this headboard for my bedroom, it is a lovely piece. The creamy velvet color and texture is excellent and the bronze nails make it look so classy. I am very content with this purchase. It arrived quickly and was in excellent shape as it was packaged securely,", 
    "The headboard has enhanced the look of the bedroom. Assembly instructions were not very clear but managed it ok since there weren't too many steps anyways. It is not as soft as I was hoping, and also a bit smaller than what it appears in the pic, but looks good and fits together well with the bed frame, so all in all a good purchase. And great customer service experience with Overstock as always.", 
    "Very pleased with quality and detailing of this headboard! It has a very luxurious look with a very reasonable price! I love it!", 
    "A Beautiful Headboard for the price! Decent quality and was easy to attach to the frame, perfect for a guest room!", 
    "Really upgrades the look of the bed, and went together easily. The only thing I don't care for is that this was purchased for a full-size bed, and the cushioned top protrudes out about 3 inches from the width of the bed on either side. This can be masked with poofy pillows, but wish there would have been an option to purchase a size that truly fit the bed.", 
    "I have looked at the padded headboards for some time now. I found one at a store and was waiting until their October coupon came out. In the meantime, I found this one online. It was less expensive than if I'd waited for the coupon.I bought this for a guest room and it looks so good! I could not ask for a better headboard. Easy to put together and it attaches to the bed frame which makes it much more stable.", 
    "An excellent buy. Quite pleased with the style and quality!", 
    "I love this headboard. It gave my bed just the pick me up it needed. I have my bed in front of a window and it really helps keep the draft away from my head. It was easy to attach to the bed frame.", 
    "I ORDERED 2 OF THESE HEADBOARDS FOR A BEDROOM. THEY WERE EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED AND WORKED GREAT WITH MY BEDROOM. I ESPECIALLY LIKED HOW WELL THEY WERE PACKED WHEN THEY ARRIVED. THEY WERE EASY TO ATTACH TO THE BEDS ALSO. LOVED THE FABRIC THEY CAME IN ALSO. WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND THESE.", 
    "Looks good and fits well in room - slight blemish in fabric, but not really noticeable. Good value", 
    "This headboard turned out beautifully! So easy to put the legs on and looks high quality! Would highly recommend it.", 
    "I purchased this headboard for our queen size platform steel frame bed. Another reviewer mention the headboard didn't fit. We found it slightly bigger than our bed frame so be aware of that. I did have to purchase separately a headboard attachment piece because our platform bed did not come with it. The attachment piece provided enough extension to allow us to attach the headboard to the bed frame. Assembly of the head board was quick and simple. The item was well packaged by Overstock and it was shipped in a timely manner (considering all the bad weather in our region) The head board itself is a stylish and quality piece (sufficient foam padding). We bought the Champagne Velvet, the soft material gives the head board a luxurious look and feel and the gold studded accent matched our bedroom furniture to a T. The price above all makes this such a great deal. I found comparable to other headboard frames twice the price elsewhere.", 
    "I love this headboard and thinks it looks way more expensive than it really is! Glad I bought it!", 
    "I adore this headboard, and for the price, you can't go wrong. However, it does not fit my bed frame. I have it propped between my bed and the wall so it stays in place but disappointing that it doesn't fit the dimensions of a queen size bed frame. Though everything else about it so modern and fashionable. I would certainly recommend it but be prepared if your bed frame isn't a match."
