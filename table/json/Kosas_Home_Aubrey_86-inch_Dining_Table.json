    "The table is even more gorgeous in person! This table arrived quickly and in good condition. It was packed really well in three boxes. No instructions needed. Only four major pieces to attach. We were shy one screw but I'll call and get it sent. I put orange oil on the table to shine it up and remove and residual dust from shipping. I love it!"
