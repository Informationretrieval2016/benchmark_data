    "Good looking chairs, very true to the provided picture. Extremely simple to assemble as well.", 
    "These chairs were delivered in just a few days. I do like the print and the colors. But, when putting them together the legs were not even or level. We had to make adjustments and add spacers to the legs.", 
    "Exactly what I hoped for. Couldn't be more pleased.", 
    "Easy to assemble arrived really fast! thanks", 
    "Simple, attractive and comfortable chairs. Fabric and design are great, tool less than 10 minutes to put together and they look and feel terrific. Probably not for you if your BMI is over 30, but great for normal-sized people and kids. A great value and highly functional."
