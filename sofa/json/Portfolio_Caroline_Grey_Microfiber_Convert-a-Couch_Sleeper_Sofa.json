    "Took my husband & son about 1.5 hrs to put together. It looks nice, but is really cheap & not that comfortable. When one person sits on one end, the other end lifts up. When no one is sitting on it it's not flush/straight, it bows in the middle. I can tell over time it will get worse and padding will flatten.", 
    "I had been shopping around for a futon, that didn't look like a futon. Many I had seen didn't make into a full size bed or larger. This does and looks great. I had bought several mid modern furniture pieces and was looking for a futon as a couch for the living room. This futon is would look wonderful in most any decor. I have also slept on it one night and found the futon to be quite comfortable. It is also super easy to convert into the bed and back. I would highly recommend this futon!", 
    "Love my new couch. Very comfortable", 
    "I received this couch in June. Firstly, it took a while to put together and the box is heavy and awkward to maneuver. However, everything you need to put the couch together was in the box, which was convenient. The couch was long and the material was soft and as you would expect. This particular couch also folded down and converted into somewhere around the size of to twin beds. It could fit two adults or about 3 small kids, if you have a lot of family or visitors. Initially, the couch was sturdy, but over a short period of time it began to make noise when you would sit down. Then it just became the opposite of sturdy. When I would try to convert it to a sleeper, the sides would become dislodged from the couch itself and then when you would sit down and fall to the ground with the couch. I would have to fix it every other day. Note, I have only had the couch for around 6 months! For the price, you can definitely do better."
