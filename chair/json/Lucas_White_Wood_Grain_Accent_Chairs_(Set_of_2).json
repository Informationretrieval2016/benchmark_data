    "These chairs are easy to set up, great quality, and inexpensive. We purchased them to replace our old chairs and have done the job perfectly. My husband noted that although they aren't low, the backs don't rise as high as our other chairs but it hasn't been a problem when actually sitting. It's more of an aesthetic thing.", 
    "Legs of the chair were MUCH lighter than in the picture so did not match the legs of the table.", 
    "Bought these to go with my Kosas table love how they compliment and aren't to matcy - they are sturdy easy to clean a must with teenagers.", 
    "chairs are beautiful but too short for a dining room. Probably great in a small apartment kitchen area.", 
    "So Far, I guess they are O.K. I only have them a week or two.", 
    "Great products and amazing customer service!", 
    "This is a lovely piece of furniture. It's light but strong; looks very cheerful.", 
    "Great replicas great price", 
    "These chairs are easy to put together and sturdy! Very happy with this purchase. I am considering getting a few more.", 
    "Great for our dining room. Sturdier than expected and looks much more expensive IMO.", 
    "These chairs are excellent knock offs! Beautiful and a great value for the $.", 
    "I love these chairs, so clean and comfy however they have a very small profile compared to my 1930s wood table. To rectify this I added sheepskin cushions/throws that bulk up the chair and add warmth for the winter. They also add about 2 inches of padding for extra comfort.", 
    "Perfect for our school desks!!", 
    "I'm happy with my purchase, They were easy to put together and I have not had any issues with them feeling flimsy. They're plastic, so they're not so luxurious, but they still look nice.", 
    "Very happy with color, my table will be lowered a few inches or I will need servals pillows to eat properly, assembly was a breeze .", 
    "Love these chairs and very cute but the wood grain cheapens it a little and they bend in the back a little much.", 
    "The legs keep coming detached from the chair base.", 
    "Great Quality and easy assamble. love them", 
    "bolts dont match up that well so chairs set in pretty cheaply, and you have to do a lot of finagling to get them in right. Also, had a heavier set friend sit on them and it bent the metal, which was rather embarrassing for him.", 
    "Really like the chairs the color is lighter than the picture", 
    "Chairs look so cool with my dark wood dinning table.", 
    "They look great and comfy but the bolts fall out occasionally.", 
    "I was at first worried if these chairs would be durable and they are..When I got them they seemed a little cheap but the look is great and they are durable..Can't go wrong for the price..", 
    "I've had these chairs for about 3 months and they look great and hold up and easy to clean. Great value.", 
    "it was easy to put together and the look great.. actually look better in person.. they are sturdy and have that iconic shape.. awesome sauce!!!Cant beat the price!!", 
    "Stylish and easy cleaning. Also comfy too.", 
    "Couldn't be happier with my purchase. Chairs arrived within a week with free shipping via UPS. Packaging was immaculate, very secure and safe with no damage to the box and contents. Very easy to assemble, extremely comfortable. the 4 Chairs look fantastic in my loft apartment dining area. Don't think twice, BUY, BUY, BUY.", 
    "They look great, were easy to assemble and Im happy with them.", 
    "You cant ask for more with that price! ...", 
    "Bought 4 of these to use and a dining table, love them!", 
    "I've seen these chairs for much more elsewhere and I must say I love these. They are quality and were priced well.", 
    "Great price , perfect for my kitchen!", 
    "Bought 2 and then two other styled white chairs from overstock, in a mid century style. Love these. The wood grain plastic is very cool and clean easily with my two little dudes. They are comfy and not too stiff. Put it together really quick. Don't hesitate to buy.", 
    "They were easy to assemble and are easy to clean.", 
    "Don't buy them. They will break pretty fast. You're better of with buying a real one and not a knockoff", 
    "The chairs arrived on time. They are very easy to assemble, and where ready to use in just minutes. I couldn't be more pleased and would recommend these chairs to my friends. They are a a perfect addition to my mid-century modern home.", 
    "These chairs are comfortable, great looking, good height and seem sturdy. Time will tell how they hold up, but I am very happy with my purchase so far. Would definitely order again.", 
    "Easy to assemble, lightweight, good value, add a touch of style to our decor. Good buy!", 
    "Using as dining chairs and really happy.. wished I realized that they were wood grain and not smooth. That was my mistake. They seem to be holding up great.", 
    "Sturdy, great design and easy to assemble. I couldn't be happier with these chairs. I just ordered another set with the sides because they are so great. HIGHLY recommend these little gems.", 
    "Wood on legs is lighter than pictured and looks a little cheap. They are sturdy chairs though and have good flex. Also, nothing to do with the rating, but I didn't ready closely enough to understand the wood grain was in the white chair, not the legs. I was expecting plain plastic. They are easy to wipe down though and were super fast to put together.", 
    "Bought these chairs to complete the mid-century modern look of my dining room. These chairs are sturdy and comfortable. Easy to assemble and does not scratch my hardwood floors. I would recommend tightening the screws where the seat and the legs connect every 2-3 weeks.", 
    "These chairs were everything we hoped to get and more!", 
    "Dead on knock off for the eames chair-but sits incredibly low to the ground-better for a child scale wise than an adult. Measures slightly lower than specified on description", 
    "we've had them only a few months. One bent beyond repair within 6 weeks. A second fell apart while I was sitting on it last week. They look cheap. They are cheap. Not worth the money.", 
    "The build quality was poor and the color of the legs didn't remotely match the image or description. The faux wood grain in the plastic makes it feel especially cheap", 
    "I seen these chairs & thought... I'm trying these with my farm table I had custom made! Excellent outcome. Easy to clean and I have a more modern beachy looking dining room exactly what I was hoping for and at a price that can NOT be beat!", 
    "I ordered these chairs to use with our dining table, but they were a touch too short for this purpose (we are 5'4\" and 5'11\"). They would likely be fine as a desk chair or for some other purpose. The surface of the chair also has something like a faux wood grain texture, which was not apparent from the photos. It was not necessarily objectionable, but it was unexpected. I only assembled one chair but assembly was quick and easy.", 
    "I did not measure the height and width of these chairs before buying them. They are small seat wise and the height of the back in portion to the seat. However, they fit the space needed. I like them for the purpose needed.", 
    "These were easy to put together and look great! They are a touch filmsy, but much better price than an Eames! Def works!", 
    "These were what I needed for the right price. If you look too closely you can tell they're cheap, but they're sturdy and look great where I wanted them. Happy with my purchase.", 
    "I bought these for my cabin - Just what I was looking for. I needed something easy to wipe down, trendy, and white. Thank you for the fast delivery.", 
    "Wonderful price for the set. I would definitely buy them again. Very comfortable and easy to wipe off.", 
    "These chairs are so pretty. I love the wood-grain texture... I was worried it would look cheesy, but they look great with our white and walnut table. Keep in mind the legs are a bamboo color (relatively light). These are super light weight, but seem to be sturdy. These are quite obviously plastic, so their best use is for a casual dining area.", 
    "Feels a bit flimsy but so far so good. Got four for kitchen space. They are very good looking and modern (we have mid-century modern home and decor). Not sure how functional they would be for everyday convenient kitchen use (we have the dining room but only use the area when family or guests are with us). Will review after a year or so!", 
    "These chairs are great! Fairly priced, easy to assemble, and super comfortable. Not to mention they're beautiful!", 
    "Great quality chairs, easy to assemble. LOVE the style.", 
    "The chairs were very easy to assemble. Great value for the quality and style. Very comfortable and easy to clean.", 
    "these chairs are great! no regrets. they look lovely and are good quality!", 
    "We bought a pair of the Lucas white wood grain chairs to go with our white desk. The chairs are modern and light. They came on time and packaged properly upon delivery. Very easy to install. I would recommend not wearing any dark jeans that could transfer the color onto the white plastic seats.", 
    "I've been researching dining chairs for a while. My requirements were style, comfort, and value. Although these are a cheaper version of a classic chair, I couldn't justify spending $300 on a single chair. These are a great alternative! They are comfortable and feel sturdy.", 
    "Just love every thing about this chair! Wood grain effect, real wood legs, easy set up, great look, low price...etc.", 
    "Very please with the quality. Fast shipping and simply assembly. White seat and natural wood legs works great together. The wood grain is very unique and it does add value and positive feel to the chair. The chair is light but strong. Amazed by the good price when considering the quality and style of this chair. It is a great deal.", 
    "Great looking chair. Brought for my son's new apartment. The chair is comfy with some give at the back, so it's not hard. Appears to be sturdy and reliable, but only time will tell. Regardless, the good look already worth the money and not to mention the great price.", 
    "These chairs matches perfectly with my mid-century style wooden table. Love the overall look, very fashionable and yet timeless. I have recently move into my new place, and need lots of new furniture. And these chairs are certainly my favorite ones. I am glad we also got a good deal in terms of price.", 
    "This is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something simple, yet elegant and are reasonably priced. I love the design and style, I found it very attractive, and the pure white seat top matches perfectly to the beech color legs. It brighten up our dining room and make the room look clean and relaxing. It's also fairly comfortabe and size is ideal for the limited floor space we have. Very pleased.", 
    "Brought 4 of these chairs before thanksgiving. They looks great and my family loves them. Good quality and price.", 
    "The wood leg split while a person who weighs 120 pounds was sitting in it at the dining room table. Unsafe. 2nd time it was used.", 
    "The chair is very stylish if you are going for Mid Century Modern. The chair was shipped so all you have to do is screw on the legs. It is white, white and unfortunately the wood is much lighter than it appears in picture. More like a light maple.", 
    "You can't beat this price. Simple connections and nice details. The back rest has a little play which I think is nice. Good design. Will match up with our Shutter Louis Poulsen lights.", 
    "It was incredibly frustrating assembling the legs to the body of the chair. After over an hour of trying to make that one last stubborn screw align with the threading in the bottom of the chair, we simply gave up. The threading simply wouldn't line up and there is definitely a manufacturing flaw. This happened on two out of four chairs that we bought. We were able (after almost an hour) to sort of force the other chair's screw to take hold by pounding it. Very disappointed in this respect since I love the look of the chairs. Also, after regular use over the course of a couple of months, they have become very loose and squeaky. Not a confident feeling when sitting down. Have had to go back and tighten everything.", 
    "This is a knock-off. No problems assembling these chairs. Though they are a bit flimsy and perhaps not designed for heavier persons, but it is not overly bothersome. I'm keeping them as for my weigh they are just perfect. You get what you pay for and it's still way cheaper than the original.", 
    "The chairs look great in my room . They feel a little weak as they are incredibly light, but I haven't had any issues with them and putting them together was super easy. They really do look fantastic and felt satisfied for what I paid for them."
