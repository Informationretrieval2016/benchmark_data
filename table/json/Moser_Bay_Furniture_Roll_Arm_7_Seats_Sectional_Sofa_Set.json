    "We bought for our living room, they are very nice. Color in picture is spot on with a great linen texture. Looks amazing with my rustic industrial decor. Amazing steal on these sofas. So comfortable and so stunning! Way more expensive anywhere else!", 
    "This couch is fabulous.The tuffed look is so in right now. I placed the order and received it right away. I was thrilled to see it looks just like the picture. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "I've always been skeptical about ordering things via the internet...especially furniture that I couldn't see and touch in person. I finally decided to order this set for my new lake home and I couldn't be happier. It has the look and feel of subtle, yet super high end furniture...which is what I was going for. Very heavy and solid. Fabric is great and although light...still very durable. Very comfy. The set is true to color. Very very pleased.", 
    "This sofa is exactly as pictured and described - it is so beautiful and my guests can't stop complimenting it!", 
    "Had a little trouble putting it together, but has been working out great thus far. Quality is great for the price."
