    "Better than expected in every way! The assembly was simple, color true to the photo, well constructed, and size exactly as stated. This was our first major (non-returnable) purchase on Overstock and we're thrilled. This chic addition to our sitting room won't be going anywhere for a long time!", 
    "Very functional and eye pleasing. The materials and cushions are somewhat firm (which we like) but if you are looking for a sofa that you \"sink into\" this isn't the right choice. This is a nice looking and practical couch for reading and/or watching movies but keep in mind that it isn't long so if you like to watch tv with your significant other there's not enough room for you both to lie down.", 
    "Love it! Well made and elegant accent to our living room!", 
    "makes a really beautiful set with the chair, love the quality very comfortable too.", 
    "Very pleased - the reviews are accurate. When assembling, a tip: the bottom section slides into the arms section. Note that the arm sections have \"stops\" at the bottom. It is also kind of difficult to make sure that the back lines up smoothly with the metal brackets.But once it is all done, the love seat is very sturdy. And yes, the sofa is hard, but you can soften it with pillows.", 
    "Beautiful purple couch, stunning impact in my reading room. Firm cushions that have softened just right over time.", 
    "The design is beautiful, of course, but as I sit on the loveseat and type this review, my neck, shoulder and back feel just as stiff as the loveseat. It is uncomfortable and the DARK GREY is more like DENIM and that makes me sorry that I bought sight unseen. The back is very short (but that is the design). Maybe I will be more comfortable if I get an ottoman and just slouch down so low that my neck and head rest on the back of the loveseat. I would recommend this for an office or \"just for show\" in a room where it wont get much use because it is beautiful.", 
    "...but its color is rich. Its comfortable. It just is half the height of a normal couch....", 
    "Misleading description of fabric used \"Upholstery materials: Linen\". This is not linen but cheap synthetic. Very disappointed.", 
    "Red! Beautiful! Took only a short time to put together. The people who made this were geniuses.", 
    "These couches are really beautiful. They look like they cost much more than I actually paid for them. The color is a true gray and is slightly darker than the picture shows on my monitor. The couches are not very comfortable because the cushions are a bit hard but I think that is necessary so that they maintain the shape. Definitely more for a formal living room that does not get sit in much which is what I bought them for. I am extremely happy with them!", 
    "I bought this as extra seating for my work office. Everyone complements the style and comfort of the sofa. Firm enough to make it easy to get up but not as if you are sitting on a board. The fabric is soft and smooth. The color is possibly a little lighter than pictured but I also have it against a darker colored wall.", 
    "This love seat is beautiful and fits perfectly in my bay window. It is firm but very comfortable. It seems very sturdy. I get lots of compliments.", 
    "very elegant and rich the sofa and loveseat are beautiful. I am so pleased with my selection. Assembly was super easy. Love it.", 
    "I got the darker grey, which is almost charcoal black. It is a nice piece and was easy to put together. Good quality.", 
    "If you love red and classy, you will love this high quality love seat!", 
    "The assembly system for these loveseats solved our problem! We have a 120\" picture window looking directly onto a beach on Lake Michigan in Chicago. The bottom of the window glass starts 29\" from the floor. A sofa long enough to fill the space but low enough not to block any of the window was beyond our budget. Then we found the loveseats! Because they arrive in pieces to assemble, we were able to eliminate two arms in the center, tightly connect the seats and backs and move the feet from the arms to the underside of the seats in the center. Voila! A sofa that fills the length of the window and doesn't block the glass, a sofa that we bought (with a combination of accumulated points and timing for a great sale) for about $*. Can't beat that, not even at a hotel liquidator!", 
    "This loveseat is what I was looking for. The quality and look matches my living room and other furniture. Lovely~", 
    "ROOMY.RICH LOOKING. NOT THE EASIEST OF PIECES TO PUT TOGETHER", 
    "Couch came in two large boxes. Extremely easy to put together, requires no tools. Cushions are firm but still comfy, feel that they will not lose shape like some do. Fabric seems thick and high quality. Color was spot on in dark grey. Very happy with this couch, considering buying another for a separate room.", 
    "I love this tufted loveseat! Looks beautiful and is comfy with right pillow accents", 
    "I purchased this to go in my sitting room in my bedroom and it looks beautiful there. It was very easy to put together and is very pretty. The couch is comfortable but I wouldn't put it in a high use area.", 
    "This small chesterfield is gorgeous. Good quality, wears well! Great color!", 
    "This loveseat is exactly what we were lokking for. The fabric, color, style and comfort is simply elegant!", 
    "very small and i ordered the dark gray, it came i was so excited and it was blue! not impressed with overstock and there pictures.", 
    "The couch looks great in my apartment. It came in four pieces so it was hard to put together alone but otherwise I love it!", 
    "This looks great. Looks more expensive. I only gave it four stars cuz it is not cushy and comfortable for lounging. I have bad back, so I have less pain in straight back chairs rather than the ones I sink into. Beautiful grey color and nice fabric unless u have cats that claw. I use a colorful throw so dogs won't get it dirty, since I only have occasional visitors. People with dogs on furniture might want something with a pattern fabric. I adore this love-seat... I like looking at it as I enjoy looking at the artwork on my walls.", 
    "Was easy to assemble and it looks beautiful in my living room. I purchased the red and so happy I did. I give it 5 stars.", 
    "When I read the reviews, I thought this might be the good item to have it in my living room. But When it has arrived, and it is beyond PERFECT than I can ever imagine. Wish I can buy more, but it is no longer on sale.", 
    "A NICE FRENCH FURNITURE FOR A LOW BUDGET. GREAT QUALITY OF CONSTRUCTION. EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. LOVE IT.", 
    "Exactly as pictured, very easy to assemble. Firm but comfortable.", 
    "I bought this sofa in order to bring a pop of color to my living room. It serves its purpose while also remaining comfortably firm.", 
    "I like the firmness and style.", 
    "I ordered this loveseat and chair in \"Grey\". I was promised by someone on chat that this would be dark grey and not the lighter grey. This was not the case... what a headache. Be careful when ordering these couches that you are getting the color you want!",
