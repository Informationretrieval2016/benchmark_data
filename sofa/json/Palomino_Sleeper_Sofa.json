    "After shopping extensively decided on this sofa as available now, and it came with patented inner construction which allows you to lift up head area to read a book, watch tv, and mattress was best had seen for a sofa bed where you could leave mattress cover and bedding on it when folding back in. Also back cushions are removable giving your guests more room at top. Wanted a sofa that was \"comfortable\" as 90% of time you'd be not using it as sofabed. . .this was did it for me at right price, on time, and with helpful delivery putting it in right place in house for me :0)", 
    "great couch, but sleeper mattress is soft", 
    "Great fabric and hide a bed is relatively comfortable!", 
    "Ordered this sleeper sofa for queen size and color. It had to go up one flight of stairs so I used Overstock white glove service which was excellent. It was minimal cost and the two delivery guys were great. It came so well packed that the three of us were not even sure what needed to be removed and cut off. That is the reason for four stars instead of five. I still don't know whether the backing on the bottom should be totally removed or just trimmed. I did not see any mention of this in previous reviews - only a comment on stapling of fabric. The fabric looks just as pictured - a rustic brushed suede and is very nice quality. The cushions are well filled - firm to sit on but comfortable. Pull out is easy and smooth - mattress is only 4 inches - sitting on it was OK but I am looking for a mattress pad cover which should add another inch. This is going to be used for guests so I cannot comment on sleeping comfort. Price comparison showed Overstock was amongst the lowest. If you are looking for a queen size sleeper that is very well built and like the casual look, you cannot go wrong with this item.", 
    "I really like this sofa. It's very comfortable both as a sofa and a bed. It also fits in my living room perfectly.", 
    "We bought this sleeper sofa for our small downstairs office/guest room. It is Very heavy and awkward to move, understandable since it has a heavy bed frame inside, so plan ahead if you need to move. It was difficult to find what we wanted but we decided this would serve it's purpose, a place for an occasional family guest to sleep but not continually take up too much space in out small room. The material is just staples on and not very well. The couch is very firm and the bed is comfortable enough. We are happy with our purchase but we do not expect it to last too many years.", 
    "We are happy with this sofa sleeper. It's good quality and seems to be constructed solid.", 
    "We bought this pull-out couch for our office/guest room and it's perfect for that room. It's pretty large in most dimensions and feels bigger than the measurements would suggest.The fabric is nice and does look a little like leather from afar although no one would mistake it for the real thing up close. Unlike leather it breathes, which only adds to the comfort. The only downside we've discovered so far is that the back cushions are so well-stuffed the seating area is a little shallow as a result. We tested the sleeper mechanism and the mattress seemed comfortable, but we haven't had an overnight guest yet to try it out for an entire 8 hours."
