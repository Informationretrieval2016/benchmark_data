    "I was hesitant to purchase these cream-colored chairs because I have not had any luck while researching other chairs for many reasons; including the color was not cream or ivory as described and the height of many chairs is less than I wanted. These chairs are true to color---creamy white. They are not stark white and definitely not beige or tan, etc. which is often the color of items when looking for ivory or cream. These are creamy white--a bit lighter than what I needed -- but I am keeping them because a true cream is extremely difficult to locate. The height of the chair base is good, not small as many are, which, I think looks very awkward! Would have liked the back to be a few inches higher, but these still look good and again...not too small as many are and then look odd in the space.They are good quality, not great quality. On one of the chairs the material is not even but I don't think many people would notice and on another some of the interior batting material was sticking out, I trimmed it off. For the price, these are fine for now. The weight of the chair is a bit light, not as heavy or as sturdy as other chairs we own. This could be a concern for some; not for us. The reason for the 4 star and not 5 is---first: the chairs are very time consuming to assemble. They come with an wrench that you can only turn partially and then have to remove it and turn again: in essence-- start again. My husband, who is excellent at any project we have, got frustrated after putting together two chairs. He ultimately devised a tool to put these together and it was easier and faster. Second: all the chair legs were uneven. Two of the legs are attached to the back of the chair, so you will have to add the front two; this took time because of the tool they provide, the location for adding the legs is tight and working to even them out. Be prepared for someone to spend a lot of time on the assembly of these chairs!! Fortunately, it was not me.For you regular O shoppers: last year, I purchased the *********** ****** counter stools in cream leather for our kitchen island; they coordinate so very well with these chairs! These chairs were put nearby in the breakfast area of our kitchen and add so much to the space with a trestle table we already own. I am pleased with how the stools, chairs and our cabinets all coordinate; color is great.", 
    "I was looking for new chairs for my dining room (a room in my house I rarely use, but walk through often). I knew I didn't want to spend a ton, or need something high end...and when I came across these chairs I figured I'd give them a try. I have had the chairs a few months and have used them a few times. None of the chair occupants have been especially large, and the chairs have held up nicely. The only down side was assembly - that was a real pain and quite time consuming....but for the price I'm not really complaining.", 
    "Hard or impossible to clean the fabric, if you get ink on it or blue dye from jeans. Have to keep tightening the bolts under the chairs, and we uses glue. Took some time putting 6 together. I would prefer cloth and preassembled higher quality. They look very chic though around a large round Z'sGALLERY dark cherry table, in a room with white wanes coating.", 
    "Love theses chairs. A little time consuming to assemble. But worth it", 
    "Great set for the price. Easy to assemble. Fairly lightweight which was good because we move them around quite a bit.", 
    "The chairs look great. For the price you can not beat it. I do not think they're real leather though. Assembly is a bit time consuming, but not difficult. We replaced the pads on the bottom to prevent them from sliding on the tile floor and sit more evenly. A total cost of around $*per chair is a steal."
