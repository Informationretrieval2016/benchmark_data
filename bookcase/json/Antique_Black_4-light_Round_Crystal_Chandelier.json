    "I am so happy with my purchase!!! I looked for a chandelier for our dining room for two years, and have never seen anything like this! I wanted something that would satisfy my husband's modern style while giving me something a little glamorous and unexpected. I fell in love with this chandelier because the modern pendant shape is what you see in all the design books and modern furniture stores...but the crystals gave this a fabulous twist. After reading all the rave reviews, I had to see it for myself - so glad I did!!! Yes, it takes a little time to put on the crystals - but like everyone says, it's just a night or two in front of the TV. Very easy and so worth it!!! My husband installed it himself, it is very easy. Please note the chain has a caribiner clip that allows you to adjust the height before you hang it. My daughters and husband say it's the best thing I ever bought! Another note - it looks amazing with frosted bulbs! Clear bulbs are a little too much for me, more like a disco ball. I bought this with another chandelier that I am returning and I just wanted to say how thrilled I am with Overstock's customer service - they are so kind and make it so easy. You never see that anymore.", 
    "This is one of the most beautiful chandeliers I have ever seen, I stop and admire it every time I walk by the dining room. our house is craftsman style, with lots of straight angles, simple bold lines, and oil rubbed bronze....this chandelier works beautifully with the simple drum shape and oil rubbed bronze finish, but the sparkle and the crystals just add a really playful element that softens up all the heavy, straight elements of the house. It's a great chandelier if you're looking to combine the masculine (the heavy, simple drum shape), the feminine (the swarovski-like crystals), and a some whimsy (the drop crystals). Ours is hanging near dining room windows that get lots of sun, so the effect is fabulous all day. And we live on a corner and when I was walking the dog yesterday afternoon I noticed that when I looked into the window during the daytime the chandelier was sparking like crazy from the inside...and the sun wasn't even on it. Did not expect that. If you get this chandelier get clear candelabra bulbs, bc then with all the hundreds of little reflections on the crystals you won't even be able to see where the bulbs are, pretty great. Oh, and this is a chandelier that definitely calls for a DIMMER, you get a remarkable range of mood with these crystals and a dimmer....so grab a $7 dimmer from your hardware store and install that at the same time to get the full wow effect.", 
    "Absolutely stunning. If your looking for bling, this is it. Love it!!! Perfect for a romantic setting in bedroom and/or dining room. Please note, the shade is covered in glittery crystals which does cast shadow of round bubbles on the walls that surround the room. At night when the night is on, the room looks as if your under water surrounded by bubbles......really neat, calming and relaxing feel. Adds some texture to your painted walls. This is why I would recommend this fixture for a bedroom or dining room, rather than a hallway or foyer.", 
    "This looks just as wonderful in-person as on-line. My husband and I are thrilled with the results. We assembled it over a few movie nights, as it took a few hours to put together. Installation was easy. The large crystal in the middle was chipped, but thanks to them sending spare parts, we were easily able to fix it. The sparkle and shine are amazing - we certainly recommend it!", 
    "I ordered this chandelier because of the description and the spectacular reviews. I have to say i am disappointed because the light is described as \"bronze\" but the color is actually black and was too dark for my living room. I wish i had liked it, but everyone says it looks spectacular! too bad...", 
    "I saw this chandelier in an upscale home my husband and I were touring to purchase. Our jaws dropped when we saw two of them hanging on top of the kitchen island. I told my husband I wanted the house!! Unfortunately we were outbid and I had to part from them. To my wonderful surprise I found them here and they are so affordable!! I ordered two and will install them into our next new home! I just got them in the mail and so happy to finally have my hands on them. As most recent reviewers mentioned they too came with all the small crystals attached and shipping was very quick. I love them so much I could hug them, haha! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!", 
    "I literally squealed with delight when I pulled my chandelier out of the shipping box. It was much prettier in person than in the photo. The light catches all of the little crystals and throws little rainbows in the daytime. Each little crystal in the shade is held in place by beautiful little silver filigree pieces that add yet another dimension of texture and beauty to this light. I debated for months on a chandelier for my new house and looked at literally hundreds of chandeliers on the internet. I finally chose this one because there simply was nothing else out there as pretty and unique as this chandelier. I am absolutely thrilled with it and smile every time I walk by it. If you want something unique and gorgeous- this is it!!", 
    "The only issue was that I have 17 foot ceilings and so I had to buy extra chain, ground wire and electrical wire. (came with 39\") Then an electrician had to rewire the base before he could hang it. This cost approx $200. I wish these chandeliers had different lenghts but the base price was reasonable and so it all worked out fine!", 
    "We like this fixture and it's looks good. The one issue is that the \"crystals\" are actually plastic, so that is a disappointment and I don't recall that being noted.", 
    "Just had the light installed by an electrician. BEAUTIFUL! I had it placed where a recess light was above the bar. Used a ceiling medallion to cover the large hole from the recess can instead of having sheet rock repair. Looks perfect. No one would ever know and cheaper. The light was packaged well. No damage, came with spare parts/crystals. The crystals to the shade were already attached. Just had to attach the hanging crystals (25) in all. took 30 minutes. I attached them after installed. Just looks beautiful, especially with the light against the crystals. would highly recommend!!", 
    "I had hit all the local high end lighting stores before I purchased this chandelier. I could not come close to the modern drum style or the price on overstock. Be prepared to spend a night attaching the crystals, but it's worth it. I replaced a 6 light chandelier in my dining room with this 4 light one so I was concerned that this was not \"big\" enough for my room and my table. Boy was I wrong. This light, probably due to the number of crystals, has a presence and throws the light much better than my old 6 light. If you like the look online, you will love this in your home.", 
    "The chandelier is perfect. The pattern created on the walls is incredible. I ordered this chandelier because I was looking for a brown metal with some bling and I got it. It has enough bling without overdoing it. It has that traditional feel with a contemporary look. I do not like the fancy crystal chandeliers out there. so I have avoided them. The crystals are indeed glass. It was a labour of love putting the crystals on and worth every minute (8 hours aprox). It met all my expectations after reading the reviews. Everyone who sees it loves it. It is easy to adjust height on a permanent or temporary basis, with the almost invisible carbiner clip. I would recommend this light in a heart beat. You can't go wrong. Canadian Sandkastle", 
    "My..my..my..I never knew a light fixture could have that much power to transform the look of a room. It replaced a builder-grade light with our new home....placed it in our foyer and it's absolutely stunning! The crystal prisms are aaaaamazing!!!!!! We had a handyman put up the light and it was done in about 15min. He said it was \"too easy\". The hanging crystals took about 20-30min to attach...I have to admit I was so busy admiring the light fixture(light on/light off, walking in the room,walking out...lol) that my husband actually did the hanging crystals for me :) We also purchased the 'crystal cut' bulbs as a previous reviewer suggested...great idea! We will probably switch to a dimmer for better light control..but that's only because we have the other version of this light in a room close by. You will be so pleased with this purchased......Overstock did it again!", 
    "This lighting fixture is truly beautiful - I purchased it and the other chandalier that kind of matches it - (the double shaded one) - this hangs in my front entry hall and the other over my dining table - they complement each other and look awesome when I dim them at night - creating magical reflection on the walls - they look so expensive and classy - not too much bling but just elegant. I am glad that I was asked to write a review because I just realized that I did not hang the crystals on the bottom !!! it looks good the way it is but I will now go and hang the crystals. Would recommend this product - packaging and shipping were excellent and the price is amazing.", 
    "I just LOVE this chandelier! I have been looking for the right crystal chandelier forever, and was excited when I found this one. Like many others have said, it's even more beautiful in person than it is in the picture. The crystals catch the light beautifully. It was very carefully packaged. When I first unwrapped the outer ring, it was missing one crystal. I called customer service and they couldn't have been nicer and offered to send out a replacement . I told them I just needed the crystal and could attach it myself. While on the phone with customer service, I discovered that there was a whole packet of spare parts, including the missing crystal, so that was a happy surprise. It only took me about 5-10 minutes to attach all the crystals to the frame. Some have wondered whether the crytals are real crystal or just glass...I can't tell for sure but they are heavy and reflect the light beautifully with prismatic colors so that's all that matters to me. It is absolutely beautiful and I recommend it!", 
    "Fabulous metal drum fixture with glass crystals! The images don't do it justice! Exceptional value for the money!! The color is definitely a darker oil rubbed bronze, not black, as previous reviewers have written. It's similar in color to Delta Faucets \"Venetian Bronze\" finish. For optimum results, install a dimmer and use \"crystal cut\" candelabra bulbs! I tried both the frosted and clear bulbs that other reviewers recommend but didn't care for either. The frosted was just blah and the clear was too easily visible through the crystals. The \"crystal cut\" candelabra bulbs blend in beautifully with the drum crystals making them almost impossible to see. It took my electrician less than 30 min to install both the fixture and dimmer.", 
    "The chandelier is an eye catcher in my dinning room, everyone that came in always complemented it.Assemble was not that tedious. However this is an highly decorative piece not an utility light fixture perfect for formal dinning, it creates a pattern on the walls as the light shines through the crystals. Use 60W bulbs in it, the 40W did not give us enough light so we had to switch. I am very happy with the way it looks.", 
    "If there is anyone out there on the fence on whether or not to purchase this item, hesitate no more! I just purchased 2 of these for our foyer. The are nothing short of show stoppers bringing such elegance, class, and style to each guest that enters our front doors. They give off such a vintage and antique feel. I LOVE THIS CHANDELIER!!!!", 
    "a lot of work to put the crystals on but it really is a stunner. It also casts beautiful shadows on the wall.", 
    "Nice light - creates pretty pattern in the evening. Does take a bit of time to string on crystals, but a good value. Recommended.", 
    "Installed over our dining table, it's a beautiful fixture. The crystals around the drum are already installed, and emit a beautiful pattern on the wall. I attached the hanging crystals in about 20 minutes at the most. The fixture and all parts came well packed and of good quality. My husband installed without the need to run to a hardware store lol (it took a few tries to attach to ceiling plate correctly, but eventually he got it). Make sure you know exactly what height you want it at before cutting any extra wire. All in all, we are extremely happy with this purchase.", 
    "Purchased this for entry way, the first fixture sent out didn't work which was frustrating because we spent 4 hours hanging this and trouble shooting, only to find that it was defective. Overstock quickly sent a replacement. It's gorgeous. I haven't hung the crystals on it yet so for those of you that think it's too feminine, you can tone it down by leaving off the crystals.", 
    "Ordered this chandelier for our dining room.It arrived in tact promptly- within four days of ordering. It was breeze to install with very clear directions. Attaching the crystals took me about 10 minutes. I'm not sure why other people had a harder time with this. The color is a black/bronze which looks very nice with my reclaimed barn-wood floors. The size and weight are on point with the measurements on the sight. I was worried about it being large enough but it's is suitable for above the dining table. The dining room is part of a large open area in the front of the house so I was concerned about the scale. The light nicely separate the dining area from the seating area. I wish they had a slightly larger size but it works. My electrician removed 3-4 pieces of chain in order to make it a more ideal hight. We have 12ft ceiling, if it helps. A dimmer is a must for this lamp. The lamp glitters and glows with 4 revel chandelier bulbs on a dimmer. The way this lamp throws light has me sold. My style is a little rustic/industrial so this is a nice touch to pull it all together in a glamorous manner. Photos avail on insta gram- user mochibunny. A seriously good value.", 
    "I had been eyeing this chandelier for months and decided to buy it knowing that I had a few different options for placement. We hung in our kitchen first and it could not have looked more out of place over our beautiful Hooker Sanctuary Collection round table and chairs and we were definitely not fans of the shadows cast on our gray walls. I was worried that I had made a bad purchase until I hung over my tub in my glamorous black bathroom. I am now in love with it as is everyone that sees it! It is a fantastic purchase if you have the right spot.", 
    "I really am in love with this chandelier. I purchased all three in the collection and this is my favorite. Pay attention to the dimensions, it's not a huge fixture so make sure your space calls for one this size. It is so unique, overall, love it!", 
    "This crystal chandelier looks gorgeous in person. It is a great mix of contemporary/traditional. It has enough chain length for tall spaces, was easy to install and looks like a million bucks on my breakfast nook. It does not provide a lot of direct light, it casts a \"bubbly\" shadow on the walls, which I love. I only had to attach the crystals in the middle, the \"shade\" came with all the crystals in place. It was a little bit of a splurge for me, but it was totally worth it.", 
    "this chandelier is exactly as pictured. I love the style where it is sparkly but not old fashion. It is a dark brown and almost black in some spots, no copper like some oil rubbed bronze. The crystals were easy and fun to put together. I did buy the frosted bulbs because it is bright. I have mine on a dimmer and love the ability to have it bright when I need it a low when I want to set a mood. Great buy!", 
    "I'M WRITING IN ALL CAPS TO MAKE SURE YOU PURCHASE THIS STUNNING CHANDELIER!!!! I ORIGINALLY PURCHASED THE RENATE TRIO CHANDELIER AND RETURNED IT FOR THIS LOVELY PIECE OF ART, I CAN'T STOP STARING AT IT. I HAVE VAULTED CEILINGS IN MY APT AND MY HANDYMAN HUNG IT FOR ME SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S EASY OR HARD TO PUT TOGETHER. WHEN I WALKED IN AND SAW THE SPARKLES AND CRYSTALS AGAINST THE BRONZE I FELT LIKE A KID ON CHRISTMAS MORNING :) I INITIALLY SHIED AWAY FROM THIS CHANDELIER BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY REVIEWS I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE THE SAME THING AS SO MANY PEOPLE, TRUST ME NOW I DON'T CARE, BUY IT AND YOU'LL BE GIDDY LIKE ME", 
    "With so many glowing reviews, it wasn't hard to decide to buy. I love it even more hanging in my dining room! It adds the perfect touch of bling, and I absolutely love it. I also bought the pendant to match to hang over my kitchen sink, and am now thinking about the one without hanging crystals for my hallway. I love it that much! Some reviews said the finish is more black than bronze, but mine is definitely an antique bronze. It was exactly what I needed.", 
    "I purchased this ceiling fixture as part of a bedroom renovation. Pros: It's stunning - industrial glamorous and was great that we didn't have to hang all the tiny crystals in the barrel area. I highly recommend getting a dimmer switch. Cons: my contractor complained there was no real instructions, one small crystal was missing from the center barrel. The center hanging arm was not exactly like the picture... In the center, there wasn't a crystal, but a solid sphere and it didn't have a hook on which to hang the center crystal. Strange because that crystal was in the box.", 
    "I really can't say enough about this chandelier. It is absolutely gorgeous and everyone who comes over compliments me on it. The instructions say a very specific kind of bulb but it really just takes standard candelabra base bulbs. I have mine on a dimmer switch and the mood lighting created by turning it down a bit is stunning!", 
    "It's so sparkly! If you can hang it lower to attract the sun and create rainbows you will absolutely love this!", 
    "Wow!!!! I looked at several chandeliers in Stores and on line, but when my friend called me and said \" I found the right chandelier for you\" I was so happy I ordered it immediately. It is absolutely beautiful. I used the Crystal Cut Clear Bulb and a Dimmer .", 
    "I am so happy we went with this light! Now I understand all of the wonderful reviews! We recently did a full renovation on a townhouse we just bought. We have dark hardwood and light beige walls. This light is PERFECT for the space. Our ceilings are only 8' 0\", we originally we were a little concerned with the size of the light. My fiance just cut the chain shorter and pulled the cable through to make the chain only about 6 inches long. We used clear light bulbs, which YES they display a very noticeable pattern all over the walls. WHICH WE LOVE! It adds such a character to our home. I would suggest putting in a dimmer with this light, we have yet to do so...but I think it would be a perfect light to dim!", 
    "This is soooooo Beautiful!!! We purchased it to go in our entryway and the bigger one for above our table. They are both so beautiful!!! They Bling and are exactly what I wanted at an AMAZING price. It came put together and ready to install. I LOVE THIS!!!!!", 
    "It arrived well packaged and took about one week to arrive from order placement date. The chandelier was replacing a ceiling fan w/light. My husband is handy and with the wiring in place, we had it installed in no time! It was very easy to install the lower hanging crystals myself. All the crystals around the chandelier drum are already installed & well wrapped-protected for shipment. If you are considering purchasing this - do it!", 
    "I feel like I went on a high end spending spree with out spend ing cash! Looks fabulous and expensive. Who care if it's real crystal or not. The point! It looks great for the the money spent. Good Job on this pick O.co!", 
    "Yes...It did take a few hours to install the beads, but the beads were very easy to install and once it is done...WOW! I did a \"bling\" bedroom and needed oil rubbed bronze to match the room. This was the perfect light! Easy install, easy assembly and very happy with this light.", 
    "This item shipped quickly. It took a few hours to hang all the crystals on the Chandelier. It is beautiful on or off. The antique bronze is more black with streaks of brown. The dome was completely black. I just figured that the crystals stands out better shining off that black. It stands out in my dining room. It gives off plenty of light. Very nice! I would recommend it to anyone, although, a lot of my crystals were missing but that is being corrected.", 
    "This fixture adds style and class along with a lot of sparkle in my entryway.", 
    "I love this chandelier in my high-ceilinged master bedroom, with my barnwood panel headboard, reclaimed dresser and simple other furniture pieces. It catches even the smallest beams of light and reflects beautiful colors. Easy to install.", 
    "It is so pretty,,accents my room perfectly!!!", 
    "Haven't been able to hang it yet, however it's beautiful. Sturdy. Perfect size. Packages well and super quick delivery.", 
    "this chandelier adds some extra jazz to my dining room. happy with my purchase. reasonable price!", 
    "Looks Exactly as shown! Most beautiful when the lights are on. Very nice purchase for a great price.", 
    "OMG! I absolutely LOVE this fixture! It looks fabulous in my dining room, and adds class and a touch of glam without being so girly that men are uncomfortable in the room. Delivery was prompt; fixture was well packaged and arrived intact. Worst part of the order was waiting for the electrician to show up and install it for me! (Although a handy husband, if you have one, shouldn't have any problems installing it.)", 
    "Perfect for my bathroom, exactly as described true bronze.", 
    "So happy I purchased this Beautiful Chandelier.....Another great buy!!!!", 
    "Love love love my dining room got a face lift with this light fixture", 
    "It's beautiful just like the pictures. It's unique and is perfect in my dining room. I have another bronze chandelier nearby and they are harmonious. Crystals add a touch of bling to the metal shade. Easy to assemble, it took a couple hours but I took breaks. Husband easily installed, basic like any other install. Comes with replacement crystals and extra ring attachments. Highly recommended!!", 
    "nice, and we added some more crystals and wow it dresses up nicely", 
    "This light is so beautiful! I absolutely love its shine and glimmer. Adds sophistication to any room.", 
    "However the crystals reflect prisms around the room so if you require direct light this may not work.", 
    "Love this light. Can't wait to hang it in our new house!!", 
    "It's so pretty, lightweight, and easy to assemble. I put four LED dimmable 60W equivalent bulbs in it. It's nice and bright. The crystals are glass and it comes with extra crystals and loops to hang them. An installation note; I hired a handyman to do mine, but I left the plastic that is wrapped around the mesh frame on it during the install. The crystals stay in place while the chandelier is being hung. The after it's hung, cut off the plastic and everything is intact. Then you hang the crystals at the bottom. This is a romantic and beautiful chandelier.", 
    "This lamp is beautiful. If hung in just the right spot during the day, the crystals catch the outside light and glitter like diamonds. Also pretty at night when you turn on the lights. Very classy piece!", 
    "put this in the dining are", 
    "Fit the space perfect and looks beautiful", 
    "Just like reviews say, this is absolutely stunning. It's NOT black, it's antique bronze, perfect. Easy to install and I've never done that before and I'm female. Lol. Took about hour. My daughter helped me hold it while I did the wiring. My daughter attached the crystals in under 20 min. You cannot go wrong with this beautiful piece. I have it over my kitchen table and I get a smile on my face everyday I look at it. :). All these reviews are spot on. This will not disappoint.", 
    "I wanted something modern with bling bling for my office , this is it! I love it!", 
    "I love the light. It is elegant and it gives off nice light. I live in an estate home and this light blends well with the formal decor!", 
    "I am an avid overstock shopper and they have never disappointed me. This light is simply awesone", 
    "Great quality! I get a lot of compliments on this fixture!", 
    "i installed this light over an island in our closet and it looks beautiful. came very well packaged with no issues. 4 stars only because it does hang slightly off balance, but i think if i adjust it a little better it will help.", 
    "We are remodeling the entry/lobby for our community theater, and ordered two of these chandeliers to bring an elegant look to the space. We are thrilled with the look and feel like our limited funds were well spent.", 
    "Don't hesitate just do it. Came mostly assembled and was easy to install. With some white leds this thing gives of a cool sparkle effect. Good quality and looks fancy.", 
    "We purchased this Crystal Chandelier for our dinning room and it immediately changed our decor. It's very beautiful and it comes already assembled. You just have to add the crystals because i guess it may damaged during shipment. But apart from that, it's beautiful at night as the crystals reflect on the wall. I will recommend it to anyone. By the way the installation was very easy too. But i used a professional electrician. It took them less than 30 mins.", 
    "This light is great I love the look and quality. Its absolutely beautiful!!", 
    "gorgeous and looks very elegant!", 
    "This light is the prettiest one I have ever purchased! I love \"bling\" and this light has a wow factor that none other has!", 
    "Real glass \"crystal\" parts, some had to be added by hand. The antique bronze is more like a very dark oil rubbed bronze - imagine the darkest chocolate/espresso brown. Amazing look, and the light reflects on the walls in a very romantic and beautiful way! We used this in our dining room with a dimmer and it just takes it to a whole new level!", 
    "modern with a sparkle- the crystals are beautiful, especially the ones in the drum shade", 
    "We hung this in our formal dining area and it casts little rainbows around the room - beautiful with a dimmer switch! The crystal connections are a bit cheap so I'm looking for black connections that will be less visible and cheap looking. Overall though so pleased with fixture - GREAT price.", 
    "Perfect for my morning room!", 
    "Purchased this for our master bedroom and I am 100% obsessed with how it looks. Super easy to assemble and hang too.", 
    "The product is even prettier in person, it has a very elegant yet mod look to it. I have gotten several compliments on this chandelier.", 
    "Installed this myself in about an hour, including cutting down wire and chain and installing all the crystals. It is truly lovely over my bed in the Master Bedroom, just enough modern lines to offset the bling-y crystals. Totally in love and a fabulous buy!", 
    "The pictures on the site cannot come close to the beautiful refraction effects of this fixture. In the evening, the ceiling shows a shadow similar to a sunburst and the walls have small prisms. I turn it on every time I pass the room! Cannot believe that I got such a bargain on so beautiful a fixture.", 
    "This beautiful chandelier transformed my small bungalow. It is glamorous and adds a special touch to my home. The coolest part is the way the crystals and light make the walls look patterned!", 
    "This is soooo beautiful ever one that sees it just loves it and they say they will buy it. Easy to install just like picture, just love it", 
    "I absolutely love this chandelier. My husband is an electrician and said it is one of the best made lights he has installed. Even he was impressed which takes a lot. Recently renovated our dining and living rooms and most people focus on this chandelier and say how beautiful it is. The shadows it displays on the walls is also very pretty", 
    "I have purchased two lights from overstock and they are both beautiful! Shipping was fast and everything was just as pictured. Possibly better... Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "Don't want anybody else to buy it because I want to be the only one that has it but it's a beauty!", 
    "Gorgeous! I love it. I have had many compliments on this fixture in my office and everyone assumes it must have cost me a fortune. It is wonderfully made and when it is on, it puts a wonderful glow on the wall. (I live in a very upscale home that was recently featured in a magazine so that should let you know the caliber of the fixture.) I have the 8 light double tier as well in my hallway and it is amazing as well. Don't hesitate.", 
    "This chandelier is beautiful. It casts a beautiful shadow on the walls. Nice heavy quality and crystals are easily attached. Extra crystals are also supplied.", 
    "Beautiful mix of old and new. I was looking for a little bling, but since I'm not an over the top blingy girl this chandelier fits the bill! We couldn't be happier!", 
    "Looks beautiful hanging above our kitchen table! Easy to install. Frosted bulbs work really well; regular bulbs were a little much-gives lots of light.", 
    "This Chandelier was a outstanding buy..it looks great", 
    "We LOVE this!!! Everyone comments on it how pretty it is. It catches the sunlight even during the daytime so we enjoy it day and night!! Great purchase!", 
    "Looks like a $400 fixture", 
    "wonderful product, exactly as described", 
    "This is a beautiful light! I'm getting so many compliments. Very high end looking.", 
    "This light fixture is in my dining room and I get constantly receive compliments on it. It's a beautiful light fixture and the crystals give off a shadow that looks like wallpaper. Everyone asks how I get that type of \"wallpaper\" on my wall, and I say \"it's not wallpaper; it's the light!\" The fixture is absolutely breathtaking.", 
    "Love the chandelier and it was very easy to assemble. It's a nice compliment to our dining table", 
    "We are so pleased with the way this looks in our dining room. We have an octagon shaped table and this looks fabulous hanging over it. This was easy to put up, and easy to assemble. No regrets.", 
    "Everything about this light is lovely. It came with all the crystals assembled with exception of the large dangling drops which took all of 5 minutes to put on. Mounting and wiring was a breeze, it took my husband maybe 25 minutes total. The packing was sturdy and strong and it arrived quickly. I could not be more pleased with the glow, reflection off the walls and the overall look of this fixture. It completely changed our dining area which is exactly what I hoped for.", 
    "I cannot say enough about this light...when the sun comes in the prisms from the crystals swirl around the room...we have an open floor plan....Everyone that sees it cant believe what I paid for it...the crystals are just enough to give it the flare we needed in our home...Unbelievably beautiful.", 
    "So sparkly and beautiful. I get compliments all the time on this.", 
    "so very pleased with this purchase. Chandelier is well manufactured, its the perfect size and most elegant. Adds an amazing accent. Have received the best complement. Brings replacement pieces....just in case. Love it!!!", 
    "I started to get nervous after I ordered this light fixture. After I installed it I was still on the fence. I few people came over and immediately commented on its look and the crystals give off great reflections on the walls making it very interesting. I'm sold, the construction is top quality. And it wasn't difficult to hang at all or to put the crystals on either.", 
    "This looks gorgeous over my dining room table. It is very bright, so we did put in a dimmer switch. The light does cast a pattern on walls which we love. There was a slight issue with getting the fixture level, but it was easily adjusted.", 
    "The other reviews are spot on--this chandelier is gorgeous in my dining room! I like the bronze as it gives it a more modern yet still elegant feel. Easy to hang up myself--just paid close attention to how my old light fixture was connected and made sure the connections for this one was similar.", 
    "Love, Love, Love this chandelier! My husband had it up in less than 15 minutes. I added the larger gorgeous crystals in no time at all. Its a beautiful addition to our dinning room.", 
    "Looks better than in the picture. Got lots of compliments on our dining room as it changed the whole decor as the chandelier added elegance to the room. Thank you.", 
    "I hung this in my dining room and it looks wonderful. The color is more black then a bronze but it works well with my decor. The lighting effect from the crystals and shade provide a pretty effect on the walls and ceiling.", 
    "I love this chandelier. I put it in my entry way and it is exactly the look I wanted when someone walks in my front door. A real wow!!!!", 
    "Updated master bedroom fixture. Very pleased!", 
    "Spectacular showcase of twinkle lights in my dining room when the chandelier is !turned on. The quality is much more than I expected. Gorgeous! Have received sooooo many compliments on it. The perfect size for a medium sized room! Thank you Overstock", 
    "I really love this light. I got the dimmer bulbs and switch as recommended and I really love it!!!", 
    "I bought this for my Dining Room and it's absolutely beautiful. Quality is amazing and it leaves beautiful patterns on my wall! Definitely gives off enough light. I've gotten so many compliments!", 
    "I was worried about quality ordering something online, but this light did not disappoint. Looks just the picture. Light gives off a beautiful reflection against the walls and ceiling. I put in 60 watt bulbs, but could have also gone with 40 watt.", 
    "This light fixture is even more beautiful in person!! It turned my kitchen space into an awesome focal point. Highly recommend for the price!", 
    "Love it and simple to install", 
    "This light is dazzling. A perfect addition to my master bath, combo of masculine and feminine. The light/shadow cast by this fixture is gorgeous.", 
    "Great chandelier for our bedroom. Elegant and modern. Works in a traditional or contemporary decor.", 
    "This looks very expensive. I have it in my dining room and is fabulous. The crystals are bright and beautiful. It was difficult to install- can be done- just difficult. It took me awhile to to choose a chandelier, and I am so glad I took my time and found this - I love it.", 
    "You will not be disappointed. Highly recommend this beautiful fixture. The metal work is heavy and sturdy. The color is actually matte black; not antique bronze. The crystals are beautiful and filled with reflective colors. The design and crystals look spectacular from outside and add to the curb appeal as well. This fixture and lighting transformed the dining room with modern contemporary design. Product was delivered quickly in great packing and good condition. Easy to hang and lots of extra chain to swag. The small crystals in the drum were pre-hung and the drum was shrink wrapped to ensure crystals were safe in transport. I strongly recommend this chandelier; it's fabulous!! What you see is what you get but even better.", 
    "Many many compliments received, looks beautiful in my dining room, adds a modern bling.", 
    "Its a nice chandelier, but I changed my mind with other decor, and now it does not go.", 
    "This beautiful chandelier is a very dark bronze almost black. It sparkles a lot and sends rainbow colors on your wall. It took getting used to. We put on a dimmer switch because it is very bright even with a low wattage. We like a lot better now with the dimmer so we can adjust the brightness/sparkle effect.", 
    "I have received so many compliments on this chandelier! This is just so beautiful in my dining room! Even my husband likes it (he especially likes the way the light is reflected onto the walls). The crystals are made of glass (not plastic, like one reviewer said) and it was very easy to put them on (maybe 10 mins). I just love this fixture. It's so classy.", 
    "I knew I wanted this chandelier after seeing it online because I thought I would look fantastic in my newly remodeled kitchen. But what I did not expect, was for it to far exceed my expectations in terms of beauty, quality, and appeal!!! Even the installer, after installing it took a step back and said \"WOW, I love it\", and asked where I bought it and how much it cost. I am very happy and proud of this chandelier :)", 
    "Beautiful! I get many compliments on this light", 
    "I bought this chandelier to hang over my jetted tub for my bathroom remodel and I put it on a dimmer. I get so many compliments on it and it looks great in a transitional remodel. I have high end finishes and combined clean lines with traditional touches in warm tones on walnut, and creams. Please note that the finish is very dark, like a blackish brown, but it still works with my dark walnut cabinetry and bronze and nickel fixtures. I am very happy with this purchase and it looks very expensive.", 
    "Great piece of lighting ! Quality is great and is hardy and durable!!", 
    "Exactly as described. Very pretty.", 
    "I've had this chandelier for more than a year now, and I love it today as much as I did the day we installed it.", 
    "it was very pretty, but I accidentally ordered the wrong style, and returned it for a flush-mount chandelier.", 
    "I wanted to create a vintage look in my mother-in-law's room ,this was perfect addition.Easy to put up .", 
    "This light fixture gives a great ambiance to our dining room! It shines beautifully on our wall sand makes a statement. Love it!", 
    "I questioned this choice, but my wife was right. This light is perfect. All our neighbors are wanting to know where we got it. We leave the blinds open at night and it looks amazing from the street.", 
    "I bought this chandelier to update my dining room. I wanted a modern look, but a classic feel that would be timeless. I don't enjoy updating my d\u00e9cor every few years to meet the latest trend. This light met those requirements. It is very classy without a big price tag too. It took me about 20 minutes to assemble the lower crystals and my husband about 40 minutes to install it. We discovered a part of the chain link was missing ( a d-ring buckle) but was still able to install it. I contacted customer support about the missing part and they were very easy to work with and promised to send the part. I love the way the crystal light illuminates and projects a beautiful pattern on my walls.", 
    "love the way it brightens our partners desk. Make working at home a joy.", 
    "Beautiful piece. Great value.", 
    "More beautiful in person.", 
    "I was hesitant on purchasing this chandelier based on the price point, but once we got it put up I have had no regrets. Like other reviewers have mentioned if you get the sparkle effect bulbs it makes a huge different with a beautiful underwater effect.The finish is a very dark oiled bronze almost black color. The crystals were simple to attach and didn't take much time at all, I love my chandelier and find myself walking past the room several times a day just to admire it - highly recommended!", 
    "Looks intimidating when you first get it out of the box, but all the crystals are actually already assembled and you just have to hang them from the appropriate arm. Plenty of extra crystals so no worries there. It is beautiful. Not bright enough to be good for reading under (you can, but it isn't a really brightly-glowing light) just be aware, but it is a great dining room chandelier. Love it.", 
    "We recently renovated our kitchen. These were one of the first things I bought when I was in the dreaming/planning phase of the remodel. About 4 months after I bought them, we finally started the remodel. Now, they are finally up and they really make the kitchen. My white custom shaker-style cabinets with black soapstone was beautiful to begin with - a dream come true. But once my husband hung these two chandeliers over our big island, it became breathtaking. Everyone comments on them. Even my 15 year old son said he liked them! It is a nice touch of elegance in a very timeless black and white kitchen. They were not very difficult to install. Took a little time hooking all the crystals on once it was hung, but soooo worth it. I am very happy with these!", 
    "Mounted this as the focal point in the dining room. Looks amazing!", 
    "This lighting fixture is so beautiful in my home and just what I was looking for!!", 
    "Gorgeous, easy assembled.", 
    "I love the look of the chandelier, it's very pretty and looks great in my dining room. BUT I'm getting a bunch of web shadows on the walls when I turn it on. It's rather spooky - has this happened to any other users?", 
    "Love the chandelier. It is everything I expected & looks just as amazing in person.", 
    "This fixture is the perfect combination of modern and old world elegant. And when the light are on and shining through the fixture, it creates a lovely textured pattern on the walls. I love it. I would have given it 5 stars but it had a terrible smell when I took it out of the box (as so many made in China products do)and I was worried that the smell wouldn't go away. After a few days with a fan blowing, the smell finally did go away.", 
    "Perfect for master bedroom", 
    "This lamp has an oiled bronze stem that connects to the ceiling, the rest (the rounded shade) is black, and the crystals are very nice. It looks amazing with the ceiling medallion that I just added. Since there are four bulbs, you can get away with using 40-watt, frosted bulbs and still have plenty of light. Great buy!", 
    "I fell in love the moment the lights came on and the reactions of friends just confirms it is an awesome fixture. It works in every way; looks, function and bling factor.", 
    "Even prettier than on the website. LOVE this light! It looks Amazing in my Master Bath.", 
    "I get lots of compliments on this light..we love it and the light from it is great.", 
    "Great value and very classy!", 
    "I bought this for my formal dining room that needed some \"pop\". This did the trick! It is my favorite light in my entire house. I did what another buyer suggested and put the frosted bulbs in so it wasn't such harsh lighting. I DO recommend this also. Very pleased with my purchase!", 
    "This is a beautiful chandelier. It was easy to install. I had my 13 year old son and my 9 year old daughter help me with the installation! It looks beautiful.", 
    "I have this in my kitchen. I get so many compliments. Beautiful when the lights are on and off.", 
    "I bought this light for my dining room. I think it looks fabulous. it's the perfect size. It is nice quality, and very unique. It looks very true to the pictures. I have seen very similar items at Z Gallerie for a lot more money!!", 
    "I turned my dining room into a \"girl cave\" and it looks great in the space with my white leather couch and teal chair. Adds bling to my room. Wasn't difficult to put the crystals on it. Husband put up light without any issues. Love the shadowing that it displays on the wall. Shadowing is more prominent on lighter color wall.", 
    "Hung this in my bedroom and just love it! Great purchase", 
    "With the chandelier over our dining table it is absolutely stunning", 
    "Makes a fun shadow on the wall at night and is a nice statement piece. I have gotten lots of compliments!", 
    "I put this light over my vanity in my master bath. Not easy to put together though. But I am happy with the purchase.", 
    "Love, Love, Love this light! Delivery was fast and product was not damaged! My son installed and it looks beautiful over my breakfast table!", 
    "Chose this piece for our stairway lighting. It is absolutely gorgeous. Changes the feel of the room to class and elegance. Rainbow prisms on the wall when lit. I LOVE IT", 
    "Beautiful chandelier. Easy to install, came with x-tra parts. Great price. Quick delivery.", 
    "Beautiful in dining room.", 
    "This is an absolutely stunning light. Everyone that sees it wants one. Color is more on the black side than antique bronze. When lit, it leaves patterns all over my walls and ceiling. Had it professionally installed but worth every penny!", 
    "I shopped around and this is by far the nicest quality at the cost. I purchased two chandeliers from Overstock not knowing how they would look in person and was pleasantly surprised that I had two great options. This one was the winner simply because it has all the sparkle on the drum shade. The crystals are plastic but heavy and a pretty nice quality. Also, the crystals that you hang from the bottom were exactly the same on this one and the other chandelier I purchased (quantity and quality) so that should not be a factor if you are trying to decide between two versions on Overstock (I also purchased the Indoor 4-light Chrome Antique Bronze Chandelier). The crystals cast a rainbow when the light hits it just right. There is a cast on the walls from the unique shade but I think it is beautiful. Highly recommend this chandelier!", 
    "This fixture has just the right amount of glitz without being too much. I have a very contemporary mixed with traditional style and this matches perfectly. I knew I liked it online but in person it's just beautiful! A few of the crystals fell off in shipping but were very easy to put back on and took about 5 min.", 
    "It's so much nicer than I thought it would be. Friends compliment it everytime they come over. It was time consuming to put the crystals on but really easy. Great purchase", 
    "quality exceeded expectations", 
    "I love my new Chandelier. Very Classy. Happy Customer!", 
    "It's been a couple of years since I purchased and installed this light in my dining room. I still love it as much as I did when it was new. To me, it has a \"masculine\" feel, which is perfect for how I am trying to decorate.", 
    "looks very expensive and adds so much to my dining room. I've got ton do many compliments and questions as to where I purchased it. You won't be disappointed", 
    "Crystals were already assembled on shade. Installed by electrician. Good quality chandelier. Much prettier in person!", 
    "I get so many compliments when people come into our home!'", 
    "We decided to add a little bling to our master bedroom and love the way this light looks. Very nice fixture for a reasonable price.", 
    "Loved it, it was perfect!", 
    "I put this chandelier in my entry way. The size is perfect for the room and it looks stunning. Creates a lot of interesting shadows on the walls and it gives plenty of light at the same time.", 
    "I was looking for a light fixture that looked nice and put out good light...this definitely does it. Love the way it looks in my dining room.", 
    "This chandelier looks gorgeous in our dining room! It casts a beautiful pattern all over the walls and ceiling. My only issue is that it hangs a little crooked, but that might be the way we have the chain; we may need to fiddle with it a little. Other than that, we absolutely love it and cannot believe how little it cost!", 
    "This light is even nicer in person, love it", 
    "Everyone who walks into the home compliments this light fixture", 
    "This is a great piece for my small dining room. I highly recommend. It did not take much to put the crystals on. Its a beautiful fixture and looks much more expensive than it is.", 
    "Very nice light fixture. I would buy again. Beautiful hanging above my staircase.", 
    "I received the light fixture promptly. I read many wonderful reviews and the chandelier lives up to its compliments. It is sturdy and well made for the great price. Look forward to hanging it in my master bedroom!", 
    "This chandelier is just perfect for my formal dining room. It arrived well packaged and was easy to assemble and install. It's the perfect update by being traditional, yet modern with the right amount of sparkle. It's particularly beautiful at night!", 
    "Great, beautiful, gave the room the right kind of drama and the lighting that came through was beautiful.", 
    "love it... very pretty and sparkly... shows a nice pattern on walls when lit", 
    "I bought two of these one for my master bath and one for my master closet. They are well made and look absolutely beautiful near my double slipper tub.", 
    "You have to be patient, when assembling this piece! It is worth taking time with it! Great result at the end! Shimmering lights everywhere! Many compliments !", 
    "I LOVE this light. Is mostly black which I wanted. You can see all the little facets of light on the wall when it's on. It even sparkles when it's not on.", 
    "After searching every lighting website possible and returning several lights I found this chandelier on Overstock. I depend on the reviews of fellow shoppers and this light had very positive ones, I can see why... It is absolutely gorgeous!! I noticed several reviewers saying how adding the crystals took some time; however, I found that not to be an issue at all. I have never installed a light myself but with the arms of my husband I installed it! My style (this year) would be a rustic elegant and this light adds just the right amount of \"glam\" over my dining room table! The light refracting off of the crystals throws a beautiful show onto ceiling and walls. At night it is stunning! It is a show stopper and pairs very well with my heavy wood beams and stone floors. I love this light! Now I need to find two coordinating lights to go over my rustic island! Thanks Overstock for the great buy and free shipping!!", 
    "My husband and I purchased this chandelier for our new master bedroom and absolutely love it! The quality of the product is great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone in search of a chandelier. My favorite thing aside from the look of it is the effect it casts on the walls when it shines through. This product deserves 5 stars!", 
    "Looks great and very easy to assemble. Satisfied with quality.", 
    "We put this in our entry way - swapping out the old brass fixture. It completely changes the look of the entryway/living room area. It's just gorgeous.", 
    "After reading lot of reviews i bought this chandelier, i must say it looks amazing over my kitchen island. Its actually made for foyer/dining room but i wanted to hang it on the island, i just had to cut the wire short. I have got lots and lots of compliments for my chandelier. The light reflected from the crystals looks beautiful. It looks more expensive than its actual price!! I would definitely recommend it.", 
    "This took a little time to put all the crystals on but is really pretty at night and reflects light all around the room", 
    "Love this light. It is even nicer in person. Put it in my master bedroom and it looks beautiful.", 
    "I have this in my bedroom and it's gorgeous! Nice sparkle and lends sophistication to the room. You have to be prepared for the shadows that it casts with all of the glass bits...it's a bit overwhelming at first, but I quickly got used to it and now I love it! I bought one in chrome for use downstairs.", 
    "I really enjoy this light. It's even nicer then I thought it would look in my dining room. I only had one issue with the closure piece that hides the wiring in the ceiling, but otherwise very satisfied.", 
    "I bought this for our foyer and it adds so much elegance without being a traditional chandelier. The photo really doesn't do it justice - more sparkle than comes across which made me love it even more.", 
    "I bought this for a clients master bathroom and it looked absolutely beautiful in her bathroom...the master bath was done in a zebra theme and this just went so good in there it was really easy to install. If you're thinking about it order it you will love it", 
    "A beautiful light for the cost. After reading all the great reviews, I was super excited to receive my order. It is just beautiful and makes the room pop.", 
    "I bought two of these to go over my dining room table. I like the look of more than one. You can probably get by with just one, but I like the added light on our long, barn-style table.", 
    "I love this chandelier it's so beautiful I get so many compliments and it was super easy to install", 
    "After reading all the reviews on this chandelier and comparing to others on here I decided to purchase this one and I'm one very satisfied customer. My husband and I installed this in less than 5 minutes above our dining room table. I was able to hang the crystals within 10 minutes myself. I did purchase a chain cover on etsy since I'm not much of a fan of exposed chains and it added the perfect touch. Highly recommend this and in fact, I bought the matching flush mount and will buy matching pendent lights that will go above my bar.", 
    "We love this Chandelier, we have it in our foyer and we can see it from the street! It is absolutely beautiful and the crystals are stunning! It has that simple but elegant look!", 
    "I ordered this because all the reviews were great and they were all true. This looks great in my dining room. It is not the brightest if that is something you need. I have a dimmer switch and it does work. It was easy to put the hanging crystals on. Overstock also had the best price I found. Fast delivery and well packed. Great quality for great price.", 
    "Very pretty and functional piece. Puts out plenty of light and looks perfect doing so. I used this piece to make over my closet. Perfect!!", 
    "This chandelier is amazing!", 
    "Installed this in our entryway. The installation process was a lot faster than we thought. The most time consuming part was adding the crystals at the end. It looks beautiful!", 
    "Such a perfect piece. Everyone loves it. Perfect size!", 
    "We have hung it over our kitchen table and it brings a exciting dimension to our kitchen with its slate tile floors, dark granite counters and wood cabinets. Awesomeness!", 
    "Such a beautiful chandelier!!' The picture does not do it just at all!! Anyone who has seen it has commented on how stunning it is. It casts a beautiful pattern on the wall when lit almost giving the room a Moroccan theme feel. It's easily my favorite part of my dining room. I suggest if your considering it to buy it! You will love it", 
    "This chandelier is very nice. I love it, hung it in our master bedroom sitting room area. Elegant and good quality for the price.", 
    "beautiful, sparkles but even my husband likes it, easy install", 
    "Beautiful chandelier, matches my dark British antique furniture very well.", 
    "This light is stunning..... easy to install, comes with lots of extra parts and tons of extra crystals... I use this with a Lutron dimming lightswitch and 4 LED dimming candelabra bulbs that are 4 watts each... this light goes from romantic and sparkly when dim... to stunning and sparkly when bright. I now have 3 of these and 6 of the ones without the crystals that hang down... just buy it, you'll love it!", 
    "This chandelier! So beautiful! It's so classy, really gave our bedroom a chic boutique hotel feel! It sparkles so so much, I sometimes find myself just staring at it, mesmerized! If you want a jaw dropper, get this chandelier! Everyone that sees it, loves it! It wasn't very difficult to install either, very basic.", 
    "It's exactly what we were looking for.", 
    "This chandalier grabs everyone's attention who comes over. It's gorgeous! Only downside was the cord was a little shorter than what we needed", 
    "beautiful, high end looking, and has been looking awesome in our brand new home! I get LOTS of complements on it. More black ish in color.", 
    "Put this in the area in front of our wine room. I was afraid it was going to be junk in person because it was so inexpensive but it really is rather beautiful. Great find!", 
    "I purchased this for my home 4 years ago and I always receive compliments on how beautiful it is. It looks much more expensive than it actually costs. The chandelier is really elegant and has a nice transitional feel- traditional yet contemporary. The \"crystals\" sparkle beautifully. Its a great piece!", 
    "I had this in the entry in my house. It sparkled and lit up the area so beautifully. When people walked in the front door, everyone commented on it. Definite WOW factor.I just moved to a new home and it works just as beautifully in my dining room. I love, love, love this chandelier. Real glass baubles, not plastic, yet not to heavy for ordinary installation. Bracing not necessary.", 
    "this item is truly more gorgeous in person then on the site. Very high quality and easy to install. It is the perfect mix of modern and classical. You can't go wrong with this piece.", 
    "This was initially purchased to go in our dining room, but in my opinion, it was just a little too small. However, it was absolutely perfect for my daughter's bedroom and casts a very cool effect on the walls and ceiling. This light looks similar (in photos) to some that you see in the hardware stores, but it is significantly better in person than those. When you see both up close, this looks to be at least 3x more expensive.", 
    "Everyone who sees it, oohs and awes. It is simply beautiful. Hung from a tray ceiling in my master. Throws a beautiful rainbow on the walls. I love it!!!!", 
    "Love, Love, Love!!! We get a compliment every time someone sees it!!!", 
    "I love this chandelier, it adds the right amount of bling to my formal diningroom!!!! Don't hesitate to buy this chandelier. You won't be disappointed!!!!", 
    "Super glam lamp. It's actually more beautiful in person. The pieces are real crystal.", 
    "This is a beautiful chandelier...I only wish it were slightly larger. I have high ceilings and it not as visible being that size. But for a standard ceiling, it would be amazing!", 
    "Gorgeous!!! I love love it! Hanging beautifully in my living room. Awesome Glitz for a contemporary space. I also have the two tier matching chandelier hanging over my dining room. Highly recommended.", 
    "Beautiful chandelier. Yes acrylic \"crystals\" but looks stunning. High up enough that you can't tell. Highly recommend.", 
    "In Love!!!!!! Renovating entire first floor and this is the jewel in the crown. I previously had a modern style light in the dining room but it looked so sterile. This is the perfect amount of bling in my new loft/industrial look. SO happy!", 
    "I am in love with this light fixture. Just the right amount of bling. The prisms on the ceiling make it even more beautiful. My husband said it was really simple to install.", 
    "gorgeous!!! made my bathroom complete!", 
    "Put this chandelier n my closet. Omg gorgeous!!! Totally worth every penny!!!", 
    "I LOVED this chandelier. The material is great. It looks classy and not cheap looking. The shipping went smoothly and they made sure to carefully package it in two boxes and lots of foam.", 
    "Love this chandelier !!! It is So pretty on and off. When on it cast a Lacey shadow around all the walls. You will Not be disappointed !!!!", 
    "I bout this Chandelier in December and every time I walk into my Diningroom and say to myself \"I am so glad I bought this fixture\" I is very elegant but not too fussy. I highly recomment. Very easy to put the crystals on.", 
    "Love this light! It sends prisms around the room.", 
    "I bought this chandelier for my sun room. It looks beautiful and I love its sparkle. It is great quality for the price and I had no problems at all with hanging the crystals or hanging the chandelier. You will love it!", 
    "It took us about 2 hours to put this chandelier up and it was all worth the time and efforts. We texted the picture of it to our friends and family and they all loved it and some even asked us to send them a link so they could place a purchase. After reading a number of reviews regarding this item prior to purchase, we decided to go with a frosted 40W light bulbs and it was the right decision. The crystal will bounce the lighting off of the wall and if you don't want to turn your dinning room into a disco dancing floor, you should stick with frosted light bulbs. Our dinning room is painted with light grey color with big white crown molding. Adding this chandelier makes the room looks very modern, luxurious without being overstated.", 
    "Very unique and lovely. Had to return because my style changed, but otherwise very nice, indeed.", 
    "outstanding pretty than the picture crystals are beautiful!", 
    "Easy to put the crystals on and hang (2 person job), and by fair much more beautiful in person...love it!!", 
    "I am so happy with my purchase. I bought product to replace my old dining room chandelier. It's simply amazing and just completes the glam for both my living and dining rooms. Simply can't stop gazing at it. It's definitely an eye catcher and would suite any room. Just giddy!!!!!", 
    "It is absolutely beautiful. It took me and my husband about an hour to assemble and install...", 
    "This is the most gorgeous chandelier. The crystals around the drum of the chandelier reflect so beautifully on the walls. When the light shines through them, they give off all of the spectrums of the rainbow. Love, love, love it.", 
    "Looks gorgeous on and off! The crystals reflect off onto my entire dining & living room spaces. Great price!!!", 
    "I just had this fixture installed and it is so pretty! When it's on at night there is a pattern on my walls. I really love it !",

    "Beautiful! I get compliments all the time on this chandelier. It looks very expensive.", 
    "This item looks better than the picture, and we didn't have that hard of a time putting it together.", 
    "I bought the Melinda 3-light Antique Bronze/ Crystal Flush-mount Chandelier to go with this and have had tons of compliments on them. the color is exactly as shown in the picture and is very easy to put together.", 
    "Love love love my new dining room light. Other reviewers commented on how beautiful the light shines throw the crystals day and night. It's true!!! This light came mostly assembled, instructions stated to unfasten the bottom part of the crystals and secure each top clasp. I started doing this and found it took too long. Still looks beautiful.", 
    "A perfect pick for our dining room makeover.", 
    "A very pretty light and I love the black. A little edgy and glamorous at the same time.", 
    "Hanging in my hair salon. Received so many comllaments. Very happy with purchase.", 
    "Beautiful light! Great quality", 
    "This makes our dining room sparkle. Thank you to other reviewers for commenting on the patterns the light makes on the walls. Not many crystals to assemble, so was quick.", 
    "I love, love, love this chandelier. It's definitely a conversation piece as it's the first thing you see when you walk in my door. It's sits atop my lovely westmont 5-piece dining set. Stunning!", 
    "I absolutely love this light and I get so many compliments on it. It does cast a bit of shadows that resemble a disco ball (according to my husband) onto the walls but I don't even notice it it's such a beautiful light and very reasonably priced.", 
    "This is THE prettiest chandelier! I had my electrician assemble it so I don't know how difficult it was, but it's perfect over the dining room table. It's a wonderful sparkler, without having a ton of pendants hanging down for me to clean. I have it on a dimmer switch, & no matter what level of brightness it makes a gorgeous pattern all over the walls of the room at night. When it's off in the daytime, the light coming in the windows makes it sparkle then too. It looks updated with the \"drum shade,\" but it's a bonus that the shade is made of crystal!", 
    "i've gotten so many compliments on this piece. its simple yet it stands out", 
    "Bought a home an wanted this over my table", 
    "More beautiful than pictured! You won't be disappointed!", 
    "I put this light fixture in my dining room. The crystals below the fixture need to be attached by hand (20 minutes) - the crystals in the black orb were already attached. For the price - the glamour it adds to a room - it is a great buy. Not a huge fan of the chain and would prefer a more linear look with an inclusive wire. Item was smaller than expected so make sure to read measurements. Also - smelled strange when taken out of box - maybe the paint?", 
    "Hung this fixture over the tub in my newly remodeled bathroom. It is stunning!", 
    "This light is awesome and exactly as all the reviews I read about it. Casts a beautiful glow all over the walks", 
    "I would buy this again. Beautiful easy to install. Worth the money.", 
    "This is a STUNNING chandelier at a GREAT price!!! It took a bit of doing to get all the crystals on, but goodness, once it was up, it shimmers and glows and looks simply wonderful!! It's a fun juxtaposition of rustic and elegant .... a great shabby chic look! The crystals make prisms on the wall in the day and at night, lovely interplay of shadow and light. It's gorgeous!!! Highly recommend!!", 
    "Neat chandelier that is visually heavy and important. Pretty, cut glass and molded glass that shines almost as well as cut crystal. Great look for the money.", 
    "Really nice chandelier. The crystals hanging on the bottom give it that extra wow factor. I had it professionally installed along with other lighting, but it took the electrician all of 10 minutes.", 
    "Wow! When it is turned on, my whole bedroom sparkles!", 
    "I ordered this for our master bedroom and it so stunning. It looks really elegant and is super bright. It cast a design on the ceiling and walls when lit. The size is perfect for a large bedroom. I also love that they sent a ton of replacement crystals.", 
    "This is so nice, I bought it twice! One for my old house, and now for my new house to go over my bathtub. Everyone who sees it loves it! It looks far more expensive than it is, with minimal assembly required.", 
    "This lovely chandelier is the perfect balance between traditional and modern. We love the drum shape. The crystals through beautiful reflections of light on the walls, which creates a romantic ambience without being too feminine or over-the-top. It gets rave comments from guests. Low maintenance.", 
    "Love this chandelier! It's hanging right now over my distressed kitchen table. Love the contrast! Well packaged, easy to install (I only had to hang the dangling crystals) and a great price! Highly recommend!", 
    "The chandelier arrived in a timely manner. All of the crystals in the \"shade\" were intact. The hanging crystals were easy to attach. My husband installed the lamp in less than a half-hour. It looks great in our large kitchen The crystals to make a design on the wall but that doesn't bother me. We have the lamp on a dimmer. The price was great. We couldn't be happier.", 
    "Purchased for my dining room even though their is no table. I only used 2 or links and no one hits their head on it. Looks very pretty. The only exception is I thought it was going to be a darker bronze - it actually looks black. My brother put it together and said adding the crystals took the most time. Recommend", 
    "I love this chandler. I put it in a guest bedroom and it looks beautiful.", 
    "This is beautiful. Its hard to find nice lights at a reasonable price with the bronze finish. I hung this above my bathroom makeup vanity! Nothing but compliments.", 
    "Very satisfied with this chandlier. Match beautifully with my home decor. But it adds glamore and shine to my home. Blends everything together. I made the right choice. My family loves it too.", 
    "I have been shopping for a long time for the right light and it was well worth the wait. I love this chandelier and everything about it. The bronze color with the crystals is such a great combination. The crystals really stand out against the dark frame. It's both simple yet elegant looking at the same time. Easy to hang and looks stunning when lit. I wish it came in other sizes such as a single hanging pendant for over my island. Overall, a really great buy.", 
    "I absolutely love this chandelier. I read and read the reviews and was pleasantly surprised that this was such an easy assembly product. The fixture is georgous and everyone who sees it thinks it's from some expensive lighting place, but of course overstock has once again given me a beautiful product at a fraction of the price.", 
    "Really beautiful, might hang slightly crooked but I think we can alter that by skewing the metal a bit. Thanks!", 
    "First off this light is really easy to install. I replaced an 8 light chandelier in the kitchen with this 4 light chandelier and this chandelier actually gives off more light due to the light refracting off of the crystals. The light shining through the crystals creates this really cool pattern on the walls. We are very pleased the way it updated the kitchen. Buy it you won't be disappointed.", 
    "Was skeptical about buying it, but it adds class to my entryway. Just beautiful and not too big", 
    "Mre beautiful than the picture, very nice quality. Very satisfied", 
    "Really sparkles, looks way more expensive and I'm very picky, can't wait to put it up. got it for my master bedroom, but may put in my dining room so everyone can enjoy it. Truly lovely. Dont think twice, get one!", 
    "This light gave our entrance hallway pizazz. beautiful crystals reflect the light. Instructions say can use up to 60w bulbs, but we ended up changing the 60s to 40w and like the effect a lot more.", 
    "It is better than the picture, a must buy", 
    "Very happy with this chandelier!! Shipped super fast. Assembly was fairly simple. Looks so beautiful!! Allows light to flow through out the room. Sparkles everywhere!! Looks amazing and so much nicer than photo... Excellent price!!!", 
    "Works well to bling things up, but has a masculine feel too, because of the wrought iron features.", 
    "Pretty and at a very reasonable price.", 
    "Hanging over the dining room table..... We love it", 
    "I bought this light for my dinning room and I'm in love. It looks even better in person.", 
    "I'm happy with this purchase. It is just as I expected. Dimensions were correct. You can leave off the longest crystals at the bottom if you have low ceilings.", 
    "This chandelier is awesome! I put a dimmer on it and wow looks great.", 
    "I'm 62 yrs. old, need glasses to see anything close and I put this chandelier up myself in a couple of hours. Crystals took about an hour (wires are like tiny key rings, I suggest snub nosed pliers) but, the results are SPECTACULAR! Never been a crystal fan, but, this transcends my concern that it would appear gaudy. I can't imagine any d\u00e9cor where this would not be \"just the right touch\". I truly am very pleased.", 
    "Beautiful Chandelier. Very nice quality. My husband didn't have a hard time putting it together or installing it at all. It does cast a patterned light around the room because of the shade but it is a nice soft effect.", 
    "This is a very beautiful chandelier. I had it installed today as I am not terribly handy. I was very happy with how it looks over my dining table. My dining space is not large and my table isn't huge (42\") so the 17\" diameter drum was just perfect. I had a dimmer switch put on to save electricity and the dimming effect was gorgeous. The hanging crystals are indeed glass. It takes a little time to hang them but is really quite easy and outlined in the instructions as to how to hang. I already have sent pictures to all my family and friends with positive feedback. It is not black in color but a very dark brown/bronze color. Just what I wanted for my polished-casual design style. I am so relieved I no longer have to look for pendants or chandeliers for my dining space. This one is going to be up for a long time to come.", 
    "Excellent value for the price. Looks beautiful over my dining room table.", 
    "I could not be happier with my light! It is totally beautiful! It has so much bling and style. It was easy to put up and the added crystals were so easy to put on. There were three of us, and it probably took about 20 minutes to put them on. I am so excited, it's just fun to see the bling in my dining room. The sun shines through the windows and my light just sparkles, which I love. The reflections it puts off at night are striking. I never would have the light on at night, now it is! I can turn it down to a soft glow and it just makes the house look cozy. If you are having second thoughts on getting this beautiful light, I would say go for it! It's just too much fun!", 
    "Looks high end! Great price for a stylish chandelier.", 
    "Closely resembles Restoration Hardware piece. It was a little smaller than anticipated, but stunning none-the-less.", 
    "The quality of this chandelier is excellent. It looks like it should be priced much higher. What an excellent price and product. I was a little leary because of the price but wow am I happy I bought it. So many compliments. When people come in the house the first thing they say is wow. So glad I bought this.", 
    "Needed something eye catching but not over the top for my entry way. This fit perfectly! I've received so many compliments. Looks great and expensive", 
    "I bought this for over my dining table in our open concept modern living area. It's so cool and amazing. It better in person . the color variation people mention doesn't bug me .. it looks great. Don't hesitate.", 
    "Good Lighting but does give shadows on the table. It looks great all lit up", 
    "All joking aside this is a gorgeous light fixture. It puts out a lot of sparkle and is really beautiful in our dining room. Ours came with all the crystals attached, minus the dangling ones. LOVE love love it. Such a bargain!", 
    "I got two of this one to put on top of my kitchen island our ceilings are 12' they are black, the crystals are glad but they are not that shining they look a little bit like plastic but they are not. I took the plastic ball that it's on the bottom off and it was easy just because it looked cheap. It was easy to assemble", 
    "We purchased two of these and they look great above our nine foot table..", 
    "Beautiful light!!! I have this hanging in my bathroom above my tub and the light it puts off is beautiful!.", 
    "This is the most beautiful chandelier and everyone always compliments it when they walk into my kitchen. Yes, I put it in my kitchen over my table and it looks amazing. I also have similar fixtures I purchased that match this. One for my entry way, and one for my closet. All of them are stunning and cast this beautiful shadow effect when lit. I do have dimmer switches on all of those as the are very bright fixtures. I would highly recommend this fixture.", 
    "The most gorgeous chandelier ever! I have been looking for years for a replacement for our dining room. As soon as I saw this I was in love! I seriously cannot stop gazing at it! Stunning to say the least! If you are on the fence about this fixture, get off! Buy it, you will not be disappointed. The light bounces off all the crystals and it is just beautiful. Love, love, love it!", 
    "Haven't installed yet. We move into our new home in Dec. This is just as beautiful right out of the box as it is on line. Can't wait to get it put up in my powder room. There are several small pics. In the box I have to put together to add the glass crystals on the chandelier.", 
    "Very nice chandelier with a modern touch. Easy to install but if you are planning to have it very high up, it may be hard to clean... like any other chandelier really.", 
    "We bought a townhouse and my husband decided he really wanted a glitzy chandelier in the dining room. We picked this one out in chrome before seeing it in the bronze and I'm so glad we ended up choosing the bronze. It is glamorous and beautiful without being over the top. We absolutely love the look it gives to the room. The style, shape, color, the way the crystals drop, the light that shines on the walls, and the sparkle... all of it is stunning. Up close, the crystals look cheap. They're all scratched up. However, for the price we paid and the upgraded look it gives our home was well worth it.", 
    "It's large enough to provide light to our very big bathroom. No complaints.", 
    "We actually didn't put all of the hanging crystals, it wasn't needed, but it's a very lovely light and conversation piece, I really like it!", 
    "Love this chandelier over my dining table. Its an added level of luxury to the room and draws the eye from every angle. The quality of the crystals are good quality.", 
    "Love, love this. Beautiful chandelier. Putting the tear drops on, did take some time, but well worth it.", 
    "Omg love love this chandelier.I wanted one to scream glam and this did it for me. It took us a half and hr to put crystals on. Hubby had no issues installing at all. But he is handy. It such a pretty chandelier I keep walking past my dining room.", 
    "Everyone that walks into my small home comments on the very sexy, lovely light in my dining area.", 
    "We bought this light for our entry way, which isn't a very big space with a 9ft ceiling. This light is spectacular and just the right size for this area. The crystals are really nice and do not look cheap at all. I wish we had higher ceilings so that I could've let it hang more from the chain because we had to really shorten the length of it to about a foot but it still hangs down low enough that you can still see its beauty. The color is a very dark bronze, almost black when you look closely but hanging up I don't really notice the black so much as when the light is turned on you can see the dark bronze coming through. I also purchased the 2 tier 3 light fixture that is a smaller version for my office/study which is off to the right of the entry and they flow together really well. My husband and I, who know very little about installing light fixtures, were able to put this up fairly easily. Putting the crystals on wasn't that big of a deal to me as I just did it sitting in front of the tv. I was so anxious to get this light put up I didn't even think about it. I have gotten lots of compliments on this light and when it is turned on it is stunning. One of my friends came to my house for the first time last week and as soon as she saw my light she told me she had gotten the exact same one from Overstock for her Master Bath. What a coincidence!", 
    "It is perfect for our dining room. It gives a warm glow over the table. It looks like twinkling diamonds from every angle. Beautiful. If you like bling this is the fixture for you.", 
    "This looks absolutely stunning above my small round table in my dining room! I have the pendents in my kitchen but did not use the crystals on the pendents so that we do not have too much bling...", 
    "Ok, I will start out by saying I NEVER write reviews. This light fixture is almost life changing lol. It was easy to put together it's gorgeous during the day when the light hits it and at night, look out. It's casts the most beautiful refracted light all over the ceiling and walls. I felt like a little kid looking at my first christmas tree!!!! We are building a home and I spent some serious cash on custom light fixtures all over the house. This overstock fixture is my FAVORITE!! At a fraction of what the other fixtures cost. I can't imagine anyone regretting this purchase!", 
    "I had the chandelier professionally installed in my stairway. It is slightly more black than bronze. The crystals were not hard to attach ,they pull apart & push back together easily, it takes about 10 minutes to attach them. I used LED chandelier bulbs that I purchased at Costco. The effect on the wall is stunning, I'm really in love with this light fixture, it was the finishing touch that I needed. It was securely packaged for shipping, extra parts are included in the box.", 
    "Have this in my dining room, it looks really nice. would fit a small place not a big dining room.", 
    "If you are looking for a touch of bling in your space at adorable price, this is the product for you! Used in 2 of these in a master bedroom on dimmers to ass great drama and sparkle to the space. If you prefer a more traditional look I would not recommend this for you. However, contemporary and transitional design lovers may adore this piece.", 
    "I love this chandelier. I installed it as more of a flush mount because I don't have very high ceilings in my bedrooms, so I shortened the chain to about 5 inches. It was a little difficult to install, but now that it is up, I love it! I love the sparkle and the shadow that it casts on my walls. This is worth the money. I have been looking at similar chandeliers for three times the amount. People are right when they say it is very dark bronze, but the \"old world rustic bronze\" is almost black. It only took me about 20 minutes to put on all the crystals, so I'm not sure what is taking other people so long. I bought a similar one for my other bedroom and is coming in the mail today...I can't wait to put it up!", 
    "The chandelier is beautiful, but I can't say that the crystals are real. The color is more black than antique, which was what I was hoping for. When the chandelier is on, the \"crystal\" beads are very shimmery from the outside looking it. At night, the chandelier cannot be used as the only source of light. It doesn't give off enough light to light up the entire room. I have another chandelier that I have on the same time, so it is not so bad. Overall a fantastic purchase for the price that I got it for, and it was pretty easy to wire and put together. I am extremely grateful that the beads on the drum were already installed.", 
    "This chandelier is absolutely stunning, easy to install and great overall value. Looks terrific in our entryway", 
    "my dining room suffered major water damage this summer when a tenant improperly installed his air conditioner. The entire ceiling a part of a wall had to be replaced and we were unable to use the room (and the living room where all the furniture was moved to) all summer. What good timing for an ad to pop up with this chandelier pictured! Seeing the room finished with this beautiful piece as a focus made the whole experience bearable.", 
    "I have never received so many complements on a light fixture! Absolutely beautiful and stylish!!!", 
    "Idk...I have it hanging over my table and it is a nice light, I love the real crystals on the bottom very much...I just am not sold on the 'drum' part of it and the 'crystals' in the holes in the drum are plastic and have that plastic, rainbow type sheen to them that looks cheap to me. Now that the fake 'crystals' in the drum are a bit dusty after a few months I like the light more lol...I did not like that fake sheen on them. This light will stay for awhile even though I am unsure of it's style being right for me.", 
    "I have purchased many light fixtures in the past but this surpasses them all. It was easy to install and the way it turns an ordinary room into a place of elegance is only to be seen.", 
    "Love it! Just what I was looking for for my formal dining area.", 
    "This is a very unique light; however, it doesn't quite work with the style of my home. A little too retro looking. I would still recommend it, though, as it is cool - you just need the right space/balance. Regardless, I had to write a review due to the outstanding customer service that I received. The first light that arrived was damaged - one of the wires was torn. I called customer service & could not have asked for a better result - a new light arrived the very next day - amazing!!! Although, I am returning the light, I am extremely pleased with the whole experience & will shop for a replacement on Overstock. Risk-free shopping is hard to beat!", 
    "I love this chandelier. It is just the right mix of metal and crystal to make it beautiful but not too fancy!", 
    "This was actually purchased for my Mothers dining room. It looks spectacular! She loves it! It really looks like a much more expensive piece. I have seen similar lamps at stores for 4+ times the overstock price! Once again I am happy with my overstock purchase and highly recommend this item.", 
    "I love this light! It is classy and elegant. The quality seems good and it looks even better in the dark, crystals glow. FYI smaller light bulb size.", 
    "I only had to put together the crystals that hang from the chandelier so it was very easy. I love the light that reflects off of it.", 
    "The shade was loosen from the sticks where it should be hanged. When I took it out of the package I realized it was loose. I don't know if it was already shipped in that condition. Today I showed it to my husband and another when loose!! So it cannot be hanged. I contacted customer service yesterday and no news from them. This is an expensive item for such a poor and bad quality. Very disappointed. to make matters worse, I moving to my home country so I'm not going to have time to get an exchange or replace. Money wasted to the trash bin. Beside, it is not crystal or any glass, JUST PLASTIC. If I live again in USA I'll never again buy from Overstock. Not recommended. Total Disappointment.", 
    "This chandelier is beautiful. Looks great in my formal living room", 
    "LOVE IT...It really is gorgeous...got it for my bedroom but didn't pay attention to dimensions - it's a wee bit too big for our room but over the dining room table - it's perfect.", 
    "The one and only bad thing about this chandelier is that it looks so amazing that one of my sisters and two of my friends now have it in their houses too! HAHA. The crystals give a very slight prism effect as mentioned in other reviews, but it is not overwhelming or tacky. Very nice light, looks MUCH more expensive than what it costs. I would not hesitate to recommend this chandelier.", 
    "Just opened the box and it looks beautiful. Can't wait to get it installed in my formal dining room.", 
    "Love these chandeliers! Got 2 to put above nightstands on either side of bed. Delivery was fast, they were packed well and I was delighted to see all of the little crystals on the shade were already attached. the light diffuses so pretty on the room and sets the stage for the wole room!", 
    "I cannot say enough about this light. It was simple to get the crystals on. It looks AMAZING!!! My boyfriend is not even into this stuff & he said it looked GOOD! It puts off this crazy sequence of sparkling lights against the wall. I just love love love it.", 
    "I decided to change the lighting in my house and wanted something that would catch your eye!! This definately does the job! Beautiful addition to my decor!! Although I had an issue with the 1st chandelier that arrived, part of it was broke but customer service was wonderful in handling my issue and shipped me another chandelier that arrived pretty quick!!", 
    "We had the builder install this in our new house rather than the builder's own standard light. We used it in our nook/eat in kitchen area. This product exceeded my expectations. It's very attractive and unique and when lit up casts a beautiful pattern on the walls. Even the builder was impressed and asked where we got it from. We've received compliments and people are always surprised to hear where it's from. The color is a very dark bronze and matches the other antique bronze light fixtures I purchased from lowe's and pottery barn. People are also surprised at how well it matches the fixtures from other places.", 
    "This chandelier is absolutely gorgeous!! We added a dimmer switch and it so pretty to dim it at night and see the pattern on the wall and ceiling. We hung it in our bathroom and it makes it so elegant ! A lot of reviews said it took a long time to assemble. It took me about 30 minutes to hang all the crystals. The crystals surrounding the round light were already attached. May buy another just like it for another room. You won't be disappointed.", 
    "I've been looking to replace my dining room chandelier for quite a while. Can't believe how much I love this one! So glad I took the chance and ordered it. It is beautiful and the style is not too formal or too contemporary. It is the perfect mix of both! The crystals were not bad at all to install and the shadows on the wall at night that it gives off is amazing- the extra touch of ambiance you never knew was missing! My dining room re-design took me from a more traditional design to a mix of traditional and modern- was going for something similar to the Restoration Hardware look. Highly recommend if you're considering this one! I never found anything I liked better and certainly not for this price!", 
    "All the reviews are right... It is a very pretty light and a great value! I get so many compliments. I would purchase again. If you are afraid a 4 light fixture will not produce enough light...the crystals make it even more luminous. It even glistens when the light is turned off.", 
    "Some of the crystals were scratched and chipped, there are spares but not enough to replace all the damaged ones. I found a website that sells crystals for a good price; crystal prism world dot com, I was able to get more unique crystal styles for under $XX and since the price was so good on this chandelier so I didn't mind spending a little more. The light through the side cast a very pretty pattern on the walls. I got a dimmer switch because it is very bright with 60w bulbs which is good when cleaning but bad when having a relaxing evening. Looks very classy and expensive once hung, the weight of it is a little cheap feeling but the look is not compromised. Overall it is a great product for a great price.", 
    "Coudn't be happier. I read so many reviews stating it was difficult to hang, but my electrician put it up in 5 min, I waited to hang the crystals until after it was up. The small crystals came already attatched with plastic wrapped around protecting it, I again waited to remove until it was hung. I used 40W bulbs, gives off great light. LOVE this chandelier!!", 
    "I loved this. It throws little shadows around making room a unique look very happy", 
    "I absolutely love l, love my chandelier. It sparkles during the day and night, leaving beautiful reflections of the crystals. Gives such a warm feel to the room and a welcoming glow . I get so many compliments and a couple of my friends bought this light after seeing mine. Couldn't be happier, and great price!!!!", 
    "Absolutely worth the price and probably more! It looks more expensive than it is, and is exactly what we wanted for our dining room!", 
    "We love this chandelier! I contemplated buying it for months and finally did it! So pretty and unique and fit perfectly over our dining room table! It is our \"pop\" for the room! It was already put together except adding the last hanging crystals. It took my husband and I about 30 minutes to hang it, and 10 minutes to hang the crystals. Love it!", 
    "I read several reviews about this chandelier, but I had no idea the magnitude of beauty this light displays. I purchased it for our dining room and it is gorgeous. The quality of the product is that of a much more expensive light. We are well pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I purchased this chandelier for our master bath renovation. It was the best decision! It added the right touch of elegance. My husband is extremely handy , so he put crystals on with no problem. Our ceiling is 15 feet high and the length was perfect. I used 60 watt clear bulbs which provided more than adequate lighting. The simmering effect is quite beautiful and romantic. We added a dimmer, which I highly recommend. Our friends were raving about how the chandelier has enhanced our master bath renovation. Don't hesitate to get it. I have no issues. It was well packed. It's more black than bronze , but not an issue for me. It actually complimented our vanity bath lights that are made of iron. Lastly, the price was good.", 
    "The chandelier came exactly how I expected. It is beautiful, but more black brown then bronze color if u are looking for more of a brown metal look. Mine came broken and I was able to return it with a breeze and get a replacement in couple days! Overstock was awesome and quick to respond.", 
    "really nice chandelier but to large for my small foyer...please read the size before ordering", 
    "I'm very happy I took a chance and ordered a light fixture online. The quality is very good.. This chandelier surpassed my expectations. Not only is the style unique, but it looks amazing over my round ornate dining table. When I turned it on for the first time I couldn't believe how the multitude of crystals cast a beautiful damask pattern on the surrounding walls. Thank you, Overstock.com for offering great products!", 
    "I had been eyeing this chandelier for quite a while before I finally ordered it. I am mad at myself for waiting so long because it is absolutely gorgeous. I LOVE it!!! It was just the look I was going for in my dining room. It looks elegant and has just the right amount of bling. It is well worth the price. I had it installed by an electrician and he even commented, \"This is a really nice fixture\". He had it (along with a dimmer switch) installed in about 30-40 mins and took maybe another 10-15 mins to install the hanging crystals. If you are considering buying this...GET IT... you will not be disappointed!!", 
    "Love love love this light!! Very soothing and elegant focal point", 
    "I purchased the chandelier for our dining room and it added that \"finished touch\" to the room. I was also nervous to buy the fixture sight-unseen but I was immediately put to ease when it arrived. The hardware and crystals are of great quality and so pleasing to the eye.", 
    "Absolutely beautiful! Easy to install. Love it, so many compliments. Overstock.com is easy to shop and in a timely manner.", 
    "I love this chandelier! I read many reviews before deciding on this particular light. It was easy to put up. I had an electrician install for me. Took me no time at all to hang the crystals. No, they are NOT glass. They are a plastic material, but they look so lovely. I will say that I DID get one that was black, rather than the bronze. In reading the reviews, I thought I would take my chances and hoped that I would get the bronze color, as that was what I wanted. I was sad to see it was blackish, when my electrician pulled it out of the box. I told him to install it anyway, thinking I would be OK with it. I wasn't. I wanted to REALLY love it and I needed the bronze. I called customer service and they were amazing! I spoke with **** and he couldn't have been nicer. They're sending another one to me and I should receive it tomorrow. (I told him that the electrician was coming back the next week and could they get it to me before then.) He said it would be hand-picked, so as to make sure I DID receive the bronze one this time. We'll see when it arrives tomorrow, but I couldn't have been happier with his response. This is why I love Overstock! They stand behind their products. Thank you for a beautiful light at an affordable price!", 
    "Excellent quality. Compares to $400 items in lighting stores. Easy to assemble and install. Adds just the right bling to my beach condo.", 
    "After reading glowing reviews on this oil bronze drum chandelier with crystals, I first bought one and was fascinated . The drum with the tiny crystals are very well made . It took me an hour to get the larger crystals together but it was doable . The effect is glamorous, goes well with my eclectic furnishings and is a good size for the dining room. I liked it so much I ordered another one for the foyer but I wish it came in a larger size too with a longer chain. I saw similar styles at high end stores for much more. You won't regret buying it. Can't wait to get it installed with the full effects of lighting. I got LED e12 for the foyer and \"crystal cut\" per a reviewers recommendation for the living room.lets see how it works with installation and all!", 
    "I waited 17 years to replace the recessed light in my dining room. I love the mix of old world and modern that this fixture has. If I ever move, the fixture is moving with me.", 
    "WOW...The response of my friends when they see this light. Adds just the right amount of bling to my new bedroom decor. Installed a dimmer and the light sparkles off the wall crating a lovely ambiance. Excellent value & easy enough to install with a handy hubby!", 
    "I love this chandelier! I get complaments on it every time someone comes over. I moved in to an apartment and put this up. It has completely changed my boring dining room in to an amazing dining room.", 
    "This is a very beautiful chandelier! It does look more black than bronze.", 
    "I hung this chandelier in my dining room and it is absolutely stunning! The first one I received was damaged and was immediately replaced - customer service was amazing. This was my first experience with Overstock, but I will certainly use them again.", 
    "This chandelier is really beautiful We hung it in our bedroom and it really made a huge difference. It took 10 minutes to put on the hanging crystals. The ones around the cylinder come already on. You will need to buy E12 bulbs which are bit of a specialty. Hangs pretty easy for do it yourself-ers. I would highly recommend this fixture!", 
    "I was spectacle of purchasing this light fixture. Sometimes it is difficult to determine the actual style of a product by the photos alone, however, I consider this one of my best purchases in years. It is stunning! It truly lights up my entire dining room.", 
    "I love this chandelier! It is so sparkly in real life! I would buy it again in a second if I had a spot for a second one. It is honestly one of my new favorite possessions. So worth the money.", 
    "this item,, it super nice,, looks great.. but quality a little poor,, but overall,, looks amazing when is on", 
    "Beautiful drum chandelier! Purchased to go in my new \"Dream\" closet. The room itself has dark wood floors, white Dupani silk drapes, white walls, and white cabinentry for the closet hanging and storage area. So, this light fixture adds to the whole allure. It casts a beautiful shadow on the walls and gives off ample light in the 10' by 12' closet space!", 
    "Larger than it appears in the picture - not good or bad just seems larger", 
    "I read the reviews, was really excited to get it. I, like another reviewer, squealed with delight when I opened the box. My husband was hesitant, but EVERYONE that walks in comments on how pretty it is. I only wish it was a little bigger. This is my first time writing a review, but I love it so much, I felt compelled.", 
    "We put this light over our dining room table. It puts off a nice amount of light for a dining room but not as much as some of the other chandeliers we purchased from Overstock for our new home. It does reflect a pattern onto the walls when turned on, which I like. Overall, a great light. Oil rubbed bronze color is pretty true to picture and looks lovely.", 
    "The chandelier was great price, but you get what you pay for since it came slightly crooked.. Only we installed it so I had to make due and try to make some tweaks.. Still tini tiny bit crooked but too late to return or exchange.. Plus I really like the style of this chandelier..", 
    "I bought this a year before we renovated the Master Bath and am so glad I had it. You could put it anywhere you want an extra special touch! Such Sparkle.. it is a joy to see it when I turn on the light!", 
    "This is a must buy for the dining room. I have received so many compliments on this piece. When turned on it gives the walls and extra glow, that friends asked how I designed my walls that way. Great value for the price and design. Put up in less than 30 min. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!", 
    "I had my doubts, about buying on-line......but this is the most gorgeous lighting I have seen!! Quality is the Best!! Size is Perfect...I am odering more!", 
    "Love, Love my new light. I purchased this for my breakfast area in my kitchen. It has a very impressive look. Certainly looks more expensive than what I paid. The light cast interesting shadows on the wall and I personally like that. The quality is great. My husband put this up and actually dropped it on the floor from on top of the ladder. IT DID NOT BREAK. I couldn't believe it. Thought for sure it would be damaged. He is so lucky. :) I would say based on that experience the light is made well. Would not hesitate to recommend this product.", 
    "This lighting fixture is gorgeous. It compliments our industrial chic look perfectly and is an excellent value!", 
    "I received this today and this is the first item I am hanging in my new home. Took a short time to hang the crystals, the crystals on the shades were pre assembled. That helped a lot. My and my electrician had a hard time getting this up. But I suspect it's due to the fact that he's not too competent...... When lighted, this just takes the attention away from everyone!! I put this in my breakfast nook which is 9x9 and it is absolutely gorgeous!!! Best if all, I got it during O's sale!!", 
    "We've had our chandelier for a couple months now and we love it! Best piece in our home! It is absolutely stunning!", 
    "Wasn't sure about this light right out of the box but liked it after the crystals were hung. It projects a really interesting pattern on the walls from the crystals on the shade. Very different.", 
    "Not installed yet, but looks beautiful out of the box. Does have a slight odor; I think it's the plastic wrap on the shade; noticed no one else mentioned that. Only have to attach the crystals to the bottom, so will do what others suggested and attached once installed. Great value, a similar light locally was closer to $XXX.", 
    "I'm a nervous shopper and even more so as I was travelling in a few days and wasn't sure if I would get my delivery on time . But I really liked the chandeliers on line and after reading the wonderful reviews I decided to go ahead and order 2. My nervousness returned after I had ordered and just to make sure I get them on time I called the number on the site. The overstock rep was so very helpful and assured me I'll b ok !! And I'm in Toronto , so I did expect some delays. But after 4 days I received two cartons . The chandeliers are beautiful , haven't put them up yet , the small crystals were all put up and the crystals are GLASS !! So lovely !! Thanks overstock !!", 
    "Very pleased with the purchase. It is unique and beautiful when lit. The crystals were not a problem to assemble.", 
    "Aweseome light! The picture do not do justice to the appearance once lit. This light is hanging over our dining table and the iron and crystal accentuates a light reflection on the adjacent wall. We've had people ask what type of wall treatment or faux paint we did to the wall, when in reality, it is merely the light's reflections. Love it!", 
    "This chandelier is absolutely spectacular!!! It changed the whole look of my home. Added some bling and just an indescribable elegance! I bought my new home one year ago and have purchased so many things! This is by far the most amazing! So classy! You cannot go wrong here! My electrician installed it and did a perfect job. And yes, at night it makes the ceiling and walls look so lovely, the ambiance is again spectacular!! Love, love, love!", 
    "This is a spectacular light fixture and looks great whether fully illuminated or dimmed. I was surprised it didn't come with light bulbs but figured they might break in transit, so I would recommend the company mentions which light bulbs are required but not supplied, so that purchaser can have them ready when installing the chandelier. It requires 4 small candle bulbs.", 
    "Beautiful chandelier/pendant for my new home...perfect size and just the right amount of bling :)", 
    "Great look. Get tons of compliments... Casts a nice pattern on the wall due to the perforations and crystals in shade. Quick and easy install-- like 20 min. Would order again.", 
    "I read the reviews before my purchase. They were right...Beautiful!! Looks amazing in my dining room!!", 
    "This is a good quality chandelier with a good combination of traditional and modern styles. It dresses up my dining room. I\u0092m pleased.", 
    "Love this chandelier in my bedroom bay window. It looks exactly like the picture and the crystals make shodows on the wall. Gorgeous piece!", 
    "This is the second one! Yes, I bought two for my kitchen and living room. They're a little smaller than I thought. But, two chandeliers spread in an open concept space looks great.", 
    "This product was way better than what I imagined from the site. It was the earrings that finished the room we remodeled.", 
    "We purchased this online as we crossed our fingers that it would look as good at it appears in the online ad. We were pleasantly surprised to find this chandelier exceeded our expectations. It's gorgeous! Even my husband really like it. We've had quite a few contractors over and even they ask about it. My husband, who did the installation, liked that we could adjust the height from the ceiling. Plus, we could also take some of the hanging crystals off to have less bling. This piece puts the glam into any room. We do recommend this chandelier.", 
    "Bought this beautiful chandelier to go over a very rustic dining table for an eclectic look and it's awesome. The install was easy and the quality of the light is great. The crystals are beautiful and real glass, not some cheap acrylic. I just found the entry foyer match and am ordering it right after this review. LOVE IT, you will too. I used 25 watt bulbs (4) and it throw reflection from the crystal on the walls that look awesome in the room.", 
    "This is a great product and I can't believe the price I paid. What a deal! It looks way more expensive than it is. The light fixture came mostly assembled except for the hanging crystals, which were fairly easy to attach once you got the hang of it. Easy to hang, and the mfr. includes a package of spare parts and crystal pieces. I accidentally dropped one crystal piece but it was such a relief to have spare parts and easy to re-assemble. We actually turned a very small bedroom into a walk in closet and have this fixture hanging over a small island we made. It gives this room tons of class! I would not be afraid to make this purchase.", 
    "This was an easy-to-install piece and was quite easy to assemble. My husband hung it, and I was able to put the crystals on in about 30 minutes. (Only the hanging crystals need to be assembled. - The outside ones come completely wrapped in clear plastic and I left that on until all of the others were hung.) Extra crystals are provided but I don't think they would ever be needed. I have this hanging above our high-top dining table in our open kitchen/dining area. It defines the space as more formal, yet not snobbish. The shape is the same as two pendants hanging over our kitchen island so it fits in well. Our neighbor (who is a realtor and homebuilder) stopped over and noticed it right away. He thought is was perfect for the space and said he is sending his wife over to see it.", 
    "When I showed the picture of this chandelier to my husband, all he said was, \"Bling Bling\", which meant he really didn't like it. I ordered it anyway. I am so glad I did because it is GORGEOUS. It elevates the dining room to a higher level. It twinkles and makes me, and everyone who looks at it, smile. That includes the doubting tom husband. The early reviews of this product said that it was time consuming to get the crystals attatched. This almost scared me off from buying it, but mine came with the crystals already attached to the drum. All I had to do was attatch the hanging crystals which was a piece of cake. 100% pleased with this purchase from Overstock.", 
    "After gazing @ this Chandy for weeks, I decided to take the risk of buying.....SOOOOO pleased with my purchase! My husband is a man of very little words, even he loves it. Def. better than anything I've seen in the big box stores, and the price can't be beat compared with high end places. LOVE LOVE it! Also casts shadows on the walls, just Beautif!", 
    "I needed a fixture that was not oversized, fitted with the black accents in the room with a touch of old style and \"bling\". It was like buying a new dress for a special party. This chandelier met all of my requirements and more. Everyone that see it, loves it. I love how the crystals make patterns on the walls. Putting on a dimmer gives you even more options! Love it, love it, love it!", 
    "Beautiful! I am having my bathroom remodeled and this is stunning with my clawfoot tub! Brings elegance and a touch of romance to the room. I installed with 15 watt light bulbs vs. 40 watt. This provides a beautiful glow. 40 watt bulbs displays a lot of light and a dimmer would be necessary. I purchase often from Overstock! Can't go wrong with this purchase!", 
    "I had my eye on this piece for a couple of months for our dinning room. I am so glad I purchased it and I also purchased a matching \" Antique Bronze 8-light Double Round Crystal Chandelier\" for our Nook/Breakfast area. The pieces are just gorgeous and the crystals have so much sparkle to them. Both fixtures came with the crystals on the piece so it was just a matter of my husband installing them. All the hardware was included and we installed in a couple of minutes it was a breeze and we are not even handy! I keep getting compliments all the time. If you are thinking about purchasing just go ahead- they look so much more expensive than they are! GREAT VALUE and FAST SHIPPING! Thank you Overstock!", 
    "I couldn't be happier with this chandelier. Our house was built in 1933 and is in the Art Deco style. This chandelier looks like it is original to the house. It has a refined style and is just gorgeous in the evening when it is lit.", 
    "LOVE this chandelier! It casts a beautiful shadow on the walls and ceiling and the crystals are gorgeous...just the right amount of bling! So happy with this purchase.", 
    "This is a beautiful and unique chandelier. However, thru no fault of Overstock.com the one that I received was faulty and would not work. I called Overstock and they immediately offered me a return shipping label and a full refund because they were out of stock at the time and could not replace it. I initiated the return process, and was going to box up the gloriously beautiful chandelier and tearfully ship it this weekend...when out of the blue I received a call from Overstock, they contacted the manufacturer who said a return wasn't neccessary they would simply refund my money, which they processed while I was on the phone. I am truly disappointed that the light didn't work but that can happen with anything you buy. I am completely impressed with Overstock.com's customer service and will not hesitate to buy with confidence. Sometimes the measure of the quality of a business is not when the transaction goes right, it what happens when something goes wrong. Overstock, you have won my loyalty and will see me again. Thanks :)", 
    "Wonderful fixture! This is for you who want a little flashy without over doing it. This is elegant and will grab attention. The pendants are easier to install then I thought they would be. I highly recommend this antique bronze round crystal chandelier!", 
    "I have been looking for the perfect chandelier for my dining room for months! I have an open concept flow in my new home and I needed something would match the living area as well as complement the dining area. Now the problem...I have bronze in the living area (ceiling fan, wood curtain rods, hardware, etc.) and I needed something to match them, but I also wanted some bling! I purchased lamps with the crystal ball support and they really add the special something and this is what I wanted in the chandelier. I was discouraged until I saw this chandelier! This combined the bronze with the bling and it is fantastic!!! It has just the right amount of bling and combined with bronze is a great look! It cast the most gorgeous light throughout the area! Get a dimmer to maximize the beauty. Don't believe the reviews that say it is difficult to put together or that it takes hours. My husband and I put it together withing 60 minutes....ready to hang! You just can't go wrong with this addition to your dining room! All of your visitors will be so impressed! It looks like a really expensive chandelier!", 
    "Based on other glowing reviews, I purchased this chandelier for my baby boy's nursery. I had originally purchased a chandelier that was too small for the 11' x 12' room. This was the perfect size. The dark bronze metal added a masculine elegance to the room, and the crystals were that touch of glam I was looking for. I was concerned that it would make too much of a statement for the room, but it hit just the right note. My husband says he loves it. The rest of the room is all creams, whites and a touch of silver blue gray in the rug. I'm using a mirrored chest as a changing table. The chandelier fits in perfectly with the decor. If the chandelier receives direct sunlight, it casts rainbows on the wall, which I thought would delight the baby. Indirect light produces a watery effect on the walls--whimsical and unexpected. I put it on a dimmer for nighttime feedings and just love it!", 
    "This chandelier has met and exceeded my expectations. It's gorgeous! It wasn't hard to put together at all as was indicated in other reviews I had read.", 
    "I am very happy with the appearance of this fixture and am sure the flaws I have found on the crystals will not be noticed by others. I installed this myself (5'4\" lady) with no problems. I only wish I had purchased brushed bulbs vs. the bright as they are a tad bit too bright when shinning through all of the crystals. I will probably replace them in the near future.", 
    "Absolutely love this chandelier. After reading the reviews, I was prepared to invest time in setting up but it really wasn't too bad. It took my husband approx. 20 minutes to set up and install. The end results is a beautiful, glamours light fixture which has received many compliments.", 
    "I have ordered from overstock in the past and this is one of the bigger ones that I was skeptical in the beginning but Im glad I did. I like everything about it and fits in my not so formal dining area, gave it a lot of glam!", 
    "This is hanging in my dining room and I love, love it. It makes the dining room look very glamorous...which is the look I was going for.", 
    "I love this fixture! I have gotten a ton of compliments from it. It was not hard hanging the under-hanging crystals like I read on another review.", 
    "This might be my best Overstock purchase to date! I love this chandelier it is exactly what I was looking for and for an unbeatable price! It's was perfect for dressing up my dining room but it still has a classic look that goes well with my 1920's house! It was easy to install and it took maybe 15min to hang all the crystals. I would recommend this chandelier!! I can't wait to host a dinner party to show off my new chandelier!", 
    "Love it!..get lots of compliments on this Chandelier!...great purchase and product for the $$$", 
    "I ordered the chandelier for our new kitchen hoping to add a bit of pizazz to the space instead of using a regular light fixture. This gave our new kitchen the look and feel of an upscale high end design. Rainbow reflections from the crystals add a nice effect in the room. I'm extremely satisfied with this product. So much so that I'm ordering the smaller version for our foyer area. Great look, quality product!", 
    "My husband installed this chandelier above our new four poster bed and we were in awe after turning it on. The whole room just shimmered! It is so beautiful and romantic. We love it, and highly recommend it.", 
    "Love this Chandelier! The reflection it puts on the walls is amazing. It makes my walls look like they have wall paper on them.", 
    "Came quickly, easy to hang, looks great. It is effect for a dining, living or master bath.", 
    "Can't believe the quality for the price. Every person who comes over comments on how pretty it is.", 
    "I get so many compliments on this chandelier. It looks very expensive and is just the right size for my living room. At night, the crystals reflect on the ceiling in a nice ornate pattern.", 
    "This light looks absolutely gorgeous in our master bedroom!!! I love it and so does my husband. He was a little bit apprehensive about having a \"chandelier\" in our bedroom but really likes this one. Would recommend.", 
    "I can't say the quality of this chandelier is superb, but it is certainly above what the price would suggest. It gives off great light and looks very nice - I'm quite happy with my purchase.", 
    "Looks great hanging up and gives off a light of light. I like it a lot and everyone always compliments me on the lights. Very nice glow.", 
    "Never bought from Overstock.com before. Will defintely go back.", 
    "The chandelier is essentially black and I was looking for bronze to match the other chandeliers in the room. Also, the shadows it casts on the walls are excessive, really quite distracting. We hung it over a piano and it is difficult to read the music because of the shadows. Overall, I am not thrilled with the light for our needs, however, I will say it is an interesting light.", 
    "I LOVE my purchase!! I couldn't be happier with my new lamp. I purchased it for my master bedroom and it's the perfect size, shape and style, even in our contemporary room as the lamp adds a little glitz and glamour to the whole room. It is more stunning in person, than it is on-line. When it's lit up in the room it just adds sparkle and a calm, relaxing feeling. Installation was easy and it came with many spare crystals and parts. Overall, it's a perfect addition to our room!", 
    "Beautiful chandelier! We hung it in our dining room, it looks amazing. Casts alot of light, recommend using frosted bulbs.", 
    "This looks great in almost any room. I put it in the second floor picture window and it looks awesome.", 
    "Beautiful! I was not around to install the crystals. My husband said that it \"was not fun\". However, the whole family loves it.", 
    "Fantastic Chandelier! It casts the most beautiful sparkle around the room. All the crystals are glass, not plastic. I loved that most of the chandelier came assembled, I only had to add the hanging crystals at the bottom; it took my husband about 15 minutes to install. I highly recommend this piece. Another great purchase from Overstock.", 
    "provide a lot of light, looks good, easy to install", 
    "I love this chandelier!! I love that the barrell is metal and not cloth. The only thing I wont like is when it is time to clean it. all those crystals but that is what makes it look so beautiful!!", 
    "Buy it! We were worried that it would be too formal for our front room as it is a more casual room but this piece would go in a casual or formal room. The small crystals on the frame are attached and you just have to hang a few of the strands which took me about 10 minutes. We put in the glass bulbs per another review and it does make lovely shadows on the wall. If you don't like shadows, go with the frosted bulbs. My husband put in a dimmer switch which is even better!", 
    "This chandelier is GREAT! I read all the reviews before purchasing and I agree with all previous comments on the quality and appearance of this product. It really is a fabulous piece and we have already received multiple compliments and have only had it up for two weeks. We installed it in our dining room, we have shorter ceilings (8ft) but we were able to adjust the chain so it is an appropriate height. The crystals are true crystals and they even include several extra pieces which is great because I chipped one of them when unwrapping it so it was nice to be able to replace that immediately. I found that putting on the crystals after the chandelier is hung from the ceiling makes it quite easy so if your ceilings are low enough I recommend hanging it then hooking the crystals on. It only took me about 45 minutes and it was well worth it. Plus, the packaging of the crystals is necessary to preserve them so it is better to have to hook the cyrstals rather than the alternative of them getting chipped during shipping. Also, when you turn on the light it casts a fun pattern on the wall. This is a must have if you are looking for an exciting transitional/modern piece that won't break the bank.", 
    "We ordered two of these chandeliers for our salon area and they are truly beautiful. Surpassed our expectations as far as \"rustic chic decor\" Brought the wow factor to the area and our clients truly feel pampered and glamorous!", 
    "I love it. The small crystals are of very good quality, good crisp cuts that really sparkle. The bigger drops are of glass, probably molded as the edges aren't quite as sharp but it is still of decent quality. Great buy and I love the way it looks hanging. It was very easy to put up. It has nice proportions, looks good up close and from a distance. I also liked the fact they give you a few extra crystals just in case.", 
    "This chandelier is absolutely gorgeous and great quality. I'm assuming this was previously shipped without all of the small crystals already attached based on other reviews, but my light arrived with that intact and only needing the larger lower crystals attached. The antique bronze is very dark - almost black in most areas, with some slightly more brown areas as well, just like our other lights with the same finish name. Looks great hanging over our black table with \"Java\" painted walls. We used CFL lightbulbs and get enough warm light out of it without really getting the \"designs on the walls\" other reviewers said - which I liked because I was concerned it wouldn't be bright enough with the crystals distorting the light with regular bulbs.", 
    "Looks very cheap! Very poor quality! Never BUY this one!", 
    "Hangs above the dining room table ,looks elegant. Have had many positive remarks from friends and family", 
    "Even more beautiful in person. Pictures don't do it justice. Looks to be of good quality and shipping was fast. Couldn't be happier! Worth every penny!", 
    "This is a beautiful chandelier. Mine arrived with the crystals already attached, so I did not have to put them on as in the other reviews. Well worth the purchase, very pleased with this chandelier.", 
    "Very nice chandelier that produces a good amount of light. I would recommend a dimmer on it so it can be adjusted.", 
    "Packaged well and arrived quickly. Beautiful light that looks great in my dining room. Changed the look of the whole room...love it!", 
    "Love this light. In master bedroom and the lighting is softer and dispersed by crystals. I thought it would be brighter, but the design tones it down. Bright enough for a large room with bedside lamps. Very nice.", 
    "This chandelier lets off a brilliant sparkle. I hung on a 9 ftt ceiling in my diningroom. I wish they would offer it in a larger circumference. It is a bedazzler though and I like it a lot.", 
    "I wish I had place for another chandelier, it is beautiful.", 
    "Like many, I was nervous about purchasing a chandelier online. But, this has been hanging in my house for a little over a month now, and I'm so pleased! It is gorgeous, and I've gotten so many compliments. Perfect touch of modern style, without over-doing the glam. Would recommend to anyone!", 
    "This fixture says antique bronze but it definitely looks more black. I read the reviews before and knew it was going to be black. It is a beautiful chandelier that looks way more expensive than it is. It's super sparkly and casts a really cool shadow on the wall at night. My friends were all raving about it at my party. I love it because it is so different than anything I have seen.", 
    "I love this light -- it brings personality to my closet room! I highly recommend this piece...it is very elegant and gives off a lot of light.", 
    "Reviewers indicated the 'bling' factor and it does not dissapoint. Wonderful addition. The mood it sets when lit is wonderful, just wonderful. We used 4 candle lightbulbs and this provides more than enough lighting. Because the glow is deflected through the little crystal pieces on the side of the shade, it creates a special sparkle in the room - really. Enjoy.", 
    "This is even more beautiful in person. Hubby hung it, but had to take it down to reverse the wires, so the directions weren't the best. It worked like a charm the second time! The crystals are real crystal or glass, not plastic. It only took me a few minutes to add the hanging crystals once we hung the chandelier (the smaller ones in the drum come pre-hung). They add just enough frou-frou to the elegant shade with mini-crystals. We used the highest lumen 60 watt candelabra bulbs we could find and feel like it lights our dining room well. It does throw a quilted pattern onto the walls due to the metal grid in the drum shade, so the light is not even, but we have additional light on the perimeter of our dining room, so this isn't an issue for us.", 
    "This was a great buy! I was a bit skeptical at first because I am not a crystal girl, but my husband and I compromised on this because of its antique yet modern feel. I must say, it is absolutely gorgeous and I am so happy with it! One reason we chose it was because we are selling our home next year and I just know this product will appeal to many home buyers!! It really gives our dining area the pizazz it needs!! I am so happy with this product and I would definitely reccomend it to others!!", 
    "I received the chandelier in a couple of days an packaged perfectly. the jewels around the base were already attached. it went up with no problems according to my electrician although if this weren't part of a remodel job it can very easily could have been installed with 2nd set of hands. it looks great up as it cast a pattern on the wall lit up at night from the jewels. luv it.", 
    "We love this chandelier. It makes our dining room pop (big pop) when we turn the light on. It is now a master peice in our dining room. You will not be disappointed to buy this chandelier. We love to look at the shadows that shine through from the chandelier to the dining room walls. It makes the room feel cozy. The size of the chandelier is perfect for the room. I could not be more happier when we were finally done with hanging the chandelier up. My husband was very excited after he turned the light on. It was like we were at a different place when the light is on. It was really that dramatic; I am not kidding.", 
    "This is an overall great buy! I highly recommend this product.", 
    "This was a unique light fixture for a great price. The small crystals were already installed on the fixture I received. It was easy to put the larger crystals on. I really like the updated look for our dining room.", 
    "A beautiful, affordable, modern take on a chandelier, maintaining a little bling on the bottom. When the bulbs are illuminated, they cast a shimmer on the walls of my daughter's bedroom through the crystals embedded in the cylindrical drum. Great piece.", 
    "This light is stunning! I absolutely love it!. If you like a little bling then this light is for you. It does cast light through the crystals on to the wall which I was not sure about. Once installed it does not bother me. It is a beautiful chandelier.", 
    "We get comments on this fixture all of the time. It is literally amazing and it's the first thing that catches peoples' eyes as they enter our house. It comes with extra crystals just in case but we have not needed to use them. It was easy to put together, not sure how it was to install, we had an electrician do it but he never complained! Would highly recommend!", 
    "This chandelier takes quite a while to put each piece on around the outside of the drum but after you finish, it looks really nice. No one knows it is plastic instead of glass beads.", 
    "I used this chandelier on my master bedroom, and have gotten so many great reviews on it! It is absolutely breathtaking when lit, and I don't even have it on a dimmer yet. Was very easy to install, and was very surprised at how big it really is. You won't be disappointed with this purchase.", 
    "This chandelier is so beautiful and different - bling with a contemporary flare. I hung it over my kitchen island and it makes my whole kitchen sparkle. Highly recommend if you like this style -", 
    "Love this chandelier! It took me 10 mins to put together. Very easy! Looks absolutely stunning in my dining room. Everyone that comes over compliments on my chandelier and they can't believe how much I bought it for. Despite it only have 4 lights it is very bright so I suggest adding a dimmer.", 
    "I couldn't decide between this chandelier and another one. However, reading the reviews helped my decision.It's exactly what they all say. It's so lovely and really changed the looked of my kitchen. I wanted it in the dining room but I'm glad I chose the kitchen. It's very classy and was very easy to install (with the help of hubby of course!) I LOVE it!", 
    "I love this. It is hanging over our bathtub and it makes the room complete. Even better in person!", 
    "Love my new chandelier. It's so bright and makes my office very cheery. I wanted to glam up and brighten my office since I spend so much time there, and this light did the trick. Easy to install, and absolutely beautiful.", 
    "Wow what a beauty. Only took about an hour to hang all the crystals and another 20 minutes or so to install it in our dining room. It's so beautiful and a terrific value. I can't stop looking at it.", 
    "I originally had a problem with the 1st Chandelier that I received, it was broke during shipping and I did not know it until I had it hung, contacted Overstock and they immediately sent out a replacement. I could not be happier with this chandelier, it is GORGEOUS! And I highly recommend the customer service that I received!", 
    "I absolutely love this chandelier! We finished our basement and I put it in the media room and it looks great! I often find myself going into the basement just to look at it. It was hard trying to find an oil bronze crystal light but I found the perfect one. Thank you overstock!!", 
    "I purchased this and two flush mounts-same style. Love how they transformed my space. The hanging crystals are not super high quality but it's still a very beautiful lamp and it was excaclty what I was looking for. I would purchase again.", 
    "Love this fixture. It's a great transitional piece in my formal dining. It casts a fun romantic sparkle on the walls in the evening and was easy to install. Get lots of compliments.", 
    "gorgeous! expensive yet worth every penny! very unique, antique yet modern looking!", 
    "I love the look of this chandelier. I purchased it for my \"Diva Den\" (shoe/purse/jewelry room) and it adds a great look to the room. In the evening, the lights/crystals display cool \"shadows\" all over the walls/ceiling. It has gotten a lot of compliments and people have asked where I purchased it. Definitely not a disappointing purchase. I'd recommend to anyone.", 
    "This is beautiful for the price, I was looking at items 3-4x the price and I am extremely happy with the product. My husband was pleasantly surprised as well! We hung this in our dining room which has 1920's art deco furniture (antique bronze with black details) and the product really gives it a modern flair. Looks great with the ceiling medallion (in white) with white ceiling. The other reviews prepared us about the color which really looks closer to black but the hanging crystals are very pretty and sparkly and the children turn on the light all the time because it makes fun sparkly lights on the wall. Looks much more expensive than it is and is a nice way to update your room for a low cost! We are very pleased!", 
    "I just have one word to describe them, and that is \"Gorgeous\". They look absloutely beautiful in our family room. The color is just perfect. With the ivory lining the fall is just perfect. It was my first buy from overstock.com and I have been very pleased with all the products I ordered. Even there coustomer service is awesome. I always compare my online shopping experiece with amazon.com ( I am a big fan of amazon) and I must say my experience woth OS is comparable to amazon.", 
    "We had shopped around quite a bit prior to looking on Overstock. Once we did, we knew that this chandelier was for us. It was the exact style that we were looking for and at about half the price or less when compared other retail options in our area. It was far superior to anything similar that we found at Lamps Plus. We highly recommend this item to others considering it.", 
    "This chandelier is one of my favorite things of our remodle! The quality is top-notch. I was so pleased to see all the crystals in place on the barrel. The package arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The light has a rustic, classy look which my husband even enjoys! I have had many compliments on it. Thank you so much for such a great selection Overstock", 
    "This chandelier is lovely and casts a good amount of light. I was a bit hesitant to order this since I could not truly see the finish and was concerned that the finish may look \"cheap.\" It does not. It's elegant and much better looking than in the on-line picture. I used the \"blue-colored\" bulbs (more of a white light cast) & the hue is beautiful & bright but not overly so. I am glad that I took the chance on this one.", 
    "This chandelier is so beautiful in person!! It casts such a beautiful reflection in my living room, and it changes the whole look of the room! I definitely recommend it! Assembly & installation were a piece of cake.", 
    "There are already so many great reviews that I don't nave to say much but I am just so happy with it. I get lots of compliments. It is in our small dining room and looks great.", 
    "Love it in my bew bathroom.All my friends and neighbors love it too.", 
    "Just received this . My husband put it up with no problems. The pictures cannot do it justice. This light is Beautiful, all the sparkels really draw your attention! It is classy not not cheap looking. I would deffinantly recomend it. I also purchased the two other lights that match for my living room and kitchen. They are all so beautiful. My home looks so elegant now. Love, love love this light!", 
    "I LOVE LOVE these chandeliers! I get massive compliments on them when guests come over. The way they reflect light in your home a awesome. Nothing negative to say. If you like them on the website, then make the purchase. They are more than I expected.", 
    "certainly was not the color I was looking for the finish looked black!", 
    "It's even more beautiful in person! It came almost fully assembled, just had to connect the large crystals on bottom!! Easy to install, well, well worth the money!! I love it!!", 
    "This is the talk of my house when I have guests! They think I spent a fortune on this chandelier. It's elegant, but not too over the top dressy. It can go in a casual or formal setting. Now, putting the crystals on is an exercise in patience. It took about 4 hours to do it, but it could be a fun activity with kids or friends. I am very pleased with it and want to order the companion fixture to put somewhere else. There are extra crystals in case you lose some. The instructions are easy to follow and the picture helps alot to determine where the crystal go. Afriend recommended it to me. She has it over her whirlpool tub and I have it in my dining room. You will love it.", 
    "I receivd this light fixture last week and it is to die for. When I took it out of the box I could not control the smile that came across my face. The quality is excellent and it looks so much more expensive than what I paid for it. I highly recommend this to anyone!", 
    "Looks lovely in my dining room. Have gotten many compliments. Took a few hours to put the crystals on, but spent the time watching tv and chatting with a friend. Well worth it for the price!", 
    "This light is stunning. Put in our master bedroom, with dark walls... gorgeous!", 
    "This is a gorgeous chandelier! It looks just like the picture, well it did, but I spray painted it black to go with other things in the room. It throws off lots of rainbows when the sun hits it. It had been hanging in my bathroom (yes, I said bathroom) for almost a year and a half. It was simple but time consuming to put together...so I had my kids (5y and 7y) put most of the crystals on. It came with lots of spare crystals but I don't recall having to use any of them. The only problem I have with it is how to clean the crystals decently without having to take them off.", 
    "very nice product. looked as pictured and I would recommend", 
    "Such a great chandelier! Great quality, great price, easy to install. Love Overstock!", 
    "I LOVE my chandelier! I was looking for something to jazz up my master bath. This was perfect! I leave the light on just so I can look at it.", 
    "We ordered this light for our dining room, which was a bland room that needed a little something extra. This light was exactly what the room needed. It is somewhat modern because of the drum shape but still formal due to all the crystals. They sparkle in both artificial and natural light. When the sunlight comes in the windows and shines on the light it is just gorgeous. I love this light and it is a great purchase for the price. We installed it in less than a half hour. The small crystals on the drum came pre-installed but we had to place the hanging ones on by hand which took no time at all. I have zero negative comments and highly recommend anyone considering this fixture!", 
    "Very nice addition to entry way. I definitely enjoy it.", 
    "The light is stunning. Have gotten a ton of compliments on it already! Really completes my bedroom.", 
    "Very Very nice in our dining room. Absolutely gorgeous! Very well made, however the lower crystals on mine weren't cut glass, but rather cast in molds. Those don't shine as well as the upper ones. All the upper little crystals are of very good cut quality. They shine like diamonds. I would have to point it out very closely to someone for them to notice...but if you are looking for outstanding cut glass think about the price :) My wife and I stared at it and walked around the room for almost an hour after installing it... The oooooohhhhh factor is high. Going to purchase two more in the tiered wedding cake style ones for our upstairs bedroom... Thanks Overstock!", 
    "I love this chandelier. Unfortunately, I was not one of the lucky ones who had the majority of the crystals already attached before the product was shipped. But, after a little practice, I was able to attach the tiny crystals in a systematic fashion while watching TV over two evenings. It is truly beautiful in the small dining room of my condo. It is a very good buy for the price.", 
    "I'm so happy that I was like some of the other reviewers and my chandelier arrived with the smaller crystals attached. Attaching the larger crystals took me 10 minutes. I purchased this fixture for my master bedroom. My home is contemporary and this chandelier fits the bill perfectly. It casts a soft mosaic pattern on the surrouding area when lit. I've recommended it to several friends and they've each ordered one. Don't hesitate, order yours now, you'll be very pleased that you did.", 
    "I looked for months for the perfect light. I pick this one for the simple elegance and mix of metal and crystal. I am very pleased with the quality of this chandelier. It looks wonderful in my stairway.", 
    "Stunning light fixture!!! It is much larger than I imagined, using in our dining room over our round dining table and it is absolutely stunning. Small crystals were already attached to the drum shade which made installation and hanging of the other crystals quick and easy, we had it up in less than 30 minutes. I must say one of my best purchases with overstock and so glad I opted for this choice. I just love it and can't stop admiring it.", 
    "I searched for a long time and I finally decided on this chandelier for over my breakfast table because of the reviews I read. It is not difficult to assemble only took me about 45 minutes. Love the look, modern and sparkling. A great find.", 
    "We put this Chandelier in our dining room and we just LOVE it! It is a perfect combination of modern and classic. It looks beautiful not lit - but lit is just fantastic. It is so sparkely and it casts such a beautiful pattern on the walls. It was fairly easy to install as the chrystals were already on the circular globe and we just had to attach the hanging chrystals. The only thing that I was surprised by was that the chandelier casts a shadow directly below the chandelier. This creates a dark circle on my dining table. I am not too concerned, however, because we like it so much. We will just light candles while dining!", 
    "Actually didn't take long to hang, but the previous fixture caused us some problems. I only had to add the hanging crystals for the finishing touch! I went with the clear 40 watt bulbs (because that is the only stuff the store had) and I really like them-- they cast a 'faux finish' look on my walls at night. I've had many compliments!!!", 
    "I get compliments everyday. Easy to put together.....mine came with all the small crystals already installed. Took me under 10 minutes to hang the large crystals.", 
    "I purchased this chandelier for my bedroom and it ties the whole room together. It looks glamorous, sophisticated and elegant. It is well made and has a long enough chain that you can shorten if desired. I also have one of these in my walk in closet........it makes it look so beautiful!!!", 
    "We LOVE this chandelier! I read this items other reviews and was sold. I have to say that it is quite impressive. We looked in several lighting stores and never saw one quite like this- and certainly not in this price range . It is SUPER sparkly and modern at the same time. It is in our dining room and everyone who sees it thinks its stunning! Even though it has fewer bulbs than our last chandelier it seems to give off the same amount of light- if not more!! Unlike some of the other customers, our crystals came on the chandelier and it only took about 10 minutes to place the hanging crystals (on the bottom). We also placed a medallion above it on the ceiling to complete the look. We are extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend others take the plunge. You cant go wrong for the price!!", 
    "This is a great light fixture. It is very beautiful and requires minimal time to put on the hanging crystals (crystals on the sides are already attached) If using clear bulbs be prepared for an array of shadows on the ceiling, this is hanging over a dining table so I opted to use frosted bulbs which brings the light down onto the table. The fixture is more attractive than the picture, it has a nice weight so it hangs very evenly, and the light shining though the crystals is very classy and elegant.", 
    "Very easy to assemble and mount. Extra baubles included to be able to customize some of the drop pendants. Beautiful light pattern on the walls. Took one-and-a-half evenings to hang the individual crystals but the cost savings more than made up for it. Fun to do. Everyone is impressed with it. Am now looking to purchase the double tier chandelier for my entry way as both can be viewed in my living room. Stunning! Don't hesitate to purchase this light.", 
    "Beautiful chandelier! Provides great light and was easy to assemble (even if somewhat time comsuming!) My sister and I set the light up on top of an empty box (since the center sticks down below the shade) and went to town putting all the crystals on the shade. Well worth the effort and I am extremely pleased with the product.", 
    "The crystals (415 of them) took a good night and a half to complete, but absolutely worth the effort (I also didn't read the diagram correctly and fixed the top and bottom of each crystal, then ran out of fasteners and had to backtrack - BUMMER!!) Had help from artificial nails and needle nose jewelry pliers. This piece makes such an amazing statement over my breakfast bar, it is unbelieveable!!!! The colors that the crystals give out, the amazing shadow pattern on my walls at night... STUNNING!!!! So much bigger than the picture shows!!! The centerpiece of my house!!!! I looked at this for weeks, and my mothers day was AWESOME!!! Instalation was a breeze too- for two people. Many crystals left over for incedentals ( or another project!!) If you are still trying to decide, JUST BUY IT!!!!! You wont regret it!!", 
    "Hangs in the center of my Master bathroom I think that is why everyone calls my bathroom their \"favorite room\"! I have Oil rubbed bronze vanity lights and faucets, it goes great! This took a while to put together, every crystal has to be put on the fixture. But very easy to assemble! Well worth the time! Great price, would definately purchase again", 
    "It took about an hour and a half to attach the crystals, but it was worth every second! The chandelier is absolutely STUNNING!", 
    "yes, it takes time to hang the crystals BUT it's so worth it...", 
    "This chandelier is beautiful! The crystals are glass, not plastic as someone said they were. The quality and price are excellent. I would definitely recommend this chandelier to anyone one. Time consuming putting all of the crystals on. Since it is over my bed, I hung it first and took my time hanging crystals as my time permitted.", 
    "If there were 6 stars, I would give it 6! I love this chandelier, it is very breathtaking, very unique and very sparkly! I put it in our master bedroom, it is really gorgeous when on in the evening, and even in the daytime it is stunning. I have been looking for a long time for a fancy bedroom fixure, and this is truly it. It would look beautiful in a dining room too. It did take a lot of time and effort to put together, but it is worth it, trust me you will not be disappointed. My favorite purchase so far!", 
    "I have received many compliments on this items. I looked months for the perfect chandelier suiting my style and I am glad I found this one on overstock. Not only does it fit my style, it look great and it was reasonably priced. Of course the crystals are not real and you have to put each crystal together and hang them in the shade as well as hanging the pendants, timely but worth it when you turn it on and see the beautiful shadow on the walls.", 
    "LOVE this chandelier. Looks expensive. The crystals are GLASS, not plastic as one reviewer stated. The light casts a nice pattern on the walls too. Takes time to put all the crystals on, but worth it.", 
    "This turned out to be a very attractive chandelier and it has been receiving compliments from the day it was installed. Be prepared, however, to do a major amount of work assembling the individual crystals! The process will take between 2 and 3 hours of solid assembly. Not hard, but tedious. Also, be aware that the \"crystals\" are plastic. When all is said and done, for the price, I am very pleased.", 
    "Although it does require a little time to put the crystals in place, it is worth every second! This chandelier is gorgeous. I am beyond happy with the purchase.", 
    "I love this chandelier. I have the double round one that matches and have just purchased the pendant for my foyer. The crystals were a lot of work to put on but well worth it. I split it between 2 or 3 TV nights. I love the image it puts off on to the walls when it is on. The crystals are beautiful. This goes perfectly with my dark furniture and adds some light at the same time", 
    "It's beautiful. It hangs pretty low, but you can cut th wire & chain to meet your needs. It took about 2-2 1/2 hours (non-stop) to put the peices on so it wasn't that bad.", 
    "I purchased this chandelier based on previous reviews. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it does take a few hours to hang all the crystals - approximately 200. The light fixture is beautiful and looks wonderful in our dining area. Overall, I am extremely happy with the style and value. I love overstock and the wonderful deals!", 
    "This chandelier definitely sparkles! As others have stated it took some effort to place each one of the crystals, but it's definitely worth it.", 
    "This is a great chandelier, really beautifies our dining area. It is one of a kind, we searched for a very long time, and this chandelier fit the bill. It is very unique and not too many people have seen anything like it. The reason I have given it a 4 star rather than 5 stars is that it takes a VERY long time to assemble. There are about 300 small crystals that need to be put into place one at a time. Thank God for my wife's patience....", 
    "We purchased this light for our newly renovated dining room. It made the space look very elegant and sophisticated! It did take my husband and me about an hour to put the crystals on, but it was a really easy process. The chain to hang the fixture made picking the right height easy. It has a clip that allows you to temporarily hang the light and then step back to look at it before final installation. Beautiful light!", 
    "Perfect addition to our modern/contemporary bedroom. Just the right amount of bling and it makes a great pattern on the ceiling when on. It did take some time to add the crystals to the frame, but it became a family affair and was well worth the effort.", 
    "This chandelier is gorgeous - even better than I expected. I have no problem with the assembly aspect of it.. completely worth it. We like the dichotomy between metal and crystal. Beautiful. SO nice!", 
    "Pretty once done-tons of pieces to put togther though. It may be a little over priced for the quality, but it looks pretty over my jacuzzi tub.", 
    "This chandelier took me 5 hours to put together (500 pieces) but in the end it was worth it, this is a BEAUTIFUL centerpiece and looks very expensive. We haven\u2019t hung it yet so no feedback on that but even without the lights it is a very attractive piece. It is actually quite a bit larger than I expected it would be too.", 
    "I have never reviewed a product before but just could resist with this light. The picture doesn't do it justice. When the light strikes this chandelier it gives off the most beautiful colors, and the shade casts patterns of the walls making them almost appear to have been painted that way. It adds a real elegance to my dining room. I had read a lot of the other reviews and decided I would give it a shot for the price. I couldn't be happier. It came very well boxed and there were a lot of extra crystals in case of brakeage. You just can\u0092t go wrong with purchasing this light."
