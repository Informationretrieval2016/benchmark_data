    "Classy looking small loveseat. I'd describe the cusions as a little springy/bouncy, but it's quite comfortable. As has been mentioned, the color is a bit more tan than the picture indicates, but I have it up against a grey wall and it looks nice. Overall, we're very pleased with the purchase.", 
    "For the price of these, they were great.They look great in my living room and are comfortable. I have a small living room and I bought the sofa and love seat both. They look neat and fit well. I am very pleased with the product. I was a little surprised that they needed to be assembled, but it was a very easy assembly with minimal parts.", 
    "I am as impressed with the way this loveseat was packaged as I am with the assembled product. Everything fits inside of other pieces such that the loveseat was delivered in a box roughly 32\" on a side. After I cut the box open I was able to assemble the loveseat in about 15 minutes. Unlike other furniture which will say \"no tools needed\" (when you really need a screwdriver) or \"only a screwdriver needed\" (when you really need a drill), this piece actually didn't require any tools. As others have mentioned, the cushions are pretty springy, but I imagine they'll settle down in time.One odd note: my loveseat had a bunch of little pellets in the packaging. I suspect that they are pesticide/fungicides from the shipping process, or perhaps some sort of moisture-absorbing granules. You might want to have the vacuum cleaner handy as you unpack it if you have kids/pets (though my cats have ignored them).", 
    "I was amazed that this sofa came in one box, the way they packaged this product was excellent everything was in there. The assembly was EZ. SERTA awesome quality product! The style is modern... Love It!", 
    "I got this little couch yesterday and I totally love it. It\u00b4s tiny but perfect for my studio and it\u00b4s very sturdy! It\u00b4s a great purchase for the money it costed compared to the comfort it provides. I assembled it myself in one hour and without any tools. It was that easy! The color is similar to the picture and it\u00b4s somewhat soft but that\u00b4s exactly what I wanted, not too firm, not too soft. The only thing I could say it\u00b4s that it\u00b4s a little narrow so when I\u00b4m lying watching tv I use the entire width so I have to be careful to not fall asleep otherwise I could fall. Other than that it\u00b4s a great purchase!", 
    "This came in a square box: the packaging was seriously clever - every bit of space usedI unwrapped it outside and let it off gas outside for 2 days then a friend took it to it's location and set it up.I spent 10 minutes at the end helping her stuff the foam into the covers and I sat on the sofa twice for 5-10 seconds each time.Immediately after my lungs seized up and I had a 5 hour asthma attack that was hard to get under control.I have mild asthma that needs relatively few medications to control it so this was completely unexpected.I wrote to Overstock to get a list of the chemicals used in the manufacture of this sofa (so I could know how to take care of dealing with it)They ignored my request and told me to air it for 2 days - which I had done already and told them soIt's a nice, clean looking, compact, affordable sofa but ...If you or anyone you live with has any kind of chemical sensitivities do not purchase this sofa", 
    "There is no padding in the arms and frame after the first month!!!! So cheeply made!!!! my elbows were indented in the arm rest area after one month!!!!! You can feel the wood through the frame!!!!!", 
    "At 65, I need an easy project, and I unboxed and built it without any tools, as advertised. Quality fabric, stuffing, and design.", 
    "The loveseat was just the size needed for a small room and it comfortably accommodates two people, even two people napping we found. Assembly was easy and somewhat entertaining: amazing how carefully thought out the packing of one of these is. While the box was too big for one person to manage it was not too hard to remove components and bring them to the place where we were assembling the loveseat.", 
    "Came well packaged but very heavy - will probably need 2 people to move boxes. Hard to believe a love seat fit into boxes. Once out of boxes, cushions expanded. Easy for my hubby to put together. We've been using it for a year & it's held up well so far - good, durable fabric, fairly neutral color goes well with a lot of colors. Very comfortable.", 
    "This arrived quickly and the loveseat is exactly what we wanted for our toy/game room. It went together very easily and came out great. We use this every day, and it is solid and comfy.", 
    "Very good condition. Can't beat the price. Free shipping sold me for sure.", 
    "I ordered this loveseat and the matching sofa. They were not delivered together. Fed Ex had a helper on the truck and so the driver did not bother helping. The helper puts the loveseat on a hand truck, but alas he could not roll it up the steps of the stoop. He lets go and the box rolls all the way back down. But this item was package so well, that it did not matter. It did not need any tools, but it does need room to get it out of the box and put together. That is why was I was no longer bummed about a split shipment. 60 minutes to put it together and cut up the box. We'll be ready for the sofa and it should get done in a much shorter time.I did not rate it excellent but it is worth the money. Just do not compare it to a brand name loveseat and you will be good to go.", 
    "Nice enough and easy to set up. You should know that the loveseat is two pieces that you bolt together", 
    "The couch came in a box approx. 30\"X30\". I couldn't believe it was going to be as nice as it is. Very easy to put together, it only took 15 min. Looks great in my guest room.", 
    "This is smaller then expected, but quality is as one would expect at this price point. The cushions didn't fluff out as in the picture. Not sure how long it will hold up.", 
    "Bought this for a small condo I was living in last year. It was easy to assemble myself and has held up well. The color looks like I would call a light taupe and the fabric reminds me of corduroy and still looks good. Only draw back was it took a little while for the cushions to fluff after shipping and I didn't care for the throw pillows that came with it so I just use others I already had in the house. The back panel closes with velcro, so have to make sure that side is against a wall or it looks a little strange. Not a deal breaker. I have owned recliners that did the same thing. I have no pets or kids living here, so don't know how it would hold up to heavy traffic.", 
    "The loveseat was easy to assemble, the cushions fluffed up, as predicted. The material and color were much higher quality then I expected. Good purchase!", 
    "WORST OF ALL MY PURCHASES. NOT COMFORTABLE AT ALL. Looks cheap!!! DON'T BUY IT!!! Does not look like the pic at all at its description .", 
    "Maybe convenient to put together but not terribly comfortable!", 
    "I bought this for my mother-in-law who is downsizing to a studio. It is perfect for one person and a small space. However the fabric is a dated corduroy, which is fine for her. The pattern on the matching pillows is also out of style. Regardless, it was easy to assemble and seems like it will stand up to regular use. One defect is that the edges of the seat cushions never filled out to be 90 degree angles after taking them out of the shrink wrap. When inserted into the covers, the edges are still pointed on the front after 2 weeks. If you are picky, this will bother you. It's not that important to me as to figure out how to send back a love seat.", 
    "this loveseat is very cheap looking and small! when you sit on it the cushions sink and spread apart, the only thing I would give a shout out for is the way overstock quickly refunded my money and how my awesome husband got it back in the box it came in, that is a true miracle in itself. Don't waste your time or money on this item", 
    "I was worried as we are big people and it is a little couch/love seat but it is the right size for our little liviing room. It has no issues looks brand new and fits 2 with ease. Along with the dogs inbetween us and one on the back and 3 cats and of course the 3rd person has a chair.", 
    "While this loveseat may look OK and the fabric is nice, the seat cushions do not stay in place. The seat depth is also too shallow.", 
    "I am a bit disappointed in this loveseat. The cushions don't hold up well, and cannot be turned over for fluffing. Not comfortable to sit on for more than an hour or so. The back cushions are the same.", 
    "The color is great, and it is just the right size. It was very easy to put together, but I am not sure I would put it in a high use area...", 
    "I suppose the title of my review is confusing. Let me explain. The loveseat is really lovely. I couldn't wait until my husband got up this morning, so I put it together myself in about 45 minutes. Assembly is very very easy, and once together, it doesn't look like a loveseat that came in pieces. It is beautiful and very, very comfortable. One review I read on this loveseat said \"the back was unfinished and it was not possible to float the furniture in the room. It must go against a wall. That reviewer was absolutely correct. This is not the loveseat you want if you will not be putting it against a wall. The back fabric is loose in order to screw the two pieces together. Once it is screwed together, you are suppose to close the flaps and that's it. NO! The flaps are made to cover the back of the loveseat, but the flaps aren't long enough to fold under the bottom of the loveseat where the velcro is. So, it can just hang unattached. Design flaw, but not a problem if you are going to put it against a wall where the back doesn't show. Otherwise, this little loveseat is a gem.", 
    "We were so surprise to find out we had to assemble this piece of furniture. It was not an easy process. Everything had to be put together including the pillow covers. The thing we disliked the most was the backing on the loveseat. It was hanging loose and looked terrible if we didn't put it up against the wall. That is not where we wanted it to go but had no choice. We thought the back would be completed and smooth. not a piece of cloth hanging loosely. It completely looked unfinished. We would not purchase anything from overstock.com again. Very disappointed in the whole transaction.", 
    "the quality for the price is very good. my wife likes the color and comfort. however, you must read the assembly instructions carefully. the holes do not fit perfectly,and the Velcro strips do not match up easily. after assembly you need to let the sofa set a while to let it adjust so it doesn't wiggle. make sure you have help to assemble or it will take more than 15 minutes to assemble.", 
    "Fit my living room just right comfortable color is good", 
    "Fairly easy assembly and good quality. Cushions a little bouncy but nice value overall.", 
    "This is a very nice sofa and fits in to the small space we needed it in nicely. My only problem is, I would have liked it to have been more substantial. The seat depth is a little short for a tall person to sit comfortably.", 
    "The sofa is not only ideal for a small apartment or a nook in a larger one, it is comfortable. The back cushions tend to sag a bit after a while, but are easily fluffed up into shape.", 
    "Soft durable platinum colored fabric. Nice addition to our kitchen corner in front of the fireplace", 
    "The previous reviews were dead-on. This purchase was for an office setting and it is perfect for what I need it for.", 
    "Great couch in a box! Super simple to put together and very comfy! Cushions are vacuum packed and need a day or two to completely inflate. Very easy to put together and really are pretty good quality!", 
    "We have a small home, so this couch was the perfect fit for our living room, assembly was fairly simply and took my husband about an hour.The couch is super comfy, good looking, and is perfect for lounging, however, I recommend reinforcing the seat cushions with a small piece of plywood or other supportive material, as the couch gas a tendency to \"dip\" in the middle. I love the color and it will match most color schemes, my husband occasionally lays on it despite being 6ft.", 
    "Nicer than the picture, great feel to fabric, stylish, comfortable if a little small for two average size folks. Son loves it.", 
    "Really, really comfortable. Love this.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Doesn't take up much room love it!", 
    "Amazing way it was packed into such a small box! Easy to construct, very comfortable. Is it a piece for heavy use/heavy traffic... no BUT it is perfect in my office! and for the price = great value", 
    "My husband laughed about the small box it came in. When we got it together he said this is actually very comfortable and it was very easy to put together.", 
    "The title describes this item perfectly.", 
    "Bought this for my son. He loves it.", 
    "It's perfect for what I needed. It's comfy, durable, springy and not too big.", 
    "After 3 months, I was finally able to assemble the love seat. The directions were easy to follow and within 1/2 hour, it was put together. It is so comfortable. The color blends well and it looks great in my space. I definitely recommend this sofa.", 
    "This is an affordable, small loveseat. A great buy for the money. Loved that it came in a box. Heavier than I anticipated so I could not get it into the house by myself, but my husband could. And it was packed so tightly that I also could not get it out by myself. But once out of the box I was able to \"build\" my loveseat in less than an hour. Was not crazy about the pillows that came with but no big deal. Really happy with this purchase.", 
    "Excellent for the money\u2026looks and comfort. Cleverly designed and packaged. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "Was really easy to assemble with out tools. Good study sofa .. Very pleased with this purchase", 
    "Fits well in the smaller space allotted. Comfortable, yet firm. Fabric looks and feels like good quality. The accent pillows are an excellent addition.", 
    "Cute little loveseat, perfect for a small space. Easy to assemble. Can't beat the price!", 
    "exactly as described. make sure you let the fabric and cushions air out before putting it all together as they smell badly of chemicals. the box that it is sent in is fairly small but this couch is really easy to put together.", 
    "This sofa would be nice for a small room (with little usage) and carpet under it's feet. It's very light weight, so I'm always moving it back into place on our hardwood floor. It is comfortable for me at 5'1\", but my husband who is 6' absolutely hates it. My small basset hound usually sits with me, but not comfortably on this sofa as it's not big enough for the two of us. I wanted narrow for my short legs, and that's exactly what I got. This definitely isn't one size fits all. There is also an odor to it which I hope will go away soon. I've had it less than two weeks and will be replacing it shortly. The package was mind boggling in the respect that the couch was in a box half it's size. :-) It appears to be well constructed, but I'm a bit leery about its longevity. The color and fabric look just like the enlarged photo of it. Hope this helps with your decision.", 
    "Fast shipping, went together easily, great quality, and very comfortable. Was great in our smaller apartment. Very glad to have found this on Overstock.", 
    "Nice sofa for the price. It was just what I was looking for and expecting. It was perfectly easy to assemble. Firm cushions, which we prefer. It smelled like plastic for a few days, but it has gone away. It comes with throw pillows; the pattern wasn't our style, but it was a nice addition and buying pillow covers costs less than buying throw pillows as a whole and there are endless patterns to choose from. This sofa was just what I wanted, but if you're hoping for a piece that looks high end, this is not it and you won't find it at this price, so adjust your standards or your budget so you don't find yourself disappointed.", 
    "My son loves this love seat. The only thing that is not good, it doesn't line up on the bottom so you can tell I put it together out of a box. On the other hand it was easy to assemble, but messy. Have a vacuum ready to suck up the beads.", 
    "this couch was exactly what I hoped for. It was very easy to put together, very comfortable and my kids at first were very skeptical of it, but now I can't keep them off. I even got a second one.", 
    "This is a perfect sofa for a small space. For the money, the quality was there! Very happy with it as it fit our needs in our tv room.", 
    "Very, very nice for the price! It got her within 36 hours, was easy to put together even for me (I'm 76 yrs old) and looks great in my small living room.", 
    "This Serta loveseat is attractive and comfortable and a good value when purchased the sale and coupon priced reduction.", 
    "This came on time and in one box. It was easy to put together. The packing was well thought out. Sitting on it for the first time, was good. I like the firm cushions.", 
    "Was minimal work to put together and no tools were needed. The quality for the price I paid was excellent. Very comfortable...", 
    "Excellent buy for the price. Fits perfectly in space and is comfortable. Extra pillows cheap looking and have not recovered from shrink wrapping.", 
    "I was shocked at the comfort for price and the easy, genius assembly!", 
    "The love seat is exactly as describe and photoed. I purchased two, they arrived promptly and were very easy to put together. The instructions suggest two people, however I was able to assemble both alone without any difficulty. they are comfy! Make sure you read the size - they are small and low - but that is exactly what I needed for my space. The fabric is fine - a little thin but hopefully will hold up. The pillows that come with each love seat are not needed (plus they are a little ugly) so we won't be using. For the price - you really can't go wrong with these if you are looking for small, low, neutral love seats.", 
    "This loveseat comes in a huge box to assemble. Easy. Make sure you lay out all pieces first. Don't unleash cushions until your ready to insert in covers. Love this little couch.", 
    "The sofa was easy to assemble. Fits nicely in our small space and moves around easily on our wood floor when we wish to rearrange our seating. Very durable fabric and neutrally attractive. Lots of compliments.", 
    "THis love seat is a good value for the small loft area in my house", 
    "I was very disappointed with this Loveseat. It is more like for a very small child's room. Very uncomfortable.", 
    "More like dollhouse size. Expected larger. Not close to standard height or length. Great for kids"
