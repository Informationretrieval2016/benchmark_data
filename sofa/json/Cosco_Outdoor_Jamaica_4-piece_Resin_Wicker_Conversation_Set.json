    "Love the look and for the price you cant beat it. I have a small patio on the 3rd floor of a condo and this set is a perfect fit. I have gotten a ton of compliments on the look of the furniture and a ton more use out of my patio area. The cushions are more comfortable than I expected and very water resistant as well. The assembly was tedious (a lot of screws) but easy to figure out. It shipped super fast and was packaged extremely well. Overall very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "After look a bunch of websites offering patio sets, in rattan and other materials, I found this set, not to much known, announced like black, but look look like gray, I took the risk of get one. Big surprise, it is really black, and beautiful, easy to mount or assembly. The tool for assembly is not to much efficient because the working space, nevertheless after finish the assembly you got a beautiful set of patio furniture. Its look solid and comfortable enough to take a break around a cup of coffee with friends.", 
    "This set us absolutely beautiful. It was easy to put together and looks very good on my patio.", 
    "Very nice for the discounted price. Perfect for our screen porch. Would recommend to others.", 
    "Absolutely love it..have received a lot of compliments on the set. It's a small set but it's perfect for my area.Cushions are comfortable. Easy to assemble.", 
    "The set is smaller than it looks in the pictures but it fits my front porch nicely. It was quite a chore to put together but once done it's pretty sturdy. Unfortunately the black cushions do fade with constant exposure to the sun and you can't take the covering off to wash or anything like that. I'll just eventually have to buy new cushions. And beware of pollen season... Of course it shows every speck but I guess that can't be helped. Overall I'm satisfied with the purchase though.", 
    "it did require some time to assembly", 
    "This set is nice, but much smaller than it looks on the picture. We were disappointed.", 
    "Ordered this item for our covered deck. We were surprised when it was delivered in one box that measured approx 4 ft by 4ft. As soon as we opened it, we knew why. It was TINY! My two children could fit on the loveseat, but two adults would not. Very disappointed in not only the size, but the quality. I should't have expected much for the price however. Very affordable, but not a quality product. Cushions are also very thin. We will be returning this product. Sadly, we're out $$ for return shipping :(", 
    "Spent > 5 hours trying to piece this together. The holes, which are drilled into metal, do not line up. Try as I might I was unable to piece together all of the set. The sofa and table are complete. I have given up on the chairs. There is a 6 cm difference between drilled holes and I can not get the chairs together. In the end customer support offered some compensation, but not half as I had hoped. Next time I will buy something preassembled.", 
    "Love it and very comfortable . I have it our sun room", 
    "Just what we wanted for the backyard", 
    "Let's be real here, the price is SO good, we can't expect highest quality. However, given the price it is a very nice set. I put them together myself with no assistance. There were a few screws that gave me a hard time, but all in all, assembly was a snap. It looks beautiful when put together. I would suggest getting a nice cushion set as the cushions that come with the set are very thin and not very stylish. I added some nice pillows and cushions and a rug and it looks very high end.", 
    "Poor quality and very difficult assembly", 
    "We use this on our front porch and it is very comfortable, easy to put together.", 
    "Very hard to assemble, it took two people. Overall, nice set", 
    "Furniture is fine but cushions aren't thick enough, and are black, which can get hot in the sun. I had them replaced, with thicker more colorful ones and it looks much better.", 
    "Pieces were difficult to match for better fit, but once together it is very durable and looks good.", 
    "I am enjoying the furniture year round. It is great and stylish.", 
    "looks very nice on my front patio, love it", 
    "Love this set. It was a little frustrating to put together with no directions so it took a little while.", 
    "I am so tired of buying these patio sets and finding that they are sized for children. If you are taller than 5'8\" or weight more than 130lb you will feel like a giant (or get stuck) in these tiny chairs. The table is the size of a large deck of cards.", 
    "Junk very dinky and cheap", 
    "Small but very nice furniture", 
    "Easy to put together and couldn't be happier", 
    "Great set! Assembled easily..... Looks great in my yard!", 
    "A little tricky to put together. Small but sturdy. Looks good in the space.", 
    "I had been looking for quite a long time for some outdoor furniture that did not require taking out a 2nd mortgage. When the furniture arrived I was quite apprehensive as it was in one fairly flat box. Everything that was needed was in the box, but it did take two people to put it together. I am very happy with the furniture and would buy it again if needed, but it is holding up quite well.", 
    "Looks great. easy to put together. Love it", 
    "I am glad I purchased this outdoor set. It is a bit of a pain putting it together. I don't know how they fit all of the pieces into one medium box. Once it was done I was happy with the set.", 
    "not crazy about it or the color but I kept it anyway. However I am now looking fOR better set.", 
    "I purchased this set for a large covered condo balcony. I was surprised with it's size considering most people found it to be small. It is indeed a smaller set, but it is not \"children sized\" as some people made it seem. The back, as pictured, has no cushioning. If paired with some accent pillows, it definitely makes the set look more expensive! (I managed to get a great steal, waited for a sale price and used an emailed coupon on top of it!) So for me, it was well worth the price in comparison to some of the other wicker units.If you're looking for the wicker look without breaking your budget, I'd highly recommend this set.", 
    "Very small set, very thin padding and cheaply made. I'll spend more next time.", 
    "Very small. Not comfortable for fuller size folks.", 
    "Love the color and sturdy. You can put it together but would of help for more detailed instructions. Totally enjoying the set in our sunroom.", 
    "its a nice set, but small in size. easy to put together but took time.", 
    "It's smaller than I thought but still nice", 
    "First one came damaged, but replaced quickly. Good quality, holding up good.", 
    "I researched for 6 months on patio furniture and didn't want to spend a fortune! I absolutely love this patio furniture! Only thing I would change is to be able to put it together with a screw driver because those little things you use that come with it take forever! But it looks gorgeous and way more expensive than I paid for it! Love me some over stock.", 
    "Adds to my Florida evening", 
    "I purchased this for my daughter-in-law and she loved it. I just saw it this week and I love it. It should serve their family well for many years. Easy to clean and a great size for any outdoor area. Blends well with other out door pieces as well.", 
    "Love this set so much I bought two! My husband put it together. Figured out after the first piece that using the Allen wrench that comes in the set was not very productive. But...we are cyclists so used the ratcheted Allen wrench in our bike tool kit, and that was very effective!", 
    "Took me 3 hours to assemble!", 
    "It's a lot smaller than I expected but good quality. A little hard to put together.", 
    "Really like the quality and not too big or small for my yard. Comfortable as well.", 
    "These have been great for our back porch, the only complaint is they are smaller than we thought--but still great!", 
    "affodable outdoor furniture with good quality i recommend", 
    "this is very nice for the money it took 2 of us to put together and about 3 hours but it was worth it the set is beautiful the cushions are thin but she has a puppy and another dog so this is fine for now and then I will buy her nicer cushion I highly recommend it", 
    "easy to assemble, not quite as comfortable s I would have thought. I needed a small set for a small patio, so this fit the bill. Good value for the price.", 
    "Not good at all section would not fit together and the chairs and sofa are made extremely small", 
    "This set is comfortable and my husband put it together in about 3 hours (he's handy). The set, as others have said, is small, but that's my fault for not really thinking about the measurements...the arm width is a few inches (like 2-3) and we can curl up on the loveseat, but it's certainly not too roomy. Part of the material is coming apart, so it doesn't seem the like highest quality. But, for what we paid, I'm glad we bought it.", 
    "It was not easy to assemble and after putting it together I realized it is small. It is perfect for a small patio area.", 
    "I had received the box a few days after ordering. The box looked as if it had been dropped and opened during transit. I did open the box and noticed on just one piece of furniture , it looked as if had been cut in a few locations. I put it back in the box and communicated with Overstock. I received a quick refund and instructions. Overstock gets 5 stars but the furniture 1.", 
    "Easy to put together. Everything was packed well. For the price you can't beat it. My family and friends love it", 
    "Cushions faded after about 2 months; they look gray now instead of black. Okay for the price though.", 
    "Looks nice on the OS site, and is a true black color in person, not dark gray like the photos depict. The seat cushions are not very thick, but so far, they are holding up in the Florida rains. I added some lime colored decorator outdoor pillows, and voila, I now have an instant trendy patio. Please take note that this set is for a small/compact area, as it is extremely \"petite\". Wish it came with a disclosure that warned of weight restrictions, but thankfully, I have other chairs/seating that I will be certain to encourage anyone who looks like their body weight might exceed 200 lbs! Unfortunately, my husband reports that when he assembled it, each piece had various places that were already unraveling right out of the box. Too expensive to return.", 
    "Love this set and it was the best price for the amount of furniture. The only problem that stunk was putting it all together but well worth it! I have had it outside for a few months and its been great (kept the cushions in the garage unless we have company over).", 
    "Difficult to assemble and cheaply made. Do not purchase this item. Not what we thought we were buying.", 
    "Love this set. My only complaint is that the cushions are cheap, but they are fine & can always be replaced. Perfect for our front porch!", 
    "This was simple and easy and was perfect for my vacation rental", 
    "Fits perfect on our front porch overlooking our garden!", 
    "I was looking for smaller scale seating for our back deck and this works very well. Good quality and affordable.", 
    "This is a perfect set for a smaller space, but large enough for comfortable adult seating. It is a little harder to put together, but if you have 2 people it's definitely a little easier.", 
    "Looks nice, a little smaller that I expected, but works for me...", 
    "This set looks good and the price is fantastic. However, you get what you pay for. The chairs were uncommonly hard to put together, and they're not really that comfortable. Most aggravating now is that the seats stay wet for days after it rains. Not sure I'd buy this set again.", 
    "It's perfect for our patio space. The only challenge is the assembly. Had a screw pop out while sitting in it but it's back together now. Have patience, it's worth it!", 
    "have used this a bit this summer and holding up well. wasn't sure it would when we were putting it together - not terrible set up but you'll need an extra set of hands. not sure I would buy as a do-over. We just finished our deck and were awaiting company so needed something quick and reasonable. This did the job, when it wears out, we'll feel we got our money's worth. If you are looking for something to last a long time, you might want to shop around a bit more.", 
    "Bought the set for my daughters bday party and was a hit. Everyone gathered around the whole time of the party.", 
    "Love this set!! But difficult to put together.", 
    "Very happy with this outdoor furniture set. It is small, but well made and very attractive. Perfect for entertaining in the summer months.", 
    "Loved the set. Its a perfect size for our small screened in porch. There are what seems to be a million parts to put together but don't let that scare you. It was super simple to put together. We had two people but it could have easily been done by one.", 
    "Nice set but the alignment of the holes and screws makes it somewhat of a pain to put together. Had one defective screw but Overstock took care of issue. Love their customer service with under one minute wait times. Price is good. Nice quality. Good for 15ft by 10 ft wide porch. Easier assembly would have made it five stars.", 
    "Easy to assemble, comfortable.", 
    "this is a great patio set. Easy to put together!!", 
    "We are extremely pleased with the look and color of this outdoor set. It gets a lot of compliments from our guests and it's a fun sitting area to have wine or a beer and relax from a hard days work.", 
    "Very nice set for the price.", 
    "The furniture itself is a thin and not too strudy, but it is great for the price you are paying for it.", 
    "This set takes a while to assemble, but it is so pretty and comfortable! Fits perfectly on my outdoor patio.", 
    "very cute patio set but the assembling process took a long time, it was hard putting the chairs together.", 
    "They are much smaller than they look in the picture and very poir quality.!aome parts were damaged and I am dealing with them..,", 
    "This set is absolutely perfect for a small screened in porch. The dark gray coloring helps it feel more modern. Assembly required... put it all together loosely like the instructions say and then tighten it all down and it's no problem! I love it!", 
    "Better than the picture! Great outdoors furniture! Awesome price!!!", 
    "measurements were perfect, easy to assemble, and fills the space I needed it for!", 
    "It's very comfortable. A little hard to put together but we did it.", 
    "I purchased this patio set forth small front porch. It is under a roof but rain still manages to get in from time to time. This set looks amazing! It's smaller than other ones I've seen which is exactly what I needed. It was easy to assemble. I do recommend using a drill to tighten the screws instead of by hand. I also recommend getting every screw in place before tightening any ad there isn't much wiggle room once one is tightened. I went from never using my patio to getting up in the morning just to sit out there. The cushions aren't the most plush but they are not uncomfortable by any means. I would definitely recommend this set.", 
    "It's a nice set but small, although it looks nice in my gazebo it could of been a little bigger.", 
    "Even though the assembly of the furniture was a bit tricky, the furniture looks and feels great! Very comfortable chairs, the cushions are a little flat but that's easy to replace with the style of you choice. I even left the couch outside during a huge storm and they survived with no problem and dried really quick!", 
    "Kinda small and hard to put together but overall good for the price.", 
    "Once assembled, this is a great patio set for a condo size balcony. It took three adults to assemble this set. Four hours to assemble the table, which should have been the easiest. The written instructions could use substantial improvement. Each piece should have been associated/categorized with a letter to facilitate assembly. The chairs were the most difficult, with sides of one chair not lining up properly.", 
    "I loved this set. The couch is on the small size, but the set looks great.", 
    "This is a great product for the price. I bought the one with blue cushions and brown rattan. The product arrived a week later on schedule. Moderate difficulty for assembling. It look me 2 hours.", 
    "Screws strip very easy. Very low quality.", 
    "I originally purchased the set for the rear deck of my home. the deck is pretty large so to say the least the set looked like doll house furniture on it! I moved it to the front porch and it looks absolutely fabulous! Its comfortable and pretty sturdy. It was very easy to assembly as well", 
    "Love it !!!I put it together yesterday and looks beautiful", 
    "This is a nice enough set but it was very hard to put together because of the screws, OMG!!!! My fingers are still sore. The holes are in the worst positions and not one matched up, Maybe one, The bottom was bent on one chair so I had to keep pushing trying to bend to make it fit. Every piece rocks. Not balanced at all, I guess I will buy the lil thingys that go on bottom to stop from rocking, Its a nice looking set but I really had to overcome a lot mostly the screwing! No pun intended!", 
    "We love this set! It was a great price and delivered quickly. It was a bit of a struggle to get together, but having two people immediately made it easier. It's comfortable and looks great and you can use it without the cushions, which is great for when they're wet.", 
    "Very durable, but nothing is marked and it was difficult on some parts to line the holes up. Some holes were covered by the plastic rattan. Be careful not to cross thread the screws. Took me a while to put together.", 
    "Great find. Love how it looks on the patio! Would recommend to a friend. Delivered fast and great service", 
    "Great set and as advertised. Hard to believe that, that much furniture could fit into such a small shipping box! When I saw the box I thought they had only sent me one or two pieces... warning, I am very technical and mechanical and this set takes some time and patients to assemble. If you have a right angle battery operated diver with an Allen attachment it will save you about an hour of the assembly time. Figure about 2-2 1/2 if you do it with the supplied tools. When correctly assembled, the furniture is solid and looks exactly like the pictures. I am a big guy and although it a little small for me, it is a good size for normal size humans!", 
    "Great price, nice looking.", 
    "Looked around at other stores for similar sets but the price was a lot higher although these weren't as fancy these were a great solution. We had trouble assembling because you had to use force to push it to fit. And the cushions are thin, but all in all they are lovely glad I made the purchase.", 
    "Excellent grouping. Nice set for seating on Lanai added two extra chairs for the whole family to hang out.", 
    "We have a small patio in the city and it serves its purpose. We've gotten lots of compliments and it was easy to assemble.", 
    "The cushions are included and the set sits comfortably, however, some of the wicker resin was damaged and unraveling upon my unpacking. It's extremely difficult to put together and I had to not put some screws/bolts in because of the amount of torque needed to align and install. Overall I am happy, but if I'd known it was going to be as difficult as it was to put together, I would have bought locally and arranged for a truck to pick it up and deliver it.", 
    "We have a 9x11 patio and its perfect without crowding the space. Easy to assemble, the trick is to screw them all loosely (used my hands before the actual tool for tightening) then adjust while tightening", 
    "Only problem is having to put it together but it's very sturdy and comfortable.", 
    "Definitely small and not the nicest outdoor set, but comfy enough. We have a small patio so it works for the space.Was definitely a complete pain to put together though, had to juggle the pieces a lot to get it to work.", 
    "Great price got it put together and as everyone a little trouble getting the screws in but added a couple of throw pillows and it looks really expensive and even my neighbors came over and said how much they loved it!! Couldn't be more happier just love it!!", 
    "Good looking, nicely made and somewhat easy to assemble...", 
    "The outdoor set is great. We use it all the time near our fire pit and have enjoyed it. It look good too. We've only had it outside, both covered and uncovered for a few months, but the materials look great.", 
    "Love the set, seems like good quality. Definitely feels smaller than it looks in the picture.", 
    "Nice looking, but very small scale. Better suited for a balcony, small patio", 
    "As others have said, this set is incredibly difficult to put together. Although, three hours, five stripped bolts, and four very sore hands later.... We really do love this set. We have a small deck and it fits perfectly!", 
    "I love this patio set. It's modern and comfortable.", 
    "This is not the highest end set of patio furniture but for the price it is excellent!", 
    "This was kind of a pain to put together, but it looks really nice.", 
    "The price cannot be beat, this was exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for my patio coffee & conversation nook ;) Simple assembly directions, however it's quite tight. You'll need another set of hands to get everything screwed in. (It's always that last freaking screw!)", 
    "Decent quality of furniture. Sturdy and well built. The only issue we had was bolt holes not lining up that we really had to force. The set is very small. We ordered the beige. The cushions are slender as pictured and the color much darker than the photo. I would purchase again.", 
    "I was missing Feet protectors on 2 legs. other then that they went together relatively easy.. took me 4 hours. all worth it .", 
    "I was kind of a little disappointed because is too small. But for the price I paid it's worth it. Suppose to be is for our backyard but I will just put in our front entrance since I have a perfect room for it.", 
    "Exceeded my expectation. Very comfortable and looks very classy.", 
    "This arrived all in one box, big surprise. Which means every single piece has to be put together. Very difficult for me to do alone. I am a women and have been single for 17 years, never counted on a man for anything. But no matter what I could get this together without the muscles of a man:(... This set is very pretty, but very small. I needed small for a small porch, but it is really small. Overall it looks really pretty!", 
    "SECOND ONE I'M BUYINGLOOKS ATTRACTIVE, LIGHT AND DURABLE, GREAT QUALITY, EASY ASSEMBLY.HAVE ANOTHER SET THAT SPEND 2 WINTERS ON THE TERRACE UNDER THE SNOW - STILL LOOKS NEW.", 
    "I really like it, I have a small porch and it fits perfectly..", 
    "When I receive this Item the box was opened and the sides of the box had holes, luckily nothing got damaged. it took me about one hour to assemble everything. Some of the holes do not match , so it can get tricky...anyways once it was all set up I was happy with it. It is a small set but perfect size for my patio. For the price it is really a good deal.", 
    "I purchased this set with the assumption that it would come already put together. Unfortunately it was not set up when it arrived and I needed to put it together myself. Very hard to do, as the holes for the screws did not line up properly. Ended up using it without all the screws.", 
    "A lot smaller than I thought and harder to assemble, too. Mainly because the finish isn't that great, which means the bolts don't quite fit perfectly. And there are lots to tighten :-/ Also, the frame is metallic and there is a rust warning in the assembly instructions, which is unexpected for an outdoor product that's going to be out in the rain.", 
    "This set looks good in our Gazebo. However, the cushions are very flimsy. Not cloth but plastic, but if you excersize with other pieces it looks okay.", 
    "Perfect size and good construction! Easy to put together. Great price!!!!!", 
    "This is a great set for the price, but I recommend checking the dimensions before you buy. The loveseat is very small, and the set looks a little like children's playhouse furniture! Overall, though, I am happy with the purchase.", 
    "Small enough scale for my small back yard deck. Very comfortable and they look gorgeous.", 
    "I like the set. Its very nice for my small space. Not very bulky. My only gripe is the amount of screws I had to screw in. My hand hurts, I should have assembled with another person but I was too impatient to wait. I found it easier to insert screws without the washers they provided. Other than that I love the set!", 
    "This set is very small it looks like it can be for children i'm disappointed", 
    "very sturdy. so comfortable. sure its black and retains heat but i have a covered deck so its perfect.", 
    "Great for smaller spaces. Comfortable. Most everything went together well but there were a few holes especially on the chairs that did not line up and required some tweaking. Overall great value for money, would purchase again.", 
    "We love our furniture. It wasn't the easiest to put together but it was worth it! It would have cost double to get a set already assembled and this looks great!", 
    "This set looks great and fits in our smaller porch very well. We had been looking for a smaller size set for a year and found it at Overstock. Well constructed and comfortable even though the cushions could have a better foam in them. We have had several compliments already !", 
    "Great for a small area. Not so bad to put together, but somewhat of a challenge. Great look. Not super comfortable.Great for the price.", 
    "It is very good looking. It seems smaller that it looked in the photo. Great price.", 
    "I love my new patio furniture. When I open the box and saw all the pieces I thought Oh No but the assembly was quite easy. Very happy with this product", 
    "Excellent quality. Great price. Sturdy. I get lots of compliments. Oh, and very easy to put together", 
    "Nice set. Better quality than I had thought it would be. Difficult to put together. The love seat and one chair wobbly and we cant seem to fix that.", 
    "I was expecting to pay upwards of $1500 for a set of patio furniture. When I found this set for not ever $400 with good reviews I jumped at the chance. It's definitely not as good of quality as I expect a $1500+ set would be. But it's worth it for my husband and I have to have for a few years while we purchase other needs for our new home. We did have some difficulty assembling it as some of the holes did not line up, and some of the legs are uneven due to missing foot pegs. We will fix them up and live with the set for now.", 
    "GREAT PRODUCT ON GREAT PRICE AND FAST DELIVERY. MY NEIGHBORS LIKED IT SO MUCH THEY ORDERED ONE TOO", 
    "Good quality: color, attractive, strong. Price is very reasonable. Assemble directions mostly by illustration. Have a friend help in assemble.", 
    "Great futniture !!!Little hard to put them together... Small, but great for the space I have !!!", 
    "Happy with my patio furniture. Its comfortable!!!! and nice. Its looked liked I'm in the hotel backyard.", 
    "Set looks just like picture. Needs to be put together although moderately difficult. That being said I love it!", 
    "Great once put together. It took two deliveries and a lot of pushing and pulling to get it together.", 
    "Item arrived a day earlier than previously anticipated which is great. The finished seats are sturdy, a little narrow but the perfect size in my opinion, easy to move around when needed. Allen wrenches are the worst but putting these together wasn't that bad. They look great! The negative for me was that mine unfortunately came with some broken \"weaves\" on one of the arm rests (so far that I've noticed), it looks like it was sliced right down the edge. I was pretty disappointed with that b/c who knows how much more it may unravel during the course of use and it hasn't even been used yet! I'll try and super glue it into place and hope for the best...", 
    "I absolutely fell in love with this set, it exceeded my expectations. This set is very comfortable and looks beautiful, I am very happy with it. I bought a couple of colorful throw pillows and a matching flower pot to help the furniture stand out. I would definitely recommend this set.", 
    "Great value ...need assembly ,but easy...once assembled ,it looks great...comfortable ...like the low maintenance cushions....perfect outdoor set for small areas ,and will seat 4 comfortably !", 
    "Great for the money!! Looks great on my deck too! I am pleased with product color, design and quality.", 
    "It is a three piece wicker outdoor set that is just lovely. It is just the right size for my patio and lends an air of relaxation.First time used on Sunday and got rave reviews. Perfect place to read a book, meet with friends or nap. Very pleased!", 
    "They are quite small in person, sturdy though but big and heavy person will have a hard time squeezing himself in and out of the chairs. This set is for skinny people, perfect for my family but not for guests who are on the heavy side. Overall i like them, my husband assembled them in about 30 minutes with no help, material is excellent. I decorated them with colorful throw pillows and area rug.", 
    "Love this set! Was a pain to build, but worth it. The set is actually black, not dark grey - perfect for my outdoor deck area. Great price!", 
    "The style of this product is great. You won't find anything like it for less, I've been looking for a while. The color is exactly like all the similar styled outdoor rattan-like furniture,being that very dark, dark, brown. I have no complaints with the set, other than the assembly part. I've assembled lots of DIY furniture,but this one was terribly frustrating. The table which has a glass rather than plexiglass top, was straightforward. The 2 chairs were also straightforward. However, the bench was a nightmare because certain holes didn't come close to lining up properly. The holes were drilled into a metal piece, so I couldn't remedy it with my drill. It was impossible to assemble, so I had to return it. Overstock was super nice and real easy to deal with. The representative was quite sympathetic and understanding. I received a new set and like the original set, the table and chairs were easy to assemble. The bench was more difficult. 1 hole didn't line up properly, but it was close enough to get by. The screw isn't set in all the way in that fitting, but it's good enough. Hence, I gave the highest marks in the value and style of the product. However I gave it a mediocre rating for quality due to my experience with the bench's out of alignment pre-drilled holes. The cushions are jet black in color and once assembled, the furniture is actually quite comfortable.", 
    "This was a little more difficult to assemble than I anticipated, but with help from my son-in-law we got it together. It seems like a nice set, comfortable and nice looking. We'll see how durable it is outdoors!", 
    "For the money it fits the purpose, small but functional.", 
    "Shipping was quick , I like the set it was just what I was looking for, a great value.", 
    "The packaging on this product was exceptional. It seems to be smaller than the picture suggests. The table is not as large as it seems. The overall set is good for the price. I would recommend it for a small area.", 
    "Great value. Not too hard to out together. Nice wicker material", 
    "Nice for the price. The furniture pieces had to be tweaked to fit. Doable but frustrating along the way. I lie my set tho.", 
    "This furniture looks fantastic on our back patio. It was super fast shipping as always. My husband had no problems putting it together. Great furniture for a great price!", 
    "I always check the customer reviews before buying anything. This patio set is just what I needed for my small patio. Set up is not as easy as I would have hoped, but once together ithas been perfect. I purchased a few accent pillows to go with it.", 
    "*Yes, it's difficult to set up, but not impossible. *The materials are actually pretty heavy and good but the construction is pretty poor. *The side arm rest sections of the chairs are actually literally impossible to attach: the holes are a good 4-6 inches off the marks and the pieces are just straight up the wrong size. Luckily they aren't essential to the chairs working. *The table was easy to set up and looks great. *The bench is smaller than I thought it would be. I went in with very low expectations for such a cheap set and my expectations were met. The set is marginally acceptable. Bottom line: Ultimately I'm keeping the set because it's functional and looks nice enough and I'm not willing to pay 10 times more for something that will accomplish the same thing. If you're looking for high quality: look elsewhere.", 
    "Not that easy to put together. It would be beneficial if the items were marked."
