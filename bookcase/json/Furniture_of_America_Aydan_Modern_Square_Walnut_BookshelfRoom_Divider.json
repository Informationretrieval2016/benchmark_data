    "I'm not gonna lie, I was nervous on buying this given it had no reviews, but it turns out it's a really nice looking piece of furniture. We have plenty of books on it and it's definitely very sturdy, so I consider the quality to be very good.My main gripe was the set up. It was difficult imo, and I'm usually able to take my time and get stuff assembled correctly. The instructions are pretty weak...no words as usual, and the pictures were inconsistent. Maybe it was just an off day but I needed a drink half way thru just to calm down!", 
    "This shelf was easy to assemble and is quite sturdy. It is a little small however it will make a nice addition to my living room", 
    "I bought this bookshelf for my children's reading nook in our new house. I wanted something that was different, not overly massive (as it is just a nook) and would fit ALL of our children's books of which we have MANY. This bookshelf is perfect. It had good instructions so easy to put together (though time-consuming). Once assembled, I thought there was no way I would get all books on. I was very surprised that every single book we had fit and the different shapes of the shelves worked perfect for the different size books. The only thing I don't care for is that it is laminated particle board instead of hardwood, which I try to buy, but it looks nice and doesn't look cheap like some manufactured woods do. It was a great bookshelf for the price.", 
    "I really wish it were a bit larger, but it's fine. I can't imagine it would serve as a room divider given its size, but if you keep it at the wall, it's perfect. I love it though. It's very sturdy, and it's not too difficult to assemble.", 
    "It looks beautiful in my office. I get lots of compliments on it. It took two of us to put it together. Love it...", 
    "I like the looks of this bookshelf but really look at the dimensions, it's MUCH smaller than it appears in the picture. It was easy to put together.", 
    "Looks great and very sturdy", 
    "Love the design. Will work well.", 
    "I absolutely love this. I have fabric storage cubes that fit perfectly in most of the shelves, and it's interesting looking, not just a boring shelf!"
