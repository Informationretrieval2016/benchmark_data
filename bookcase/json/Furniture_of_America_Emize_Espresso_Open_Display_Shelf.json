    "Seems to be fairly sturdy. We stood it up the wrong way and were afraid it wouldn't hold up to being rolled over and it did! Great addition to our dining room!", 
    "The description sayS wood but this is actually particle board covered with MDF. I wish Overstock would stop this practice of deceptive descriptions. Instructions are accurate but since they are just diagrams and no comments you really have to pay attention to the diagram's minute details or you can screw up the assembly.", 
    "This product was a bit deceiving in regards to its name. Understood that it would have to be put together, and the directions were exact. Yet it took two people over 3 hrs to get it finished. Mind you, it looks good, but at the end of completion one piece was almost 1/4 of an inch off from the line up. That is when I discovered it was made in China. So if you are very handy, and have lots of time to spear, then this product is a good buy, otherwise just find a company that has it completed before u buy.", 
    "We bought this piece to display crystal, books, photos, etc. in our living room. Wish the narrow shelves were a little taller, they're really only good for books, most photo frames won't fit. Fairly easy to put together and it looks great in our space.", 
    "Although it was a little difficult to put together, once it was, we loved it! It is a perfect bookcase for our family room.", 
    "This display shelf is really nice. It's visually a conversation starter. I really love the way it looks in my living room. It's different from anything I have seen in the stores. It took about and hour and half to put together. Love it."
