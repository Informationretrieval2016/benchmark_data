    "Good value for the price ease of assembly however very easy with 2 people.", 
    "Easy to build - the shelves are bending a bit due to the weight I have put on them.", 
    "Shipped fast but one corner was damaged Easy to put together", 
    "I bought this bookshelf for my 4-year-old son's room - in part of redoing it to a \"big boy\" room. Both side pieces had scratches upon arrival. It wasn't enough to warrant the hassle of returning and doing it all over again, but it is irritating. It was very simple to put together. It seems solid and deep, which is nice. There is NO WAY you can put all three shelves in and expect books to fit. I had to do one shelf in the middle to be able to accommodate his books on the bottom and stuffed animals on the top. It will do for now, but expected a little bit better (at least no scratches...) for the price.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Nice for a teen.", 
    "Bought 2. Easy to put together. White brightens a room. Good for short paperbacks. If you want space for tall books, either leave out a shelf or make one space a small knick knack area.", 
    "This bookcase was easily assembled, very sturdy and nice looking. For the very reasonable price, I couldn't be more please.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Very sturdy.", 
    "This bookcase is deep enough to store my 12\" by 12\" scrapbooks. Standard size bookcases are not deep enough for this purpose. It was very easy to assemble & very sturdy. I was so happy with this purchase that I ordered a second one a week later."
