    "The appearance is very good, but the fold out bed is not balanced; when laying on one side, the othe side flips in the air. The legs come up off the ground.", 
    "i was very happy at the beginning when i received this sofa. I purchased it for my office, slightly used, to be honest. After 4 months of using, the sewing line is broken from the middle, and u can easily see the inside fiber from the broken gap. It is the first time i purchased furniture from overstock, not sure if i will do it again. Cos when i reported this case to customer service, the rep told me that overstock only has 10 days warranty police after the purchasing date. u can't tell the quality of a furniture within 10 days!!", 
    "Very disapointed in this piece! If it had been priced at half of what I paid, that may have been a fair price. I will likely send it to college with my daughter next year, and buy something of better quality for the den.", 
    "I received the product and the only assembly needed was to screw in the legs. The material is nothing more than plastic. The items must be placed against a wall as if anyone walks behind it they see the poor quality of the material. As for comfort this is the hardest piece of furniture I ever sat on. It is hard and is made for a child\u0092s play room. I NEVER would have bought this item if I saw it in person. It would not have been bad if the price were $399 for the pair. Now I am nervous about buying any more furniture on lions. I have bought a nice chair ottoman set on-line and a few other pieces of furniture but have never been so disappointed. I think that if they labeled this as a Futon I would have been a little better prepared on what I received.", 
    "bought these two pieces of sofa three months ago. now the sewing are coming off and the, and the stuffing from the inside are hanging out. very bad material. no worth a penny. I don't encourage anyone to buy this set.", 
    "This couch lasted 30 days before the initial seems started busting (barely) 6 months later, i can now say the entire couch and loveseat (the size of a chair) are destroyed. Do not buy this for the ability to use as a fold out. Not only is it terribly uncomfortable, but it is lopsided when it folds out.", 
    "I love this set, I bought it to put in my guest room. I have no trouble with it and it fits perfectly! Great color great look and great quality!"
