    "This looks nice in the picture, and for less than $$$ I wasn't expecting fabulous quality. But the quality was really, really low - something I would expect from a deep discount store. Thin particleboard, plastic (!!) feet, the backing is thick cardboard. All in all, very disappointing.", 
    "Quick delivery, good quality"
