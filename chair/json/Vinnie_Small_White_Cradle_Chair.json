    "We got this for my newborn son's nursery. It's so much more cool looking than a clunky grandma-style glider. I wanted a piece of furniture that I would love to have around after our need to rock is finished -- this chair is perfect! We've rocked our way through his first six months -- the rocker rails give a very nice rock and it's even comfortable for my 6 foot 2\" husband who weighs, er, over 250... In fact, it's my husband's favorite place to soothe baby. Diminsions are small on this chair -- but that is due to the Eames original design (you can find a certified replica on Design within Reach for over $400 and it's the same specs.) The seat itself is average sized -- the small part is the height of the chair. As long as you know it's not going to be a tall seat, you should be fine. Gorgeous white design -- we get lots of compliments; plus the small size doesn't take up too much room in the nursery, and is even easy to move to other rooms if we occasionally need to. I've even nursed in this chair comfortably!", 
    "I don't understand all the reviews of people stating the chair is small. If you're looking for a knock off of the Herman Miller Eames chair, this is EXACTLY it. So, if that's what you're looking for it's not small. I loved the Eames chair so I think it's perfect.", 
    "I used to sell the real, designer-made version of this at a furniture store in California. So many people came in and said it was too expensive for them to spend on children's furniture but the thing is this is not child-sized! It's not sized for large adults, but average to small adults (remember the real thing was made in the mid-1900s when there weren't a lot of overweight and obese individuals!). That being said, I've always wanted one but didn't have the budget so I scooped this up in a flash. It's strikingly similar to the one I sold years ago.", 
    "I love this chair-we have a mid-century house but short on cash to decorate it. The chair is very cool and only took like 10 minutes-if- to put it together. We put it in our living room and everyone comments on how cool it is. I would highlly recommend this product to anyone else-if your house or condo is modern and you are into classic modern statement pieces but short on cash-which everyone is these days- go for this chair.", 
    "This is a lovely reproduction of the classic Eames rocker - white plastic as per the chairs for years now. Nice wood rocker base, and great seat. It is a small chair, as others observed, BUT it is the right size - the original size. If you want a bigger chair, one higher off the ground, or that supports your back, get one of those. This is a design classic, 1:1 scale with the original. very good price, nice finish quality. one of the four screw holes on the chair was out of line to connect with the base, but worked sufficiently for me. We will use ours as a nursing chair, but we are not very tall people. we love it.", 
    "I have the \"real deal\" Eames chairs as my kitchen dining charis and I felt the quality matched these! The molded plastic is the new soft and slightly textured plastic -- not the original fiberglass. I did, however, buy this chair to use in our nursery as we are expecting a new baby. I LOVE the look. Now that I have the chair I'm not sure it was the best choice for this end use. I know we will be up in the middle of the night for feeding and rocking and this chair, while comfortable in the middle of the day, does not allow any place to rest your head or really relax into it. But, I do feel like it's EXCELLENT for the price offered here on Overstock and if you feel the chair is right for you, BUT IT!", 
    "Great looking piece. The shell is a light (non shiny) plastic. I thought it was going to be a shiny fiberglass. Overall a cool looking chair. I have it in my home salon against a black wall! Great contrast!!!Many compliments on it.", 
    "I was saving up to by the original, but when I saw this chair I decided to buy it on a whim. The chair came quickly and was very easy to assemble (only 4 screws). The chair does sit lower to the ground that what I expected and my first thought was \"kiddie furniture\" and I immediately decided to return it. However, when I sat in the chair it was very comfortable and it does fit perfectly in my modern/mid-century decor -- so I decided to keep it for a few days before returning it. Lo and behold, the chair has grown on me and I", 
    "take note of the dimensions before you order. Seat height is for children - lower than standard. Does not mix well with regular furniture. Otherwise super cute.", 
    "This chair is really CUTE, very stylish but small. I was so excited once it arrived. I took it out of the box and was very disappointed due to the height. It is LITERALLY for a child. Will look really cute in a child's room but NOT your living room unless that's the height you are going for. I misunderstood the dimensions because I was so overwhelm by the style and in such a hurry to order before they were out of stock. WARNING it is the height of an ottoman or end table and that's including the chair with the legs. SO disappointed.", 
    "these chairs are nicely designed but too small. they are really the size of children's chairs", 
    "I've been wanting this style chair and I was delighted when it was on sale and combined with a great coupon for a great deal, but my excitement was cut short when I realized (after ordering) that it is a child's size chair. Totally my fault for not reading the details more carefully. I was just afraid it would sell out so I hurried through my purchase. I'm sure this is a great item if you are looking to buy it for a child. Big Oops! But thankfully Overstock accepted my return.", 
    "Great little rocker. It's a little lower than we expected, but otherwise it's great! Wifey loves it!", 
    "It might be quite strange that a father buys a cradle chair but my wife was so busy with the baby and her bad night sleep that I needed to find something that would solve our problem. My friend advised me to buy this great cradle chair as this was the only way their baby could fall asleep within minutes. It worked. The chair is so comfortable and so helpful that we do not have problems in the evening. Thank you.", 
    "This is definitely the best cradle chair we had. We tried out numerous different ones, leather and wood, but this was the winning one after all. It is really comfortable and lightweight, has a stable construction and great quality. The price is also way below all others.", 
    "This is really the best cradle chair you can get. It is so comfortable for the back and the whole upper body and my baby sleeps like an angel every evening after a few minutes in this chair. It is solid and sturdy and I hope it will last for the second child as I cannot do without it. Thank you.", 
    "My wife and I recently had a baby. She wanted a cradle chair but all I could find was old or the style of the chair was from the 80`s. She didn\u0092t want those chairs so I was looking for something out of the ordinary. A friend recommended overstock because he bought some furniture from this site and he was satisfied. This is how I found this cradle chair, and made the purchase.", 
    "In lieu of spending the money for an ugly nursery glider, I decided to purchase this cute and modern looking chair for our toddler's room. Contrary to a few other reviews, I did not find this chair to be too small for me (I'm 5'3\"). However, there isn't too much back support so if you plan on using this for pure relaxation purposes, this is not the chair for that purpose. In addition, the rocking motion is vastly inadequate when compared to a traditional rocking chair or glider. The motions are more of a tilt forward, tilt backward. So if you are using this to rock your baby to sleep and would like a full motion of rocking, this may not be the best option. This chair, however, is very cute and is versatile enough to be in a child's room or just as easily in a main living room.", 
    "I was skeptical but the chair was delivered quickly, the box a bit damaged but the chair was perfectly intact inside. Very easy to assemble and it looks fantastic! It sits very low to the floor, so unless you have low-slung, contemporary furniture, it will look out of place with larger, taller, bulkier pieces. Very satisfied!", 
    "The chair came quickly. It was very easy to put together. It should have been packaged better. There was some rubbing on the top of the chair by the box which left a mark, but overall it is in great condition. It is smaller than the original, but you will not find a better price. If you are considering getting this for your nursery, I would reconsider. You will not have enough back and neck support to be comfortable. I put the chair in my living room. It looks great with my eclectic mix of furniture. I love the fact that it will be kid and cat proof as well. I would recommend this to others.", 
    "Decorating mid-century modern in one of our bedrooms. This chair is perfect.", 
    "This is used in our baby's room. It is perfect for a small space and I love rocking my baby to sleep in it.", 
    "Good quality for price! This is in my daughter's bedroom and she loves it and it is easily cleanable.", 
    "yes nice but smaller than I expected, mostly suitable for a child's room but solidly built and no issue with adults sitting in it. appearance wise, this is exactly like that in the picture.", 
    "I use this in my nursery and its the perfect size- not too big and bulky.", 
    "I bought two of these for my nursery hoping that I may be able to rock babies in them, but I think they may be more beneficial as kids chairs. The back height just seems a little low. The seat height actually feels normal. I love the style and the price though!", 
    "I love this chair- it is short, but that is perfect for small spaces and small people. It rocks very smoothly and with a little furry rug thrown over it is a great little additional seat to any room. Fits almost anywhere and is easily portable.", 
    "I like that there is minimal rocking (on carpet) - it's not one of those rocking chairs where you feel flung around.", 
    "We've had two of these chairs for two years now, and they've held up well. Guests always gravitate towards them when they visit, and they add a nice design element to our living room.", 
    "Love the chair. Perfect size", 
    "I use this rocking chair in my kids room and it is pretty comfortable, but it is already starting to made noise like the screws need to be tightened. I don't sit in it often, so that's a little strange to me. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase.", 
    "This is a super comfortable chair.", 
    "Chairs looks and cleans up with ease.", 
    "it's an ok chair. it's small as other reviews state. good for a kid.", 
    "I ordered this chair during a sale and very happy with it. Easy to put together , sits very low but I am a short person and it's most for decor. Very modern at fraction of the price", 
    "Classic touch. High end designer style and budget friendly", 
    "These chairs are modern and stylish, they look great in our office!", 
    "Kids and I like these chairs; comfortable. Easy to put together, handle a lot of use. Just have to re-tighten if used a lot, but that's with any chair used heavily.", 
    "I love the style of the Eames rocker and this is a great buy at an affordable price.", 
    "This is ridiculous, is a rob I return back as soon I see", 
    "This chair was cute for small people..pretty low to the ground for taller people..just not a good fit for me although I gave it to a smaller stature person and it was fine.", 
    "ive used it in my sons nursery until he outgrew the rocking stage, now it has been in my living room for months its great. recently its started to get a dingy and dirty look so i did spray paint it white again hopefully it will hold up even longer.... not too comfy for sitting in long periods of time since the back is low there is no support for your neck.", 
    "people complained that it was too small but I think it is a great size", 
    "Easy to put together and looks great :-)", 
    "Looks great. Well made. Still in great shape after nearly 5 years of regular use.", 
    "Sturdy, cute, just what I wanted! Though if I was only buying one rocking chair and I had a newborn, I'd pick something much more comfortable. But this is the look I wanted so I'm happy!", 
    "Love this chair, so comfortable! Even for men over 6 feet", 
    "The chair looks great but one of the screws that fastens the legs to the seat wouldn't tighten all the way leaving the seat a little loose.", 
    "Those are very in and on every modern website, but the original Herman Miller runs over $***. This is a fantastic alternative! I have it in my daughters room and she loves it too. It goes nicely with white furniture, very easy to put together and looks stylish. I do suggest using a pillow for comfort.", 
    "Perfect for our small nursery!", 
    "It's ok, but I wouldn't use it as an everyday piece.", 
    "This looks cute in my grandbabies room and just what I wanted to rock them in. Has a nice rocking motion. Might have been more comfortable in the back was higher.", 
    "had to improvise when putting it together, nut did not fit screw.", 
    "I got it for my nurcery and i sit on it every day.", 
    "elegant and doesnt take up eye space.", 
    "Better than I thought it would be considering the low price. Good quality and its actually comfortable", 
    "It was way to small for an adult I gave it away to the neighbors kid.", 
    "The chair added so much charm and character to our room. Great buy!", 
    "The chair looks great in my living room. It is a little thin and plastic feel but overall it serves the purpose. Everyone compliments when they see it. The size is small and it fits perfectly in the baby room.", 
    "Perfect fit for my daughters room. She loves to sit in it and read books. I added a nice sheepskin rug/throw to it to make it a bit more comfortable. Perfect for children.", 
    "I've had this rocker for almost 8 years and used it with two kids. Now I'm ready to use it for number 3. It's sturdy and still looks great. It's a nice alternative to the more expensive rocker with the same look. I'm 5'3\" and this size is perfect for me.", 
    "It's actually pretty comfortable, super easy to put together, and actually looks really nice", 
    "Nice looking chair that is well-made and exactly as pictured. It's fine to sit in for a short time (20 min) but not very comfy for long sitting. More of a modern furniture statement than for a comfortable chair.", 
    "It really looks classy, and it's sturdy", 
    "Easy to assemble. Quite good looking and comfortable.", 
    "Sturdy yet fun! Everyone wants to sit in them!", 
    "We love this chair, the kids are playing with it all day... And it is a very comfortable chair too. Just perfect for us", 
    "Looks great in my living room. Great product!", 
    "Smaller than I expected but nothing wrong with it.", 
    "We love this chair - its comfy and sturdy and looks terrific with our modern decor - could not be happier.", 
    "i was worried it would be too small, but it's awesome, and comfortable, i love this piece!", 
    "On the smaller side, but great chair for kids room.", 
    "I wasn't aware of the \"original\" version of this chair but I liked the dimensions and retro vibe. My teen daughter loves it in her room. It was easy to assemble and seems sturdy enough.", 
    "Pricewise, this is a good alternative to an Eames Fiberglass shell chair. I've now had this chair for six years and use it daily. It's very comfortable and looks brand new. I'm very happy with it.", 
    "Like others, I was imagining a much larger chair. In reality, this is very low profile and very small, almost child size. I ended up giving it to my sister. Other than that, the craftsmanship was decent and it was easily assembled.", 
    "If I could give this chair 6 stairs, I would. People of all ages who have sat in this rocking chair find it extremely comfortable. Only one thing to take into consideration, it is very low to the ground. Assembly was super easy.", 
    "I love this chair and still use it a year later, but it is smaller than I originally thought - would make a great addition to a child's bedroom.", 
    "Great little chair. I find it very comfortable and enjoy rocking on it. We have two on the sun porch and they look great. High quality construction for a great replica chair! Pleased with my purchase.", 
    "its really a good looking chair and I love it, but the screws keep getting loose and I already lost one so every time I rock my baby on it it makes a very bad squeak.", 
    "I don't know if it's just the way it's meant to be, but the chair feels almost child-sized so it doesn't feel comfortable or secure to actually rock in the chair. Sitting in the chair is fine, but rocking is probably best left for smaller people, like children.", 
    "Great for a kids room. Any reasonable sized adult over 100lbs will feel as if it is breaking. Need to retighten the screws occasionally. Great looking overall.", 
    "This is the perfect knock-off of a VERY expensive designer chair especially for the price! Super easy to put together and sturdy enough for my 200 + lbs husband. Do be aware it is definitely a low profile so it may not work in larger rooms or paired up against bulky furniture. We have it tucked in our office corner and receive many compliments. For a plastic backing I'd say it doesn't look too cheap. I love sitting in it drinking my wine listening to music!", 
    "The chair is a lot smaller than I expected. I even used a tape measure before I purchased it but it's too small. However it is really cute! I want to return it and get a size bigger or get something else", 
    "Very comfortable to sit and looks great.", 
    "I used this chair in our church nursery. I finally gave it away as the screws that attach the legs kept falling out. I have no idea how or why, but as tight as we would screw them in, the rocking motion made the screws come undone and then they would get lost on the floor. I finally just gave it away. It's super cute though and very sturdy.", 
    "its small but sturdy and mighty. Designed very well and it rocks smoothly", 
    "We ordered one rocker to accompany the rest of the set. These chairs are easy to assemble and beautiful.", 
    "Amazing product for the Price! SUPER easy to assemble. I was rocking in it 5 minutes after I opened the box.", 
    "Great rocker! Easy to assemble but super small. Sized for a child rather than an adult. Definitely not made to be able to rock a baby in even though it looks cool! :)", 
    "I've not seen a real Eames to compare, but it looks good to me! We put a pillow behind it to break up the white and add comfort. It certainly low, but perfect for both myself and my two little boys. It's very lightweight and slips around on our hardwood floor easily. Need to keep an eye on it, so my boys don't rock the bottom into the wall behind it.", 
    "Put this in our daughters nursery, looks great!", 
    "A little flimsy and not comfortable. Was not thrilled with the quality.", 
    "easy to assemble, colors were true, it rocks well", 
    "Love this, and everyone who sits in it loves it and says it fits like a glove. I've been buying this style of chair for 25 years now, and I was 100% satisfied with the prodiuct... I have 6 of them...", 
    "It is a great chair! A little shorter than I anticipated but not enough to make a difference. Comfortable and very easy to put together. The product arrived in perfect condition and the quality is excellent. I would recommend to my friends.", 
    "This chair is exactly as pictured/described and super easy to assemble. It added some style and a little sophistication to our nursery.", 
    "Very easy to put together and very well made!", 
    "I was not expecting it to be the size of a childs chair from the description. Other than that it's cute. I just wish it worked in my adult apartment!", 
    "This is the perfect, little modern rocker. We put a sheepskin in the seat to make it more comfortable. There isn't a ton of back support, so you have to be okay with that, but I knew that would be the case and enjoy it for occasional sitting.", 
    "The chair is super comfortable and it is small for a reason - the reason is it's a prototype of the original..and original chair is exact same size", 
    "This is one of my favorite chairs in my home. I've had it a couple of years now and its in great shape! Highly recommend!", 
    "Love this chair ... It's adorable in any nursery", 
    "This chair is much smaller than I expected, but that's fine since I'm only 5'2\". Aside from is being smaller person sized, it's perfect! And not to mention it's comfortable!", 
    "Smaller in person. Ended up in a child's room.", 
    "fits nicely in small bedroom...comfortable", 
    "we couldn't be more pleased with our order", 
    "This was such an amazing deal. I got it with black Friday discount, so it was a steal! This chair not only was simple to assemble, it's comfortable, is good quality, and looks adorable in the nursery. I plan on keeping this chair to repurpose in a different room when my son no longer needs this in his nursery. Great knock off at an amazing value!", 
    "Looks great in the room. A bit smaller than we expected, but very comfortable for adults.", 
    "I bought this chair for my son's nursery and it looks perfect. I absolutely love it.", 
    "I read other reviews stating these chairs were small - I thought they meant width wise. They are in fact very short / low to the ground. I'm 5'4 and it's a little short for me. They are strong, look very nice and only other downside is they get dirty pretty easily.", 
    "Great deal, looks like the real deal!", 
    "Like the description says -- \"small\". The cradle is adult sized but the rocker bottom is almost as low as a child sized chair. Odd proportions but a cute piece to use as an accent.", 
    "We've had this for two years and still love it. Wears well.", 
    "Very nice and easy to put together , sturdy . Although I have had for a month . It's seems good quality", 
    "Amazing! Great price! Great quality. Great purchase.", 
    "This chair sits very low to the ground and is more for a child", 
    "Ordered the chair in grey and color is taupe so does not go with colors of room was to use it in. Had I'd known would have ordered in black. Hoping to exchange for this color for black if possible.", 
    "I wanted the real version of this chair - until I found out they cost nearly $500. This chair has a great silhouette, looks more expensive than it is and has rocked more than a few visiting babies.", 
    "I purchased this chair for a guest room where my mother-in-law would be visiting. I thought the rocking part of the chair would be nice for her. As it turns out, my husband loves the chair despite its small-ish size (he is 6'). He can balance perfectly in it with his laptop and sit comfortably for a stretch. The plastic mold is very comfy and warm. I love this chair and am thinking of purchasing a second.", 
    "Not a child's chair although it would be great for kids too, it's the correct scale and it's wonderful, the plastic is different from the original fiberglass but other than that it's a great edition to any mid century modern room", 
    "I ordered a baby chair! It's so tiny! Perfect for a kids room... unfortunately that's not what I was going for. It's very cute, easy to put together and sturdy but it's just... small.", 
    "This chair looks just as pictured, although it is slightly smaller than I expected- but not in a bad way. It is very attractive, durable, and actually quite comfortable. We constantly get compliments on the chair. Great price.", 
    "I have owned this chair for nearly 3 years now. Fast shipping! It was super easy to assemble- just a few screws to attach the legs. It served well for rocking a newborn. The back is designed low with no headrest. I knew that before i purchased it, so I was prepared. It is wonderful for a toddler room- easy to wipe clean. We moved across country with it and i was grateful for how lightweight and small scale it is compared to other rockers. I put a sheepskin in it for cushioning.", 
    "I love chair. I love the modern look of it, it's easy to clean and it adds a stunning modern accent to my midcentury/modern decor.", 
    "I bought this rocker when my second child was born. I really like this rocking chair . It is small and lightweight, easy to move around. The style is great, but it is also pretty comfortable. The height of the arms is nice for me (I'm 5'4\"). However, both my husband and I dislike the height of the back. When you are at a full rock, the back edge puts a good amount of pressure on the middle of my back. Therefore, I rock only medium. Also, the wooden rockers are lighter in color than pictured, and I think the wood looks a little cheap. Still, I like the chair. My 3 year old thinks it's awesome too.", 
    "We bought the rocker chair to put in our living room. It's super cute but a little short, measuring about 15\" from the ground. It is modern and light. The box came on time and packaged properly upon delivery. Very easy to install. I would recommend not wearing any dark jeans that could transfer the color onto the white plastic seats.", 
    "Looks cute, aesthetically pleasing, functionally less practical and comfortable than an actual rocking chair but it does the job for story time and cuddling with our toddler daughter in her room", 
    "This is an excellent reproduction. Great value, easy to assemble. Quickly shipped. Would buy this again. I am 5'8\" and 150lbs and the seat fits fine. My husband is much bigger than me and he sits comfortably in it too. He is over 200 lbs and 6 ft. This was purchased as seating in a child's bedroom. It looks very cool.", 
    "I read several reviews on here that concerned me about the size of this chair. The dimensions are on the description. It is a low profile chair, but I don't believe it to be a child sized chair. My husband who is 6'2\" can easily sit in it. It's not something I would rather spend hours sitting in, but I have it in my kitchen sitting room where someone will likely sit in it for a short time to drink coffee, read a mag, or just hang for a few. It's definitely an interesting, modern piece and rocks well.", 
    "The rocking chair was just what I was searching for. It has a small footprint, it is easy to move around, sturdy enough that my grandchildren cannot tip it over and it fits everyone. It is a great chair", 
    "Bought for a baby nursery. A large, cushy recliner would definitely be more comfortable, but we don't have the space for something that big, plus I like the look and style of this better. It's actually pretty comfortable for me while nursing (more so than any of our other chairs, or our couch even); my only complaint is that it would be nice if I could lean my head back against something, but obviously this chair isn't designed for that. My husband is super uncomfortable in it, but it's not for him, so...", 
    "I ordered two for my den and I'm quite happy with them.They look just as they are pictured. You can tell that a few corners have been cut from the original design, but nothing I can't get over, given that I saved hundreds of dollars over the originals. They are firm since they're plastic, but I think they're quite comfortable as well.If you want these chairs, I would seriously consider one of the colored options. I like the look of white, but I know they will end up with scuffs and stains eventually. The texture of the plastic is not smooth, so I don't think dirt will come off easily.I also have the same chairs, but with the fixed wooden legs, also from overstock. The chairs with the fixed legs are about 4 inches taller when set up. This doesn't bother me, but if you're also ordering both, you might want to consider that.", 
    "Love the look, the size is fine for myself but I don't believe my husband would sit in it. Too small for him!", 
    "An excellent option for a stylish casual chair in a living room or bedroom. Others have mentioned using it as a rocking chair in a nursery - - you definitely can. I saw someone using these as front porch rockers. You could but they will weather a bit. Really a nice mock-up of the original at a bargain basement price.", 
    "*Obviously this is not totally perfect. I only say that because unlike the original, it's not fiberglass and the rockers aren't walnut. But, the dimensions are identical to the original and the materials used are high quality. It looks just like the Eames rocker that DWR sells and it assembles quickly out of the box. Like a lot of the other reviewers said, the box comes a little busted but everything was safe inside. Guys, buy it.", 
    "I am 5'1\" and felt enormous in this chair. It is just barely 2 feet off the ground--26\", to be exact.I would be perfect for a child's room, but not for the corner of my living room like I wanted.", 
    "This is a great little rocker in the mid-century style. It is perfect in my guest bedroom. It is not very large in size, so it might not work for a larger person, but for anyone under 250 lbs, it's probably fine. It is pretty comfortable even though the seat is hard. Easy assembly.", 
    "I ordered this chair for the nursery that we are finishing for our daughter who will arrive in a few days. It perfectly fits the style of the polka dots walls and white pottery barn kids furniture. I am not sure if it will fulfill its function because we haven't used the chair yet. The assembly was extremely easy and quick. At this point my review is very limited as far as functionality of the piece, but it's a beautiful piece of furniture for sure.", 
    "I've been looking at this chair for a long time but kept not buying it due to people saying that it was really short (my husband and I are both on the tall side). I'm really glad I decided to get it afterall! It goes perfectly in our son's room, and it's actually way more comfortable than i expected. We did have to put a small pillow behind our backs to keep them from hurting while we rock with our son in our lap, but otherwise it's been great to sit in. It doesn't rock as smoothly as I'd like, but I'm not entirely sure if it's the rockers on the chair or our old hardwoods. Overall, it's a great chair for the price, and I love the style.", 
    "I've had this for over a year and I get so many compliments. Throw a lambskin over it and it created a focal point in any room!", 
    "This chair is really cute, well made, easy to put together. It is smaller than I'd thought it would be, however, it's great for my guest room.", 
    "I am so I love with this perfect little rocking chair! It adds just the right element of cool to my son's not-so-babyish nursery, is totally fun to sit in to rock him to sleep and fits perfectly in his room, which is on the smaller side. It isn't a huge rocking chair, but I knew that when I bought it but it still works great for the adults who have used it. I totally would recommend this to everyone, great value, super easy to assemble and full of style! LOVE IT!", 
    "I adore this chair and love the price. It added a little quirkiness to my decor. It is also surprisingly comfortable for a non padded chair. Having seen the (very expensive) original I was not surprised that this is a smaller size chair.", 
    "This chair might be suitable for a small child, less than five years old. I am an adult, only 5' tall, and this chair is way too little for me. It is not a normal sized piece of furniture.", 
    "I bought this for my baby's nursery because of the size and modern look. I like it and have gotten quite a few compliments. I will agree with other reviewer's who say that it sits low. The size works, but it does seem small. For the price and the overall look, I would still recommend.", 
    "I wanted a rocking chair that was stylish and this is it. It's not as tall as I thought it would be but still worked out great in my space and looks more expensive than it is.", 
    "Oh, I really wanted to love this chair. It would have been perfect for our nursery. I love that the plastic has a textured, almost soft feel and the design on the legs is awesome. However, it's not for anyone over like 5' 6\". The back of the chair is super low (I'm 5' 9\") and it provides no support at all. I didn't expect it to be super comfy (it is plastic after all) but it's totally not going to work. I feel like I'm sitting on a stool and that's not going to cut it with a baby. I think this is closer in size to my 2 year old's rocking chair than to the glider we have in my son's room.", 
    "Ordered and sent to my single daughter. She seemed very pleased, although she said it looked so small. We knew it was not a large chair. But she was pleased and said it was comfortable. I would purchase again!!", 
    "I really like this chair. Great price and quality for an imitation Eames!", 
    "It's kinda small but not strangely so. I like it very much!", 
    "It's for the baby's nursery and will fit perfectly. I have a small space for a rocking chair and this one is exactly what I needed. It's short and small and it's how it was meant to be by Eames. Very good quality for a knock off.", 
    "i bought this as an accent rocking chair in my toddler's room. i would not recommend if you plan on using hourly with an infant, it's a little hard, but with a pillow it's fine for occasional use. stylish knockoff of a more expensive chair. great price!", 
    "You can't beat the style for the price. The chair arrived just as described. It was easy to assemble and is quite comfortable. I would come back for more!", 
    "This retro rocker makes an excellent chair in our guest bedroom. It is both stylish and practical. The price point was far better than any other site we checked", 
    "While cute, it is not a substantial chair. It will fit the average adult, but not a large person. I bought it for the midcentury look in my family room. It could easily be used in a child's room. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "These are completely adorable. They are on the smaller side, but still very comfortable for an adult. They sit lower to the ground. I would recommend these if you already have lower-profile furniture in the room, otherwise these may look out of place. Luckily, I have low-profile furniture in the room these went into so they look outstanding, but any other room and they would have seemed dwarfed. I do need to mention my first time sitting in them I thought \"wow, how comfortable!\" and then I began to rock to try it out and I thought I was going to fly backward. YOU WILL NOT FLY BACKWARD, it just feels like that at first due to the length of the wooden rocker bases, almost like curved skis. They curve up in front and elongate toward the back making a different kind of stride on the way backward. Once this was discovered, I was fine with it, but it was jolting at first to not know how far back I was going to go. All in all I like these chairs and they definitely fit the bill for what I wanted. They look amazing!", 
    "Mid-century modern style rockers! Easy to assemble. White finish= dirt magnet Compact seat size & height. These chairs are extremely small. Check the specs vs your size & weight before purchasing. The style for price factor make these chairs worthwhile.", 
    "This is a very petite version of this chair. While it is comfortable and attractive, it needs to be used alone because it looks awarkly small when next to a standard chair. If you are at all \"chubby\" this chair might be a little tight. It's a mat finish and I would have preferred a little sheen, but overall it is an excellent buy and the quality is great!", 
    "Very cool stylish little rocker for my teenaged daughter's room. Fits perfectly.", 
    "I really love the look of this chair! The price is great and it seems to be well made. But... It really does look like a kids chair, despite having similar overall dimensions to an eames chair. I'm not sure if I'll end up keeping it because it just looks odd next to my couch, like I'm expecting elves over for dinner. I may just have to find a different spot for it. If you are looking for a super cute rocker for a nursery or kids room it's a great deal though!! A few other comments: The wooden rockers are lighter than they appear in the photo. Also, there were no instructions in the box, so if you are not familiar with washers and other tool-y stuff you'll just have to guess like I did.", 
    "Good proportions and materials, looks similar to the original.", 
    "Very retro chair that has gotten compliments already. Used as an accessory chair in a mainly white bedroom. As such, very happy with the size as it does not dominate the space. Comfort question is obviously misleading, as this is not upholstered. Very comfortable, although not used for long term seating.", 
    "I read the other reviews before buying this chair, and I knew it was going to be on the smaller side, which I was fine with. However when I saw it in my living room, I literally laughed out loud! However, it is an attractive chair so I decided to keep it, but had to place it in a different corner spot, mostly for my children to use. It does fit an adult, but seems comically small!", 
    "This is a wonderful replica of a classic Eames design. If you're familiar with Eames, the dimensions of this chair are spot on! I trusted the other reviewers who seemed to be familiar with Eames and mid-century modern furniture design and very glad I did (it could be easy to get discouraged from reading the reviews about this chair being small). This chair was very easy for me to assemble in a matter of minutes using only the allen wrench provided. This chair looks chic in my apartment and already fooled one friend. Definitely different from the original (matte plastic), but I knew that going into the purchase. Very pleased! Also worth noting, the box arrived without any damage!", 
    "It's cute but smaller than you would expect. Easy to assemble, nice looking for the price. The plastic does get marks, so you do need to clean it.", 
    "I think the chair is great for the price. Only thing is that u can see the circles from the bottom of the screws on top of the seat. That makes it look cheap. It's comfortable for short periods of time but adds style to our living room as an accent chair.", 
    "I have many original mid century modern chairs. But I could not pass up this reproduction at a fraction of the cost. While the shell is different from the originals produced in the 50's, it is very similar to the more expensive authorized reproduction being sold be DWR. The chair is definitely a smaller scale than most chairs today. But it is not a child's chair.", 
    "such a perfect knockoff. and super cheap! love it. and it showed up faster than I expected too.", 
    "This is an accent chair; it is all about being stylish. You can't sit on it if you are looking for super comfortness. But all my friends and family members love this chair because of the way it looks!", 
    "Just know that the chair is small. I love it but had to put it in a bedroom as my other living room furniture made it look like a toy chair. We have a white bedroom that it looks great in. I leave the door open so I can see it when I pass the room. It is not a child's chair and is comfortable to sit in, but is much smaller scale than the furniture I have in the living room.", 
    "I first saw this chair while googling for some nursery ideas, and was thrilled when I realized it was affordable! We have our first baby on the way and wanted a simple rocker that wouldn't take up too much space. It comes in a very light box, all we needed to do was screw the bottom to the chair with 4 bolts, super easy. I'm 5'3 and 120lbs, so it's the perfect chair for me. Seems super comfy and has a nice rocking motion. My 6'2 180lb husband looks silly in it, but he says it's comfy for him too. This is def. a smaller chair, low to the ground and will stay in baby's room, it would look too tiny in a large living area, but for smaller rooms or apartments it's got a fantastic design. Height is about the same as a toilet - so I can see how some folks could be surprised opening the box, but measurements are listed under the description, so we were expecting it as it is!", 
    "This chair is exactly what I was looking for. It looks great in our nursery!", 
    "brings style to a room. great price, cute size. love it", 
    "An exact Eames knock off. I love this chair. Very comfortable and that great mid-century look.", 
    "This was a great looking chair, that was sized to fit a child. The dimensions were so small and the back of the chair so low that it felt as if it would tip over backwards. A poor purchase all around. It isn't safe for children or adults. Unfortunately, the return of the item was just as bad of an experience as receiving the item. Overstock has docked $45 from the return price at their whim since now they consider the item damaged when I returned it in perfect condition. I wont be purchasing from overstock ever again. Very disappointing.", 
    "If you are looking for a chair that also rocks in place, here you are. The name of the chair, \"Vinnie White Cradle Chair\", is a bit misleading. It is not a \"cradle\". DO NOT try and put your baby in the chair alone. But if you would like to hold your baby in your arms while you sit in the chair, that is perfectly acceptable. Easy to put together, simple style.", 
    "This is not the most comfortable rocker but it is really cute, is an excellent replica of the original for a near fraction of the price.", 
    "This is an excellent quality chair for the price. Great Reproduction! Not recommended for an every day chair. Casual use is excellent. See measurements as they were not designed to be a big chair. Has a very small/slim profile.", 
    "Small but nice, sold to a friend bc too small for my house.", 
    "This is a good looking chair, but it was delivered with a small gouge in the seat. It's not big enough to merit the hassle of sending it back, yada, yada. The other thing is it's not particularly easy to assemble. It took me a few tries to align the bolts correctly and then you have to tighten them like the lugs on a tire kind of going from one bolt to the opposite corner then back and forth to get them fully tightened down. The chair looks good and is a bargain at this price, but due to the flaw, I can't give it an excellent rating.", 
    "I will admit we don't sit in this chair much but it's a piece of art in the nursery. Its great as a guest chair and the kids love it!", 
    "I love it it is just lower than I expected. It is not the normal height of a chair.", 
    "This is a very high quality knock-off. The chair is surprisingly comfortable and attractive, the only minus is that it is a little lightweight. Not a real issue, but just something to note.", 
    "i really like the aesthetic appeal and it is very comfortable to sit and rock it. had no problems in assembly and it came together in minutes.", 
    "this is the cutest rocker ever i adore it and it is very comfortable it has a very unique style i love it", 
    "I love this chair, but my boyfriend is not a fan. As other reviewers have said, it's definitely lower to the ground than you imagine when you're looking at the pictures. I'm not bothered by that, and it's the same height as the original Eames chair it's modeled on. The chair is comfortable for any normal-sized adult to sit in, but you might have to stretch your feet out a bit instead of sitting with them straight down. Feels like it might not last forever -- maybe not quite as sturdy as it could be, but for the price, I'm OK with that. Overall, very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I'm not sure how durable this chair will be in the long run but I am only using it to \"fill space\" so it's great for me! The seat is definitely made of molded plastic vs. enameled fiberglass of the mid-century originals.", 
    "This was exactly what I was expecting (and more), would definitely recommend to anyone!", 
    "I bought these for our loft for two teenage girls to use. We've had them 2 years and they've been used about 5 times. They say they are not comfortable. Going in a garage sale tomorrow. Very cute design!", 
    "Was redoing my guest bedroom and changing the style to an mix of modern and transitional. Needed a cool chair and had seen this before but didn't have a spot in my house to put it until I did the bedroom. Can't beat the price point, it's an imitation of a much more expensive chair and it's great! Very happy with my purchase....fits the space perfectly, I didn't want anything too large but wanted something to make a statement. The scale of the chair is the same as the very expensive version. I am 6' tall female and it's a comfortable chair for me to sit in.......great buy!!!!", 
    "Great Rocking chair. The small size of this rocker works perfectly in my teen's bedroom measuring 6 x 11'. There is enough clearance for a twin bed & the rocker off to the side. The rocker is good quality & comfortable. It is not padded but the plastic seat is well shaped.", 
    "This chair was way smaller than I was expecting. It is more a child's size. It was dwarfed by the size of my sofa so it didn't look right at all. Also, it came with a stain on the seat, so I returned it. Quality was fine otherwise, just really small.", 
    "We really love this chair, very modern. We use in baby room and it's perfect size for us to sit in and our toddler can climb in alone. Looks great and good quality. I didn't give 5 stars because the seat is very matte finish and I think that if it gets anything (like crayon /marker etc) on it, it would be difficult to clean. But that hasn't happened yet, so not sure.", 
    "This is a high-quality piece of stylish furniture. The main question the reviews here try to address: Is this seat too small for an adult? The answer:Yes and no. This is not a question of corn-fed Americans being too husky for slick euro-design. The seat itself is wide and deep and accommodating enough for most adult rear ends. It's molded perfectly and is very comfortable to sit in. The back isn't very high, but other than that, it's a perfect seat. The problem is how short the rocking legs are. Your rear sits about 13-14 inches off the ground. Measure a typical chair in your home and you'll see that this is a very low-to-the-ground chair. Normal adult legs are too long for the chair. When rocking, you will either have your knees bent so the bottom half of your legs are underneath the chair, or extended far out. Unless you're pretty darn short (I'm 5'7), your legs will not bend at a 90 degree angle. This isn't exactly uncomfortable, but it isn't optimal either. We bought it for our nursery, as many others have. It will be a great chair for our daughter's room as she grows up. It looks great, so I have no regrets buying it, but it would look silly in a room of 'adult' furniture due to its height. In sum, the chair is best for children or the very short (5' tall), but will be fine in a pinch for those taller than us.", 
    "Great purchase, excellent price, true to size. My Husband and adult stepson enjoy sitting in it with no complaints, although it is a smaller scale. Perfect compliment to any decor or room. Would work great in a teenagers bedroom, office, entryway... we use it in a smaller end of our familyroom which was a three season porch. Could not be happier!!!", 
    "I love this chair! Its a great price and looks beautiful in my room. It does scratch quite easily (especially if someone is wearing jeans or something), but I mean it's plastic so use your noggin! I just threw a sheepskin stole on it which keeps in protected and gives it a nice cozy vibe. Took about five minutes to assembled and looks magnificent.", 
    "This chair was purchased for a spare bedroom. It's very comfortable, and sturdy. Would easily purchase again. I have used as an extra seat when we had company, and it held a hearty 225+lb man, and he said it was comfortable! Yikes ... but it held up. Good buy, no regrets.", 
    "Cool looking chair but very short. Not really for adults but perfect for a childs room. Good design but should only be used for a child.", 
    "Purchase this as a small chair for a guest room/nursery. Easy to assemble and very comfortable. Love this rocker. Great design.", 
    "Always wanted one of these for the nursery, it's cute, it looks small in American standards, but I hate anythign bulky and big. I could not justify purcahse of the real one, and this will do the trick for me.", 
    "this chair looks really cool and modern but i would prefer something a bit more comfy/", 
    "I was surprised by how low the back of the chair was - I even looked back at the description to make sure I didn't order a juvenile chair by mistake. But when I looked back I saw all the reviews about how the chair is pretty much an exact replica and meant to be low. The chair is very comfortable. I bought this for the nursery and the arms are at a perfect height for cradling a nursing baby. So glad I didn't wait to purchase - it is out of stock now!", 
    "I love my this chair! It has a slightly textured surface; I was expecting smooth & shiny, I don't know why. I probably didn't read the description thoroughly.", 
    "This is a rocking chair with style and a must have if you like modern furniture. It did not come with instructions but was very easy to assemble. The back could be higher -- even for me at 5' but I still find it comfortable.", 
    "I was convinced by other reviews of the Vinnie White Cradle Chair that it would fulfill my desire for an Eames chair but would fit my budget. When it arrived and was assembled, it appeared to be too small for an average adult. However, it is the perfect size, is very comfortable and is the go-to chair in the living room now! We love it! We've even had style-conscious friends comment, \"Wow! An Eames chair!\"", 
    "The chair is exactly what I wanted. It looks great in my living room with a sheep skin throw on it. It is on the small side, but I knew that when I ordered it.", 
    "The chair is beuttiful but kiddy size ... its a chairs to go to kids or baby room .looks rediculuos in the bedroom or in livingroom. Have to mantion the great service of overstock representative ,when called to ask about returns fees and policy she said she emailing a free return lable !!!!! So i didnt pay for returning the chair.", 
    "This is a beautiful chair and the price is unbelievably cheap...", 
    "Great piece. The quality is definatly not as nice as the original herman miller, but at 1/6th of the cost, you manage to get over it. The chair is smaller than you think, but the measurements are spot on of the original, its just a small chair.", 
    "My husband and I purchased this chair for our nursery. We love it. Baby hasn't arrived yet, but we're using it all the time. It's comfortable and very stylish.", 
    "This chair is rad. My only beef is that it's a lot shorter than I thought it would be, which is a little weird. It looks like an albino E.T. However, It has a nice, wide seat -- perfect for friends and family who are larger. That's not a joke. I want ALL people to feel comfortable in my home! Also, the rocker is nice on carpet. It doesn't leave a heavy mark and can still lull you to sleep easily when you sit in it. But more importantly, you can't beat the price. I bought two of them for under ***.", 
    "Pleasantly surprised by the chair. Solid construction and perfect style choice for the room. My 5 year has been all over it with no problem. The only surprise was how short the rocker is - not small but short. I had to re-think where it went in the room because it was so much shorter then the couch profile. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "I'm a little over 200lbs and was scared this would be too flimsy for me - not so! It's a great little rocker to enjoy. It's not a chair you're going to relax in for an extended period of time unless you're a smaller person - under 5' 5\" or so. The back of the chair just isn't high enough to really get comfortable in for that long period of time. It's lightweight, so it great to have on hand for extra seating as we can move it around easily. I have it in the corner and use it to put my shoes on or take a load off while listening to music. Obviously this is an interpretation of a very popular designer's work and frankly, for the money, I'd go with this all day long. It's great to look at and functions well.", 
    "I love this chair. Others are correct that the seat is not particularly deep; this is not a chair to fall asleep in. But the chair looks great, and is perfect for extra seating. It is especially nice if you use a poof to prop up your feet. A very affordable alternative to branded similar chairs.", 
    "I loved the look of this chair, it was exactly what I was looking for and the price was excellent. However, the material of the white chair-part feels like an upgraded cheap plastic (think higher quality children's toy... that's about the same feel); I was expecting something more similar to Melamine or Acrylic. This is important because the bright white material that is used picks up every.single.speck.of.dirt. A better quality plastic would have wiped easily or not immediately marked, but this picks up everything (3 children in the home, within a day, it was covered in hand prints and foot prints). It's also not super comfortable-- the back seems really short (and I'm not a tall person). Anyway, if you're going on looks only and won't have any kids around, this could be the ideal chair for a sitting room. Otherwise, it's all first-impression-looks and regret after. I'm sending it back now.", 
    "Love this chair! Been looking for one for a while, but can't really afford the real deal... This chair is great, and at a great price. Looks great in my living room.", 
    "Love this chair. Modern and comfortable. My daughter has this in her new \"teen\" room and it is such a cool accent plus she and friends love sitting in it.", 
    "I wanted a different kind of rocking chair for our toddler's room. We had outgrown a traditional glider, and I was looking for something more stylish and sophisticated. This was it. After reading through the many helpful reviews, I decided to buy it. My husband wasn't into the modern design too much when I showed it to him online but once he saw it in person and sat in, he loved it too. He is a big guy, and he fits in it just fine and finds it to be very comfortable. It was also a breeze to put together. His mom thought the chair was \"different\" when I showed it to her online, but she was pleasantly surprised at how cool it is. In fact, she thought it would be a great child's chair once we outgrew the need for a rocker since it's on the small side. I agreed. All in all, another great Overstock purchase and you can't beat the price.", 
    "I love this chair. Its a great accent chair. Great Fit in a living room or kids room. Its a great replica of the original. Very easy to assemble. I highly recommend.", 
    "I love the chair... Obviously in a perfect world I would have the actual eames rocker, but this is much more affordable and looks fabulous. I used it in our living room.. it is quite small, but that is how it is suppose to be. My son (16 months) actually loves it the most. It's just super cute and modern.", 
    "I was worried about purchasing this item thinking the price would reflect the quality. These chairs are so expensive on other sites, even reproductions. When my chair arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. I love the look of this chair and am happy with the modern touch they add to my decor without the hefty price tag.", 
    "This chair is not for everyone but if you like unique modern w a retro feel this s your chair! It can be used for a nursery or child's room. The price is fantastic compared to the original designer on Land of Nod which retails for 300!", 
    "Easy to assemble, great quality, and very comfortable. The size is perfect for adults and children, just like the original.", 
    "I am a huge fan of Mid-Century modern design and when I saw this rocker with its affordable price tag, I just had to have it for our nursery. It is small in scale, but it is supposed to be, the original ones are very small. This is an Adult sized chair, it just has a small footprint. It is a more comfortable sit if you put an upholstered seat pad on the chair, we added one with a pop of color and it looks great. I am planning on getting a true recliner for the nursery but gosh, this one is adorable and will be a great looking piece for years to come! My only negative is that it holds a bit of static electricity, however, it could be that the air is quite dry this winter.", 
    "This is a great little rocker, and for the price you really can't go wrong! Like so many others, I would love to be able to afford the original, but it's just not in my budget. I was looking for a small-ish chair for my bedroom and this fit the bill perfectly. Compact design, and surprisingly comfortable. It\u0092s a low chair, which I was aware of before purchasing it, but that\u0092s what I wanted. I\u0092ve had my taller friends sit in it and they\u0092ve all said that the height doesn\u0092t bother them. Delivery was very speedy, and it came well-packaged. The overall quality of the chair is good. There was one minor nick in the plastic, but it's not noticeable unless you're really looking. It\u0092s a nice bright matte white, with a very subtle texture to the plastic. There were no instructions in the box, but customer service was very prompt in sending me a PDF version (and I also found a number of sites that had similar downloadable instructions for their version of this chair). It was very easy to assemble. I\u0092ve read a few reviews that said the holes didn\u0092t line up, but I had no problem. I got all four lined up and half screwed in before I tightened them, which seemed to be a good method. I also re-tightened everything about a week after first assembling it. Overall, I\u0092m very happy with this purchase!", 
    "Bought this chair for my daughter's room and she loves it. Many reviews suggested this product wasn't sturdy or large enough for adults, but it seems fine for average sized adults. It was very easy to assemble.", 
    "I like the chair a lot and my six year old daughter loves it. However this is not a chair for an adult unless you are very petite.. It is bigger than the average toddler chair but much smaller than any chair for an adult.", 
    "We purchased this small rocking chair for our baby's nursery (in white, grey and yellow). It goes really well in a child's room, it is small but large enough for adults to sit in and rock a baby :) A little less comfortable than expected on the back, but really great-looking and quality for the price. Our baby is due in a couple of months so we have not had a chance to use it extensively yet, however, we look forward to putting it through the test of time!", 
    "When this chair popped up in my email with a discount I knew I would be silly to pass it up. After reading the reviews I was a little skeptical because some people described it as a \"child's chair\" but since there were more positive than negative reviews I decided to take the plunge and buy it. Even though we are not expecting yet, the plan is to use this in a baby's room in the future and I think it will be perfect. Right now it's currently being used as extra seating in our living room and I love it. It is very deep (and definitely wide enough for grown adults of different sizes), but we just put a cute pillow to help out with that, plus add a little padding. It's comfortable without the pillow, but I like the option. I'm 5'4\" and think it's perfect, and even my 5'11\" husband thinks it's a great chair too. I look forward to rocking away the days in this cute and modern chair. It seems like it sits low to the ground but I think it's actually a really great height to be able to keep your feet on the ground, and you can always pair it with an ottoman to prop your feet up and still be able to rock if you want. Another note I'll make is that like other reviewers I also had a few problems getting the holes to all align when assembling it, but I was able to get all four screws in after using a little elbow grease. It's not perfectly put together but it definitely is not going to fall apart on me. Overall, it's a great chair at an amazing price! I highly recommend this chair!", 
    "Very good replica of the Eames RAR Molded Plastic Rocking Chair for a fraction (<1/4) of the price.", 
    "Soooo easy to assemble. I'm 6'3\" and 240 lbs and these chairs are surprisingly super comfortable. We purchased these for a nursery and are a perfect complement to the decor.", 
    "very nice piece, just as described. It is most definitely a chair most appropriate for a child. This is what we bought it for, so we are very pleased!", 
    "I love this chair, it's very well made. Very sturdy and charming. Wish I had more space to buy it in all colors!", 
    "I was so excited when this chair arrived. Between the price and the super cool, retro/modern look of it, I felt like I truly got a steal! Glad I made this purchase.", 
    "Smaller scale great for small nursery, but still decent size for average size adult & comfy. Looks classy & different than the usual nursery rocker. Using this in grandsons room.", 
    "Beautiful chair, excellent price! It's certainly not the highest quality piece of furniture I own, but you cant beat the price.", 
    "Purchased for a baby nursery in a city loft apartment. The look and scale are perfect for the room and the taste of the parents-to-be. Not as comfy as a more traditional, larger, padded rocker, but I knew that going in. Assembly seemed pretty easy.", 
    "I received my order pretty fast and I'm very happy with it. The only thing that surprised me is the size of the chair. It's smaller than a regular chair. I bought it for my baby's room so in a way, it will be good for her as she grows up.", 
    "I bought this chair for my son's nursery, and I love it. You cannot compare it to a fully upholstered glidder for comfort, but it is a win-win on looks. My husband is not very keen on it (he reminds me every once in a while that I should've gotten a glidder), but I use it all the time. I'm 5'7\", and I love to nurse my son in it. I find that using a stool (I bought a poof at CB2 for it) makes it very comfortable.", 
    "Great modern look. Super comfortable rocking chair.", 
    "this chair is very comfortable but it is on the smaller side", 
    "This chair looks just like it does in the pictures. From across the room it could pass for a $200 item. However up close you realize the texture is cheap grainy plastic and resembles nothing like the finish of smooth fiberglass. For the price, I knew I wasn't getting fiberglass. But I was led to believe it was going to be a hard, rigid, sturdy plastic with smooth shiny finish. It's flimsy, feels and looks cheap when using it and is not comfortable to sit in if you are over 5'-4\" tall. Had I been able to look at it in a store I wouldn't have paid more than $30 for it. If you've never seen an original, and need something to fill a dorm room... and can't get to ikea, it may be just fine. Otherwise, don't fall for it.", 
    "This chair is exactly what it looks like. It comes pretty much assembled except putting the base and top together with a few bolts. It's comfortable for a shorter person like me (5 ft 4in) and I enjoy rocking in it even though the baby has not arrived yet. I prefer to put a pillow on the back to make it more comfortable as I watch TV in it for extended periods of time.", 
    "Love this chair, such a great value! I've wanted this style of chair for a while and this was a great find and saved me hundreds. Easy assembly, very sturdy and comfortable!", 
    "Please pay attention to the dimensions of this chair. I was aware it would be small but wasnt expecting it to be juvenille looking. I have a low sitting italian white leather couch and figured it would blend since the couch was low. If it were a foot higher, I would've loved it. Not ideal for average height adults, cute for your child's room though! I returned it.", 
    "The chair arrived quickly, and comes in two pieces. Unfortunately, one of the screws didn't quite fit properly in one of the holes in the seat of the chair, causing imperfect construction - but it doesn't affect the use of the chair horribly. The seat is made of plastic and is very light. I wouldn't call the chair incredibly comfortable for my 6'0\" frame, but it looks quite nice in the living room. It does sit low for my height, but is not a real issue. I wouldn't recommend using it as a seat for a table or desk. Overall, the price was right and I think the quality of the chair at that price is expected. I would be willing to pay more for a more perfect chair though, but can't afford the original Eames design.", 
    "I ordered two cradle chairs into our weekend house to have them in the living hall. The look is perfect. Simple, unique and really stylish. The chairs are really stable and massive, really durable, and I have to admit I was surprised as I did not expect such quality. I warmly recommend them to everyone even if only for display as they rock.", 
    "I always search for unique pieces to complete the decor of my home and on Overstock I always find that piece that I need. This is how I found a pair of amazing cradle chairs which were destined to be in the large living room,. The look is really fresh and retro in the same time and from time to time they are really cozy to sit and relax in.", 
    "This chair is so relaxing. I liked it because of it's unique look and I was simply going to use it for guest, but after siting in if on the first day, it has become my favorite chair. It's comfort level comes from the fact that you really do feel like you're being lulled to sleep when you sit in it. Not many people like white furniture, but this is worth buying despite its color.", 
    "This cradle chair is the perfect decor addition for the room. It is stylish with a retro charm and really great quality. I sometimes sit in it and relax, and then nothing feels better. I do not wonder everybody loves it, as it is perfect.", 
    "love this product. shipping was extremely quick and chair was simple to assemble. it seems sturdy, though i might worry about it holding up to a lot of weight in it. so far, so good!", 
    "I am not a fan of white furniture, but this chair was too good a deal not to get it. I didn't want the ordinary rocking chair for my daughter's nursery, especially since a lot of them creak and are not comfortable. This chair really does cradle you and it's comfortable to sit on for extended hours. I love it!", 
    "Purchased the rocker to go in my son's nursery. The chair has exceeded my expectations. It is just like the designer chair, you will not be disappointed.", 
    "The only Overstock item I've purchased that I've been happy with. No damage to this one from poor packaging, and ithe chair is quite nice.", 
    "These chairs are wonderful and are priced at a fraction of what the real McCoy might be. We currently have them placed around an outdoor fire-pit facing the swimming pool. They also wipe down quickly and can be easily brought into the house for additional seating. We love waking up to our morning coffee and the sun coming up over the mountains while rocking in these chairs.", 
    "This chair really does cradle you. At first glance, it looks like a rocking horse in chair form. I'm not a huge fan of chairs with wood and steel mixed together, but this chair's unique look and comfortable nature makes it a great buy. The price of this chair is a steal, I plan ordering another one in the new year.", 
    "I was surprised how compact it was when it arrived at my door. It was extremely easy to assemble. I compared it to my friend's Eames chair and I noticed that Vinnie chair is a lot more thinner and light weight. I still sit, rock and read or watch tv comfortably.", 
    "I really enjoy this product and my baby has not yet arrived. I think for the price the product is reasonable and stylish. I have seen chairs that are exactly the same for 3x's as much as this. I recommend this value version of the product.", 
    "This cradle chair has an excellent quality and look. We ordered two to have in our weekend hose, with the aim to have a cozy place where we can relax. The chairs are really comfortable and have the best design ever. Modern and classic in the same time, and the construction is solid and durable. Why to spend fortunes when you can buy top quality on affordable price.", 
    "Cradle chair is visibly nice and looks great in my toddler sons room. It is sized for children. Although, I can easily rock my son comfortably since I am only 5'2. May not work well for taller adults over 5'8.", 
    "I had a same cradle chair when my baby boy was born and now I ordered this for my sister who is pregnant. This chair worked as a miracle when the baby did not want to sleep, as only in this chair he fell asleep within minutes without crying. I was lucky having this great help and fortunately my sister will also.", 
    "This is a really excellent chair given on a fantastic price. I was searching for a cradle chair so my baby can sleep easier, but all I received was poor quality on a high price. My friend advised to look around on Overstock as here all she found was top quality and functional pieces and she was right. This chair is amazing, my baby sleeps like an angel. Thank you.", 
    "This little rocker is the perfect mid century for less chair. After easy assembly, it seems like a size intended for children, but it very comfortable fo me. I'm 5'7\" and it's perfect. I've gotten alot of compliments on it and most people prefer to rock in this seat!", 
    "I liked the size of the body of this chair. The seat itself was very wide, and the chair back was just tall enough. The construction of the metal legs and wooden rockers also seemed durable. My issues with the chair is that the body of the white plastic seat wasn't what I thought -- it's like the same plastic as a shampoo bottle; weighed like 5 pounds -- I just thought it was going to be much more heavy-duty. But that wasn't the deal breaker. It was SO low to the ground. I'm only 5'3\" and had to squat to get into it! So while I read other reviews about the \"size\" of the chair, that wasn't the problem. The problem was that it was only about 18 inches off the ground and looked like a chair for ants.", 
    "This cradle chair is amazing. Since I have it I can sit and relax in the most comfortable way and I have no back pain as before. The quality is amazing and although it looks fragile, the chair is really solidly constructed with top quality materials. Excellent service and shipment.", 
    "I ordered this cradle chair for my younger sister as she is pregnant and needs a comfortable chair before and after birth. I had a cradle chair from Overstock and I know how comfortable and amazing it is. I had comfort and a place where I can rest and relax, but most importantly my baby girl fell asleep in a record time. Great quality, service and price.", 
    "This cradle chair is definitely the best that can be found on the market. We had numerous ones in different shapes and materials but this simple one with the sturdy construction seemed to be the best of all. Even the price was half than the ones we had. I wish I found this website sooner.", 
    "It is so easy to assemble a child could do it. You have the seat and the rocker base legs. You screw the base onto the bottom side of the seat and 'voila!' it's done. It's cute and comfy in a bedroom. I didn't realize until I was raving about the facility of putting the rocker together to my daughter, that she bought the same chair for my granddaughter's bedroom!! How funny...like daughter, like mother LOL!", 
    "When I had my baby boy I ordered this cradle chair and it did miracle when it came the time to sleep. It was relaxing and really comfortable, and sleep came within 10 minutes. Now my best friend is pregnant so I ordered a cradle chair for her. The price and quality remained as great as it was. Keep on the great job.", 
    "This chair was just what I was looking for. Very stylish without being too expensive. It's smaller than many chairs, but I knew to expect this after reading other comments. Despite being smaller, it is not too small for an adult, and it is more comfortable than I would have expect. This is a chair worth buying!", 
    "Love this chair. Exactly like the Eames at Design within Reach but at a fraction of the price. Pretty easy to put together too. Very happy.", 
    "This cradle chair does miracles. It is the greatest chair we had since our baby was born. It arrived in the shortest time possible and it is as perfect and great looking as described. All solid and durable, made from top quality materials, but most important it is very very comfortable. Thank you.", 
    "This chair is a real miracle. I always had troubles with my baby boy as he does not want to sleep and always cried. My friend advised me to order this cradle chair as she said this was the only way her daughter fell asleep. As the price was really great I gave it a try and it worked. I am happy and warmly recommend it to every mother.", 
    "This chair is very good looking, but also very uncomfortable. We got a great price and put it in our guest bedroom, but probably will never sit in it...", 
    "I purchased this chair for my bedroom. I have always wanted an Eames chair, but did not think I could afford it. Was happy to discover Overstock.com. The chair is perfect. It is on the small side, but the scale was perfect for my space. very comfortable, rocks well, and seems sturdy - all for a great price.", 
    "The first chair base I received looked completely awful. The welding job was very poor and some of the spots were not actually welded together, plus the wooden parts were not tightly attached. It took several conversations with customer service to get this correct but finally about 1.5 weeks after receiving the chair I got the replacement base, about one week later I received an entire replacement chair. Now I need to send the second chair back so I don't get charged - such a hassle. The rocker itself is really cute and pretty comfortable for a plastic chair, even my tall (6'3\") husband thinks so. It has a nice rock, I'm using it as my desk chair. You may want to get a comfy blanket or sheepskin to act as a cushion and because when the weather is cool the plastic is cold. I'm happy to have this chair even after the hassle, and Overstock offers a wonderful price compared to the official reproduction.", 
    "Purchased for my niece's nursery. Smaller chair that is still comfortable for both 5'4\" mom and 6'3\" dad. Fits nicely in room without being overbearing and adds an eclectic modern touch. Very happy!", 
    "Love this chair, I was a little scared that I would have a nightmare putting this chair together from previous reviews, it only needed 4 screws! It is very cute, sturdy and whimsical. I would not mind having it in robins egg blue now.", 
    "Good chair for the price. It was just what I wanted and put together in less than 5 minutes. I would buy again.", 
    "Cute modern chair, a breeze to assemble. But it is very small, even in my daughter's small bedroom. Probably best for a small study or kid's room, like a tween.", 
    "im a student and a babysitter, $$ for this is amazing..love herman mille. look like him so much! couldn't be more pleased.", 
    "Perfect! Great rocking chair for smaller spaces. It was a snap to put together and super affordable. I couldnt ask for anything more! Great buy!", 
    "Great chair for my two year olds room. She loves it and I can sit and read to her and it is comfortable.", 
    "My parents had six of the original rockers lined up on a covered porch -- which is, btw, an excellent place to use them. Why? Because they are impervious to humid conditions -- and can even withstand wet bathing suits and soggy beach towels. They are also extremely comfortable (even for men who are over 6' tall.) Note: Several people have mentioned in their reviews that the chairs seem small to them, but I think what they really might mean is that the chairs, at first glance, appear to be shorter than expected. That impression may well be a function of the fact that seat heights standards have risen over the past few decades. Seat heights of 15-17\" gradually rose to 18\" as the industry standard; and now I frequently see seat heights of 19-20\". My advice? Don't worry about the seat height -- which is 15\" when the chair is not in motion. Instead, simply enjoy -- with family and friends -- the experience of these carefree, comfortable rockers which invite relaxation and conversation.", 
    "I love this chair! Great quality for the price. After reading other reviews about the size being small I was unsure about how comfortable it might be, but its not small or uncomfortable at all...even for a average size male.", 
    "This is definitely an eye-catching chair! It is very well made. Well worth the price!", 
    "I bought two of these; one for our daughter and new baby and one for us for when she comes. We love it and it looks like the one that's much more costly!", 
    "When I ordered this cradle chair I did not think it would be so beneficial. It looked so nice as a chair I decided to place it into my darling daughter's room. She is sleeping really bad and we stay up all night sometimes. i tried this chair out to see if it works and it worked. What happiness. Whenever she cries we just sit in this chair and my baby falls asleep without problems. Mothers, you all should get one.", 
    "Originally it was meant to be part of our living room design but after the purchase our kids just gone mad with it. So what can we do? We bought two more to satisfy everyone. Since then this is the favorite chair for us in the house. Price completely in range. Built quality and finish is very nice.", 
    "This cradle chair is the best for our baby. i ordered it when my wife was pregnant and even then she loved sitting in it. The chair is really comfortable and it has a high quality. Since our daughter was born this is the only chair where she can fall asleep. There are no cryings and discomfort. This chair does miracles.", 
    "Very comfy chair! Looks great and it's small profile fits nicely in almost any space. I know it's a reproduction but it looks very much like a vintage chair. Love it.", 
    "My husband and I are fans of midcentury modern design, but alas, cannot afford the steep price tag. After reading so many great reviews of this chair, we bought it and are happy we did so. Like others said, it seems quite small and short compared to most furniture today. But once we set it up in our living room, we both agreed that it is an excellent addition. The finish is not smooth and glossy like we expected, but more of a matte, slightly rough texture. For being an inexpensive reproduction, the quality is remarkable. We fight over who gets to sit in it, and I'm pretty sure we'll be buying a few more....perhaps in the non-rocking chair version. We've already gotten several compliments on it as well. Assembly took all of 5 minutes.", 
    "I totally love the look of this chair and it looks great in my living room", 
    "This little chair - and I say little - because it is quite low to the gound. The seat itself fits very comfortably most adults. If you sit forward, you can use it as a desk chair which is why we bought it. Our daughter lived in a dorm and the dorm supplied a rocker chair for sitting at the desk for long hours of study. She was so happy with this chair that I tried to buy one like it for her at home but couldn't find out where to buy it. Then I saw this chair online. If you sit back you will go into rocking position. The chair is shaped well and doesn't need a cushion. The arms at back are at a comfortable height. This is an unusual chair in that it can serve as a desk and a rocker. Just be aware that if other furniture in your room is normal or higher height, this chair may look a bit out of scale. The chair seems very sturdy is a cinch to put together. Enjoy.", 
    "This is a great knock-off for a super low price(lower than other websites, too). Delivery was super quick. Assembly was easy. It's sturdy,it's comfy, it rocks, it's not as small as the reviews made it out to be (after all the dimensions are given), but best of all it looks great with my mid-century-ish themed decor and I still have money in my pocket!", 
    "great chair for nursing, feeding snacks to little kids (catches all crumbs and wipes up easily), pulling into living room for extra seating plus it looks cool.", 
    "The chair is as advertised, the review of others were helpful in realizing the size and quality of plastic. I am happy with my purchase and enjoy using my rocker. The plastic is matte and the chair is low to the ground, as many have stated.", 
    "I'm very impressed with this chair, as it combines classic mid-century design at an affordable cost. I welcome the plastic seat and find it a logical alternative to fiberglass. The matte finish of the seat is lush. As others have mentioned, the size is somewhat diminutive, and may not be suitable for larger people. There is no way to improve this chair.", 
    "Just got the chair, and the only thing that I would say is that it is smaller than I thought it would be, just pay attention to the size chart. Other than that, it is what I expected, and it will fit perfectly in my baby's room.", 
    "softer plastic than i was expecting, and it is small... but really comfortable. I'm 5'6\" about 140lbs, much bigger than that would start to get tight... Overall pretty cool chair...", 
    "I love the look of the Vinnie White Cradle Chair. It adds some interest to the room. It is a little small in scale but I was expecting that. My kids love it because of the rocking feature. It is comfortable enough for a plastic chair but I recommend using a small cushion if you will be sitting in it for a longer period of time. It is a good accent chair for an average size or smaller adult.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised with how fast I received my order. It was super simple to assemble (legs) and I love it. It\u0092s the perfection addition to the room. I\u0092ve seen higher priced chairs like this in magazines, but this fits the bill.", 
    "Small, therefore uncomfortable on the back, but nice looking.", 
    "You almost can't tell this is a fake! Obviously for this price you're not getting a licensed original, but the details are all there. I'm impressed.", 
    "My kids are having too much fun with these! I bought two but didn't intend to use them as furniture for the kids but I guess rockers have a way of attracting kids for playtime, right?", 
    "I've always drooled over this design and now all I have to do is walk in the next room to see it. Never thought that would happen! It's sturdy and well made. I love this so much.", 
    "I loved the concept of these rockers, had big dreams in my head where i would put it in my new house but when it arrived i was a little disappointed.Its small, meaning short, low to the ground.It looks like it would break if i sat on it and for ***dollars i guess i thought it would have been more substantial.(my fault for not reading hight on discription) Im keeping it anyway and putting it in the corner in the living room like i was going to.Just take measurments if you deside to buy it. Oh .. its stark white and came perfect, no scratches or blemishes.", 
    "I was highly impressed with the chair and the quick shipping from overstock. All the screw holes lined up and I had it together within mins. The chair sits much lower than I expected and looks a bit child like but I still like it. perhaps something in the item photo to show scale would have been nice.", 
    "This rocker... Well, this rocker rocks! I've admired this style for years and Overstock has this great price that makes it AFFORDABLE! Thanks so much, I love it!", 
    "This rocker is perfect for a small room. It's stylish, compact and comfy. Love it.", 
    "This chair is exactly what we were looking for (in design) for our new baby boy's room. The seat is comfortable, but the back could be a little higher to offer more support.", 
    "This is one rockin' rocker! Rocking chairs are no longer for new mothers or old grandmothers exclusively. This is a hip, versatile, modern rocking chair that looks nothing like the rocking chairs you're used to. I'm a big fan!", 
    "Easy assemble and great replica if you can overlook the minor flaws on the bottom of the chair from the molding and minor scratches on the seat of the chair (i think from lack of padding in packaging??). Comfy.", 
    "I wanted the original version of this chair, but paying $600 was out of my budget. This chair is a really good interpretation of the original and looks great in my tiny apartment. It took me about 5 minutes to put it together by myself. I don't know why everyone keeps saying its so small. All of the classic, iconic furniture from this era are on a smaller scale than the furniture we buy today.", 
    "This chair is very short looks almost like a childs rocker. The material is also very cheep looking unfinished plastic.", 
    "It is small, but it's very comfortable. Everyone is suprised by how comfy and sturdy it is (better with a blanket or sheepskin of some kind). It's super low profile so it doesn't take up much visual space but it provides extra seating. I don't know how it compares ot the original, but I love this chair.", 
    "MY SON IN LAW WHO STANDS APPROX 6'4\" SAID IT WAS MUCH TOO SMALL FOR HIM TO SIT IN AND ROCK THE BABY...............SO IT WAS RETURNED.", 
    "my husband found those chairs by accident and we bought them for our formal living room, which is now a study. They are extremely comfortable and easy to carry around, when needed. We like them very much and they make a good contrast to the formal dining next to it. We found a small white round table with white legs, and we bought two Retro classic white accent chairs. which looks all together very stylish! Got many compliments and are very proud of our purchase!", 
    "This Eames inspired rocker is so comfortable and sturdy. It was really easy to assemble and looks great in my baby's nursery. the price was unbeatable, especiall for an exact replica of the original design. I am tall (6 ft) and was worried about the low profile but it is actually super comfortable for me and i love that it is a cahir my daughter will eventually be able to use as she grows. Excellent quality, high style, total bargain price!", 
    "I bought this for my daughters nursery. It is surprisingly comfortable to both myself and my husband. It cleans up easy and was very easy to assemble. You won't find a better deal than overstock. Shipping was fast, I received it 2 days later after purchasing it!", 
    "Yes, the chair is small, but so was the original. It fits the skinny adults in this household just fine. Assembly was dead simple and everything lined up right. The necessary allen wrench was included. Once assembled, the chair looks just like the famous one, at a fraction of the price. Another great deal from Overstock.", 
    "This chair looks as pictured and was really easy to put together. It seems pretty comfortable and sturdy, though we haven't spent that much time sitting it it yet. The only warning is - this chair is really small!! That's not to say it's uncomfortable, my 6' 2\" husband can sit in it just fine - but it looks small in the room. It looks like a child-sized chair. Luckily, we have Ikea furniture in the room - which is also small - so it kind of works. However, we wanted to put a side table by it and I'm afraid I won't be able to find a table that's not bigger than the chair!", 
    "so far so good. the chair is light weight and both me (5'4) and my husband (6'2) can fit comfortably in the chair. we got it for our nursery and it looks just perfect in it. looking forward to using it to rock our newborn to sleep. i wold definitely recommend this to a friend.", 
    "This is a tiny chair! Great for a child, but looks really strange in a room. The holes weren't in sync so it was difficult to insert the screws. I'd send it back, except that it's already assembled.", 
    "I bought this for my wife for mother's day. She had it on her wish list for a while and wanted it for our nursery. It's a great chair! I thought the construction might be flimsy, but it's a really solid piece. Putting it together was really, really easy (4 screws) and it cleans up easily.", 
    "Love this chair for my son's big boy room. Perfect addition to a mid-century aesthetic in a child's room.", 
    "Perfect reproduction of the original chair, and about $$$ cheaper. This was a gift to replace the one my mother owned 50 years ago. I thought she'd be disappointed it wasn't the real thing but she couldn't be happier.", 
    "From the modern-looking polypropylene to the sturdy ash wood base to the durable and nicely contrasting chrome steel, this rocking chair is a beautiful expression of three very different materials working together in perfect harmony. It\u0092s so nice to have a rocking chair that is modern looking as opposed to the more traditional wood rockers, and this piece works seamlessly within my modern decor.", 
    "This is an absolutely perfect reproduction of the classic Eames rocker. We bought one for our son\u0092s room and he loves it. Works perfectly design-wise with the contemporary decor and seems to be quite sturdy. For the price, you really can\u0092t go wrong with this piece. For a fraction of the price of the original, our son gets to enjoy a classic of modern, 20th-century design and we hope it will be part of his overall learning about good design. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "I have only nice things to say about this great chair, it assembled easily and without any problems. It's not small, like so many people say... I don't understand what they are talking about... Unless, you really misconstrue what type of chair this is, one could not possibly call it a chair for children... Come on, now. It is very very similar in size to the original it replicates. I put it in my nursery, and although it's not the ideal nursing /rocking chair It works great!!! My baby falls asleep right away, it feels great on my back ( I add a small pillow if i am going to stay on it for a long time...fussy nights and the such). And I breastfeed comfortably on it, I turn just a tad to the side and I must say it is actually pretty great, the reduced size as opposed to a regular nursing chair kinda makes my baby feel snug against me and it seems foolproof to get a good position, as opposed to having a million pillows to prop up baby . Anyways, I love it! Love it! Just a note, if you are new to breastfeeding, wait until you and baby have the hang of it, like a couple of weeks , to nurse on this or any for that matter, rocking chair.", 
    "Love the chair. It looks great in my living room.", 
    "love this chair. Note that it is small in scale but works perfect in my small space.", 
    "The base didn't line up correctly with the chair to put together properly. Also the place where you screw the chair in was not threaded on two different chairs we ordered. Returned and bought one elsewhere.", 
    "Love the chair. A little more matt than expected but easy assembly and great price for quality!", 
    "One of the chairs I bought was defective. I called customer service and told them, they said they would have someone contact me to get me a replacement part. Since then, nothing.", 
    "Nice little knock-off for a great price. The chair was easy to put together, seems pretty sturdy, and is exactly what I expected out of this type of chair, for a fraction of the price. Not sure why folks were complaining about the scale - it's exactly as it should be. So far, so good", 
    "Initial chair we received could not match metal base with plastic chair - one screw unable fasten. Had exchange - however impressed with Overstocks customer service very fast replacement received. New chair no problem assemble however - visible differences from 'original' chair....wood legs much narrower and seat of chair not molded flat (appears 4 divits where screwattachments in bottom fastened) Nice chair but not a true replica", 
    "very cool rocking chair. not want one expects from this type of furniture. well made and comfortable. definately 5 stars!", 
    "i orginally bought this for my mom, but she wasnt a fan. i tried it out and i loved it. the chic molded plastic seat combined with the ability to rock makes this chair awesomely unique.", 
    "ROCKER IS VERY STYLISH, BUT STILL COMFORTING LIKE A TRADITIONAL WOODEN ROCKER. MY DAIGHTER LOVES IT AND I DO TOO!", 
    "Forget grandmas! This rocker is made for the young and stylish. What a moden design. I love the bright white. Very awesome additon to my living room.", 
    "i like the idea of having rocking chairs on the porch, but i dont want to compromise style. these sleek white rockers allow me to do both.", 
    "very cool rocker. fits in with my other decor, but much more fun to sit in.", 
    "I recently had a daughter and I purchased this rocker for the nursery. My wife said that the plush one she originally bought was hard to get out of and the squeeking constantly woke our little princess up. This rocker is much better. She loves how stylish it is. It will really grow with our baby girl. And since it is plastic, a little bit og baby spit-up is easy to clean off. Papa bear did good.", 
    "love this chair. great to knit in. added a pillow for more cushion.", 
    "who would think that a rocking chair would fit in a bachelor pad? it does though. many of my friends are suprised when they sit down and it lunges back. thanks to this sleek design, rocking chairs are for more than nursing mothers and the elderly.", 
    "my mom got this for me because she said my old desk chair decreased our home's value. w/e. it only had a few rips. Anyway, i like really like this chair. It actually really nice to sit in while I do my homework, but I am never gonna tell her that", 
    "quality is good - the metal legs look a little cheaper than I expected hence the 4 stars... but I am THRILLED with this purchase!", 
    "Got this for my niece, about 3 years old. Her mom likes it because it doesn't look a kids chair.", 
    "bought this for myself after the birth of my 4th son, very comfortable, perfect for late night feedings.", 
    "love. it is a great knockoff of the expensive original. easy to assemble. people complain that it is small; the original it copies is small as well. LOVE.", 
    "If anyone looks up the dimension of the Eames rocker that this one was based on, you will see that it is no smaller than the original and I'm not sure why people are all up in arms about how small it is. I'm 5'4\" and it fits me just fine and is actually quite comfy. I love it and think it looks great!", 
    "I just put the chair together and took it for a test run. It was easy to install and its more comfortable than i expected. I read that it was a bit small but I am 5'9\" and the chair is perfect. There is even room to add a pillow for color. You can't beat this price. This ones for the nursery but I may get another for my bed room because I like it so much and I know my girlfriend will once she tries it out.", 
    "Great chair and great quality at a much better price than the designer one. I bought this chair to go in our nursery and it is perfect for nursing (especially if you use the boppy, which fits nicely between the arms of the chair). I have already received a ton of compliments from my friends!", 
    "This chair is not worth the money and is very cheap looking and feeling. It's super tiny and looks stupid in any space! Don't mean to be harsh but I'm not impressed. The seat is plastic and looks like a childs lunch table bench.", 
    "this is a designer style at a bargain price, easy to assemble and perfect for a modern touch to a nursery", 
    "Thank you Overstock for another great and low-priced item! We got two of these for each of our kids' rooms and they have been getting a lot of use. The kids love them, their friends love them and they add a fun and stylish element to their rooms. As another reviewer wrote, they work much better on carpeted floors, as opposed to wood floors on which they tend to slide. Had no problems with assembly. We also like the Eames look, and of course, the low price.", 
    "This is the perfect compact rocker for my tiny nursery. It was super easy to put together and it seems like it's made of quality material. Overall, I am super happy with my purchase!", 
    "Superb! Easy to assemble, sturdy, and great looking chair! Looks great in the baby room of our mid-century contemporary house!", 
    "I love this \"little\" rocker. It is rather small, but at 5'2\", I fit perfectly. I had no trouble assembling it. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does look small compared to my other furniture.", 
    "This is an awesome chair!! It is very stylish and very modern. Looks great in our bedroom and perfect for rocking and reading to my son. It is a litter smaller then I expected, but I still love and highly recommend this chair!!", 
    "i think the chairs are cute. they do better on a carpet or rug. if not they tend to slide around when you rock. other reviews were correct: they are shorter than most chairs and there's some difficulty in assembling (but easy fix). overall i like them", 
    "THIS MODERN/CONTEMPORARY CHAIR IS FABULOUS. IT IS SOLID AND ATTRACTIVE.", 
    "This reduculous chair is a mini chair, very low on the floor and tiny seat, this chair wold be good for someone between the age of 3-6 years old. Mine came with scratches, I returned it the very next day.", 
    "This Vinnie White Cradle Chair is both funny and elegant. I did not know where to put its outlook at first, but I knew I loved it, so I had to order one. I have placed it in my living and it looks great. I am thinking of ordering an additional one, to have a pair. The quality and material are both excellent and the price affordable. I knew that I will get great quality from Overstock and I was right.", 
    "I ordered this chair after reading all the reviews, so I was very aware of the size and possible construction problems. The chair was delivered quickly and it was easy to tell how to put it together without instructions, seeing that there were only two peices. The one I received had one problem - one of the holes was not threaded, making it impossible to tighten the screw. I was able to remedy this by screwing a different screw directly into the chair - not my first choice but I did not want to return it and wait for another one. Honestly, I think the chair would have been fine with 3 screws, but I wanted to be careful. As long as you are aware of the size of the chair - it has a vary low profile - and the possible assembly problems,. you should be satisfied with what you receive. Other than that, I highly recommend this chair, especially if you are looking for a Herman Miller look alike but can't afford a real one. It looks great in my new nursery and I'm excited to start using it!", 
    "Like the look, but all the comments I had read in the reviews apply. Short chair/small scale. One of four assembly screws won't go in due to a production flaw. I was hoping they would have gotten that worked out, but looks like the problem continues.", 
    "This rocker totally rocks! It has given a sense of flair and fun to my apartment. As soon as someone come over and sees it, they instinctively make a beeline for this chair, get in it, and start rocking away. I don\u0092t know what it is but everyone seems to love rocking chairs. This is not your grandma\u0092s old rocking chair, though. This is a modern update of the famous mid-century Charles and Ray Eames wire chair. Looks cool, fun to sit in, low price. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "Best replica rocker out there. I have two of these and I can't say anything bad except I wish they still made these in fiberglass like they used to. But I can't really complain because it is still a good deal.", 
    "I was eying this chair for a long time, and finally decided to buy it for my toddler's room. It's the perfect size for a child. It's comfortable enough for an adult, but I would never use it in my living room. Luckily, unlike other reviewers, I did not have any problem with the screws/bolts not fitting. Putting it together was a snap.", 
    "the reason I gave this two stars is, like another reviewer said, this should be labeled as a child's rocker. The quality is fine, but It is so low to the ground that it isn't in scale with other small-scale adult chairs. I have molded kitchen chairs and it's even smaller than they are. The rocker boards? are short, so it doesn't have a long, smooth rocking sensation, more like a lean back, lean forward, lean back. It tips you backwards if you aren't rocking, and pillows do help with that. The white molded seat looks nice, it is comfortable if you don't mind leaning back.", 
    "I bought two of these--one each for my daughters' bedrooms. The small scale is great for the bedrooms, which are also small. And they look great. (Not as great as the real thing, of course, but good enough for kids' bedrooms.) Totally worth the price.", 
    "This is a great knock-off of the Eames rocking chair. Its nice to be able to get good modern design for a reasonable price. The chair is comfortable for me although I'm a fairly small person. I plan to use it in my nursery for feeding. I have already spent some time rocking my nephew to sleep in it so I know its a keeper. (F.Y.I. I had no problem assembling the chair that I received.)", 
    "We purchased this chair for our nursery and think it will work well. The space in the room is very small, and this chair fits in perfectly due to it's small size. As you can tell from the photo, it is somewhat retro looking, which doesn't particularly go with our house, so we are throwing a blanket and some throw pillows on it to help it blend in some...also thinking this will help to make the hard plastic more comfortable. My husband & I are both fairly short, so the size should work just fine for us, but it is very small...probably not great for taller people. The chair was very easy to put together. I did it myself in 30 minutes over my lunch break the day we received it.", 
    "Received this chair as a Christmas gift from my husband and it arrived yesterday! I was so happy that it arrived before Christmas as promised by Overstock. It was easy to put together and very comfortable. I know some of the reviews mentioned that the chair was a little small but it works for us. We have low modern furniture so the chair fits perfectly with our decor. Also, I am petite (5'2\") and I fit comfortably. Great knock off chair!", 
    "The Vinnie Cradle Chair is wonderful. A friend of mine has the brand name version of this chair, but mine is nearly identical to her's. They both have similar construction, colors, hardware, materials and they're also similar in height and width. The only main difference is that I paid hundreds of dollars less. Although she knows I have one of my own, now, I haven't revealed to her where I purchased it and for what price. Although I'm proud of my frugality, I'm afraid she'd kick herself for paying so much more for her's. I ordered mine on Black Friday when the price lowered by $xxx---but you don't have to wait for another price drop: it's worth the purchase now. There was an issue with one of the four holes in the seat that the legs attach to. The hole is missing metal threading. However, because of the material the seat is made out of, my husband was able to thread the screw in anyhow. The screw is in tight and secure. There were no problems with the other three holes. It took my husband less than 5 minutes to assemble the chair (all that you need to do is screw in the legs, which is pre-assembled, to the seat). Lastly, despite the fact that I ordered this on Black Friday, the package arrived to my home in just a few days.", 
    "I recently purchased this item after my husband and I got married. I figured it was the PERFECT addition to our little \"nest.\" I was so surprised how FAST the shipping was! The item came in perfect condition and was incredibly easy to put together (just a few screws). I know this piece is a replica of the infamous Eames Rocker, but honestly who would know the difference! In this economy being a savvy shopper is the way to go. I definitely would recommend this item to anyone who wants to add a little Mid Century Mod to your house without breaking the bank!", 
    "This chair is cute, and sturdy, very easy to assemble, but a bit smaller than I expected. After seeing similar chairs in catalogs, and on line at much higher prices, I was excited to find this one. I'm not sure if the other stores chairs are larger, or this is the standard size for this style. I am keeping the chair as it is very cute, and my kids love it. It is the perfect size for my 5 year old and would probably be very cute in a child's room as opposed to adult seating.", 
    "I read the other reviews & took a chance. Yes, the chair is small. Sitting in it is not as comfy as I'd hoped. It's when your spine hits the back of the chair...perhaps a pillow would help, but that would only take up more space. I'm not sure if the scale of this small chair will fit the room I had intended it for. I'll be able to tell better once the other pieces are in the room. I love the style for sure, but may return it. Oh, and there was a nut missing from one of the screws. Good chair for children, or petite people. I am 5'7\".", 
    "I have purchased this cradle for my little girl, but as soon as I tried it out I have ordered one into my office. The cradle looks simple but with a great touch of elegance and comfort. This clean and simple form is perfect for the body line maybe that is why it is so comfortable. In addition it gives a great atmosphere to every room it can be found in. we love this cradle and its price too.", 
    "Looks really fabulous, but should be sold as a children's rocker. I must be an idiot. I did tons of research and really investigated the dimensions. I compared it to my office chair dimensions. I thought we'd be able to manage what other people deemed \"small.\" We had hoped to use it in our nursery. The back is way too low to function in a nursery (with tons of use). I have a bad back & both my husband & I are tall (me: 5'8\", my husband 6'4\"). I figured I'd be in the nursery most of the time in the beginning (nursing) and we have other gliders throughout the house for my husband to use. But there's just no way he could sit in this chair for more than 5 minutes. The seat dimensions seemed acceptable, but it was the low chair back and the really low base that made the worst difference. I would've sent it back, but we'll keep it in our formal living room with our 50s post-modern couch, which also sits pretty low to the ground. At least they look totally swell! Fortunately, nobody ever really sits in there.", 
    "I did read all the reviews of this chair. Let me say that before I give my review. Overall great product. Quickly shipped and was easy to put together. The only problem was one washer did not fit and I read about this in others reviews. It must be a manufacturing error. Also the chair is smaller than I thought. Not the actual base. It's comfy and large but the height of the chair is pretty low. I am 5'9 1/2 and I think anyone a little taller than me might not find the rocker to be comfortable.", 
    "I don\u0092t care much about upholstery or leather or designer names. I like simplicity and contemporary design. But this modern chair makes me feel good. I really enjoy sitting in this rocking chair every evening as I read the newspaper after a hard day at work. I\u0092m told that it\u0092s a stylish chair but I don\u0092t really care. The only thing that matters to me is that my new plastic rocking chair is comfortable.", 
    "Love this chair! It feels like it is constructed with quality materials and care. I am considering buying the similar eiffel based dining chairs.", 
    "got it for my little 4yr old daughter for her to read books in. not the best chair i would recommend for posture while reading. she enjoys it ok.price was reasonable, not great. it fits/holds my buns fine and i weigh 180lbs and 5' 6\" tall.need to watch out to get all the mounting screws lined up and tightened 2-4 threads before you screw them down for good. some folks complained that they could only screw in 3 and had given up on that last one.", 
    "We debated buying a real Eames rocker from the xxx store but decided it was worth saving a few hundred dollars to try this one first. Good decision. We think this is just as nice and just as well made as what we sat in in the xxx store. The dimensions are the same as is the comfort & style.We purchased it for our nursery & it looks perfect in there. The chair is not big like others have commented however, that is how it was originally designed to be so if you want a big rocker, then this is not for you. My husband is over 6ft tall & I am 5'10\" and we both find it to be comfortable & look forward to rocking our little one in it.", 
    "I bought this chair for our nursery and I am so glad I didn't get scared away by how small it is! It really is perfect! It's more comfortable than I expected and yes it is a small chair but it fits an adult comfortably and once our child grows they can keep it in their room to read/sit in. Overall, I am very glad I bought this chair! I love the style... its clean and simple but makes a statement.", 
    "We had purchased this chair for our son's room (for his birthday) and I hadn't read the reviews on the blue vinnie cradle chair. I wish I had. I've had Overstock send me 2 of these, both with the same exact problem - the same problem people who have rated the blue chairs have commented on.The holes in the seat do not line up with the holes in the base. Thus, you can't get the screw through both. In other words, you can't bolt the base to the seat. Well. I can get three of the 4 through. But would you really want to sit in that? The bases seem to be made with poor quality control. The brackets where the bolts go through are all different angles and welds are not entirely covered in chrome. The seat themselves look fine. So I think it's the base manufacturer that has the problem.Anyway, after 2 attempts, I gave up. Great looking chair. Unfortunately, now I have to find someone else who has a similar looking (and likely more expensive) version.", 
    "the chair was easy to assemble and the qualtiy was fine. It seemed small at first but it actually works fine for average body size. It's a great style, from the original SHELL chair design. Well valued.", 
    "I guess I should have paid heed to other reviews on this chair - it really is very small. I bought it for our living room and it was DWARFED by our other furniture and vaulted ceiling, so I sent it back. I was comparing the measurements to another chair that we have, and even though they are similar in width/depth, the Vinnie doesn't have a lot of substance to it, so it appears smaller. It's really very cute and a great value. I imagine it would be perfect in a smaller space, such as a nursery or bedroom.", 
    "After looking at this chair for a while I decided to finally go ahead and purchase it. It is as small as everyone says, but it's an affordable knock off for the money.", 
    "I wanted to get this chair for sometime but couldn't decide. I saw the exact same chair in a brand name furniture store and costed over $300. That was the done deal. I bought this for my 6 yrs old son, and he loves it. It is very sturdy and very sharp looking! It goes really well with my son's room decor! I love it too. Thank you, overstock.com for saving me some money, so I can go shop for more furnitures!!!!!", 
    "I liked the chair. However as one reviewer put it the chair is small. I originally didn't pay attention to the review thinking the person might have been on the heavier side. However I am small and the chair is kind of childsize (not exactly but close). My plan was to get another chair to sit beside it to make a seating area but this chair is too small, other chairs dwarf it. I think the chair was overpriced for what it was and what it was made of but as I said before I liked.", 
    "I bought this rocker for our bedroom. I wanted a small rocker that I could rock the baby in and this one is perfect. It is quite petite and the back on it is not very high. He loves climbing into the rocker by himself. I think it is a great value compared to the $500 one that is similar.", 
    "This chair is really cute. My only complaint is that it isn't fiberglass like the eames it is knocking off, and should therefore be a bit cheaper. Overall, I am happy with it though. Looks great in our modern house.", 
    "The chair is a nice replica, decent quality for the price, easy to assemble and came quickly with no damage in shipping. It is a small chair but for a child's room it's perfect!", 
    "A great chair for the price. Same dimensions as the Modernica fiberglass rocker I bought several years ago (it, too, looks tiny next to most of my other furniture... we have it in a bedroom next to a very low bed where it looks right at home). The plastic doesn't feel super sturdy, compared to some other Eames knock-off dining room chairs we bought, and we had to work a bit to wrench the bolts into place on the underside of the chair (in fact, the first chair we received was missing a bolt hole, but Overstock replaced it quickly and with no hassle), but all in all we're happy with the purchase and the price cannot be beat.", 
    "No complaints! Great looking knockoff & you can't beat hte price. Chair construction is quite sturdy.", 
    "I was a little worried that the metal base may feel flimsy or unstable but even in my gigantic pregnant state I feel secure sitting in it so that's a plus:) The chair was lower than I had pictured in my head though it has about the same measurements as other eames replica chairs. I don't mind the size since it was purchased for my daughter's nursery -it will also work nicely for her later. For the price I think it's a great deal.", 
    "I bought this rocker for it's looks more than anything else and I'm glad that's the reason I bought it. If you're looking for an everyday use rocker than this is probably not the choice for you. My wife and I try to decorate our home in mid-century furniture and this fits in the \"looks\" category. Very easy to assemble. Smaller than I thought it was going to be.", 
    "As other reviewers have noted this is a very small chair--it almost looks like it belongs in a kid's room. Other than that, I like the look of it and you can't beat the price for this style; however, it is dwarfed by the other furniture in my living room.", 
    "This is such a cute and modern chair, we love it. It is small scale and almost looks like it's child sized but it's comfy to sit in. Love this piece. Was worried since some reviewers had problems but it was just fine.", 
    "Arrived damanged. Regardless, chair is very very low. Seems more suitable for a child's room.", 
    "We needed a smaller chair for my daughters nursery. This chair fit the bill. After reading the reviews I was concerned about assembly. The chair came in a timely fashion with all of the parts. It was easy to assemble but one screw and washer did not fit. I called and requested another one which was also received in a timely fashion. It turns out that the hole in the chair was not made to fit this screw and washer. With a little elbow grease from my husband and a bloody finger it finally fit. All and all this smaller chair fits and matches our daughter's contemporary nursery and feels pretty comfortable to sit in and rock by daughter to sleep for naps and bedtime!", 
    "I thought I was getting a great deal on a classic looking piece and the reviews seemed to back it up. The product came will all its parts and yet once constructed we found that the pre-assembled parts, namely the way the rocker rails connected to the base, were inextricably bent and broken. We tried to correct it but the metal which is so flimsy and cheap, broke. Now we're stuck with a dud chair that we can't return. I really should have bought the Design Within Reach version. A bit more expensive, but at least they'd accept my return and make sure we had a product we could use.", 
    "I hesitated before purchasing this chair since several reviews indicated that the screws were missing from the box or whatever. Thankfully, that wasn't the case at all. It arrived in less than a week, in great condition, with all the necessary parts - and it all fit together in less than ten minutes. I use this chair in my bedroom since it works with the modern bed and night stand in there. But I could as easily place it in my living room. My friends all think it's the coolest little rocker ever.", 
    "I bought two of these chairs. The first was perfect and took only about 5 minutes to assemble. I loved it instantly and gave it away as a present. I bought the chair again for myself. This one came with no screws and had to sit in it's box for 2 weeks while I waited for new screws from overstock. When I finally went to put it together, I realized that one of the screw holes was missing -- which means that the chair can not be put together. This one's going back. Great looking chair, close enough to the eames not to matter, but seriously bad construction.", 
    "Honestly---its great! We were a bit weary reading some of the other reviews- but we needed a rocker for our daughter's nursery and comparable eames replica rockers were around $400. We decided to give this piece a try and we are so pleased we did! It is super sturdy and the finishes match well with our decor. I say give it a shot! Its a good deal.", 
    "If you like the look of the classic design but would never spend that much on a chair this is the best deal you will find. I had no trouble assembling the chair and I am very happy with my purchase. Shipping was super fast!", 
    "Got the chair for a guest chair at work. When put together almost looks like a kids chair. The back is low with little support. Also when heavier people sit in it I get nervous because it looks like it might break.. Gets lot's of compliments, but might prefer to pay a little extra and get the real Eames.", 
    "The chair is easy to assemble. To compensate for the screw holes being slightly mal-aligned, be sure to loosely fit each of the four screws before tightening any of them. Then, tighten each a few turns, rotating until each screw is fully tightened. DO NOT TIGHTEN THE SCREWS ONE BY ONE.Overall, this is great value for the money. The chair arrived within 2 days!", 
    "The reviews about the screw holes not aligning properly are TRUE. But don't let that keep you from buying this chair. It's workable and in the end works out.My chair had a small black mark on the seat and I haven't been able to get it out. It's not a scratch but something that is IN the chair. That's pretty disappointing.Overall, GREAT price, looks EXACTLY like the real thing.Craftsmanship leaves a bit to be desired. But I am going to keep it and it looks great in my house.", 
    "So there is a reason this is at least $300 cheaper than any Eames reproduction I've seen out there.Like another reviewer the screw holes on my base did not line up with the screw holes on the shell. Only three of them would work. Doesn't bother me and the chair still seems very sturdy even with only three screws holding the shell on.There was also a slight smudge on the white shell from not being wrapped too well during shipping. Should come off without a problem.Looks GREAT! Fast and cheap shipping. Overall I feel like I got a great deal on a classic looking piece. I am definitely willing to live with the little imperfections to save $300.", 
    "I like the original but wasn't willing to pay for it- this is a good reproduction but the craftmanship is a problem. The base and seat are held together with four bolts. Because the holes were misaligned and the materials don't allow for any wiggle room, I could only get three of the bolts in place. This seemed like enough to make it stable and I don't plan on doing any high-intensity rocking in this thing, so I didn't bother returning it. Also, the website said they were out of stock when I received it, and it really is a good price for an interesting piece of furniture, so I wasn't willing to risk not being able to have it replaced.", 
    "I love the look/style, size and price of this chair.I was disappointed in the quality of the workmanship. The holes in which you screw the metal base were not aligned, therefore I cannot completely attach the base to the seat.", 
    "this is the best chair, you are going to love it for the price and look", 
    "the 4 screw holes were NOT alligned, so only 3 screws properly fit. the chair otherwise is lovely, although dwarfed.", 
    "Yesterday, they arrived EARLY in FLAWLESS condition. Assembly was a breeze (this coming from someone who despises assembling anything--and sometimes won't buy things for that very reason!)The foot rest and adjustment levels add to the comfort of the chairs.If you have wood floors, you may want to put stick-on felt under the base...as the chairs will slide in and out a little. I used felt strips and placed them top, bottom, left and right. The chairs remained perfectly balanced and the floors are protected.Let me tell you, I'm very picky (maybe you noticed), so to say these stools are great is a milestone from someone who notices every flaw. Don't hesitate to purchase these beauties! You'll be glad you did.", 
    "we bought this rocker because we have the real thing (an Eames Armshell rocker) and it's become my 6-yr-old's favorite chair. i wanted him to have one in his room, but didn't want to pay the pricetag of the original again. this gives us the style of the real thing (except it's not fiberglass, of course), but at a kid-friendly price. and he loves it! so far, it's strong and stylish ... a great buy for the price.", 
    "I'm happy with this purchase, but I probably wouldn't have been if I hadn't read all the other reviews first. I am keeping it as I am certain I will never find a knock-off Eames so cheap. I've been looking around and $400 was the lowest so this is a steal considering. I'm totally smitten with how it looks. Not perfect, but still a great addition to a modern home. Prompt delivery and extremely easy assembly.", 
    "this is a nice little knock-off. comfy and clean, great chair for the price!", 
    "This is an eames knock-off and a good one. Came on time, as usual. Took less than ten minutes to assemble with an allen wrench (provided).If you're familiar with eames chair designs, you'll know they appear low/small in stature; almost childlike in proportion. So that's one thing to keep in mind when purchasing. The chair is extremely comfortable and roomy. excellent value.", 
    "This version of the classic mid-century fiberglass rocker is smaller in scale than the original or authorized copies manufactured today. It is also made of hard molded plastic. Therefore it is not very comfortable. However, for the price and construction I am glad I purchased the chair.", 
    "This chair is about 3/4 size and not big enough for even an average slender adult. Darling as a child's chair. It would be helpful if something else were in the photo to give the chair context.",
