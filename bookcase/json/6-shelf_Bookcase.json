    "This shelf looks cheap, but it is, so I was not expecting much. I bought it in Oak, and the color looks very old fashioned and something my grandparents would have in their house. It took over 5 hours to put it together for 2 people, and some of the main pieces were either cracked or did not come together right - I did not return it simply to avoid the hassle. If you want a cheap shelf for a couple of years, this will do - if you want a quality piece, keep looking.", 
    "I'm not entirely happy with this purchase.The whole unit is made with pressed wood and the veneer is printed paper stuck onto the pressed wood panels and shelves. It has no feet, so the open edges of the pressed wood sits directly on the floor, these edges will deteriorate over time.Finally when originally shipped only half of the needed hardware was in the shipment. I had to call to request the 2nd bag of hardware and wait a week for its arrival.", 
    "This bookcase looks great once completed. The workmanship however is not good. I had to be very gentle with the pieces during assembly as the press board is very cheap. Im even afraid to move it. If you've ever had Bush furniture that is the one to go with.", 
    "It takes hours to assemble the book case. Once assembled, the product is not stable at all. Apperance may be good, but I could have spent the money wisely.", 
    "This book shelf is actually 2 separate bookshelves that eventually make 1 large wall unit. It is 6 feet tall, so it definitely required 2 people to assemble and additional mechanisms to ensure it's placement since it stands so tall. It is quite nice looking and a great addition to my living space.", 
    "received parts and instructions for a 29\" bookcase (Wood parts for a 77\" bookcase) after email to Prepak....received some more hardware, but no instructions...after phone call...instructions sent...but not to fit the wood parts I have, still with insufficient hardware....will call again today....(over 2 weeks since ordering the bookcase) and hopefully receive the necesary parts and correct instructions for putting this headache together", 
    "this product is wonderful.. i live in a rented small space so i knew it was not going to be an investment piece. if your looking for low price no frills good looking bookshelf this is ideal..i read previous reviews before buying this product and was warned it is not the sturdiest of pieces and i took extra care when assembling it.", 
    "I purchased not 1 but 3 of these! The best advice I can give mirrors the reviews of others who went before me: READ the directions first (can be confusing). You will switch back and forth between the instructions for the smaller book case and the larger one. Be aware the \"top\" of the small one is really the \"top\" of the larger one. The remaining 2 went up very quickly. They don't appear sturdy at first, but once it is all together, it's quite durable. There is a ton of space, which is what I was after, and the color is true to what I saw online. I'm very pleased with this purchase. You will need another person to put it together, though, as it's pretty heavy.", 
    "This is a fair (but not exceptional) value for the price. Assembly was easy and took about 1/2 hour. The bookshelf arrived with one small damaged area, but I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it, and it doesn't show too badly where I placed it. The shelf looks fine from a distance -- up close it is easy to tell it is composite wood and the workmanship is only fair.If you need a truly high quality, genuine wood bookcase, this is not for you. If you are on a budget, are looking for something that holds books and doesn't look bad from across the room, this may be just the thing. I'm a school principal and it looks OK in my office, but is clearly of lower quality than the other furniture in the room.", 
    "This is the second one I've bought, and they are great! I like the height of the shelves, (store large books), and easy to assemble.", 
    "I was looking for a tall bookcase to fit into a specific space in my office for a reasonable price and this one fit the bill perfectly. It is very well-made and looks much more expensive than it was. It was very easy to assemble as well. I believe this item was a great value for the price!", 
    "My husband said this bookcase was not sturdy (he's actually built bookcases before) but it is sturdier than it looks. I filled 5 of the 6 shelves and it doesn't look like the shelves will ever bow or anything. It looks great and it's a good price. I would recommend it!", 
    "They look good, now that they are assembled. However, it was so difficult to assemble that I had to hire someone to do it. It took him 6 housrs to put 3- 6' bookshelves and 1-smaller one together. The value would have been greater, if I did not have to hire someone to put them together. I would have rather purchased a ready made product. But it you are good at assembly, I would recommend it.", 
    "The bookshelves are beautiful. They were a \"snap\" to assemble, the wood is awesome, they are nice and sturdy, and they are more than worth the price.", 
    "The Book shelf was worth more then I paid for it by a long shot. Overstock has always gone out of the way to show the community That quality is some times more inporant then quantity. The shelf has improved the looks of my house. Thank You.", 
    "Maybe I'm a little more handy than most of the other reviewers, but I felt that the bookcase was easy to put together. It is a little top-heavy, but the bookcase is after all over 6 ft tall. Some of the trim didn't line up exactly and some of the finish was scuffed during shipment. Not so bad that I had to return it though. It still looks good. It adequately serves my purpose at a price much lower than buying one from a name brand retail store.", 
    "Book case was easy to put together, although I had a little trouble getting the top piece square with the bottom piece. Once together, it looks great and stands very sturdlely on only a 12\" by 30\" base. One has to remember with a tall bookcase, once needs to put the weight on the bottom and not the top as then the bookcase will be too top heavy. Thanks Overstock.com for another great purchase.", 
    "looks great and easy to assemble but the shelves began to bend after about a week with books on it", 
    "Took me weeks to put it together because I had the wrong instructions and missing parts. Had to order additional parts and finally got it put in my office. It is not a bad looking shelf, but not sure how sturdy it is going to be be and how long it is going to last.", 
    "The shipment took a while to come, neither UPS nor Overstock was able to commit a date owing to shipping from Canada and the uncertainty of Customs clearance etc. The package arrived in good shape. Assembly instructions were also good. It took me 3 hours to assemble the first bookcase and 2 hours for the second. What I noticed is that the color in the website is more richer than the actual. The assembled piece did not look that Oak rich color that I was hoping for. Also even though the website says wood, I am not sure if all the pieces are wood. Could be, just that I am not sure.", 
    "I agree with some of the previous comments and consequently made alterations to the bookcase to make it more rigid. My improvement was adding an additional backing utilizing a sheet of 1/4\" masonite. It stiffened the unit significantly and allowed me securely anchor the adjustable shelves so that they would hold more weight.", 
    "easy install, sturdy and work fine for my pantry.", 
    "I've put together many-a-bookshelf in the past. This one is more substantial, so it will take a careful read of the instructions. If you can do that, you will be well-pleased with this bookcase.", 
    "Fit the needs for now, not what I wanted. Being that it will be use at a resident where I'm not there all year I think it will do.", 
    "Easy to put together, holds a lot. I did secure the tops to the wall in case a grandchild tried to climb them but that was an easy up grade. My books will be well kept when they are old enough to read them.", 
    "I love the color, size and sturdiness. The directions we're just good enough, but made assembly more difficult than it should have been. I don't like the way the trim pieces are \"mounted\" , so I added glue to them because they wouldn't mount flat", 
    "All fit together very well, no parts missing or damaged. Instructions were fine -- more than you would get with Ikea (this is a similar type of assembly). Good quality, looks very nice.", 
    "These are junk, pure press board, Very flimsy", 
    "Don't buy this. Yes, after you get it assembled, it looks nice, but it wobbles back and forth. When I moved I let the moving men have it, it was just that useless.", 
    "looks great made from good wood", 
    "Difficult to assemble. Works fine.", 
    "I wanted something inexpensive I could put together myself and I did, but setting the top half on top of the lower half is difficult since the material is very heavy. It has fallen apart over time and I will soon discard it but it was cheap so did not really have great expectations.", 
    "Made of very strong good looking materials. Great looking piece of furniture.", 
    "Items arrived on time. One shelf was damaged, but too much trouble to return. Assembly not too hard. The shelves are not very sturdy but adequate. My major complaint is that I'm receiving adds to buy shelves almost all the time. This is very annoying!", 
    "Handsome style, but very thin veneer that cracks at a light touch. Be careful while assembling.", 
    "Quite complex to assemble; but is color and size I wants. Suites my needs.", 
    "I've had this unit for four years now. The six shelves are GREAT. However, I had several of them loaded with very bulky, heavy text books that after about 3 years I started to notice a slight bowing in the middle of the shelves.", 
    "While it took my husband about four hours to put this together, the result was a very handsome bookcase, which we desperately need because our new house does not have built in bookcases. Very handsome, and well made!", 
    "A surprisingly high quality shelving unit for the price. Looks more expensive. We ordered 4 units and created the effect of a built-in wall of shelves. The units are incredibly easy to assemble and when placed side by side on a flat surface look like a singe unit. The unit is structurally sound, the shelves will not bend and because they are movable, you can really dress up a room. Absolutely delighted with the product.", 
    "great product, sturdy, and looks very nice , ,Helpful tips for future packaging !! the nails for the back of shelf should of been shorter, had to use are own nails .helpful if the larger pieces were labeled instead of comparing them to the pictures", 
    "I needed a very tall bookcase for a specific area; this one is perfect. It looks more expensive than it is. The assembly was slightly tricky but very do-able. I love the look. It's a great value.", 
    "Better quality than I was expecting. The bookcases are beautiful.", 
    "It wasn't easy to interpret the instructions. Some of the shelves are bowing under the weight of the books but serves it's purpose.", 
    "The bookcase was easy to assemble. Was a nice addition to my den. Only thing better would of been a solid oak bookcase but then lot more expensive.", 
    "Simple is - good looking, hardworking. Just a good serviceable bookcase for serious book storage.", 
    "It was really hard to put together. You have to read ALL of the directions before you start. My husband read one set of directions and it ended up being the half shelf directions. If you want to have all six shelves you need to read ALL of the directions. It took him 3 hours to put together. It was crazy. The final product was nice though. I have enough room for everything that I wanted to put on it.", 
    "Not very sturdy if you have a lot of books - easy to assemble, but they list a bit to one side.", 
    "This is a very sturdy and good quality bookcase - actually two - one sits on top of and is attached to the other. It has only a cardboard backing, but for this price, the structure was good. The directions we not as clear as we would have desired, and we had a couple of things that has to be re-done to get them right.but everything worked out well eventually.", 
    "This is a quality oak and composite bookshelf. It is quite sturdy when put together. It was relatively easy to assemble, taking me approximately 2 hours, as I am a novice furniture assembler. The backing board consists of three boards held together by fabric packing tape. This seems a bit flimsy and may not withstand long term pushing of books, etc. against it. Other than that, I am very happy with this bookcase.", 
    "I love that it was just like the picture. It was easily put together. It fit exactly as I wanted it to fit. It fulfilled a need I had to clean up an area in my house.", 
    "I am not pleased with it at all. Reference my response to the quality section of this review.", 
    "I bought two and they were ruined when my toilet failed and flooded everything at floor level. But I bought another two, different shade.", 
    "It came in two boxes and they didn't go together. We did not put it together for a couple of months and there were two separate bookcases not one. I broke the bottom trim with a small amount of pressure. Nailing the back on was easy for me to screw up and not put on straight.", 
    "We needed a new bookcase desperately, and the Sonoma Six Shelf bookcase met our needs perfectly. It is an attractive piece and looks great in the space we needed to fill. We are collectors of all things natural and this bookcase displays our treasures very well, and there's plenty of room for all our many books on the subject.", 
    "The bookshelf looked good and was easy to assemble, and would have been fine storing anything lighter weight than a full shelf of hardbacked books. I was disappointed that the shelves bowed within a month with the weight of the books. I had to take most of the books off the center of the shelves but even so they're bowed like the cheap $40 plywood bookshelves I picked up from Walmart.", 
    "Not ordering this as it looks VERY CHEAP...bad molding at top and screams fake wood", 
    "For the price it's a decent looking bookcase but I don't know whether it's worth the time putting it together.", 
    "This is a very nice bookcase. The details and picture depict the bookcase well and the color is represented well in the picture.", 
    "This product was difficult to put together and the finish cracked easily during assembly.", 
    "After waiting two weeks for the delivery we had a bit of a time putting it together, but finally got it. The shelf comes in 2 boxes and you must open both and look at instructions for the two piece before assembly. I was disappointed in the quality. Considering the price, I could have done better at a local superstore. But on the plus side, it is large, holds a lot of books, which is what we needed.", 
    "My husband and I love this book shelf.It looks beautiful and is easy to assemble. It fits our room perfectly.", 
    "The bookcase I received was functional and was assembled easily, but it is made of pressed wood. The Maple described in the advertising is attached with something that resembles glue-on wallpaper. The price should have warned me of what to expect. Unfortunately the shelves are already sagging. The shelves should have been made of plywood with hardwood facing to enable them to stand up to holding books. I will keep the bookcase because it does the job for now.", 
    "We ordered the Sonoma Six-shelf Bookcase in Maple. The item comes in two boxes. Both boxes come with directions. We made the mistake of following the directions in the smaller box. Apparently the bottom unit is also sold separately as a smaller stand alone unit. We then had to take off the top of the bottom unit to put it on the top of the top unit. Anyway, that was the only glitch for us. All parts were in good condition, everything fit together perfectly and it was not difficult to assemble, probably took me and my husband about 40 minutes. This was for my son's room so we had to secure the top with a bracket so it does not tip over (bracket not included). We have other maple furniture in the room some pieces are real hardwood maple some are laminated maple?, not sure what you call it?, but fake maple. This piece was a little darker than I had wanted since the fake maple is lighter, however the real maple was a little darker and matched that better. Overall, still looks good has lots of shelves for all those bionicles my son has and seems very sturdy. Overstock had the best price on this unit and shipping was free so I feel it was worth the money.", 
    "First of all, please note that the back of the bookshelf is particleboard. Second, be prepared for pieces to be broken upon arrival (currently waiting for replacement parts... but everything I've ever ordered from Sonoma has had at least one broken piece). Ships in two boxes: the first is for the small, two shelf bookcase, and the second box is the rest of the pieces (varies depending on which bookcase you order). It's not the easiest thing to put together, but doable.Other than that, it looks very nice... and is sturdy (except for the particleboard in the back).", 
    "I bought this for my 9-year-old daughter who was ready for a bookcase for \"chapter books.\" This is very attractive (the maple matches the maple furniture in her room), easy to assemble, a great price, and came quickly. It does come in two boxes, and initially we thought that we were sent 2 bookcases (it does look like and assemble like a small bookcase with a large one on top). We will buy an anti-tip bracket separately because it is very tall.", 
    "For the money, it's a pretty good deal. But the back is very cheesy and cardboard like, so it's good if the books cover it. IT's a very plain design, which is fine, and wasn't too hard or too easy to assemble.", 
    "i like the maple color and the shelves went together easily. The worse thing about them is the paper backing that gets tacked onto the back. It is a 3-way folded piece that shows the seams. Unsightly, but hopefully hiden with books and things on the shelves. Also something they never tell you: 4 of the 6 shelves have strict weight limits (i think 30#s) since they rest on 4 plastic pins. Two of the shelves allow 50 pound limits since they are \"structural\" shelves. No bracket is supplie for securing the top to prevent tipping. I had to make my own", 
    "Tall, versatile bookshelf with a classy look. Movable shelves make it easy to fit various height items and books.", 
    "Very beautiful, they look great in my LibraryPaypall worked great alsoVery nice company to work withThank you", 
    "Nice looking, roomy will hold many books. I would recommend mounting it.", 
    "The package was missing some parts so that one shelf is not usable. The wood had small dents and some of the vineer was scraped off. It is not real sturdy. It's not worth returning though.", 
    "This bookcase looks fine when together, and should be okay, but as most chipboard furniture, it isn't too sturdy. Also of concern to me is the use of small plastic shelf holders which I worry may not be adequate to support the full load of heavy books that I have. Since I bought this bookcase, I have seen a similar ( but only 5 shelf) unit at an office supply store for MUCH less money.", 
    "I got the maple and it's really nice.The piece comes in two boxes and beware: the pieces in Box 1 are not necessarily for the lower unit pictured on Box 1. Once the other box arrived, I had to take it apart and start over and it wasn't easy. The little plastic dowels are remarkably strong and unorgiving.It's particleboard and not particularly strong, but once it's together and full of books, it looks great. A terrific value.", 
    "for any student looking to make room in a small apartment. looka pretty good, each piece on its own is pretty crumbly but once put together holds pretty well. saved tons of space studio apartment", 
    "Once put together this is beautiful.Its not easy due to size and no marking on the pieces.I have this in my bedroom catty-cornered and it looks like a million bucks!! If I didn't already have 3 other bookcases in my room I would get the matching pieces!", 
    "This is the first product on overstock that I've written a negative review. May be easier to assemble with two people. I tried to assemble it by myself and took 1 hour just to finish the smaller top section. Does not feel very sturdy. One piece was broken in the box. Thought that I could fix it myself with wood glue---looks ok, still not very pleased. I should have spent more and bought better quality piece.", 
    "Very solid, nice looking bookcase. Totally worth it.", 
    "Although the Sonoma Six-Shelf Bookcase is somewhat bigger than I thought from the picture, otherwise it is just as picture. I am very happy with its, workmanship and looks. Haveing shop at a couple of local furiture stores, I find the price very reasonable.", 
    "Very happy with the bookcases. Had help with construction and because I live in earthquake country, anchored them ot the wall, but they are beautiful.", 
    "The bookcases were great. The color of the wood matched perfectly. Had no problem putting them toghether with two people.", 
    "It's a good bookcases if you need something big. the instruction are hard to read though. it took more commonsense then the intructions to put it together.",

    "This was simply the worst product I have ever bought. There were missing and broken parts causing the Bookcase to be in pieces in my house until the replacement parts could be shipped."
