    "The bench is nice, it looks like the picture. The only issue I had is that it arrived with one small stain on the top part, where someone would sit. I'm going to try to treat the stain, I'm hoping it comes out. Its very small, but noticeable because the stain is black and the fabric is tan. The inside is lined in black fabric and has a lot of room for storage. Very minor assembly required, only had to screw in the legs. No tools needed, they screwed right into place. I would have given 5 stars if it didn't have a stain.", 
    "If you are looking for a bench to make a huge statement in an ordinary, bland room, this isn't the bench for you. But if you, like me, need a bench to fit into an already busy room full of prints and patterns, this bench is perfect. It is understated and casual, while still appearing rich and stylish. I've been sitting on it for hours at my writing desk and it is comfortable and functional for my purpose. I have it as a seat while I work, and either my dog or my notebook fits nicely beside me while a work. The inside storage is more than adequate. The wooden legs go nicely with the writing desk that I also purchased from Overstock a few weeks prior to finding this bench. I am very pleased with the purchase. Also, it arrived one day early, so that was a very nice surprise!", 
    "I am completely satisfied with this bench. It is exactly like described.", 
    "This storage bench it's beautifully made. It is a beautiful as it shows in the picture. The fabric and brass nail heads give it an elegant expensive look. It's very well made. The storage area is large enough to keep linens, pillows, or comforters. The top remains open by itself without having to hold it open. It's also easy to assemble. Just screw on the beautifully designed wooden legs and you're done. Heavy and sturdy enough for seating when you need to. The price is phenomenal. I did my comparison research...no one else could match the low price with this high quality. Super fast free shipping. I will buy another one for the front entrance, excellent for storing, gloves, hats and scarves. A place to seat while you put on or take off your shoes/boots while adding a touch of class to your home. Highly recommended.", 
    "Very sturdy, well made bench. The hinged lid is very firm, not cheaply made - no \"wobble\" when you open and close it. The bench was level, no rocking at all. Very happ!",

    "This upholstered bench was exactly what I was looking for and I have received several compliments from guests staying with us. The price was good and the decorative nail heads are the perfect touch to this piece.", 
    "The quality isn't as great as the picture depicts. Decent color poor quality leg base. Would not allow anyone larger than a child to sit on because legs are not stable. It serves it's purpose so I gave it 2 stars",

    "I was pleasantly surprised when I received this beautiful bench! I thought it might be of lesser quality because of the price, but that's certainly not the case. I bought this to put under my bedroom window to store blankets and linens...it works perfectly! Love it!", 
    "Love it! great quality, shipped right to my front door!", 
    "I am VERY pleased with my purchase. I bought this bench to sit at the end of our guest room bed to hold extra linens. My purchase arrived quickly and the items inside were in perfect condition. The color is of an oatmeal beige, which was exactly the neutral color pallet I was looking for. The legs screwed on very quickly and with ease. I was able to assemble in 5 minutes. I will say the inside of the chest did have a strong chemical odor to it upon arrival. I did leave the lid open for a few days and put laundry scent booster into a small baggie to help air out the smell. Overall very please and would purchase again without hesitation!", 
    "I was impressed beyond what I was expecting! Love Overstock!", 
    "I love this bench - it looks more expensive than it was. Great linen like texture, evenly spaced nail head trim, sturdy, and decent storage space. I should have paid better attention to the dimensions as it's a little short for the foot of a king bed, but it still definitely works. Great buy!", 
    "We are very pleased with this storage bench. It received 4 stars because some of the button tacks are unevenly placed. Also, one of the predrilled holes for the bench feet was placed incorrectly which made screwing the foot in a little more time consuming.", 
    "I have been wanting a bench with storage and when I seen this one with the nail Decor around the edge it was absolutely perfect. Also got a discount which made it even better and free shipping love overstock.", 
    "Nice quality and a breeze to put together. All we had to do was screw on the 4 legs. Love it and it looks great at the bottom of our sleigh bed.",

    "I was not disappointed when I received this bench! It is beautiful and just what I've been looking for to put in my bedroom at the foot of the bed. I store extra blankets and winter items.

    "Easy to assemble. Looks better than expected and it's a very good price for the style. Amazing buy!", 
    "The storage bench is made of good quality material and it's sturdy. It can be used in a children's room to store toys and used for a sitting area. It is very simple to assemble which is only the screwing on of the legs that are thick and have a sleek style. Love it",

    "Pleasantly surprised to receive this piece, easy to just screw legs on. Lid stays open when lifted, which is really nice. Sturdy to sit on! Not wobbly. Feels heavy and substantial.

    "Ordered this bench for my master bedroom .. It was the exact color and design I expected and it fit perfectly in my room .. Assembling took less than 20 min .. Would definitely recommend", 
    "Excellent purchase. First had it in the living room and then moved it to the bedroom....ordered a brown leather one for the living room...well made and very prompt delivery", 
    "I ordered this storage bench to go in my bedroom on a wall opposite my bed and I absolutely love it. It's made of an off white linen material with metallic nailhead detail and it fits in perfectly with the color scheme of my room, which is varying shades of brown and cream as well as different wood accents. The linen looks to be of good quality and the storage bench is adequately cushioned so that it functions as a comfortable seating option in addition to storage. There is also an ample amount of space within the bench to place things.",

    "Love this piece! Looks great in my living room. I just screwed on the legs and it was ready. Nice storage for my throws and extra seating. Very happy with the fabric and color.",

    "We were very happy with is product.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with this. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because that to me would be perfect. That being said the only flaws I found were simple ones; the decorative tacks aren't all exactly lined up; one leg is slightly crooked. But those probably aren't as noticeable as I think. (I'm probably OCD). All in all, I'm satisfied with the whole package, including price.",

I have it in the dining room for toys. The lid stays up so is safer for the toddlers. A good buy!",

    "Nice fabric, looks expensive and the right size. I noticed one of the hinges had been replaced, and the lid was not squared on the box, but that was more than a month after I purchased it.

    "I received my bench and was very pleased. It's sturdy and has a good bit of room for storing my throws. Just what I needed.", 
    "Absolutely love this bench. It's not too deep, but deep enough for the items I needed to put in it. The only complaint I have is that the top does not fit evenly. When I close the lid, the left side lifts up a little bit. However, it doesn't bother me enough to send it back.", 
    "This was my first purchase from Overstock so I really didn't know what to expect. All I had to do was screw on the feet. Material and build quality are quite nice -- nicer than I expected.

    "This is great quality, easy to put together (just add the legs) and opens and closes smoothly. Very happy with this storage bench!", 
    "I rate the bench 3 to 4 stars, but the care in shipping the product gets 1 star as the box was disheveled, damp & moldy upon receipt. Item was wrapped in plastic so wasn't damaged. Otherwise, the quality's what I expected for the price. The nail head detail gives it interest. Sturdy hinges but not sure they lock in open position. Once rid of its manufacturing odor, it will serve its purpose.", 
    "This is used for all my son's toys in the living area. Perfect because it stays open and won't slam down on his hands. Great size. Love it", 
    "This bench is beautiful and durable. I have it in my bedroom - which is a country style, highly textured, cream and light oak colored room. The color is a perfect neutral - not too light, not too dark, not too cool, not too warm. The style is not too feminine/not too masculine. Just right. The fabric is a hard, tight weave, so I will Scotchguard it and not worry that my dog will snag his claws on it when jumping up onto the bed. The bench is lightweight enough for me to have gotten it up a small flight of stairs and position at the foot of my bed. All I had to do was screw in the feet. When opened, the lid stays open by itself. It also came with 2 extra studs, which was a considerate touch. I will enjoy this for years.", 
    "Sturdy, love the look and storage is great", 
    "Nice bench and super easy to assemble", 
    "price right but the hinges no good I tried to fix one side the other side it did not sit well", 
    "The quality and look of the bench was even nicer than it looks in the picture. Adds a nice touch to my bedroom.", 
    "Perfect addition to my bedroom and nice storage. Great material and quality", 
    "Low rating because of the odor upon opening the bench,", 
    "I recently bought this a couple weeks ago and I love it! It was shipped to me on time and all I had to do was screw the feet on. The storage is great, I put my purse and diaper bag in it so I can have it out of sight but can grab it on my way out, highly recommend!", 
    "It looks good with the nailhead trim and beige linen. It's big enough for pillows, blankets, and books. It arrived in perfect condition.",

    "I purchased this bench for my master bedroom but when it arrived it was way too small. I ended up using it as a window seat on one of my spare bedrooms. Overall the quality is good and the legs are super easy to attach. Good piece for a full or queen size bed or just as an accent piece.", 
    "This sits at the base of my bed and it looks really nice. Good color and the studs give it a classy look. The only downside is it won't hold a big comforter plus pillows, but it does hold a quilt and pillows. I change my bedding for summer and winter so I need storage space. This would hold a couple of changes of sheets, too.", 
    "I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. The bench came well packaged and it was easy to attach the legs. The fabric is linen and the nail trim looks great!", 
    "Purchased this for storage at the end of our queen sized bed to store our gym and work bags that had started to take over the bedroom floor. Ample room for two gym bags and a backpack large enough for a laptop as well as a couple pairs of shoes.",

    "Quality product and no assembly was required beside putting on the legs, which was easy. Very functional and fits great in the space. Only issue I've noticed is the space when the lid is closed it not even across. Might be adjustable, but I have not tried it.",

The finish is a little bit lighter than espresso (maybe close to walnut) but definitely not dark espresso.The bench was nicely packaged, so I got it with no damage, also was arrived assembled. There is not too much space inside, but still enough to keep couple pillows or blanket. Good quality, sturdy. Nice piece of furniture. Definitely would recommend.",

    "looks can be deceiving and they are with this product it looks great but also the legs do not scew on tight the they kinda just get tight enough and if you keep turning they are loose all over again",

    "Very sturdy, well made piece, and lovely to look at, only had to put the legs on", 
    "The bench is super easy to put together, just screw in 4 legs. It looks just the picture and comes with 2 extra nail heads just in case. The bench has a nice hinge system as well. You just lift the lid to whatever position you want and it stays open. One of the legs that came with the bench had a short screw so it won't go into the leg hole. I called customer service and I had a new leg in 4 days. That leg worked perfect. I'm very happy with the quality and look of the bench. It is placed at the foot of my king bed and it looks gorgeous.", 
    "Love this bench! I have it at the end of my bed and store LOTS in it. It is just as described and super comfortable for sitting. Would recommend.", 
    "This bench is much nicer than I thought it would be. The color is a little darker than it looks in picture but still a nice color. Perfect in my bedroom. Love it!", 
    "Just what we were looking for. shipped fast!", 
    "Looks great, easy storage and useful seating.", 
    "Great value for a really attractive storage piece.", 
    "Perfect for storing extra sheets and blankets. Fits beautifully at the foot of our bed", 
    "We have this in our closet to sit on when we put on shoes. The lid is installed a bit crooked, and the upholstery is a slightly uneven from one side to the next, so it is not perfect for a prominent location (at least this one), but it is sturdy and the fabric is versatile. Comfortable to sit on and easy to assemble. Perfect for our needs.", 
    "Great bench with just enough traditional with a touch of rustic. Perfect size.", 
    "looks great - built sturdy - has made my sweaters smell a little funny though", 
    "Small bench. Not large enough for the end of a king size bed. Would be great in front of a platform bed. Well made & functional though!", 
    "fits beautifully below my queen bed and would also work for king or double. lots of storage space. i scotch guarded it before use since light color might pick up stains", 
    "Beautiful . Elegant bench at the foot of our king size bed. Great place to put our decorator pillows at night.", 
    "Looks perfect in the sitting area in my master bedroom. I use it to store all my linen for my bed and pillows too!", 
    "I purchased this bench based off the reviews from others and I'm gal I did. Very nice and sturdy storage bench. It holds all of my extra blankets and sheet sets. Mine also had a tiny stain on the top like a few other people mentioned but it's not noticeable unles you get very close to it. Overall I would defiantly make this purchase again.", 
    "We got this for our bedroom so we could throw some pillows, blankets in there. The storage bench is a good size and is light enough to easily move around. I do wish it was a bit longer to match the width of the queen bed that we placed it in front of. But doing a bit of looking around, those dont seem to be very common. We had a little stain on the top of the bench when we got it delivered but overstock replaced it without a problem.", 
    "I was looking for a simple, easy to care for and roomy storage bench. It fits nicely in front of my bed. It is not large but I am able to store 3 medium size blankets and 3 sets of King Size sheets inside the bench. I use it to place my decorative pillows on it at night and during the day it is great for nightgown and robe. Plus the material of the bench is easy to wipe. My room is more traditional,therefore the bench fits my d\u00e9cor yet it is plain so I could easily move it to any room of the house, if needed. The price was perfect and I don't believe it looks cheap. But, if you are looking for elegant or something more for sitting, this might not be a good choice. I suggest you know your need. This bench fit my wants and needs perfectly. Delivery was great, condition perfect and it was easy to assemble the four feet. Absolutely no problems with this product.", 
    "This storage bench is very nice. It really looks good and will serve the purpose that I ordered it for, the price awesome!!", 
    "I bought this because my unit is in a vintage building and I did not want racks of shelving to clutter the room. The answer is obviously clever storage and making use of the open floor space without visual clutter. The unit arrived in one box, unpacked easily and took all of 5 minutes to assemble - which consisted of screwing the feet on. There were a few extra upholstery tacks in the box but they were obviously extra as the unit wasn't missing any. I could not be happier.", 
    "I love this piece. It has so much storage space and it is a perfect color for my bathroom.", 
    "I like this piece very much. It is exactly as displayed. It is roomy, and unobtrusive in a room. The only assembly is putting on the legs. I saw this in another store for twice the price. Can't go wrong.", 
    "Arrived timely. Box was torn but product was in perfect condition. Looks like the picture and does exactly what I bought it to do. Highly recommend if you need attractive extra storage.", 
    "HEAVY, LARGE, NICE ALL AROUND LOOK FOR ANYWHERE IN THE HOME", 
    "We bought is to have at the foot of the bed! Nice addition to our bedroom. Holds a lot of blankets as well.", 
    "Simply screw on the legs and it is ready to use. Beautiful piece of furniture. Large enough to store pillows and bedding for our sofa bed and to provide extra seating in a small room. So pleased with this piece.", 
    "was delivered just fine, it's exactly what i wanted, and looks very nice,and I'm happy with my choice, I will be ordering from Overstock again.", 
    "Comfortable and functional", 
    "It's not the most comfortable to sit on but that's ok. All you have to do is screw the feet on and it's ready to use. Lots of storage and I like the neutral color.", 
    "Great storage and good length for the end of a queen size bed.", 
    "Sturdy, handy, storage room, nice looking.", 
    "Very nice but not sturdy less then a 100lbs could sit on it.", 
    "This bench is a beautiful piece of furniture at a great price. The only assembly needed was screwing in the legs and that was it! Unfortunately it won't work where I originally wanted it (at the foot of my bed) because my bed sits so high that the bench looks very small. Other than that, I am very pleased with the purchase!", 
    "This bench looks awesome, it was a cheap price for a quality piece. I have a coastal living decorum and it fit in beautifully.", 
    "fits perfectly by my back door & the storage is a bonus! The price was right too!", 
    "Shipping was very quick. The bench is just what I wanted to store bedspread when too warm to use. The color and nailheads match my headboard which also has the material with nailheads. Couldn't be happier with my purchase. Quality looks great for price.", 
    "I was looking forever for the perfect storage bench for the entryway into my family room from garage and this is it !! Just put the legs on and you're all set. Great quality. I am very pleased !!", 
    "Great quality, easy to assemble.", 
    "Bench arrived in perfect condition and looks just as pictured. No assembly, except for screwing on the legs. Looks well-made, is sturdy, and level. The bench was a little lower than I expected, but I didn't really pay that much attention to the dimensions other than depth! Fabric looks great and cleans easily. Lid opens nicely to storage inside. The fabric inside looks like it might tear easy but hasn't yet (although I haven't put anything in there yet). So far, I'm very glad I bought this bench!! Would definely consider getting another for a different room.", 
    "Lots of room inside, easy to put together. I like the look a lot.", 
    "I couldn't have picked a better match for my sofa....it is as if I bought them together.......thanks!", 
    "This bench is durable and sturdy, the fabric is very good quality, and I'm very pleased with my purchase!!", 
    "exactly what I was looking for. Arrived perfect and as described.", 
    "Love it, looks just like the picture maybe even nice, can't wait to use it!!", 
    "It's exactly as pictured. It's sturdy, pretty, and has a lot of room for storage.", 
    "I received this piece of furniture in the mail super fast! It looked just like the picture and fits great in our bedroom in front of our bed. Perfect height! Wish it was slightly deeper but it is enough to fit two large decorative pillows and 2 small pillows if you condense them down.", 
    "Really great piece of furniture for the price. I would have given it 5 stars but little flaws here and there. Not noticeable unless your looking for it.", 
    "Love this bench, fits very nice at the end of my bed. The bench has the look of a more expensive piece of furniture. It holds my crafts and blankets and books. a lot of room. I would recommend this for budget minded people for sure!", 
    "From the size to the color to the quality expected, this product was exactly what I expected. Great quality piece that serves for both seating and storage in our living room. We really loved it!", 
    "Bought it to store purses in and it is exactly what I needed. It looks exactly as the picture and seems sturdy enough to sit on. Very easy to assemble and delivery was excellent.", 
    "We needed to replace the aging wicker hamper in our dressing room, and this handsome chest is the perfect replacement.It is solidly constructed, and nicely lined on the inside with a black sheer liner that seems to hold up well to its use as a laundry hamper. An unexpected plus is that the hinges for the lid have dampers on them so the lid does not slam down when you let it go.Very well done -- we couldn't be happier!", 
    "Well made, big deep space, great place to hide those items you want to keep handy but don't necessarily want out in full view taking up valuable real estate.", 
    "Needed a place to store extra shoes/boots \"out of sight\". Serves the purpose well!", 
    "Added elegant look to my bedroom. Plenty of storage space.", 
    "This bench exceeded my expectations, very nice quality and works perfect on the foot of a king bed", 
    "Just like pictured, big and roomy, perfect for extra towels and things, I like the hinge,", 
    "Well-constructed, just a little darker than I thought it would be. The picture is pretty accurate; I should've paid more attention to it. Much more of a burlap color than a typical linen color.", 
    "It's a nice and sturdy bench with spacious storage compartment. It also looks very nice. I was not happy with the packaging. The box was wet when delivered and was ruined on one side, as a result one of the pins was missing.", 
    "Nice looking bench with roomy storage. Hard seating.", 
    "Love this bench! Highly recommend. For the money, this is a steal!", 
    "The storage bench was well packed and did not get damaged during transit and it was delivered the same week I ordered it. Assembly is very easy and will probably take most people less than 10 minutes to do it. It is sturdy and has enough storage space. The top part is not soft but it is comfortable to sit on. I placed it in our foyer and it looks very beautiful. Simple and elegantly styled and I don't regret buying it.", 
    "The bench looks great in my room. I was scared of the fabric type as it is difficult to see from the picture but the fabric is exactly what I was expecting. the only thing...the storage is not as deep as it look but it still looks great", 
    "I bought this bench for one side of my dining table. I could not believe how much storage space is in this bench. I am a genealogist and have tons of picture albums and files. This little bench holds just about all of them. The fabric is natural color heavy linen with very nice nail head trim. Perfect for what I purchased it and more.", 
    "I needed extra storage in our Brooklyn apartment, this did the trick. Easy to assemble. I wish it was slightly bigger, but works well for the size.", 
    "Good quality and very stylish, however I assumed it would be slightly taller. Either way I have received numerous compliments on it!", 
    "I really like the way this bench looks and offers a good amount of storage-- the only thing is that it smells really bad. I've used about half a bottle of febreeze, a lot of perfume, and have even put it outside to air out and it still smells. You can't lay any clothing on the bench let alone store clothing inside of it or it will stink of chemicals.", 
    "LOVE LOVE LOVE this bench!!!!! Very sturdy and a nice place to store blankets!!!", 
    "This bench is beautiful and you cannot beat the price especially since it includes free shipping. The bench top is hinged and it stays propped open - which I don't think the description says. This is a plus for me as we have decided to store some toys in here for my son. I am very pleased with this. It took me 5 minutes to put the legs on and that was all the assembly needed.", 
    "Great product exactly what I wanted", 
    "Nice heavy frame, good looking piece with adequate storage space inside. Feet are made of real wood, not plastic or particle board.", 
    "I was impressed with the quality and the value for the price of this item. Came packaged very well. The only issue was a missing decorative nail head. They did include 2 extra nail heads, so easily fixed the problem.Item was shipped very quickly and we received it in less than 5 days from when we ordered. Very impressed.I would order again.", 
    "Beautiful and easy to assemble. Was a little disappointed with the amount of storage space, but over all well worth the price and very functional.", 
    "Well constructed. Roomy storage area", 
    "I really love this bench! I was looking for a lighter tan, upholstered bench with the decorative bronze nailheads. There is a lot of storage space, which I use for decorative pillows, blankets and winter accessories. The bench also has a comfortable cushion on top. Two adults could easily sit here and it would absolutely hold the weight. It really is a great addition to the end of my white queen bed and country decorated room. Delivery was very quick and assembly was literally taking it out of the box and screwing in the legs. So easy!", 
    "This was a good quality storage bench, especially for the price. Storage was roomy. It was a darker linen so expect a little more brown. It did not fit where I wanted to use it so I had to return it. Return shipping isn't cheap so make sure you really want it!", 
    "I bought this for guest bedroom in second home. Serves as seating and storage. Fits nicely across a queen size bed. Fabric and color very neutral.", 
    "The bench came nicely packed. There was no issue with putting on the legs. The hinges were not installed in the correct place and had to be moved for the top to properly line up with the base when closed. The upholstery is good, not great. The nail heads are not evenly spaced. Even with the inconsistencies I feel like it is a good deal. There's a good amount of storage space inside; it looks good and works well in the space we have.", 
    "Easy assembly, good quality, and nice storage space.... it's perfect!", 
    "The bench is perfect in my walk-in closet. Fabric and nail head trim is lovely. Storage is good size too.", 
    "My husband and I purchased this bench to place at the foot of our queen sized bed. It fits very well and is just the right height. I holds his weight with no trouble (250 lbs.), since he likes to sit at the foot of the bed late at night while snacking and watching TV. It holds our extra blankets with room left over. We placed a throw over it since he's a messy eater and I'm not sure how well this bench would clean up. We also have 2 cats that like to sit on it. This bench took no time at all to put together since all that was required was to screw the legs on. No trouble whatsoever! Pricing was perfect since I purchased with a discount. We love it and would recommend to anyone.", 
    "The bench arrived when Overstock stated it would. When I unpacked the box, the only thing I had to do was put the legs on. It looks the way it did in the picture. I purchased it for my granddaughter to put her clothing in it when she stays. We placed it at the end of the bed and she now also sits on it to watch TV instead of being on the bed.", 
    "fabric not as soft as I would have liked but everything else is what I expected.", 
    "Bench arrived protected in strong packaging. Not a blemish on it. Wasn't sure if I would like the nailhead upholstery tacks showing on the outside, but they look quite stylish. The legs of the bench are very sturdy and expensive looking. And the color of the fabric is very nice. The hinged lid is a bonus, rather than a lid that has to be lifted off. Lots of room inside for storage.This bench is well worth the money.", 
    "For the price, you can't beat it! I've looked at other stores and they are typically $30-50 more on a storage bench. We'll see how it holds up over time. I was able to fit more of our extra blankets in it so it definitely holds more than I thought it would. Thank you!", 
    "Be careful with this buy. The picture is deceiving in that it looks like a much lighter beige. It's actually a very dark beige-khaki look. I bought two of these and both had damages to the legs and the pins that were upholstered looked like a 12-year-old installed them because they are not evenly spaced and some aren't even on all the way (as it crooked). They look kind of tacky in my entrance and would not recommend to anyone period.", 
    "its beautiful and sexy. assembly is the easiest ive done in a while. screw in 4 legs and you are done", 
    "The bench is great. Because it's very deep, I am able to place all of bed linens and towels inside. I did have to ship the original bench I purchased back because it was defective. However, Overstock was great with the return process. They immediately shipped me a new bench and followed up to ensure the new product was delivered and the old was picked up. The fabric is durable and has been standing up to my hectic routine. It's very sleek and the nail-heads that frame it gives the bench a very modern touch. I highly recommend.", 
    "The nailhead upholstered storage bench is exactly how it looks on the website. The dimensions and color provided in the online description were exact. It was securely delivered to my home. I am happy to say there was no foul smell upon opening the lid and all the nail heads are in line in each row. The only assembly required was screwing on the feet of the storage bench. This will sit at the end of my queen size bed for storage of pillows and blankets. All of the items I plan on storing fit perfectly. The neuteral color will work well with my decor. Very pleased with the price, delivery and quality of this item.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately my room isn't big enough but we are still keeping it, I love it that much!!!", 
    "The quality and storage space are excelent. Just the color is a little bit different from the picture, its more beige than in the pic.Overall great storage bench!!", 
    "Using this storage bench at the end of the bed for extra sheets and blankets. Looks great with our decor.", 
    "Very nice accent piece. Storage is an added extra bonus.", 
    "I am very happy with this purchase. This bench is exactly as described. I used it in my son's bedroom, and it looks great. The storage area is roomy. It arrived quickly. It was packaged/wrapped well. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "I love my storage bench! It looks beautiful at the end of my bed. Perfect height, length, and color for my decor. Perfect for storing extra bed linens and winter blankets.", 
    "I am just thrilled with this bench. It is perfect for the spot I needed in my family room. The storage area is plenty big for toys or blankets or just about anything. Most of the benches were too long. It is sturdy and the best thing...it came put together. I would recommend this item to anyone.", 
    "This bench looks great at the foot of my king size bed. It is of a very generous size and can easily store extra blankets and pillows. I was a little skeptical of the fabric being \"linen\", but I would describe it as \"linen look\". It has a durable feel with a very nice appearance, having some texture and being slightly variegated in a light, neutral color (not uniform in color or thin as I would expect of true linen) which will not show obvious dirt or stains. I have 2 tricolor beagles who have been using this bench as a step to get on and off my bed for the past 2 weeks. It shows no wear, dog hair doesn't show either. One day a dirty smudge appeared. I dabbed at the spot with a cool, damp cloth and within a few seconds it was gone. Any residual smudge just blended in with the color. The feet are stained a medium dark color I would call a warm brown with golden undertones. I only rated the quality as good for this item instead of excellent for only 1 reason, the nailheads are not in a perfectly straight line across the front but not that bad to try to fix it. I only noticed because I am a detail person. Overall a great purchase at a very reasonable price.", 
    "Excellent product for the price. Storage Bench came assembled. I did not know that it would... so, I was pleasantly surprised and very satisfied with the purchase. Great price.", 
    "This is the perfect extra storage spot and gives you a place to sit while putting on your shoes. The fabric and nail heads are a perfect match to my headboard, which was a big plus. Really gives the finished touch to the bedroom.", 
    "Arrived on time. No smell out of box. Feet already attached - just removed packing material and placed at end of our bed. It is really the perfect size, shape, color, and holds a good amount. Very pleased! - as I was a bit nervous after ordering and reading other reviews.", 
    "Great looking bench, can't beat the price, plus free shipping!", 
    "This bench is a advertised. But one leg would not hold when screwed in. Overstock attempted to replace it, but could not. So they gave me a small refund. I can use it with the leg as it is, but it was disappointing that a new piece of furniture would have this defect.", 
    "I really am enjoying this piece. I couldn't tell the color of the wood from the picture, and when it arrived it didn't match the rest of my furniture. I bought cherry stain for less than ** and now it's a perfect match. Very practical, in that I use it for storage, decor, and seating. I would definately recommend despite not having been able to see the color of feet well. The overall look is very classy and the size is neither too large, nor too small for my bedroom. I did find similar benches in the store that were less expensive, however it wasn't worth the struggle for me to try to get it into and out of my car.", 
    "Great Quality and price = great value. Nothing cheap about this bench. Fit and finish are on par with high end furniture.", 
    "It's a lovely bench with ample storage. The material is lightweight so it may not stand up to rough handling, but I use it to lay clothing on when changing. I searched a long time online and in stores and this bench for this price is a great value for me.", 
    "Looks exactly as advertised and arrived quickly great value . Looks great color is accurate"
