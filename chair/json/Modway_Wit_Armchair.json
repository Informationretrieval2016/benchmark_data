    "This chair has a very nice look to it, true to the picture in color (I go the blue chair). It is very firm. that is not necessarily a bad thing, but you would e disappointed if you were expecting a cushy seat. I bought it for my elderly mother, who is short in stature, because the seat is not too deep, and while the dimensions of the chair work well for her, she doesn't weigh enough (less than 100#) to counter the firmness of the cushion, so when she sits in it she is basically sitting on top of it rather than in it. I however find it to be just fine, weighing just a bit more than mom. Keep in mind that this is not a \"finely made\" piece of furniture when you look under the surface (which you have to do to screw the legs in), but it is very nice looking; it does not look or feel cheap.", 
    "great looking mod chair; easy to assemble. Firm cushions, great back- I'm on the petite side and can curl up in it and read a book or my toddlers can climb up and read in my lap.", 
    "This is a decently constructed chair. Pretty comfortable and nice look. The legs are black and wished they were more walnut colored. When first put together two of the legs were shorter than the other. Moved them both to the back and now it sits great.", 
    "They look great and are easy to assemble but have not held up well at all. Our cats have completely destroyed the 2 of these that we purchased in just 2 weeks. The fabric just isn't tough enough."
