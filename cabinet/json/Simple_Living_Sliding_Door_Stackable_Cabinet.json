    "I purchased 3 of these sliding door cabinets (dark brown color)--one with wooden doors & 2 with the acrylic doors--to stack. These were VERY easy to assemble, with no missing parts, and simple to understand instructions. I never can understand when people rate things less bc they didn't read the description correctly, i.e., it's too small, or the doors aren't real glass, etc. It's all there in the description, so no surprises and I knew exactly what to expect!! What was really helpful were the reviews that described the inadequate pegs to rest the shelves on. I was able to fix that by purchasing spoon shaped pegs from the local hardware store, that would allow the shelves to rest on a flat peg surface rather than the rounded peg. Voila! The shelves don't move, and the pegs cost $1.80 for 12. As for the open sides, that is a non-issue since I am using these units as a pantry in my kitchen, so I'm not worried about my soup cans and grocery staples gathering dust. But I figured an easy way to fix that, if I wanted to, is to get plexiglass cut to size for above and below the shelves and stick them with craft glue dots. Again, a fairly easy and economic solution, which I don't mind absorbing bc I was able to get these cabinets for a great price!The cabinets look very attractive in my kitchen and have received many compliments on them!", 
    "Assembly is easy. Problems occur when you stack the other components on top to make the \"cabinet.\" I got this piece and the glass one to go on top. The glass one causes so much pressure on the one below, the sliding doors are hard to slide.There is 0 clearance between the shelf and the inner sliding door. This also makes it rough and difficult to slide. I am assuming with age this rubbing will wear out the shelf face and inner cabinet sliding door.", 
    "Love the product, it was easy to assemble.", 
    "Nothing to rave about. Smaller then expected and not very sturdy .", 
    "Only 4 \u2b50\ufe0fS because even having the dimensions, still a bit smaller then I would had hoped and very low to the ground. Very easy to put together. (Took me about 20/30 min)Very sturdy so far no problems. Love the color spot on from picture.", 
    "Very easy to assemble. Instructions were easy to read. Package was delivered, part of the box was ripped and looked as it could've been damaged. No parts were damaged and all parts were accountable. Cabinet will be great addition in dinning room.", 
    "The doors came scuffed. Very noticeably scuffed I must add. Putting it together was actually difficult because the hardware was beyond cheap. The threads on the screws were either not defined or stripped. I had to buy new ones. While it was inexpensive, I guess I expected more for my money. I wouldn't recommend this buffet.", 
    "This is a great buffet for your dining room or a hutch if you add the glass door stackable display case to it. It is very easy to move - especially with a couple sliders underneath. Looks like it would cost 2-3x what it actually does - great value!", 
    "It is a decent piece of furniture. I do like the color and was really easy to put together. I was able to put it together in one hour by myself. On the other hand, I wish it was higher as I only wanted to buy one and didn't care for the stackable options. The shelf hardware is a bit flimsy but functional nonetheless. I am using it as a \"coffee bar \" so it is serving its purpose.", 
    "My one and only complaint is that it was a little more difficult to put together then expected.", 
    "I love the look of this cabinet, it was SO easy to put together! We have 2 of them stacked on the other. However, you get what you pay for - they are definitely not high quality, but still decent for our first apartment.", 
    "I love anything that give function and storage to a hone. It's a perfect match with my dining room table.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Very spacious.", 
    "like many other reviewers, this cabinet is very low, cute yes and the sides DO NOT have anything covering them and dog and cat hair and whatever can get in there,, I am going to buy some plastic sheeting at a craft place to seal them from the inside.....other than that it is easy to put together and nice if you intend to buy another to put on top.........", 
    "I love it, was so easy to put together which was a plus for me usually i can't even understand on how to read the instructions lol . I give it a two thumbs up and I'm going to buy a second one and make it into a larger cabinet in my kitchen and dining area.", 
    "The whole point for me to buy this was to protect things from dust but the sides have no glass so you must undust inside too like open shelves", 
    "This turned out to be smaller than I expected (didn't remember dimensions) but I was glad. Good things come in small packages. Not hard to put together either. I wasn't too fond of the door tracks so I stained them to match the cabinet.", 
    "Cabinet is pretty solid, was easy to put together, looks good and I liked that it was stackable.", 
    "I stacked it with the one that has glass and it was fine....", 
    "Great condition. Our second purchase ever from this site. Nothing is wrong with it. Will continue to order.", 
    "I loved this item, but my second door will not go on with our hitting the shelf, and therefor the shelf falls off, I am unsure to but any glass items in there. We keep going over the instructions and we did everything right it's just the door hits the self. Any suggestions?", 
    "This thing is so flimsy putting it together it started to crack, I had to glue all the joints and it's still wobbly. I don't see how you could stack anything on this it may fall apart. I would send it back but I don't want to deal with the hassle of shipping such a heavy item back.", 
    "Love this. It really is a beautiful and sturdy piece. The dark color goes with everything in our home!", 
    "I didn't spend a lot so I wasn't expecting high quality. It is easy to assemble and sturdy enough, but smaller than I realized. The color is good.", 
    "Liked the color, espresso color I like but had bad blemish on it had to return it with no problem", 
    "it is an adequate and nice piece, easy to put together and holds a lot without taking up a lot of space. it is a simple piece not a lot of flare but very good piece.", 
    "I bought 2 & both fit under my breakfast nook for addtl storage in the kitchen. But up to now, it has the annoying smell of paint. Two weeks had passed but the smell is still there. I tried white vinegar, baking soda and deodorant spray but no luck. Also, I have to find a way to cover the sides. I think the manufacturer needs to figure out how to add a thin plastic for cover.", 
    "I expected better but I gave it an average score because the price was cheap per piece. I purchased 4 of these to make a curio cabinet in my dining room but it is not something I would recommend to anyone. ***. I paid over $*** for 4 of these and I should have waited and bought one on sale at a furniture store.", 
    "Badly faded won't buy from overstock again", 
    "We have a small kitchen with little space and this was a great purchase to help with the clutter", 
    "I was looking for a smaller cabinet to put next to my kitchen island. It fits perfectly. The rich espresso finish is lovely. My teenage son put it together for me and it was relatively easy to minimal tools needed.", 
    "I did receive my black stackable cabinet but have not put it together yet. My helper went to visit son in TX so I cannot open it. I am getting old and don't know why I keep buying for my home, but it sure makest look nicer around here.I only placed the white one on the wish list because I wanted to see the cabinet. I did not mean I wanted to buy it...but maybr.", 
    "I truly enjoyed the added storage space this cabinet provides me and my family. Besides being sturdy, the Espresso color is beautiful in my opinion.", 
    "I bought this for extra storage in kitchen. It really looks nice expresso color. Easy to assemble. Has a few scratches, not too noticeable. Doors move easy and are adjustable. Make sure you take notice of measurements (3/4 the height of normal kitchen cabinets and 1/2 the width of deep cabinets). Fits nicely under my kitchen window next to my cabinets.", 
    "Even more beautiful in person. I loved it so much I bought another one. Perfect size for what I needed.", 
    "I ordered one of these and two of the matching glass sliding door cabinets to use as a hutch. Upon arrival, one of the boxes was almost entirely open. The other two seemed to be intact. I accepted the shipment. Once I started putting it together, two of the side panels (from different boxes) were pretty badly scratched. There were wear and tear on other pieces. Luckily, I was able to \"hide\" most of the imperfections on the side that is facing the wall. The item description states, \"Materials: Engineered wood.\" I don't see cardboard included in this description, which would accurately describe the entire back side of all three items. It is definitely far from solid would...it's solid something. If I didn't just move into a house with minimal storage, I would have returned all three. There are definitely better products out there in the same price range.", 
    "Bought this cabinet for extra storage in my kitchen. Seems like very nice quality and was easy to put together. All the parts were there and the holes lined up nicely. Doors slide easily and looks great! Not quite as wide as I had hoped but I would recommend.", 
    "While it would be nice to have a deeper cabinet, this unit is well made and easy to put together. It is what one would expect for the price paid. Enough space for several items, but not larger dishes.", 
    "I bought this piece thinking it was a \"wood\" look (I realized it was particleboard)...but it's not. In the light, the finish used on this product makes it look plastic or painted metal. If you are using it in a place that gets a lot of natural light, you will definitely want to consider that. Put together, the piece is nice: functional, looks like the picture, sturdy*, and the doors slide easily. That is, IF you can get it all together. The directions are incorrect (or the side walls were drilled incorrectly - one of the two), so we put 90% of this piece together, only to realize that half of it was backward (we followed the directions exactly - we triple-checked). So, we took it apart, reversed a few pieces, and were good to go...until we got to installing the shelf. The round pegs that are provided for this are absolute garbage. When I set the shelf in, if it moved even slightly (and I would expect it would, in daily use...), the shelf would come crashing down: the shelf is too narrow for where the peg holes are drilled (and the round pegs do not help, at all). We solved this by re-purposing some old/extra flat pegs, from a different shelf (probably a cheapo one from ******* at some point - go figure). It was more secure, but not secure enough. So, we also secured the shelf through the back with a couple of nails. Now the piece is solid and, except for the finish when the sun hits it, looks really nice. Overall, for the price, it's fine once you get it put together (which will include using some of your own creativity, unless your kit is far different from mine). As-is, I am not sure how on Earth anyone could stack these - the falling shelf issue is pretty major.", 
    "Easy to assemble, quality for the price and a sleek look! It sits between 2 acent chairs so it's the perfect height!", 
    "Great room for storing all my glass dishes", 
    "Easy to install the item with instruction. Sides it's open and it's not completely closed.", 
    "Low price furniture with a very good perceived quality matching the picture. The material is compressed wood with a good surface aspect. The assembly is surprisingly precise, a little labor intensive: many screws, but OK to me. 4 mounting screws are visible on the side even if slightly recessed. The final result is really convincing. I would recommend this purchase.", 
    "Bought two of this to put side by side. Not worth it. Ended up staking them. I know they are inexpensive but really not worth it. It is better to save the same amount and wait and get something better. One of them came broken and scratched. Still using them, not worth even the drive to return or spend hours on the phone. Good luck.", 
    "\"Review the dimensions carefully. I like this product overall but it is smaller than I expected. The middle shelf is also weaker than expected. I use it in a break room in an office so it serves its purpose but it isn't as elegant looking as it looks. The price fits - other similar items are more expenses (and are probably higher quality). \"", 
    "Great stackable storage--So maybe not the most heavy duty, but it serves its purpose and looks nice and clean. I would definitely order this again.", 
    "I wanted this item for my open concept dining area. It is used as extra storage for bulky appliances that I do not want cluttering the kitchen and the top of it is used as a coffee bar for my espresso machine and keurig. It is a nice, simple looking piece of furniture and works well with modern to contemporary decor. I would have liked to have more options for positioning of the shelf, as I would be able to actually use it if I could place it a bit higher, but that wasn't terribly inconvenient.", 
    "Fast delivery, Easy to assemble. Exactly as described. Couldn't be happier with it", 
    "Great find for the money.", 
    "Love how easy it was to assemble, the wood was sturdier than I had thought it would be. Perfect for my wine goblets. The only thing I don't like is that it's not enclosed so you would have to wash the glasses because it gets a little dusty. Love the sliding doors that goes both ways.", 
    "Love this cabinet. Bought 2 with the solid doors. One to store grandchildren's toys and games, and the other for tablecloths, placemats and napkins. Then purchased a cabinet that matches the first 2, but he's glass panels on the sliding doors. It safely displays some special items we have collected over the years.", 
    "This is a great storage unit for small items!", 
    "Size wise it is perfect, as it fits into a marrow space well without causing an obstruction. It is well construction and stable once assembled. We have just the one unit (no additional stacks).The top could have been a better surface (veneer hopefully) which would have given it a nice touch. That said it has a clean smooth finish, The bottom corner support blocks (legs) are just blocks and could have had some shape to them to provide a better aesthetic look.The side should really be closed up to avoid dust settling in. Overall a decent buy that's a perfect fit for us.", 
    "I measured the length of this piece but did not measure the height or width before purchasing. My fault. We did not want anything too big... But this is small. Wish it was a bit taller (two would be too big to use as a buffet) and wider. But it will do.", 
    "This is beautiful to look at and holds alot off things. I stacked mine three high, nothing heavy though. It is impossible to close contents off from dust, or view from the sides. The sides are open, with no panel. There isnt even enough room to cut and finish a thin piece of wood because of how the shelf fits in. This disappointed me, but its still a keeper."
