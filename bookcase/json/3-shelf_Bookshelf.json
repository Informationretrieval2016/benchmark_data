    "This bookshelf looks exactly like it does in the picture. We bought three of them and they were all excellent. They were very easy to put together. My husband and I added wood glue for extra stability as they are to be used in a preschool setting. I highly recommend this product!", 
    "Only thing I would like more is it it was able to hang on a wall.", 
    "Good quality, easy to assemble. Exactly what I wanted!", 
    "Great product. Fits perfectly in our playroom and looks exactly like the photo."
