    "although there were no handles I place them on so that it would be easer to open.", 
    "Putting this shoe cabinet together was a nightmare---the instructions were very unclear and I had to drill my own holes into the wood on multiple instances. Considering this cabinet is not all that big/heavy, it should not have taken very long to build. Lastly, the doors came chipped/dirty. Will keep only because it would cost so much to ship back.", 
    "It is pdf material but still looks great. Using in my entry way to maximize storage space will still having a place to toss my keys. The legs are plastic which I did not expect. I spray painted them gold...turned out great! Like so much I may buy a different style of the same for another area in my house.", 
    "Nice product at a good price!", 
    "Love the cabinet holds all my shoes .. The best part the unit has doors and the unit is close so the shoes are always clean free of dust.", 
    "Overstock fulfilled my long-time dream to have a functional, properly sized and roomy enough, shoe cabinet. For me it is very important because I usually have 8 to 10 pairs of shoes out there in any given season, and this cabinet makes all presentable and convenient. Thank you so much for the service and product, great as always!"
