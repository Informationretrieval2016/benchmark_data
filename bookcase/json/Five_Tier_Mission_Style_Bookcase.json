    "This shelf definitely does the trick, is sturdy, and holds books without any trouble. Putting it together was easy, and it looks good! Altogether pleased.", 
    "Positives: It is real wood! You can actually see the grains. It is a good size and looks beautiful. The picture does not do it justice. Negatives: Even though it's real wood, it's a soft, light-weight, wood. I believe it will probably not stand up to abuse and could easily dent. The bookcase came dented and there was a small crack in it; however, neither are noticeable from the front so I didn't return it. The assembly was difficult for one person but was a breeze when my boyfriend helped hold the pieces in place. The allen key that came with it was not made properly (the edges were rounded) and after about 10 minutes of not realizing why I couldn't tighten the bolts, I had to use another one from my toolbox. You'll also need a phillips head screw driver and a rubber mallet. A cordless drill/electric screwdriver made the assembly much easier and faster. None of the pieces are labelled (which is nice that you don't have to try to scrape off those stickers); however, you'll have to carefully look at the diagram to figure out which piece is the left and right sides (the double holes go towards the inside-back of the bookcase). The bookcase is made of a very light-weight wood, and as such, is not very stable until you put some heavy books on the bottom shelves. I would not recommend this bookcase for houses with small children or pets unless you secure it to the wall. Overall, I love the look of the final product, and will actually purchase a second one once the item becomes available again.", 
    "I bought this bookshelf several months ago and had been meaning to write a review (since I always read them prior to a purchase :-) I have had a really good experience with this bookcase - it looks great, nice wood, sturdy for my books, yet light enough for me to move alone. However, there is one caveat that ruined it all for me a made me give a lower review; it can with a few knicks in the wood (which i could overlook reasonably), but in addition to this the shelf was obviously manufactured incorrectly and portions of it did not line up! I read that someone else had this experience, and unfortunately it happended to me. I am super busy and would not consider sending it back, etc. So I just made due and had to damage certain parts of it to put it together safe & securely. It was quite a fiasco and really annoyed me, how could they actually manufacture it incorrectly?!?Well, save for this - my review would have been much higher.", 
    "Went with this one as it was the cheapest bookshelf I found on Overstock and liked it so much we decided to get another. Hubby had no trouble putting it together, looks nice and real wood is a plus. 4 stars because the wood is dented and scraped in places, but only on the underside of the shelves and so really not visible. A good deal for the price.", 
    "Love this bookcase!!! It is beautiful and is exactly what I wanted! Thanks Overstock!!", 
    "Git the bookcase assembled today and I like it except.... the color is NOT espresso, which I consider to be a black/brown color. This shelf is a reddish brown, much lighter than I wanted and lighter than the photos made it appear. But I can live with it, just disappointed because I wanted black/brown.", 
    "Even though this is real wood, it is light. I had to problem picking up the box from UPS and loading it in the back seat of my car. I put it together myself under an hour, but it would have been easier with two people as one screws the shelves together. Once assembled, it holds pretty good.", 
    "I was pleased that these were solid wood shelves and that they were easy to assemble except for the top shelf which did not come drilled. You have to figure and mark where the screws are going to go. I didn't find it that difficult to do. The shelves have enough length to each one which enables one to put the same size book or object on any shelf, which I found very helpful and practical. It has a nice look to it. I give it an excellent review.", 
    "The bookshelf is nice-looking dark solid wood. Easy to put together (I managed myself in about an hour with no special tools). It is a little tippy and a little bit rickety (you get what you pay for) but with heavy things on it stable and attractive, and fits a lot of stuff. A little narrower than measurements alone would indicate --inside the shelf width is about 27 inches. Great value for the money but not the most sturdy/solid bookcase in the world. I am quite pleased.", 
    "Please be advised that although this bookcase is typical for its type, 1. its finish is not really finished. It was rough and we had to take very fine sandpaper and smooth the finish.2. its color is not true Espresso. It is more of a cherry walnut. Espresso doesn't have red in it.3. not all of the predrilled holes for the screws were big enough. We bought smaller diameter screws.The only reason we did not return these cases was the time factor. We did not have time to wait for another shipment or search for other shelves.All said, everyone who enters the room comments on how good the bookcases look.", 
    "I love it. Some of the screw covers would not fit into the space for them. It was quite easy to put together.", 
    "I ordered 2 of these for my office. They were relatively easy to put together. A couple of the shelves were slightly damaged due to the staps being pulled too tight, but not badly enough to return the item. They are very sturdy and are perfect for my office. I am able to move them by myself and I like them so much I am going to order another one!", 
    "Your furniture looks great in my home,\ud83d\ude1a", 
    "quality is equivalent to price. Don't expect too much.", 
    "It's beautiful! And very sturdy.", 
    "Beautifully made bookcase with nice height between shelves. Super easy to put together. Extremely satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "The bookcases are a nice color and style. Very simple lines that go with a lot of styles. They work well with my Ecletic Farmhouse Chic decor. They did have a couple of minor scratches, which I touched up with Old English in a dark color and you cannot notice them. They hold a lot, but are not so big and heavy, so they can be moved easily.", 
    "Easy assembly. Looks great. Good storage area.", 
    "Nice bookcase! Easy to assemble. Sturdy. Adds lots of storage and display space. A bargain at the price.", 
    "from other reviews of this item I expected a decent value for my money but also some blemishes and/or imperfections. However, there were no scratches, gouges or mars of the product of any kind and the wood is real! In fact, it is of surprisingly high quality and the room has a pleasant odor from the wood. Very pleased indeed I am with this product!", 
    "I liked it so well at my home I bought one for classroom.! Easily assembled and looks elegant.", 
    "Easy to assemble, sturdy, does not require being attached to the wall.", 
    "This bookshelf is sturdy and looks great. Relatively easy to put together and the price was right. I ordered a second one after receiving the first. I store relatively heavy journals on these shelves, they are solid and don't sag in the center. Great value!", 
    "The bookcase is pretty shaky and wobbly.", 
    "Looks good, but needs cross bars across back to keep from leaning sideways. I put a lot of books on the selves, so they were heavy and needed good support.", 
    "I loved this bookcase, the wood parts were of excellent quality, the hardware to put it together was good quality as well, it was easy to assemble and looks great, lots of shelving and good size for books o other items. I may purchase another.", 
    "This mission bookcase was just the right look for our living room. Contemporary style and functionality. The only knock would be...be careful when you put the screws in as a mistake will chip the shelf.", 
    "Love this shelving unit - perfect for holding shoes, which my wife has an enormous collection of. Purchased for that purpose alone, it gets the job done. Easy assembly and sturdy.", 
    "This bookcase had proved to be quite sturdy, more than I had expected for the price.", 
    "the main supports were broken when they arrived. the box does not afford enough protection", 
    "Wonderful product for $$. Would buy another at that price.", 
    "This bookcase was worth the price,,,,,,easy to assemble.", 
    "This was a little hard to assemble but with assistance helped.Very good bookcase .", 
    "This was average quality but if actually using all shelves for books, the product will not hold up. The unit needs at least one more brace on each side to keep it from twisting. Nice looking shelves but wouldn't want to fill more than 1-2 shelves with books.", 
    "This bookshelf is perfect for what we need in our living room. It matched our furniture well. Assembly was easy.", 
    "Despite most of the pieces being solid wood, it's not from the most solid parts of the tree. After assembling, which was simple enough to do alone, I noticed that it wobbles more than I'd like. Not wanting to return such a large piece of furniture, I kept it and it's doing what it's intended purpose is for: storing books.I recommend placing the heavier, hardback books at the bottom and the smaller paperbacks at the top. I also have book ends and a couple of figurine decor items to punctuate the tiers, which makes the room and this piece look more elegant.It's neither too simple and ugly nor very elegant. I gave it 3 stars only because I have another bookcase that's just slightly smaller and that was priced similarly, but it's solid wood with beautiful finishing. For so close of a price, I expected similar quality.Oh well, this 5-tier Mission Style bookcase serves its purpose, so I'm content.", 
    "It's ok, for a while, then it gets wobbly and pieces start falling off.", 
    "COLOR IS TRUE ESPRESSO AND SHELF UNT ITSELF LOOKS VERY NICE. WE DID MUNT IT TO THE WALL SINCE IT WAS GOING IN A CHILDS ROOM.", 
    "This was fairly easy to put together. It does help to have 2 people. Once screwed together, it is sturdy, however a bit smaller than I was expecting. It works great for the space that I have it in and holds a lot.", 
    "These bookshelves are exactly how they are described. They are less than $$$, so don't expect fine qualty wood, but they are real wood and feel and look like real wood. You can get a better bookshelf, but not for $$$. For it's price its great.", 
    "Good condition and actually made of real wood", 
    "Looks great and easy to put together!", 
    "Exactly what I expected. A cheap bookcase that is easy to move. I wouldn't put anything heavy on the top two shelves. Books at bottom, periodicals next, toys and statuettes at the top (or pictures).", 
    "Perfect for a kid's room.", 
    "I was looking for a real wood bookcase that wouldn't break the bank, and this was it! The bookcase looks very nice. I'm impressed by the quality and it was easy to assemble. As another reviewer said, the wood is soft, so I would use some caution so it doesn't get dents. Mine arrived with only one small scratch, but I assembled it so that it was hidden. Assembly was easy. It took me a little over an hour to do by myself. You will need a rubber mallet. I don't know if you'll necessarily need a power drill, but you'll at least need a Phillips head screwdriver. As others said, it is wobbly, but as long as it's not getting bumped into, there's nothing to worry about. Love my new bookcase!", 
    "Either it was me or the quality of the product. It wasn't a bad piece, but it wasn't as sturdy as I had expected. There's a chance that it just needs some tightening, but I'm not too sure =).", 
    "Exact color requested, and easily put together. Very sturdy.", 
    "Solid and stable. Made of real wood so it looks nice, not like bargain furniture. It doesn't have the gravitas of a wood bookcase with solid sides and back, but that makes it a better match for some rooms. Assembly was easy, and the delivery cost is a tiny fraction of the cost for a fully assembled bookcase.", 
    "I have two of these bookcases in my craft room. I needed somewhere to store my quilting books and patterns. I have added some baskets for easy storage. They were easy to assemble and look great.", 
    "Beautiful design. Easy to assemble. It holds a lot of books without adding \u201cbulk to the bedroom where it is placed. Some reviews said it was wobbly. It is not wobbly but I agree, like any dresser or bookcase, it should be attached to the wall if young children are in the home as a safety precaution.", 
    "The bookcase was easy to assemble unless you had a dog that wanted to walk off with all the wood bars. It was just what I was looking for to display books and nick knack stuff and size was perfect for the area.", 
    "more decorative than functional", 
    "Very nice and as described.", 
    "Beautiful bookcase and shipped really quickly!", 
    "This bookcase is sturdy and looks great in my office!", 
    "Very nice looking and easy to set up.", 
    "Overall this is a nice bookcase. The only reason for 4 stars is the buttons that cover the crew holes are so tight they barley fit in the holes so some stick way out and some don't. Also 2 corners were damaged on both pieces from either warehouse handling or shipping.", 
    "Nice & easily to put together. Just as pictured and not as obtrusive as solid bookcases.", 
    "Holds My 32' flat screen TV on top shelve and its actually not too high for viewing. Very pleased.", 
    "This product is high quality for the price and a nice, rich dark brown color.", 
    "looks good, fits int space, easy toput together, price was right,", 
    "It's a nice looking shelving unit, and it's got good style to it. My one caveat is that it's not as stable as one might prefer. It sways easily, which makes me anxious about putting too much weight (i.e., too many books) on it.", 
    "Amazing as it may seem, this is really a very nice bookcase. We bought 2, packaged very well, assembly was smoothand they're very rich in appearance and solid in structure.", 
    "Great bookcase. Natural wood. Easy to put together. Just ordered another one.", 
    "I ordered two of these bookcases for my living room for movies, they turned out fantastic. Definitely a great deal for the money. No issues with shipments or assembly of either bookcase.", 
    "It's a nice shelf for books, display and media equipment.", 
    "The bookcase is solid and doesn't \"wobble\" like so many do. However, the style and appearance are just average. I wouldn't purchase another like it.", 
    "Needed a bookcase for my den for displaying pictures. I was very pleased with this one! The wood is heavy, and is of good quality. It was a little awkward to put together, had to get my son in law to help. I love it, and it looks great in my den!! Thanks so much!!", 
    "Don't buy this if you're looking for a 5 shelf bookcase; this only has 4 shelves. I received this bookcase today, shipping speed was average, I ordered on a Friday and received it on the next Thursday. When I opened the box, I found 2 dents already in the wood and a few scratches but I didn't want to deal with sending it back to wait on a new one so I plan on covering the bookshelf possibly with cloth to hide these nicks. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to put together by myself, I imagine it would've been faster if I had someone helping me. The instructions were helpful but the back bars seemed like each one would only go in specific holes, which was not in the directions. The hex screws stripped easily and I was worried the shelf was going to split if I tried to tighten it (some holes seemed sloppily pre-drilled). I tightened all screws as tight as i could with the hex key without breaking the shelf but when it's all assembled, it's questionable if it could handle something jarring it, such as a slight earthquake or a toddler touching it. Aesthetically pleasing, I am pleased overall with this purchase but would recommend the heavier books being on the bottom, don't put fragile, precious memories on top, and possibly a weight holding it down behind it.", 
    "Beautiful piece. Easy assembly. Coloring and quality of material is great compared to other self-assembly pieces. Matches my furniture store purchased living room pieces.", 
    "The bookcase arrived quickly! It is exactly as described. My box was intact, and none of the pieces were dinged or scratched. The instructions were pretty good. Other buyers noted the need to buy a rubber mallet for the finish pegs, but I just put the soft side of a scrubby sponge over it and used my regular hammer. Worked fine. I'd suggest tweaking the bolts one more time after standing bookcase upright. The finish is apparently sprayed on, and between some of the slats it was unevenly applied, so I touched it up so it wouldn't look cheap. Having a wider slat across the back of the shelves (especially along the bottom) would help hold small books better. On Overstock's part, I didn't know there were other finishes available until the day after ordering when a selection of them popped into my facebook feed. I'm happy with the bookcase. Would gladly suggest it to friends.", 
    "I bought this after purchasing the 3 shelf unit. After I assembled it I found some flaws but Overstock made it right for me. Customer service has been and always is the best! As with the 3 shelf, there may be an alignment fitting issue with the top shelf but its doable. Great unit and I'm glad I have them in my house.", 
    "These shelves are made in Thailand - Hi Chaol, Tony and Siri! I put them together within an hour. I glued some of the joints. The very top shelf does not have pre-drilled holes. For that, I turned the entire structure upside down, resting it on the top shelf, which was loose on the floor. I positioned it all so that it was perfectly even, and then simply wrenched down real hard with my screwdriver. The wood is soft enough that I was able to screw the stop shelf sturdily to the rest of the bookcase. Although this bookcase is made entirely of natural wood, it is not a heavy piece of furniture. It is absolutely perfect for what I wanted: to store four shelves for my yarn stash, with some of my favorite Barbie dolls populating the top shelf. There is an artistic satisfaction to it. I love seeing my things displayed like this, instead of them being stuck away in bins and closets. Now, I want several hip-high shelves exactly like these for my stash of fabric and beads. Also, I love the color of these shelves: they are of a darker, reddish color, which actually fits very well with the color of most of my other furniture.", 
    "I was looking for a bookshelf to fit an alcove at the bottom of a stairway. This fits perfectly- and I am so happy with it. It is a very pretty piece, and is sturdy. The price was amazing, and was easily assembled. It is exactly what I needed.", 
    "The first one was broken due to poor shipping and handling. However, \"O\" sent me a replacement immediately! It arrived in perfect condition; was very easy to assemble; is sturdy and can hold our heavy items. Although our d\u00e9cor is not mission style, the dark wood allows it to blend very well with our contemporary/traditional d\u00e9cor. \"O\" continues to be my first place to shop online!", 
    "I wanted to get a set of bookshelves on a shoestring budget for my office, and I am so pleased with the look of these. They are pretty solid, too. Super easy to put together.", 
    "Bought this bookcase to use with another that I had purchased , so I was very pleased that it was just as advertised. They matched perfectly and now I have a library in my unused little bedroom. My husband thought it was pretty easy to put together. Thanks", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised when I took all of the pieces out of the box to see that it really is nice, sturdy, real wood! It's color is beautiful and matches my other espresso furniture perfectly! I put it in my sons bedroom for all of his binders, folders and heavy books and it can definitely withstand all of the weight. I'm actually going to buy a few more to put in my other children's bedrooms because I know I won't have to worry about it getting damaged as it is good quality. I'm very pleased!", 
    "I should've asked a friend to help but being a man I did it myself. It took also some slight fabrication with a pocket knife, you have to whittle down some of the wooden peg in order for it to fit in the holes. other than that it's very strong I have a full encyclopedia set and some other hardcover books. its very sturdy and looks like good quality, real wood not Sauder crap!", 
    "This bookcase is Great! My only complaint is that is not as big as I thought it was going to be but never the less I'm still pleased with my purchase. The dark brown or mocha of the bookcase brings style into my living room and it looks like I paid so much for it which I like. I don't like cheap looking furniture and this piece looks like you paid way more than you did. It's a great addition to any living room.", 
    "I needed a new bookshelf and was afraid of a very shoddy product, but I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be so nice and solid feeling. I would recommend it very highly. I love it, and I love Overstock's friendly and helpful people. After many purchases I haven't had a bad experience yet.", 
    "I bought two of these, assembled them by myself without power tools, each in about 20-25 minutes (I know this for certain because I put each one together completely within an episode of Arrested Development, which run about 20-22 minutes). They are a rich, dark brown color, exactly as I expect 'espresso' to be. Reading some of the older reviews that complained about the color being more red, I think Overstock may have addressed this issue as I don't see this complaint in more recent reviews and that certainly wasn't the case here. It even comes with little wooden covers for the screw holes, which can be seated securely & without damage by a good hit with a rubber mallet. Note the shelves are very tall, so these lend themselves well to display of taller items or books. The only improvement I would make would be to offer an alternative with an additional shelf with the shelves closer together. Overstock, if you offered that item remotely close to this price, I'd pick up two tomorrow.", 
    "I almost hate to give a negative review because it seems as if customers are thrilled with the shelves. Due to the price, we bought two of these. Both of them have areas that are badly scratched due to the boxes being strapped together. My husband managed to break one of the slats on the side - while it was laying on the floor- just by screwing it together. I guess as long as you invest in wood glue and wood touch up markers, these will work just fine. On the upside, they DO look nice. I hope they can hold my books.", 
    "I love these shelves once I got them together. They were a pain to put together if you are doing it alone like I did. It would be much faster and easier if you had someone else there to help hold while putting them together. After you finish putting them together, pounding the screw covers on the sides were a nightmare. Some caps would fit the holes and others you had to keep moving till you found a hole that fit. I do like the depth of the shelves. They hold my printer well enough I don't fear it will fall off while using. The shelves seem heavy enough too, that they won't sag from the weight of the books either. All and all they look great in my living room with all my books and knick-knacks. I would recommend these bookshelves.", 
    "I received my bookshelf right on time. The top of the box, however, was torn in shipping and I was very fortunate that my little package of screws and nuts and bolts didn't fall out--I counted all of them and by some miracle they were all there even though the little bag was torn. After that, everything went quite well! My pieces were not damaged, were in perfect condition and the holes were all drilled correctly. I am not a proponent of putting things together--AT ALL- ug. However, I put this together, by myself, in about 2 hours. (Would have gone faster had I not put it together backwards the first time). Just a smidge wobbly, but it stabilized after I put my books on it and it looks very nice.(Could have been the wood floor it was sitting on). Be sure and have a rubber mallet to pound in the little pieces that cover the screw-holes. I used a hammer, because they were difficult to pound it, and I wore the finish off a bit, but using the right tool would take care of that issue. In my experience of ordering bookshelves and DIY products on-line, this one, I feel, was a great purchase.", 
    "We used this in our open floor plan dinning/kitchen for cookbooks and sundry; just lovely", 
    "These shelves are a great value. I shopped locally and could not find anything near this price. Ashley had a similar bookshelf \"on sale\" for 3x's the price. My husband and son had some minor issues putting the 1st one together. They gave up on using the allen wrench that came with the package and the 2nd unit went up just fine. Liked these shelves so much that I bought a 3rd one.", 
    "Once assembled and you begin using the book shelves, you find them a bit wobbly. Finish was not the best so I plan to paint them and possibly brace them to the wall to make them move stable.", 
    "I bought 2 of these because it was nicely made to display pictures in my husbands office.", 
    "Would recommend to anyone - a nice enhancement to my casual living room and looks great now spruced up for the holidays.", 
    "There was damage to one of the screw holes when I got it and the wood was split at the hole. I super-glued it and put it together rather than go through the hassle of shipping such a large item back. As another reviewer commented, it does lean a bit with books on it, even though I do not believe it's overloaded, and I probably wouldn't use it if I had small children. It's okay, just know what you are getting.", 
    "I love my bookcases (I purchased 2). I could not afford the higher quality bookcases; so these fit into my budget and look very nice. The mission style gives them an open, airy feel; not bulky and obstructive. They don't take up a lot of space and they're relatively sturdy. I did need to fix a couple of things so I could assemble them (one rod needed to be trimmed to fit). I have not figured out how to install the top yet, but I'm not the best with following these instructions. Overall, I am very satisfied.", 
    "This was a very contemporary bookcase, which is what I wanted. Unfortunately, I assumed expresso would be black and it looked more like cherry. I will be returning it and ordering something else.", 
    "good price and good quality. i like how it looks in my reading room. the fact that it is not solid, makes the room little spacious.", 
    "These are great for the price. Sturdy, easy to put together, look wonderful. Bought three--and am so pleased to finally have enough room to store my books! Was so glad I read the reviews first--really need a drill and a rubber mallet to put these together.", 
    "Highly recommend this bookcase. I'm ordering another one. Very easy to put together too!", 
    "This is a fine, lightweight bookcase that is a decent value for the price. Easy to assemble, few dents and scratches. Packaged well to protect the contents. I purchased these bookcases for my son's (age 8) room. He's not a climber and is mature enough to understand that he shouldn't pull on the bookcases or try to stand on them to reach a higher shelf. Because they are so lightweight, they're not especially stable. If you plan to put these near young children, you would definitely need to figure out a way to anchor them to the wall and regardless, I wouldn't put electronics on them for fear of them toppling off. Overall, though, this serves our purposes very well. Attractive, lots of space for books, accommodates taller and oversized books.", 
    "The bookcase comes as a flat box delivery. Assembling took a little over 30 minutes. I ordered this case for my DVD collection, and wanted actual wood and not the pressed wood-like materials. I had priced shelving of this type and found that they were minimally twice what I paid for this unit, delivery included.", 
    "Although there are a number of connections that have to be made for this set of shelves, I didn't have any problem assembling them. My chief complaint is that there is no bracing to keep them rigid and so they lean easily. Once the books were in place, the weight seemed to staiblize the shelves somewhat, but I wouldn't trust them around small children.", 
    "WOW! Finally a piece of furniture that was easy to assemble, made of solid wood, and looks great! After opening up the box, I was able to assemble one of these bookcases in 30 minutes (I purchased two) with minimal tools (comes with a small allen wrench). After the quick assembly, the bookshelf was level, felt very solid and looks great. Instructions were easy to read, nothing was missing and all of the parts fit together with no problems. I would highly recommend these shelves to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, solid wood, easy to assemble, and impressive looking bookcase.", 
    "Bought this to fit in a very specific space. Fit perfectly and looks good. Seems quite sturdy. Only issue was the little nob things that cover the screw holes. No instructions on how to get them in. Seemed like we would need to hammer them in. Didn't want to do that and possibly damage the bookcase so we left them off... still looks fine.", 
    "This is a quality product for such a reasonable price.", 
    "The bookcase as a finished product is an excellent addition to any room in your house or apartment. It takes about an hour to assemble even with sparse instructions.", 
    "Pretty much WYSIWYG. I've put many bookshelves together before but I must admit this one took the longest (1 hour). 2 people would have made it go much faster but still it seemed to take forever. Make sure you have a mallet handy to tap the pieces together. I had to tap a number of inserts into place because they were not properly aligned. Once complete, it was great.", 
    "Good price good product, I need more like this... !", 
    "Better than pictured! I wanted to order a solid wood bookcase\u0097this one is, and it's great for the price. I hesitated because the photo doesn't do it justice. It's not stylized, making this bookcase look plainer than a lot of others on overstock. I went ahead and ordered it anyway, and I couldn't be happier. It's not particle board/mdf junk, which can out-gas toxins. It's sturdy and made my dining room! I fit all my cookbooks, linens, and children's art supplies nicely. I got a lot of storage space without a big footprint. The shelf isn't extremely deep, but just right, so it works well in smaller spaces. The shelf feels a little wobbly if I push against it, but I think it's because I have all the weight of my cookbooks on the top two shelves, and very light things on the bottom shelves. Distributing the weight more evenly would probably make a big difference. All in all, this is a great buy and I couldn't be happier!", 
    "Very pleased. The look great in our Living Room and are really functional for our art book collection and our accessories. Shorter than I realized but it worked out wonderfully because we used the top for decorative baskets and a dried flower arrangement.", 
    "Wonderful bookshelves and sturdy. It took me less than an hour to put two together. All parts included and perfect fit with drilled holes. I love them wish I bought more. Terrific buy! Thanks overstock!", 
    "The bookshelf looks great. However, the shelf is very wobbly. I can't get it to tighten up. If I could, I'd return it because I wanted something sturdy. If I touch it, It leans one way. The screws are are to tighten up but I'll keep trying. It is beautiful though!",

    "When I was reading previous reviews of the product, I was hesitant, but the price and style were perfect. I crossed my fingers and ordered. Unlike those people who had complaints, I was quite happy. All the screws were there, all of the holes lined up, the directions were easy to follow and I was able to assemble the parts and pieces without help. It took about 30 minutes. The finish was even and flawless. There was a small nick in the back on one piece that was easily disguised with a dab of black sharpie.", 
    "We had a bunch of books laying around with no extra shelf space to store so this was aimed to do that. IT DID! Got all of them (a lot) in it with a bit to spare and it fit perfectly into our living room with similar shelving. I was amazed at the quality of this shelf for the price, so thank you very much, OS.", 
    "Purchased 3 bookshelves. It was important to us that they be solid wood. I'm very pleased overall with ease of purchase, delivery, assembly, functionality & how they look in our home."
