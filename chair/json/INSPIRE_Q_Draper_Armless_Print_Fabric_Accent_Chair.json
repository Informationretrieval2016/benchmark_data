    "Product arrived badly damanged, the back arm of the chair had a very large crack, almost seperated. The colors are also washed out and not as vibrant as the picture shows.", 
    "It adds life to the living room.", 
    "I received this chair after weeks of issues with the wrong chair being delivered. The box was damaged - though most furniture is packaged so well it can withstand minor package damage.I removed the chair pieces from the box and inspected - unfortunately in a hurried manner. I did not see any damage.At the time I was tearing down boxes to take to the recycle center. So I took time to tear this packaging down so I could take it too.When I got home I started putting the chair together. This was extremely easy. No issues with hardware at all. Great!However, when I positioned the chair back to attach to the base, I saw what looked like the edge of the wood was splintered. In actuality, this piece of wood was cracked - likely damaged in transit. This damage is not visible unless you look for it. I also bought this chair to be used as my desk chair - I'll be the only one using it. I will repair this damage myself - wood glue and few clamps should take care of it.Quality of upholstery is fair. Seat cushion is very firm. I'm 5'6\" - chair works OK for me with a lumbar pillow. Without the lumbar pillow... I feel like \"Edith Ann\" sitting in a big person chair. The seat base is very large and deep. Be sure you check all measurements! For my intended purpose - matches beautifully in my office. A bit of a hassle... in the end, I'm happy with this chair.", 
    "We ordered two chairs. Each came separately, delivered over two days. I think the directions are misprinted, there are two sets of screws and the instructions are to put the longer screws in the feet and shorter ones on back of chair. We had diffculty screwing them in completely and spent hours unscrewing and rescrewing. Finally, we decided to switch out the screws and everything came together perfectly. The chairs look beautiful. They are wider than expected, two full sized people can sit together. We've recieved so many compliments on them. They are perfect accents to our chocolate brown sofa set. I only wish overstock carried the pillows of the same fabric, like shown in the picture. Overall, really well made strudy chairs."
