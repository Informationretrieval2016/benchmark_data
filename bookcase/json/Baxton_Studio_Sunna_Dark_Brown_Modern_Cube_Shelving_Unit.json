    "It took an hour to assemble but wasn't terribly difficult. The directions took longer to understand than the actual assembly. It's not hardwood but for the price it's a good piece", 
    "I received this, and it took me about 4 hours to construct. There were a few steps where pieces were not clearly defined, or pieces that did not have the correct alphabetical indicator on them (smudged off or missing). That being said, it turned out to be a nice piece. My only concern is it's a bit wobbly on my carpet. If I go up and touch it, it can sway very easily. I need to invest in some sort of brace bracket to connect it to the wall with.", 
    "Beautiful piece. It holds my books well and I can hide the clutter with bins.", 
    "took some effort to assemble, good price, and as always fast delivery", 
    "easy to assemble, looks great", 
    "my only criticism here is that no directions were sent with the unit. They are a very nice decoraing option", 
    "This unit is very poorly built. I did not get any instructions and had to get them from the manufacturer web site. The instructions are almost worthless. I worked with my hands my entire life and I am quite handy but this still took me 2 hours to put together. It is not stable at all when put together. It is just not worth the money or effort.", 
    "Fairly easy to assemble and looks great", 
    "I am satisfied with the completed shelving, however the instructions were difficult. One shelf was damaged but I will not take the time for returning. The product is good for the price. Shipping was as promised.", 
    "We use it as a dresser and it totally changed the look of the bedroom. Would recommend.", 
    "Perfect fit and style for my husband's office...it looks great too!!", 
    "Directions were somewhat ambiguous. However, this is a relatively sturdy shelf and its color is reflective of the picture.", 
    "Other reviews had me worried about the building of this unit.. I did it alone and it took me less than two hours.. great, steady unit. Totally recommended!", 
    "I read the reviews and thought I ca put anything together , how hard could this be !!! Nothing is marked and the small picture of random pieces dos NOT help.It has 100 pieces of screws ad wooden dowels.If I ever get this together it may be pretty ,It is hard to tell when the pieces are just laying on the floor.", 
    "Needs extra caution while assembling. Got chipped while inserting the studs,", 
    "veneer is a little delicate", 
    "I arranged individual miniature rooms in some of the boxes.Love it!", 
    "My cats like to climb on it and it serves the purpose of a photo album holder, I put it in front of my window, it is nice because you can see through it also. Happy with this product!", 
    "This piece looks great in my entry area. It took about 3 hours for one woman to put together. I laid out the pieces and worked from there. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I saw all the reviews about how difficult this piece was to put together and yes indeed it was the most trickiest piece of furniture I've ever assembled. That being said it has good weight to it and looks real nice. It was smaller than expected but overall very pleased with the piece.", 
    "Great shelving unit! Read all instructions before you even start- they can be confusing.", 
    "If you're looking or a good piece of quality furniture, this is not it! once you put this together which wasn't too bad it simply isn't sturdy and of good quality. Just not worth the money. I would have rather spent another 100 or more on something that is actually worth it. After I put this together I knew right away I wasted my money. If you wanna go cheap and quality isn't a big deal to you then go for it. however if quality is important to you then you will find yourself sorely disappointed in this product.", 
    "Unclear assembly instructions, poorly marked pieces. 6 hours to assemble by 3 pretty competent adults and we never did get the legs on because the holes were drilled in the wrong places and we were too frustrated at that point to care. However, looks decent from a distance and the price was was super low. I wasn't expecting anything of better quality.", 
    "Took awhile to put together, but other than that I love it.", 
    "When I opened the box, all the parts were loose inside. Some of the screws and other connectors were missing and what was there was scattered throughout the box.", 
    "I bought this shelf about a year ago and could not be happier with this purchase. I placed it behind my couch so it acts as a sofa table plus it helps divide the room from our entry way. I get several compliments from guests when they come over. Great purchase!", 
    "Loved it. Looks great in my living room only thing i would say is that it took some time to get put together like 3 hours because some of way the instructions were made.", 
    "I was really excited for this product because of its versatility. I was going to use it as a cool shoe display, but then the wood pieces didn't match up. There are 2 centimeter gaps between 3 of the cross sections of the shelves, and one shelf was too long. I took it apart 2 times to make sure that the letters of the pieces were correct, according to the diagram, and they were. It is unfortunate. I was really looking forward to it.", 
    "It fit great in the space I had selected and the assemble was easy.",
