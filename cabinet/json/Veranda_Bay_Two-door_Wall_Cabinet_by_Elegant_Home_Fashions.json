    "I have had a long ride with this cabinet. I love the styling. The first cabinet I was sent had the a top piece with holes drilled in the wrong places. I contacted Overstock via chat and a new top was ordered easily and with no problem. But I had paid for expedited shipping for the cabinet and now I had to wait for a top. O.com was very gracious and refunded ALL of my shipping charges. So, when the top arrived, my neighbor put the cabinet together for me and hung it up (I have tendinitis in my wrist). The doors were not lined up right. The next morning I hear a loud crash and I find that the cabinet split in half and half of the cabinet was on the wall and half was on the floor and all my things were all over the floor. My newly painted walls were all dinged up also. So, I contacted Overstock again and they said they would send me a new cabinet, but I had to send back the old one. That meant I had to take everything apart and box it up. They gave me a RMA# and Shipping Label. I got the new cabinet and I asked a different friend to put it together. Someone with more experience putting things together and who has a background in hardware. Again, the doors didn't line up, but my friend put some shims in to balance them out a little more. But again, the kit was missing one part. A minor one thank goodness. The pegs to hold the shelves. There were only enough for one shelf. I just got the ones (and plenty extras) today. But a BIG NEGATIVE was that the composite split in three places just screwing in the required screws. First bought 2/24...today 4/2", 
    "This cabinet was easy to assemble, and is trim enough to fit in my small bathroom without overwhelming it. It brightens the room with the bright white color and simple decorative details. However, the cabinets's clean lines and \"freshness\" can be lost once you begin to stock it. Since the glass is clear and not frosted, all of the contents are visible and can easily look messy behind the silver and white decorative elements on the doors. Because of this, the product is not as practical as I'd hoped. My advice is to think ahead about what you are going to put in it, and how that will change how it looks online (empty). This isn't a bad product, I just didn't have the foresight to think of the aesthetics vs the practicality before I bought it.", 
    "I am very pleased with the cabinets quality, style and appearance. It is not an ordinary piece of bathroom furniture. An exceptional value for such a solid piece. I love the glass with the extra detail. Really adds style to the bathroom. I was able to put it together in less than 20 minutes.", 
    "The cabinet is beautiful, looks great in my bathroom. One person put together in about 30 minutes. Looks great, a great buy.", 
    "I wanted a cabinet that had style to match our bath. The product fit the bill.", 
    "Beautiful! Looks great in my tiny bathroom. Great that it has 2 adjustable shelves", 
    "It's a very nice cabinet. The glass doors are actually much better looking in person. It took me about 20 minutes to put it together. It had an easy-to-use template for the holes to hang it, and it looks great. I like that it has 2 adjustable shelves. I fit so much bathroom clutter into it, my whole counter top is clear! For $70, you get a really nice piece.", 
    "A little smaller than I expected but very lovely.", 
    "This cabinet is so sturdy and roomy. I love it. Would recommend.", 
    "No strong odor...very functional .....very attractive as well. Very easy to assembly.", 
    "This is just lovely. Easy to put together and very nice quality for the cost.", 
    "This has been a great addition to a very small bathroom with no storage for bathroom extras!", 
    "Easy to assemble and hang. Cabinet is beautiful and looks much more expensive than it truely is. I frosted the doors with a kit from ***** to add more privacy. This is the one you are looking for!", 
    "Sturdy construction, very attractive, and great price.", 
    "Great product, just what we were looking for.", 
    "This wall cabinet is absolutely beautiful!! Well worth the price. Looks very elegant on the wall. Very well made too. I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Put this cabinet in the bathroom. It's very useful. Hold a lot of my bathroom essentials.", 
    "for the extra storage space needed in my bath. Just one issue the doors were hinged uneven but we adjusted them and they are now great.", 
    "was looking for a cabinet to go over toilet in half bath and this fit the space nicely. Shelves are narrow and do not hold much, but the look in the bath is nice. Follow directions and it will not fall apart - as others have alleged - and we added a bit of wood glue to be on safe side. Overall for the price we were pleased -", 
    "Bought this to add some storage to the master bath. Comes in handy for storing all the extra lotions and soaps I collect.", 
    "Have had this for about 3 years now and it has held up great. Very good quality and size. Great buy", 
    "Beautiful!!!! I get so many compliments on the cabinet...", 
    "Bought this for our powder room. Perfect size and looks great!", 
    "We use this for our spice cabinet. It is just right.", 
    "We put this cabinet behind the entry door to our bathroom, takes up just the right amount of space and works great...was easy to put together and hang on the wall with the template...like it very well!!!!!", 
    "Its looks so good on my wall, just the right size I just love the design. love it, love it, love it", 
    "This is an excellent cabinet for above the toilet in the bathroom! It stores extra toilet paper and/or other items commonly found in a bathroom. I wish now we had purchased two, before I purchased a different one elsewhere. Quality is great, and the look is classy!", 
    "I love the way it looks. unfortunately, its back a very flimsy cardboard-like thing so you can't drill through that to anchor it to the wall. It has a couple of things like picture hangers attached to the top piece..and it soooo fell off the wall while I was dusting the top. the metal pieces and hinges are rusting. great if you want to replace it every couple of years", 
    "This was a nice product for the money.", 
    "I had ordered this same item from another company and paid $80.00 more for it. When I saw it on overstock, I returned the one that I had purchased and ordered the one from Overstock. What a great deal......", 
    "I love this wall cabinet. Its perfect on my bathroom. The doors have a beautiful design which adds flare to my bathroom", 
    "This cabinet was everything that I expected. Very pleased with it!", 
    "Good size and design. Pleasant effect.", 
    "SO I BOUGHT A SECOND TO GO ONE THE OTHER END OF THE BATHROOM CABNETS. MY WIFE FULLED THE ONE WITH THINGS SHE HAD ON THE CONTER.", 
    "This cabinet is more attractive than shown in the photo and was easy to assemble.", 
    "Very happy with cabinet. Looks great hanging in my newly remodeled bathroom. I looked for weeks for a cabinet and came across this one, fantastic deal.", 
    "I hesitated momentarily after several negative reviews, but this piece turned out perfect. Assembly was easy, directions well written. The template to mount on the wall was something I never expected but worked fantastic! I would order another without any concerns.", 
    "It is a pretty looking medicine cabinet. Details are nice. It fits into small space which I needed for my small apartment. I love the look of the glass doors and the details on the door. My only complaint is that the glass is see through and once you fill in the shelves it looses it's clean look. But holding pretty towels and soaps makes a nice display! Good value for what you get!", 
    "Putting together the cabinet was a snap, instructions were easy and all the parts were clearly labeled. The only problem was in the packaging itself. The top of the cabinet had several scratches in it because the package containing all the screws had rubbed against the board. Since it was the top of the cabinet it was out of sight and didn't bother me. It might bother someone else. Installing the cabinet on the wall was very easy. The template provided was great, you just need to make sure it is level.", 
    "very nice wall cabinet sturdy stylish good quality i purchased for bathroom", 
    "This cabinet came to me damaged and I did not feel like packing it up and returning it. The wood was cracked in the back where you hang it on the wall. I have yet to hang it in the bathroom yet. But I am disappointed about the damage. Also the magnet to close the door was not there. My brother had to improvide and rigged it where it would close.", 
    "cute cabinet, looks good in my new bathroom. wish it was a little deeper but it will work for now till I find something else", 
    "We bought the cabinet for a newly remodeled guest bathroom. The cabinet required assembly and during the assembly the thin wood split and had to be repaired. There is a blemish on door. The cabinet hangs from 2 screws in drywall. It will not support a lot of weight. The design is pretty and I placed a few decorative items on the shelves. A guest can put a few personal items in the cabinet. It will be acceptable because it's in a guest bathroom that is seldom used. It would not be acceptable if this was intended for our master bath with everyday use.", 
    "piece of junk! would not recommend this product to anyone! cheaply made worst thing I've ever purchased! if I could return it I would. I was in the middle of remodeling my bathroom when I purchased this so I had to wait until the bathroom was done which was just last week before Thanksgiving. Boy was I disappointed when the cabinet was built. the wood split from putting the factory screws in! piece of junk!", 
    "i was a little hesitent because some of the reviews that i had reas said that the doors did not line up, but my son in law assembled it for me and they lined up perfectly. i am very happy with it and i feel the price was reasonable", 
    "I received this cabinet in about 2-3 days after ordered. It came in a well tight package nothing broken. I put it together all by myself in about 30 minutes and considering that I'm the kind of person that I need a GPS to go across the street, this was very easy.", 
    "This cabinet looks great in my bathroom over the toilet. I had a metal stand one that just looked so messy and dirty and not very sophisticated. So my husband and I bought this one. We found it at Home Depot for around $100 and love that Overstock's price is so much lower. You do have to put it together yourself, but it was fairly simple. It took my husband and I around 30 minutes or so to get it completed and hung. The doors do not line up correctly and so far that is the only negative thing I have seen about it.", 
    "This product arrived in a timely manner promised in excellent condition. It was easily assembled & attractive. We did not like the way it was to be attached to the wall. So we screwed it directly to the wall while also using the hooks that were included. It looks great with the brushed nickel decor in our newly remodeled small bathroom. We are very pleased with this product and would recommend it to a friend.", 
    "I was very dissapointed with this when it arrived. It's very flimsy and feels like it will fall apart. The back is made out of cardboard, and the doors don't fit very well. I bought it to store bathroom supplies and mounted it above my toilet. It's much smaller than I wanted. It is almost impossible to hang. Since the back it made out of cardboard you mount it to the wall by hnaging it on screws, but you can't see the screws. If the back were made of wood you would mount it by drilling through the back, then you could see what you were doing. The glass doors are very thin and fragile feeling. They have a sticker on them that says \"Tempered Glass\". One of the doors had the sticker on the decorative side so it was stuck under the decorative metal lines. I had to cut the sticker with an Exacto and pull it out from either side of the decorative metal. All in all this was a very disappointing purchase, I will never buy from Overstock again. I will probably take the cabinet down and try to get five dollars for it at a garage sale.", 
    "Be careful buying furniture any kinds. You never know until you see the product. Even you don't like it, it is very difficult to ship it back. The package is hard to open unless you brake it. Then, you have to find a right box to ship it back with your own cost. Because of that, I just kept it even though I was not satisfied with the product.", 
    "The shelf if very cute. matches the picture on site exactly. the quality of the product is a little flimsy but it does look good on the wall. the package arrived on time and there were no issues of missing parts so it is a good product for the money.", 
    "I was very happy with this cabinet. It arrived on time, and it was really packaged well to prevent damage or breaking. It also was very easy to put together, and was a great buy for what I paid for it. I would recommend this product to anyone looking at it.", 
    "This is a lovely cabinet. It is the perfect size to fit above the toilet. It was easy to assemble and hang. It is a good value for the price.", 
    "This is a beautiful addition to my guest bath. It was easy to install and looks great.", 
    "I was kind of reluctant ordering off line, but I am very pleased with this product. I would definitely recommend this cabinet. It goes great with our renovation to the kitchen.", 
    "I think Overstock is excellent to do business with. Thank you.", 
    "This cabinet arrived quickly and was easily assembled. It looks great in my updated bathroom!", 
    "Once the cabinet is put together, which took my husband & I to do & we are very handy, it looks okay. One of the doors does not line up. I put in a 1/2 bath and I think it looks a little too big. This cabinet is designed as a decorative unit, so do not expect to put extra towels in it. I do like the front design and the fixtures.", 
    "I bought this to put our bath towels in our new master bath. It is really nice, easy to put together, pieces all fit...however, it's not big enough for even regular size bath towels. I used it anyway to put hand towels, extra toilet tissue, and wash cloths in, so it still looks nice and is useful. For the price, you can't beat it!", 
    "Very happy with the purchase...exactly as described. Good quality.", 
    "I bought this cabinet to put in my newly remodeled guest bathroom, it was exactly what I was looking, small and not overpowering. Fits right over the toilet. I will be purchasing another to go in my bathroom. Glad I found it!", 
    "This is a cheap product. As soon as I looked at all the pieces, you could tell that the metal on the doors was jagged and chipped under the white finish. The laminate sides split as I was putting it together by hand (no power tool used at all) from the screw pressure. I could have bought a nicer cabinet from Target or Walmart than what I paid for this online. DO NOT waste your money on this one.", 
    "Needed the storage in my tiny bathroom -- this works well! Easy to assemble with great space inside. It holds a lot!!! I would get more if I had the space.", 
    "good product overall would of like a better back than the split back that was supplied", 
    "The best buy that we could find. Easy to assemble. Seems to be well made. We are pleased with our purchase.", 
    "We purchased this cabinet to hang on the wall over the toilet in our bathroom. It looks exactly as pictured and overall we are very pleased with it, especially for the price! There were some quality issues (some of the screws that came with it did not appear to be long enough to hold the weight securely when fastened to the wall). However, my husband just used longer screws and it is working great now. Doors close easily and stay closed - the etched glass front as an expensive-looking touch that is easy on the budget.", 
    "Easy to put together, one person. Very solid product. Was better then I expected.", 
    "really like cabinet it brightens up a dark bathroom.", 
    "This cabinet looks great up on the wall. I actually got it for an Esthetics room to store retail product in and it looks so nice and the function is great for what I wanted it for that I just ordered another one exactlly like it!", 
    "Looks and quality are outstanding - this is a real plus in our bathroom. Unlike many other products, the assembly was was very easy. I was impressed by the super-easy instructions and quality illustrations.", 
    "Once assembled, it seemed smaller than I expected but it is fine. It is quite heavy for such a small thing. Once we installed it in the power room, it looks great and it is just what we needed.", 
    "Love this cabinet. Adds a nice touch to the bathroom. Came well packaged and very easy to put together. The best is it has two adjustable shelves unlike other cabints that only have one, so it holds a lot of stuff.", 
    "I bought the Veranda Bay Linen Tower and the Veranda Bay 2DR Wall Cabinet for my under furnished bathroom. I was so surprised when it came in and was able to assemble both pieces in and hour and 20 minutes. My bathroom has very little storage so I needed to get something. Even when my little boy ran into it with his tricycle it did not scratch. This is one of the best values I have gotten for the money and it was way better than IKEA.", 
    "arrived within days of ordering and fairly easy to assemble. the \"look\" is gorgeous and it is fairly inexpensive.", 
    "Just what I needed for some extra storage space in the bathroom.", 
    "This is just what I ordered, and I had looked a number of places for such an item. We did a recent bath remodel and needed some storage for the wall that was also decorative-- this fit the bill perfectly", 
    "Looks pretty nice and there was plenty of room inside and it was a decent price", 
    "There is a defect spot on the right side door above the handle. It looks like wood chipped but painted over to cover the defect. Since it is located right in the front, the defect is very obvious. We decided not to return or exchange because we have siffered from previous experience - pay for a good amount of money to ship back the items which did not match the size we expected."
