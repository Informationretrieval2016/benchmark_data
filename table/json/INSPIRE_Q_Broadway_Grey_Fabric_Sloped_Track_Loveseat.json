    "This product is one of the only products I have returned to Overstock. It is only made for extremely light use, and the craftsmanship is less than desirable. I can see it being used for staging, but not for anything practical.", 
    "Love these couches however I have them in a sitting room that does not get much wear. I would not put these in a family room as they are small and not made sturdy enough for everyday wear and tear. Love the light grey color. I added pops of yellow, cream, and light tourquoise, which looks great.", 
    "I'm a big fan of firm sofas and beds. So I bought it despite reading negative reviews by others. However, this love seat still \"surprised\" me with its solid hard seat cushions. The fabric used is also on the cheaper side. Not worth it. But good for punishing your guests.", 
    "The design is nice but the sofa is primarily for staging. The fabric is really low quality.", 
    "Nice Loveseat but NOT real comfortable to sit on. Quality good but ASSEMBLY required and HAVE to have 2 people to put it together to get the product together but after done in my office and am pleased with ti.", 
    "It is a nice sofa, but too firm for me. I wanted something like this when I bought it - small and more modern, but the next time I purchase a loveseat I will look for something more comfy. It has springs in the seat cushions which I removed and stuffed with foam and poly filling - helped a lot on comfort.", 
    "I just received my sofa and the color is beautiful light grey. It is so simple to assemble....Good product for its price.", 
    "This loveseat is perfect for our small sitting room off our master bedroom. The color is good. We use this room occasionally in the late evening for tv watching. The seat cushions are very firm. It arrived in two boxes and was easily assembled. It's a good fit for our use.", 
    "I would recommend for a person who can recover when desired. This is what I intend to eventually do. The couch is used appropriately by my kids and after a month is already starting to show some wear. However, it looks fairly easy to recover when I am ready to do so. I have sewing skills and have recovered furniture before.", 
    "I purchased both love seat and couch for my family room. These couches were way to small and not comfortable for a family of 4. They were also very fragile. I think they would look good for decoration only."
