    "I am delighted with the quality of construction in these chairs. The hardwood frames are secured with corner blocks. The fabric is heavy as well as exactly the look of linen that I wanted. The padding in the seat and back of the chair is very comfortable. I was hoping when I bought these chairs that the quality would match their attractiveness and it does. I have seen chairs of much less quality priced higher than these. I am very pleased with this purchase because of the look, quality and price. They give my breakfast room a designer look!", 
    "Love, Love, Love these chairs, easy to put together and very comfortable.", 
    "I was skeptical about buying furniture online but when I received these chairs I was surprisingly pleased. They are great quality: the cushions are thick and substantial, the material is well made and the legs are solid. They were easy to assemble and look great in my room. I bought 4 chairs total, and my only complaint is that on 2 of them, the legs were uneven. It appears that one leg was longer than the others because when I removed the plastic round piece from the leg (part used to keep leg from scratching the floor) all four legs were then even. I was able to sand down the leg a little bit, place the plastic piece back on the leg and now they all sit great. I would recomment this product.", 
    "Love these chairs ,even nicer in person , thinking of buying 2 more", 
    "Love the chairs we were trying to match an existing antique table in a small dining room, they match perfect. The arm less chairs did the trick for our smaller room. The chairs look quite nice and are comfortable as well. Easy to put together. I would definitely recommend these chairs to others.", 
    "I've been looking for a chair for my new desk and this one fits the bill. It's the perfect size for me. We just put them together this weekend. The only problem with that was there was excess material in and around the screw holes and once that was cleared the process was straightforward. Upon opening the box when it first arrived I didn't see directions so I contacted Overstock. There customer service was very good in helping. Noble House, the distributor was fantastic. The rep stayed on the line while I printed out the directions and counted all the tools needed. Very impressive!! BTW, I found the directions that were packed in the box. They were at the bottom of the seat under the velcro cover. Interesting placement!", 
    "high quality chairs, great addition to our dining room", 
    "Nothing spectacular. Fabric is lose.", 
    "I love the print on these chairs. Colors are great. I don't think they would hold up to everyday use. I am just using them for staging our dining room so we can sell our house.", 
    "Overall decent buy. Great fashionable chairs, but not designed for everyday use.", 
    "Nice Dining room chairs. High quality and look great", 
    "I love these chairs. They were so easy to assemble and they are very sturdy for the price. The only complaint is they are a little uneven, but that could be my floor. I haven't really tried to do anything about it, but feel like you could!", 
    "Comfortable chairs! They were used in my dining area.", 
    "I bought these as the match a large ottoman I had. It seems to be a popular fabric and I 'm quite pleased with it as an addition to my living/dining room furniture", 
    "Very nice...looks great & feels comfortable. Just as the picture portrays it!", 
    "Love these chairs. They go so well with my round glass kitchen table and I have gotten many compliments about them. They are also very comfortable.", 
    "Easy to put together - comfy - looks great. Chairs a just a bit higher than expected.", 
    "I love these chairs!! They are comfy and they look great. Highly recommend!!", 
    "Chairs look great with our glass top kitchen table. Easy to assemble and comfortable to sit it.", 
    "These were exactly what I was looking for but when they came I was not in love. To me the fabric was slightly thin and allowed the inside parts of the chair to show through slightly.", 
    "Very pretty and sturdy dinning room chair. Looks nicer in person. Took a little time to put together but not bad.", 
    "chairs are not that sturdy and the overall cloth is loose on the chairs but they are pretty andbcompliment the French script decor", 
    "Although they were somewhat difficult to assemble, we like these for our small DR. Two of the chairs were missing the black cover on the underside of the seat, not a really critical item. Look great around our round/oval DR table and they pretty comfortable.", 
    "Love these chairs! Comfy & so sophisticated looking!", 
    "The fabric on these chairs is beautifully colored, very antique looking with out being yellow, it is a very nice beige with grayish black writing . The legs are more of a cherry reddish finish than a brown, so be aware of that. They are a bit light and a smaller seat than other dinning chairs I have/have seen, but if you are looking for this style, you can't beat two for the price.", 
    "The chairs were not difficult to assemble and everything needed was included. The style of the chairs is elegant. The fabric is excellent and the wood is nice. My only small criticism is the weight of the chair. It is light and would be nice if it were a little heavier. The chairs greatly improved the look of my dining room and I am thrilled I purchased them.", 
    "Perfect for my new dining room. Easy to assemble. Well done. And comfortable."
