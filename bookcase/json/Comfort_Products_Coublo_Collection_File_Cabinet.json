    "I needed to get my files sorted but didn't want a bulky item, nor did I want just a regular filing cabinet. I also wanted something with some cubby holes to replace my 6 cubby hole cabinet.This filing cabinet / cubby fit the bill. It looks more expensive than it is, and feels solid. It's a great deal for the price you pay. The only hard part of the whole assembly was getting the actual filing cabinet into the rails. Wish it slid in nicely like a traditional filing cabinet. But once I got that in, it was awesome.One note: if you have a LOT of files, this isn't for you. The filing area only has room for one row of files.", 
    "Nice looking filing cabinet for the price. Pretty well made and easy to put together. There is not a tremendous amount of room for files but I am happy with the purchase overall.", 
    "Absolutely love this!!! Was searching for a filing cabinet that didn't \"look like\" one!!! This was so perfect!!! Very easy to put together. A little smaller then I pictured it to be...but perfect for the space I wanted to put it in!!!", 
    "Nice fit with other furniture.", 
    "If pieces were numbered (only screws and hardware are identified) and the directions made clearer the assembly wouldn't be so challenging. I am working on it for 2 nights now ... just the drawer to complete. Otherwise the product looks fine... once it's together.", 
    "It was hard to put it together and I have to paint it because it looked better in the picture than up close. Overstock does a great job processing orders and getting them to you quick on a better note.", 
    "It was easy to put together & is durable & looks perfect for a small cabinet to use in home office.", 
    "product comes with very good instructions - easy to put together and works great", 
    "Easy to put together, sturdy, serves it purpose.", 
    "Really look at the dimensions as this is smaller than it looks in the picture - at least it was for me. Other than that it was great and looked really good vs having a metal cabinet.", 
    "attractive, functional, easy to put together albeit detailed.", 
    "Easily put together, packed well so there was no damage when arrived.", 
    "It suits my need for space saving and was fairly easy to assemble."
