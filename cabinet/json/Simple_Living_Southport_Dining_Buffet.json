    "It's just okay... it came fairly scratched up in places. The styrofoam packaging was a nightmare. I was constantly vacuuming as I opened it. I regret not buying real furniture for more money considering what I got.", 
    "Love, love, LOVE this buffet! I needed somethingthat would accommodate my big platters & thisworks beautifully. It took my husband a few hoursto put together, but it wasn't difficult. The only conto this would be the smell, it dissipates after a fewdays & it really isn't that strong, but it is noticeable.I would recommend this piece. Storage room is great& it has an adjustable shelf inside to handle my tallerpieces, such as compote dishes & 3-tier pastry ones.", 
    "Nice piece of furniture...packaging of hardware odd..each little bag of screws were labelled ..one set of pieces ( barrel nuts) were not there... Contacted both supplier and overstock who were very responsive. When we went to build the piece we in fact found the barrel nuts connected to the screws in an unmarked bag...odd ..so it delayed us a week but alls well that ends well.Think others wrote that the doors don't exactly align which is True but in our case is only a tiny bit off and is not visible to others as it's sort of tucked into a corner of our room.", 
    "Attractive piece but extremely hard to put together. Took hours.", 
    "The size was what I was looking for and the piece looks nice once assembled. Overall it is sturdy but does not seem like a long term piece of furniture. Door magnets are very weak so the doors do not stay shut. Shelf hanger pegs are too small (do not stick out very far) so the shelf can fall down if you are not careful when moving items around on it. Once I replace with stronger magnets and better shelf holders I will be happy with the piece for the price.", 
    "Stay away! I have bought furniture before at Overstock and am not expecting supreme quality of relatively cheap items, but with this one you don't even get the little you pay for.As other mentioned, assembly is a pain, but I have time and am patient and all worked fine (it is time consuming). The piece has multiple defects in paint, wood and coating on multiple parts. This is not damage of packing and transporting (it was extremely well packed) - it is just extremely low quality of materials and finish.", 
    "Love, Love it's sleek and beautiful.", 
    "This product isn't made of the best material but for the price it was a good buy. If you're looking for something to store stuff that doesn't get a lot of traffic, this is the cabinet for you!", 
    "I think that the Southport buffet is a very nice piece of furniture. I really appreciated the packing of hardware.", 
    "After reading all the reviews I was expecting something less. So much so that I began having buyers remorse immediately. When it arrived I opened the box outside because one review said it was messy...which it was. The pieces were much heavier than I expected. All pieces were marked including hardware which was individually wrapped and marked. Fairly easy to assemble with 2 people. It looks great and I'm really happy with this purchase. There were a couple places on the seams where a tiny bit of paint was missing but I'm crafty and touched it up with acrylics. A brown thin pen will do as well. I love it!", 
    "Love it, if I had more space would purchase another one.", 
    "This is a nice piece of furniture", 
    "This was used in my husband's office for additional storage. It is a substantial piece of furniture and it looks great! The open shelf is an ideal place for charging iPads and phones and it is nice to have covered shelves as well. It went together easily and looks just as it is pictured.", 
    "Love this piece, perfect for extra storage. It went together easily in about an hour with 3 people. Easy to follow directions", 
    "My husband and I absolutely love this cabinet and it looks beautiful in our dining room.", 
    "Although quite beautiful, sort of cheaply made.", 
    "I really like the buffet, plenty of room. We had to get a replacement top for it, it was scratched. The replacement part came within a week. Love it.", 
    "Overall all good quality and looks good once put together. It wasn't too difficult with 2 people doing it. Using it to store my toddlers toys in the living room and it has a lot of store space. Thankfully the door hinges seem like they will hold up to a toddler's abuse.", 
    "This was has plenty of storage for my grandmother's china, and matches our very dark brown dining set. It's not real wood, but the panel pattern makes it look nice. I didn't give it 5 stars because the surface acquired a big faded white mark. Either it came from a hot plate or water...I don't know. Either way, be careful with the top if you purchase it.", 
    "Love it glad I bought this", 
    "Made a coffee bar in my kitchen nuk..perfect!", 
    "I purchase. This for extra storage and is working just great for me and I love the color!", 
    "I love this item,It looks perfect and its just what i wanted!!!", 
    "This is a nice looking buffet for the price. Unfortunately the instructions and the pieces of wood are mislabeled. So review the instructions and look at the pictures and compare them to the actual pieces bc they labeled them wrong. Once you figure that out, it's pretty easy to put together, especially if two of you are working on it. The wood had a lot of little nicks here and there, nothing a Brown permanent marker won't fix.", 
    "Bought this to replace a dry sink I gave to my daughter. I use it for liquor and soft drink storage and it sits in a corner of my family room under a wine glass rack. It's your basic plastic over particleboard and a little iffy to assemble. I had to unassembled to correct fastener openings and then reassemble. The left door does not hang true and the magnetic catches at the top are not large enough to hold the door closed so I will have to add another magnetic catch to correct that issue. Because of construction problems, need to make sure all of the parts and openings line up BEFORE putting it together. It serves the purpose and the look is OK but I not think worth the price tag.", 
    "The buffet looks great! The wood is nice. The shipping was slower than advertised and it showed up with a few scratches (i'm sure we could have asked for a replacement) but overall quite nice and a great value.", 
    "The Southport Buffet arrived sooner than expected. It's a lovely and practical piece of furniture and fits perfectly in an alcove. We have our Tuner and CD player on the shelf, Woofer hidden in the unit! HOWEVER, there were some assembly issues with the holes not drilled in the right place. Yes, we did read the instructions, took it apart to look for errors, and put it together a second time. Luckily, my husband is handy and was able to drill new holes for new screws. In the end, it was worth the effort.",
