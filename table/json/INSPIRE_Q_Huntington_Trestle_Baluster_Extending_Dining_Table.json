    "We only took the top of this table out of the box and knew it was a \"No\". It looks like fake wood compiled and stamped by machine. I could have been okay with it without the fake wood grain molded into the top. It's really too bad because this is the exact style we wanted. I thought it looked like great wood in the picture, spend over **** on shipping costs back to the company to find out it isn't similar to the picture.", 
    "I ordered this table because I loved the style and thought it would fit perfect in our new home. I fell in love with a similar more expensive one that I saw in a local furniture store. I was kind of skeptical from ordering online but i'm soooo glad I did. Its everything I hoped it would be. Very sophisticated and rustic just like the one I saw in the store except Overstock had the better price. The table was well protected when it was delivered. It looks just like the picture and very solid wood (heavy/sturdy). I will definitely order again!!", 
    "Table looks nice but a little \"rough\". The top is not good for writing and has a rustic appearance. The dark color is good.", 
    "It is a beautiful table! The colors are exactly like the picture, and it is lovely. As Mich stated above, the space between the planks is sealed, but honestly that's what I was expecting, and it didn't upset me. I have children so having furniture that's easy to clean that doesn't actually have the ability for food to get stuck between the planks is perfect! It looks fabulous in my home. WORD TO THE WISE: this did NOT come with instructions. It's pretty simple to figure out, but instructions would have been nice!", 
    "Perfect size, and beautiful l love it", 
    "A little on the low side, but all in all its a beautiful table", 
    "Table is super sturdy, well made, very easy to assemble. When time to extend table it also is super easy to do.", 
    "I liked this table for our family who tends to be tough on tables. well made, ** look. I wish it came with another leaf though", 
    "We have not had it long, and barley used, but it scratches very easily. Looks pretty", 
    "I had never heard of rubberwood until this table. This table is heavy which is what I was looking for. The assemble took a few hours during to the instructions not being the best. However, the finished product is worth the effort and time.", 
    "This table is so nice we get compliments every time we have company. Love the extending leaf . Good quality I love all the texture to the table top", 
    "Color is exactly what I expected; heavy - heavy - table. Great value but nothing about this table is \"cheap\" looking or feeling. Very happy with my first large furniture purchase from O.co", 
    "This table is solid quality. Well made and easy to put together. Not a purchase you will regret.", 
    "Bad quality, bad style. Do not trust to the nice pics", 
    "Table was easy to put together took only 15mins, looks great! Very dark but easy to match chairs to. Does scratch kinda easy but just take a wax stick and it fills it right in. Love my table.", 
    "Is precisely what Donald Trump would say about this product. The INSPIRE Q series is not good quality. Having already had a problem with a sofa, we unwittingly also ordered this table at the same time. The table was delivered broken in the box. We returned the piece for a full refund.", 
    "I call the style of this dining table, French country. I've been looking for something like this for s very long time....would you believe 30 years? Well, I finally have it. And would you believe it's exactly the right color, too. It don't get any better than that."
