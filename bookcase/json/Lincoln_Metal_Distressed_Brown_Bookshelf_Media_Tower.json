    "I purchased this for my new apartment to house my huge collection of books, and I LOVE it - so much that I just purchased another to hold the rest of my books. The quality is pretty good for the price - a solid metal skeleton, all the same color as advertised, and though I'm not nuts about laminate wood, the shelves definitely fulfill their purpose.I only had two small issues with this product:1. After fully assembling, it was solid but slightly off-balance between one front and back leg. I purchased self-adhesive felt pads to even out the equilibrium and also keep the metal legs from scratching my wood floors. Highly recommended regardless.2. The assembly directions were a little vague and imprecise with regards to indicating which bars, which hold the shelves, should be placed in the back. Half the shelving bars (5 of 10 total) have additional, pre-drilled holes on one side; these should all be placed along the back of the bookshelf with the holes facing out horizontally, as they help connect the back metal bars. The instructions do not really indicate this at all, which is confusing and resulted in my having to unscrew and swap a number of bars multiple times.All in all, it's a great product with a nice industrial look that displays my books nicely and is durable to last a long time. I'm very happy in my purchase!", 
    "I think this is a really nice piece of furniture for the price. It's quite tall, make sure to go with the 3 shelf one if your furniture or ceiling are on the lower side.", 
    "great piece for the price", 
    "Looks fabulous in our bedroom!", 
    "Meets our organizational needs and adds esthetic. Much better than Walmart quality. One shelf had dent upon delivery but a new shelf was sent in its place. Can't complain and meets budget needs.", 
    "Great price, great color! Instructions could be better but overall very happy with the purchase. I got the whole set!!!!", 
    "Love these bookcases... They were deeper than I expected but that is not a bad thing. They look great paired with the TV stand as an entertainment center", 
    "Easy to install. Beautiful", 
    "I love this shelf! I will order another!", 
    "Love this bookshelf. Do not use it for books but small cd player, plants and baskets for gym items. Assembly was easy.", 
    "The finished product is very sturdy and stylish. Directions are short & sweet. You really need to look carefully at the associated diagrams before putting it together or else you may find the the holes don't line up correctly. If you organize the part ahead of time and look at how the part are aligned in the diagrams, you should be able to put it together in a couple of hours. Once you're done that, you'll have a finished product that you'll be very happy with.", 
    "Nice book shelf. It's sturdy and I like the color and design.", 
    "This shelf unit is very attractive and on trend. It looks far more expensive than it was.It is simple to put together... BUT!!!! because the instructions are not detailed enough, it took me longer than it should have because I put some of the pieces in the wrong places to begin with.Here is what you need to do: Pull out all of the 4's that have an additional hole on one side. There should be two of them. Put one 4 as the top back support with the extra hole (it does not go all the way through) to the right, if you are facing the back of the shelf unit. Put the other 4 that has that additional hole on one side, as the bottom self support in the back, with the additional hole (it also does not go all the way through) to the left of the unit, as you are facing the back of it.When you put together the zig zag looking back support, the holes will be exactly where they need to be for you to attach the back support bars. The regular 4's are installed with the through and through holes facing vertically so that you can put the screws in from the bottom of the support and screw them into the bottom of the shelves. Easy peasy!If you get those two odd 4's in the right places from the start, this will go together really fast for you!This unit is really nice and I'm looking around the house to see where I could use another. I like it a lot!", 
    "High quality, relatively easy to put together.", 
    "This was everything I wanted and more, excellent product for the money, looks beautiful in my living room.", 
    "handsome, generous shelf at an excellent price", 
    "They go really well with our existing bedroom furniture since they are exactly the same color. This blends in quiet nicely without dominating the room. Looks elegant. The assembly isn't hard but who ever wrote instructions lack common sense. It would have helpful to know the order and direction of the shelf since you need them in particular order to attach the steel rod on the back. I matched them before screwing them in.", 
    "Very sturdy and easy to assemble. Deep shelves good for record album collection.", 
    "This bookshelf was perfect for what I wanted in my newly renovated kitchen. I have put my recipe books and collectible pottery on it. It is sturdy and was easy to put together, we were done in an hour. Because of the support on the sides my books stay in place. (Not all the open concept shelving had this.)", 
    "Nice and sturdy. Instructions not very clear but with a little thinking you can get it done.", 
    "Love it so far. Pretty sturdy. Packaging is good.", 
    "This is exactly what I wanted to add a bit of a modern, industrial touch to my more traditional bedroom set. Easy to put together (although check box for all parts. I thought I was done and there were 3 more rods for the back). The color of the shelves is brownish-grey...could match with either color.", 
    "very sturdy, and the color is elegant! match well with my tv stand. easy to assemble", 
    "These are stunning bookshelves. They were a bit darker and a lot less distressed than we expected but they're still lovely! You would never know how inexpensive they are. They're incredibly sturdy and so simple to put together. It took less than an hour! Absolutely recommend these!", 
    "The shelf is very sturdy, a great addition for my bedroom and it has the look I was going for. It is a little confusing to put together and a bit bigger than I expected. I have the same bed in the picture but when I put the shelf next to the bed, it looks huge so I moved it to somewhere else. I think the smaller size would have been better.", 
    "This bookshelf immediately struck my eye as soon as I saw it online. The shipping was fast and it is exactly as pictured. I love the geometric pattern! I have an old house, and this was the perfect compliment with the grayish/brown colored shelves and iron accent. I am so happy with this piece as it adds more personality to our already character filled house!"
