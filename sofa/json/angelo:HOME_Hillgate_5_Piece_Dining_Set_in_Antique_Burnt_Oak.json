    "Delivery was quick and smooth. I love the design and color. It was what I was looking for - a farmhouse look combined with shabby chic. Unfortunately, the quality was disappointing. The finish on the chairs was rugged with many jagged edges - to the point where it would snag my knitwear and yoga pants. The seating is also very rough. The color on the chairs is inconsistent. Some part of it looks gray and other part looks honey brown (the wood's original color). Instead of of a shabby chic look, I only got shabbiness. The chairs look like I picked them out of some garbage bin.", 
    "I redid my whole house in a beach theme and this set nails it. It's great being an empty nester. The set was easy to put together (I did it alone in 30 minutes) and very high quality!", 
    "IN LOVE WITH THIS TABLE! Sturdy, easy to assemble, great color etc. Great purchase", 
    "to have found this set on Overstock when I did. I first thought it would be lightweight after reading some reviews about the chairs. I don't know how big and strong those reviewers are, but, believe me, these are sturdy and not lightweight chairs. I also was concerned I might have to strengthen the seats, but the cane effect is over wood. The table is so solid and heavy, I had the delivery man leave it in the dining area, top down, with protection,of course. No way could I, by myself, turn it upright after legs are on (can't even lift it without legs). No doubt this is going to last for years...and, the finish is so beautiful. Plus it was on sale, free delivery, no tax. This was amazing. I sell online vintage furniture I paint in the shabby cottage chic style. I know what it costs to ship, and you have to know, including shipping, you could NEVER have bought a set like this at the sale price. This is my second purchase (this time) and I just placed another order. The packing was superb, the delivery service very nice. I can't say enough good things about Overstock.Back in 2004, my first year of selling online, There was OVERSTOCK B2B. I sold Overstock items and Overstock shipped. NOW I KNOW why my customers were so happy with their purchases.", 
    "I can't imagine why there are a few people who rated this table set poorly. Its soooooo pretty! I am a VERY picky person about my furniture. I can't afford high end items so i shop on a budget, but refuse to own anything that looks \"cheap\" or that won't last. This table arrive in about a week, so fast! The chairs are very light weight with a beautiful weathered grey brown similar to driftwood. I live by the beach and my home is themed around this so this table is absolutely perfect! The table is very pretty. It's very heavy as well. Love the legs. Arrived in 3 boxes. Unpacked everything and had it set up in about 20 minutes. Nothing more than putting the legs on the table was required. Table is solid! The table has what feels like a wax like finish on the surface which is great for protecting the table. There is a chemically type smell from the new furniture but that went away after a few days. The only thing I would recommend are chair pads. Couldn't be more pleased with this table set.", 
    "I really liked this table when delivered. The only issue was there was a scrape on the corner removing the finish and top layer of wood. Overstock was great in sending us another table. this one arrived with the same issue, however. We didn't want to get a third table shipped (as it is a hassle to to be home for the delivery service) so overstock offered us a partial refund to keep the table. We really liked the table and chairs so we decided to take it.On another note, the 5 piece set was a very good price. The table by itself on overstock was $600, and the table with 6 chairs was about $1000. I like having the 4 chairs so we can put accent chairs on the end.", 
    "Soooo happy with this purchase. I love the distressed look with the unique detail of grey and brown. This table is perfectly sized, just perfect in every way. It's so shabby chic without looking old for some weird reason. The chairs are also beautiful but they feel very light so I would be careful sitting on them. One of the chairs came torn on the back seat which shows how delicate they are so perhaps go for stronger chairs. I highly recommend this dining set."
