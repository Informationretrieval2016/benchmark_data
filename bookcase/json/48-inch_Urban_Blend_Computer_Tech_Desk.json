    "I purchased this desk for my husband and he loves it. It fits nicely in a smaller space and the outlet port on the side is an added bonus.I would definitely recommend it!", 
    "Nice piece of furniture but 3 things didn't line up well. The drawer hinge lock that holds the front drawer panel to the side drawer panels is about 3/16th an inch off so the front panel does not line up with the side panels and so the front panel wiggles as you open the drawer. One of the bolts that secure the side frame to table top had a difficult time staying in - took couple of times to seed it. I could not get one bolt to secure the L shape bracket to the shelving uint - the hole was stripped. The entire unit took some time to put together - about 3 hours and one thing I said to myself is some of this could have been preassembled - there is a great deal of time using the screwdriver.", 
    "took over an hour to assemble. was being extra cautious about it, to not scratch the floor (not sure if it does but having metal legs, cant be too careful).its heavy. the wood itself is heavier than the metal parts of the table. and moving the package is definitely a 2 person job. i had to dissemble the box and carry each piece up the stairs one by one.the one extremely annoying thing about it is that it packs extra wood pieces in the boxing to, i assume, ensure a filled box so the pieces wont get banged around during delivery. But that adds even more weight and large pieces of useless wood to throw away.theres no off/on switch to the extra plugs and port. dont know if that would affect your electricity bill since you can't turn it off like a surge protector.overall im a fan of the desk. i only name those particular things because as most manufacture descriptions go, they never tell you about these details."
