    "I just finished putting this piece together. Unbelievable! It is so poorly made, the holes didn't line up so the drawer won't close as it hits the shelf. There is no way to fix it now as there are dowels which would mean I would have to drill new holes and basically take the whole thing apart.The drawer is so flimsy. The bottom is a thin piece of laminate that bows downward and I haven't even put anything in it! One of the cabinet doors does not have a hole to put the spring dowel in so I am without a door until I figure that one out. I order quite a bit of furniture on line and have never had this much trouble.I can't send it back. It was nearly completed before I knew the drawer and cabinet did not work as it is one of the last steps.Save yourself a headache and look elsewhere.", 
    "This kitchen stand is just what I was looking for. Getting the small ovens off of the kitchen counters! It was easy to put together in very little time. Rolls well with a good amount of weight in and on it.", 
    "This cart was EXACTLY what I have been looking for for over a year! The right size, color and has wheels. My honey put it together with only a couple of glitches due to NOT reading the instructions properly but it all came together perfectly. The value for the buck is awesome!Love this cart!", 
    "It was so easy to put it together I did it myself with out my husband help looks real good in my kitchen", 
    "It was a little challenging putting it together but once it was fininshed, I absolutely love it. It fits perfectly in my kitchen.", 
    "This isn't a high-end piece of furniture, but it's a good value--definitely worth the amount I paid.", 
    "Love it. It looks great in my kitchen", 
    "A good kitchen cabinet, but a bit difficult to put together. Not all holes are large enough nor aligned.", 
    "I have never put together a piece of furniture before, but I found this pretty easy to do. The directions on the drawer are confusing, but by the time you get to it, the only pieces remaining have to fit together. One piece of advice to a beginner is to sort your screws and label each batch. They look alike and all of them could fit any place on the cart. As to the cart, I like it. It is small, fits my space, modern in appearance, and looks nice in my kitchen. There is an adjustable shelf in the part with the doors. That isn't obvious from the picture.", 
    "Good product for the price.", 
    "This product is decent. Instructions could be better. The bottom of the drawer is the cheap cardboard backing that is also used on the back of the stand. This was the most disappointing feature. Considering you do the assembly with poor instructions and a cheap drawer bottom, the price should be more in the $** range.", 
    "Got the white cart and put it together in about 2 hours by myself. Pretty sturdy and size is nice. Not overly large, so it fits in smaller space.", 
    "Assembly is difficult as instructions are illustrations only and some of the nearly 200 screws, bolts and nails are mislabeled. There is an allen wrench provided, but plan on using your own tools, as both ends of it rounded off before the unit was even half assembled. The pre-bored holes in this particle board cabinet are easily stripped when attaching parts together with screws. I ended up using glue in addition to screws so everything would stay together. The final part was inserting the drawer which locked in the closed position and will not open. The only option to fix it would be to disassemble that part and fix it, but unfortunately, I glued it so it would stay together. My advice...Don't waste your money! ,", 
    "Pressed board materials. Arrived damnaged. Overstock refunded our $$ immediately but would not recommend product.", 
    "Be sure and follow directions, and you will have a very nice stand", 
    "Perfect fit and size for the kitchen!", 
    "This is perfect size and extra storage helps my space challenged kitchen for counter and cupboard space. Love it.", 
    "Perfect for my need. Went together easily and fits the space.", 
    "cheap wood - creap stand -", 
    "Feel parts were damaged but they are sending replacement parts and then it will be perfect makes a nice addition to my kitchen", 
    "it is what it is. Not very expensive and it looks and feels that way. Instructions were very hard to follow. Not very sturdy. Budget wise, it works, but not as functional as I was hoping.", 
    "While this is a nice addition there is a drawback. I spent hours trying to get the door runners right. And they still are not 100%. The directions are pictures only which are fairly easy to follow. However the pictures of the draw slides are so tiny and a little blurry it seemed no matter how I put them on they would not work and the draw does not shut all the way and now it wont open all the way. But the cherry color is great and the rest of the unit is very nice and sturdy.", 
    "It's good for the money. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Just what you think it would be", 
    "This microwave cart is exactly what was needed. Seems sturdy and I like that it has a drawer.", 
    "The hardware for the sliding drawer does not line up properly, so the drawer doesn't work the way it should. I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it, so I'm putting up with it. Decent for the price.", 
    "This was exactly what I needed. It was easy to put together and is really sturdy.", 
    "It fit perfect for small space kitchen. Was easy to put together.", 
    "This works really well for my kitchen and it was easy to put together", 
    "This is a great cart but you have to make sure to measure your microwave before you order it. It took about 4 hours to put together because we wanted to make sure we had no problems and all went well. Our microwave is too big to put inside, so we have it on top and we use the shelf area to store extra appliances. A great cart for having extra storage space.", 
    "Looks great, functions well for my needs, only complaint is you need 2 people to put it together and instructions are NOT good!!!", 
    "the best thing I did was get this item. very well made", 
    "Just the correct size for microwave and a Wolfgang puck oven. Stores extra needs in drawer and cabinent", 
    "Looks great and works great too!", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for!", 
    "had problem with drawer it does not close easy", 
    "I love the product......but it was slightly damaged", 
    "Made very well - not the cheap crap you usually get. Easy to put together too", 
    "I don't know how I did without it!", 
    "Quality product highly recommended", 
    "Ocupa el espacio adecuado y sencillo y pero bonito ,y facil de armar y a la fez fuerte.para almacenar lo que quieras estoy contents con mi products .", 
    "I would only recommend this cart for someone on a tight budget with a very small microwave. The materials are low quality, the instructions were sometimes vague, I could not get the drawer to properly close, and my microwave was way too big for the allotted space. The wheels broke off very early, perhaps because it does not hold much weight, so I took them off altogether. My other Overstock purchases have been much higher quality, better designed, and longer lasting.", 
    "a little difficult to assemble and one corner of the top shelf had a crack, did not return because of the weight. it is not in plain view.", 
    "Quality was questionable when I first took it out of the box, but once it was put together it was great.", 
    "Well made, excellent assemble instructions! Toaster oven fits in the bottom, microwave on top. Love the extra storage underneath.", 
    "It took three hours to put together. Pieces were missing. Instructions our horrible. You gonna want to cry putting it together. At the very end you find out there's a handle missing\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21. It's a cute cart but I would not buy it again.", 
    "Needs some assemb. job but after you done, you will be happy! Looks good and so useful! I bought it for my kitchen stuff first, then I moved and here is no space in my new kitchen so I put it in my master bathroom and use it as a storage for my hair accessories, make up. and deodorant/perfumes/lotion bottles.", 
    "serves it's function. arrived with one corner banged up but it's not too noticeable", 
    "Very nice stand, sturdy, and easy to assemble, took about an hr to assemble. Fit's a pretty big microwave and looks great. For some reason i thought it was bigger thou, but is exactly as described.", 
    "I like the cherry color and it fits where I needed it to fit", 
    "drawer sides were unusable had to make my own", 
    "Got the white, looks a little cheepish, but it does the trick.", 
    "Very confusing to put together especially when the hardware to put it together is open and spilled all over inside the box. Contacted the supplier and they assured me they had another package of the hardware and would send to me. Never received it and ended up spending more money at the hardware store to get what I needed. Never again will I buy something that has that many pieces to put together. I wish I had just sent the entire thing back.", 
    "It wasn't hard to put together and it looks just like the picture. Great buy!", 
    "Excellent addition for the kitchen", 
    "I bought this for my grandmother, her cart was falling apart. This was a reasonable price & great quality! Perfect size", 
    "This stand is very sturdy and has lots of storage space. Easy open drawer and cabinet doors are a great touch. Sits on wheels for easy moving. Highly recommended!", 
    "I love my cart and plan to get a table set soon.", 
    "I purchased this cart to replace my Mother's when hers was falling apart. I purchased the white one to match the kitchen. It went together well and didn't break the bank.", 
    "taking over a week for replacement parts", 
    "Chipped the doors as we were putting it together but it was so cheap we just left them off and use the bottom area for guests groceries in our beach condo.", 
    "Love my microwave Cart very elegant", 
    "It was everything i wanted I'm enjoying it every day.", 
    "i put this together in an hour while my boyfriend laid on the couch watching tv! Love this piece!", 
    "Just what I needed, fits microwave and toaster oven freeing up counter space. Nice size drawer and decent storage space.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Sturdy. Quality materials.", 
    "The microwave stand is beautiful and looks just like the picture. It's a great value once its assembled. There were a lot of pieces and it was difficult to determine which piece was what. Things were not CLEARLY identified and no words were in the instructions. I had to figure out which screws to use because the directions were wrong and I had a set of screws let over. I would NEVER buy this again if I had to assemble it. The drawer is nice to have but the quality is poor so very little can be stored in it. The purchase was a great value and it serves its purpose.", 
    "Had many busted parts and looked like a junk yard reject", 
    "Great Product. A little tricky to put together. It took almost all morning. I wish there were more detailed words rather than pictures. Other than that, it's a great sturdy product. It holds my microwave and toaster oven.", 
    "I received the box a few days after I placed the order. The box was super heavy. It took my husband over an hour to assemble. Very cheap material and the holes were too big for the screws. Would not recommend this cart.", 
    "Save yourself the headache!! not worth it..", 
    "Microwave cart arrived damaged. Overstock was great with the transaction but the microwave cart quality was very poor.", 
    "This product is beautiful and very well made, easy to put together, I bought as a gift to my daughter in law. They love it, and I would recommend it", 
    "Good one, i liked it very much, but struggled lot to assemble. Instructions are not that great and helpful.", 
    "This microwave cart is a great deal for the price. First off, while it takes awhile to put together, all the pieces are labeled and the instructions are pretty straightforward. I am not very handy and mine came together pretty easily and it is very sturdy. My microwave is .90 cubic ft and fits great in the cart. I am using the pullout drawer as a breadbox and it nicely fits a loaf of bread an bagels with room to spare. The top of the cart is a great place to keep your keys and is also sturdy enough to hold small appliances. Plus great storage in bottom of cart. You wont be sorry if you order this for your kitchen!", 
    "Given as gift, cracked top and veneer lifting. would not recomend", 
    "Very good buy I recommend it to anyone needing a cart.", 
    "this is a real nice looking Microwave stand, it's easy to put together.", 
    "This is not super expensive, so for the amount of money spent, it is a good deal. The assembly instructions are pretty poor, so it might take you a little longer to put together than expected. But once you've got it assembled I think you'll be happy.", 
    "Perfect fit for a small kitchen with no counter space. The only con is the drawer. It is not sturdy enough to put anything in it except things like potholders. I was able to put both my large toaster oven on top and my large microwave underneath. The cart is pretty enough that it makes it a pleasure to be inside my kitchen.", 
    "I ordered this for my mom. It came in many pieces but was really easy to put together. My mom loves this thing, she had it loaded up with kitchen stuff quickly.", 
    "This is what I expected for the price I paid. Basic paper veneer, but wanted it for temporary use. There was some damage to corners even though it was shipped reinforced. Not worth sending back.", 
    "Looks great in my kitchen. It was a good price for a stand with a drawer and storage below .Directions could be better.", 
    "The microwave cart was delivered very quickly. All the pieces to be assembled were in tacked The cart was easy to assembly. I have received very good comments on the quality of the product. I do recommend this product to those who love the look of quality.", 
    "The only problem with this product is the assembly,,the instruction manual provided with the product was not helpful,,,otherwise I love this it enhances the beauty of my kitchen,beautiful style,spacious and handsome"
