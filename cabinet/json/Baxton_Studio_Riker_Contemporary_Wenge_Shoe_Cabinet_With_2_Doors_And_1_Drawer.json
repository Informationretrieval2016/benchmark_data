    "Cabinet looks good. Wood finish a is a bit darker than the picture, but not too much. The front doors do not oppose very well (there is ~1 inch gap between the doors even when they are closed), but otherwise the cabinet looks good and performs well. The build quality is not that good though--similar to Ikea--but it is not cheaper than the price suggests.", 
    "The cabinet suits it's purpose. I'm not thrilled with the three white painted lines. Two people should put it together. There are many many steps. One mistake and you'll be very unhappy.", 
    "Great item, serves its purpose the only down fall are the legs. Legs are somewhat flimsy, made of plastic. I broke one while setting it up.", 
    "Quality looks superior in the picture. Pretty decent for the price. It looks fine on my bedroom hallway."
