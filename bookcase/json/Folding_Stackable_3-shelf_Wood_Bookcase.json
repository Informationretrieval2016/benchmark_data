    "Let's see - I needed a smaller profile wooden bookcase to fit an odd area between my desk and wall. Here's the perfect bookcase - it's made of solid, heavy wood, there's no assembly required, it's packaged perfectly, it looks super stylish, it holds plenty of tall oversize books, the price is right and it's the perfect size. The search is over - What are you waiting for?", 
    "I got two of these bookcases. The best feature is quick assembly and disassembly to move into another place. They are stylish and make my library look so nice. I get comments on them a lot. They support all the \"heavy\" engineering books my husband has and not sagging. So, I love them of course.", 
    "I bought this for the size and I was surprised by reviews that complained about how small it is. The size was clearly stated in the description so when I was looking for something small for a corner in a small bathroom this fit the bill. When I find somthing more like what I am really looking for this little bookcase will be recycled into what it is actually intended for. A small bookcase!", 
    "I needed the slelf for 3 ring binders and the height and width of these shelves worked perfect. They arrived and were simple to put together. No assembly, just unfold them and it is like they snap together. they work great.", 
    "While the shelf is a little pricey, its a very nice shelf that's simple to get set up and looks very nice.", 
    "I wanted a bookcase that was stable, narrow, and not made of pressed wood. I found one. I bought two, and placed one on top of the other. It fits in the narrow space I had available and sees as sturdy as one could expect. I did take the precaution of placing the heaviest books on the bottom shelf, but not at all sure it was necessary.", 
    "The color was very red which was also stated by others. I love that there was no assembly. I am using it for clothing storage.", 
    "The shelves arrived in good condition. The color is nice and they are easy to assemble. One of the shelves was attached upside down so I had to disassemble the unit and reattach the shelf the correct way. It wasn't difficult, but it did give me pause when I initially noticed it.", 
    "For solid support and portability, there is not another shelf system I could purchase. This family loves their books, so we take them with us, whether we are moving our rooms around, going to college or relocating. Even stacked to six shelves loaded, on a thick pile carpet!, this system does not fall over. They are worth every penny!", 
    "Was very pleased with this purchase. It was easy to assemble and is very sturdy. I would have given it a \"5\", except the Walnut color which I ordered turned out to be more of a mahogany (reddish) color.", 
    "This was my first purchase with Overstock and I was hesitant but so glad I took the plunge!..I wish I had chosen the Walnut instead as I prefer really dark but these are such a beautiful warm color they will blend in perfectly!..was totally surprised that they came so quickly...thank you!", 
    "Very easy to set up. Looks great. I bought two!", 
    "After myriad struggles with \"easy to assemble\" furniture (and one wine rack cabinet that a contractor put together upside down and backwards costing him the job and a total refund to us...) these bookshelves were the best thing I ever purchased. Mind you, we have not yet loaded them w books so will write back w thumbs up or thumbs down after we do. The wood molding at the floor makes them stand out a bit from the wall and since I have them stacked side by side and 2 high, I intend to cut some of the styrofoam packing boards into thin strips and secure them to the back of the uprights where they fit together.", 
    "Love these shelves. This is the third one I have purchased. So easy to put up.", 
    "Bought these before. Love them!", 
    "I love these book shelves. I had a space just big enough for tall narrow shelves and these worked perfectly. Easy to put together and they look great.", 
    "just the right size for my space, they look great, very easy to move and can be folded up and stored when not needed, Also loved that they did not require assembly.", 
    "I use this on top of my desk to hold files, etc and it helps with organization and looks good on top of the wood desk. Very stable.", 
    "This bookcase fits perfectly into a small space on the landing outside my bedroom. It's very well made AND I didn't have to put it together - YAY!", 
    "Easy to assemble. Looks great", 
    "These are the best ever. Sturdy, fits in small spaces and requires no tools. Just take out the box and it's ready to use. I'm going to get another to stack.", 
    "I have bought many of these shelves over the years. They are perfect for anybody with a nomadic lifestyle. Just fold them up and move. This was the only place I could find the smaller size so I ordered two .", 
    "I was looking for a slim bookcase to fit a small area. I bought 4 and stacked them two-high. They look very nice and work well. Nothing to put together, just remove packing (they are shipped well) and unfold.", 
    "Bought 2 of these book cases and love them. Easy set up, beautiful wood finish and holds a lot of books in little space!", 
    "These small bookcases are a great addition to my bedroom. I have two of them in the honey oak color. I placed one on each side of my dresser. They are sturdy enough to use all three levels for actual books! They require no assembly and look very stylish. I would recommend them.", 
    "Purchased 3, opened the first box and there were scratches on it and one of the shelves wouldn't set correctly because of manufacturing issue, opened the 2nd box and found one of the support/hinges was not installed properly. Never opened the 3rd box, sent them all back. I thought it would be the prefect fit for a child's bedroom and I was ok with that they wouldn't be \"high quality\" but couldn't bring myself to pay for them when they looked used and clearly weren't manufactured very well. Wondered what else I would discover once I went to put things on them.", 
    "Super easy assembly. Sturdy. Doesn't take up much space", 
    "Fits in the small space I wanted. Looks very nice.", 
    "Nice color match with existing furniture, and easy to use.", 
    "We have four of these and love them. We have a small house and the thin size is great for a small spot for books!", 
    "These stackable bookcases are of sturdy wood and look sturdy and solid, not cheap. Or flimsy. I bought 2 to stack and they look like one unit once put together.They are very easy to assemble requiring almost no assembly. Only one fault: the company provides small knobs ro put in screw holes for a finished lok. The knobs do not fit so they are useless unless uou have tools to file them down to fit, manufacturer take note! Otherwise, an excellent buy", 
    "We were very pleased with the quality of the shelves and the style is great.", 
    "Easy to assemble, sturdy construction, real wood!A little smaller than the photo. But the measurements are correct.", 
    "We found the perfect place for it,we had a very big desk all beaten up so we replaced it with a smaller one and I needed something to handle all my paper work and it fit right.Very happy with all my purchases from Overstock", 
    "Love it. I needed a small bookcase to hold my child's DVDs and CDs to put next to the stereo and this fits the bill exactly. And I love that there's absolutely no assembly required. Just take it out of the box and unfold! And, it is quite sturdy on our wood floor. Looks good too--I like the wide array of color finishes.", 
    "No assembly required! These smart looking, simple, folding bookcases stack without hardware and are easy to move and rearrange. They are an excellent value for the money. With overstock's free shipping - you can't beat them!", 
    "Solid wood, and basically no assembly required. Be sure to measure, as these are smaller than they appear.", 
    "I wanted a narrow book case that I could store when not in use and would look well with surrounding furniture. This fits the bill perfectly for DVD's, books and games in the family room. It would also work well in my office for books I want to keep handy. I can easily recommend it.", 
    "It is a very nice piece of furniture. The fact that it's simply foldable and requires no assembly is great. the quality seems great so far. I am using it as a shelving unit for my kitchen. The color ( I got the honey oak one), however, is certainly brighter than it is shown in the pic, it has a reddish kind of tone to it. Still works for me.", 
    "We needed just a small shelf for my son's room. There wasn't much space for it and this has worked out great. It is sturdy and yet foldable, so it will also be perfect for him to take to his dorm room when he goes off to college next year. And it's stackable. We can add on if he needs even more space in his dorm room.", 
    "Easy to assemble; Sturdy; Looks great. I will definitely consider buying more of these.", 
    "This little bookcase has style, quality and easy set up. It arrived as promised. I am very pleased with this purchase. If you've checked other websites you know that this is a \"deal\".", 
    "SOOO easy to set up! Presto and you have a book case hat is ready for those reference books or whatever. The small size is perfect to install next to your desk or bedside..", 
    "This is a well built bookshelf that is of high quality and design. I have two stacked and they compliment the corner of a room with a literary elegance that hits the cerebral aesthetic spot. As there is zero assembly, it is a breeze to install and Overstock did a marvellous job of packing these for a safe shipment.", 
    "I wanted a bookcase that I didn't have to build. This bookcase arrived in perfect condition. I liked them so much I have bought three more.", 
    "The bookcase is exactly what I was looking for as it fits in small space to hold essential books and electronic components. I wanted the wood to look appealing and built to last. The bookcase strong does not wobble and is assembled very well. The color is a more red than I was expecting but I am happy with my purchase. Thank you Overstock....", 
    "I love things that can be put together is seconds and look like they took a long time. lol These are nice sturdy selves for the price. They look more expensive than they were", 
    "This beautidul and compact folding stackable wood bookcase is just perfect. Easy to use and takes no space. It is just what I was looking for and it looks great. This is very convenience if you are looking for something that won't take a lot of space. I love it and I would recommend it to all my friends and more.", 
    "Not a bad product, not great either. Yes, it folds, but it's pretty small anyway that I cannot see the need to fold t up.It's practically the same size folded. Just be aware of it's small size, and that it won't hold much. Also, the wood had a few nicks right out of the box.", 
    "Bookcase fit perfectly into the space for which it was purchased, not excessively sturdy, but will handle moderate daily use. Spaces between shelves are generous, surprising amount of width space. Arrived as promised and easily folded out for use.", 
    "I wish I had gotten this years ago. I was looking for a shelf that would fit in a narrow space, so I got two of these and stacked them. Perfect. It's a great looking shelf, made of nice solid wood. Fits oversized books nicely. I have read reviews of similar folding shelves that were difficult to put together, but there was absolutely no assembly required. I have a feeling that I will be getting more of these, perhaps in a different color, for my bedroom.", 
    "This book case is perfect in color and size for where I have placed it.", 
    "I have owned two sets (27.5\" wide, pine finish, stacked) for over 19 years and they've held up well, through my college years and into my kids' youth. I ordered two more sets (27.5\") for my other son to stack in his room, as well as two sets of 14\" wide ones (for his closet). I was skeptical based on poor quality reviews I found here (and other web sites) but trusted my instincts based on my 19-year ownership and I'm glad I was right. The walnut finish was nice and even, the hardware lined up (for folding the shelves down), and I\u0092m pleased to find out that the units now come with wood plugs to cover the screw holes. Nice touch. I had slight difficulty when stacking the units for the first time, as though the holes were blocked with varnish, but once I pushed them together (hard) they were fine from then out. Products were shipped in boxes not much bigger than the shelves themselves nestled in formed styrofoam. There wasn\u0092t any box damage done in shipping but I was nervous as to the condition of the shelves (I also bought 2 sets of the 27.5\u0094 wide ones, they were packed/shipped the same way), but all four sets were fine and not damaged. They shipped pretty quick, too. These are fantastic shelves that will last a long, long time. They\u0092ve held everything over the years (the 19-year-old ones) from folded clothing, trophies, toys, displays, books, stereos (that just dated me, didn\u0092t it?), and much more. The 14\u0094 wide ones are great to sneak in extra organization in small closets. I would highly recommend these shelves from Overstock.com", 
    "Exactly what I needed. Very attractive wood, three large shelves (hold about 15 paperbacks with height to spare). Easy to put together. Only thing I don't like are the black nubs on top where you can put an additional bookcase, but they aren't too noticeable.", 
    "These are so cute in my daughter's college apartment. They will fold up for her move home and they will easily fit under her bed for out of the way storage when not needed.", 
    "A good purchase. Looks attractive and came PRE-ASSEMBLED! Bonus! No screws to deal with, yay. My only beef is that I was expecting a true Walnut color, when the actual color is more reddish and lighter - like a rich cherry or Mahogany color. Still nice looking, but doesn't match my other Mahogany furnishings. The outside of the box said Walnut, so I do think I got what was intended to be Walnut color. I think the Mahogany version is even redder and lighter, looking at the photos. A good investment that will hold a decent amount of books or whatever, and will last a long time. Overall pleased.", 
    "This bookshelf was easy to put up, its nice and will be easy to move.", 
    "Perfect fit for a small collection of books in my small apartment bedroom.", 
    "I liked the bookcase, so I ordered a second one to stack. The first had some scratches so it was price adjusted. I had problems making the two attached.Kept them, placed a wedge on front to make sure it would not fall forward", 
    "Waiting for a new one as the size and color is perfect for my area. I'm hoping it comes intact this time. Never had issues with overstock before.", 
    "I was a little disappointed in the walnut color not being as brown as I was expecting. There was no assembly required so I liked that about the product. It really holds a lot of books. I put 48 Reader's Digest Condensed Books on the shelves by having 2 rows of 8 on each shelf.", 
    "I had been looking for a small shelf unit for some of my collectibles for a long time and nothing I saw pleased me. A friend of mine said \"what about Overstock.com? When I said I had never used that site, she almost fell off her chair! I went on the site and wow - there was EXACTLY what I was looking for - size and color were perfect. Thanks!", 
    "Wish they came in BLACK or white also! THIS IS MY 2ND REVIEW What did you do with the 1st?", 
    "These are small, but so well made. I would recommend stacking them.", 
    "This is a really nice sturdy little set of 3 shelves. Easy to open up and set up with caps for the 6 screw holes to finish it off. Highly recommend for those small areas that need storage!", 
    "This shelving unit is perfect for small places. I wouldn't use it for storing more than one HEAVY reference book, but it can hold a standard Webster hardback dictionary and a few other books. There is still room for stacks of documents and random odds and ends. I would not recommend it for printers, toaster ovens, or other relatively fragile items. I really wish that there were a \"Very Good\" category. I don't think that the item is \"Excellent\", and my only option is \"Good\". My honest evaluation over all is \"Very Good\"!"
