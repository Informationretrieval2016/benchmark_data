    "This sofa is even more beautiful in real life-the fabric color is slightly darker than the pictures on the internet. Love it-my dog loves it also-chewed a corner of a cushion right away-still beautiful though!", 
    "what a wonderful buy!a - the cushions are hard so don't expect to sink in, but it keeps it in great shape after long time spent on it. b - the color is waaaayyy nicer than in the pic - grayish beige.c - the material feels good on the skin.d - the proportions of the sofa are perfect: gives a minimal and stylish look.LOVE IT", 
    "The couch itself looks nice. However, it has very uncomfortable firm cushions. The delivery people scuffed the walls really bad and damaged my floors getting it upstairs. I actually offered to help them carry it (I am 110 pounds myself). Those guys may not make much, but they sure are not good at what they do.", 
    "Used this in an office waiting area and is perfect for the space.", 
    "I'm sure this sofa will be lovely. However, I have been having several issues since ordering. I was contacted last week and told my sofa will be delivered in Florida today between 9am-1pm. I took off from work since this item requires a signature. I just got a call from the delivery service after 12pm telling me the sofa was still in California. Overstock cant seem to figure out why and has not offered any ideas other than telling me to wait longer. I am a Club O Gold member and would love to have this item expedited!", 
    "I ordered this couch because I really liked the look of it and couldn't find anything like it in stores under $1000. I read other reviews, so I knew it wasn't as light as the picture portrays and that was a plus for me. The color is more of a warm gray which is perfect for my space. It arrived quickly and was a pretty easy process. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars though is that it's really not very comfortable. It's very firm almost like an outdoor sofa would feel. I don't sit on it much so that's ok, but if you're looking for a lounging sofa, this is not the one for you. I also took away a star because one of the pin tucks has already come loose on the middle cushion after only a month. I'm going to contact customer service and will update my review after getting an answer on that issue.", 
    "THE SOFA IS FINE AND STURDY...LOOKS GOOD. BUT THE FABRIC IS CHEAP. NO SURPRISE THERE...BUT DEFINITELY GOOD LOOKING.", 
    "I bought these to go with beige Rest Hardware chairs.... This couch is nothing close to beige.. some people say grey, some say green, some say blue... depending on the light.. NOT beige.. nothing like pictured on my computer screen and nothing like any beige I have ever seen. If I could submit a photo, I would show you the beige chairs (that are actually beige) in contrast to the couch. Like night and day. If you want beige, this is not for you. If you want mid-scale gray, go for it."
