    "so far this futon has been ok. It has been slept on for about the past week and been ok. I have 2 complaints:1) the directions were terrible. Missing entire pages so my husband and I had to guess at the end. 2) the directions say that the warranty is only good for up to 250 pounds which for a full size bed is not a lot.", 
    "the frame is a beautiful color and has held 4 people (2 adults and 2 children) without difficulty. the only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is bc I have difficulty changing the position from flat to couch. it is easier when I remove the 12\" futon mattress and/ or when I have 2 people (one on each side) to help.", 
    "This futon frame is nice looking as pictured on the website. It is made of real wood so it is not crazy heavy. The instructions are the most straightforward and clear of the futons my husband I have put together. It was a two person job and it took about two hours to put together. It has three settings: sitting, lounging and laying flat. Overall, we're really happy with the purchase. As far as durability goes, it seems study but only time will tell. Would definitely recommend to friends at this point.", 
    "I purchased a 10\" thick futon mattress for extra comfort, yet the weight of it pushes the frame out of the seated position. I have to keep the backrest of the frame against the wall for support when raised as a couch. This has marked up the freshly painted walls and its quite disappointing. If the frame were designed with a lock bar to keep it from sliding into the horizontal position it would be a great purchase. It may not need a lock bar with a light weight futon, yet a light weight futon may not be very comfortable for sitting or sleeping on.", 
    "I was looking everywhere for an all wood futon frame. We already had our own mattress from another futon that was metal and bent during a move. The frame arrived in 2 boxes... no big deal, just be aware they might arrive a few days apart. The boxes did look like they were drop kicked all the way here, which made me nervous, but everything inside was in perfect condition and all the pieces were there. The assembly instructions were pretty clear even though it wasn't the easiest thing I've put together... easier to put together with 2 people. The style is a little plain compared to some of the others I've seen, but this one seemed like the best value. Very happy with it!", 
    "Would have given 4 star of not for assembly instructions. The product itself is excellent quality but the assembly instructions were the worst I have ever experienced.", 
    "Great addition to my reading room", 
    "This futon looks really nice, however, the material is low-quality. Both of the arms came broken (Overstock sent replacements quickly - great customer service if you do have any issues). Every piece of wood had at least a small ding or scratch, and one of the screw holes was off-center, causing the screw to be crooked. I would rate the assembly as difficult (poor instructions, several hours required).It is incredibly difficult to change the position of the futon - it takes at least 2 people. Also, the arms are too low in the sitting position. It's not possible to lay across it as a couch without the pillows falling off.", 
    "I give the futon an A and the assembly instructions a B+. Though they were step by step with plenty of illustrations, they were a bit conflicting and a bit too small to show some detail; the parts included did not entirely match up with the instructions. They indicated a need for dowels to stabilize the structure. Parts did not include them; neither did the express shipped replacement parts. (Overstock customer service, though, is truly outstanding) So I made do with home made dowels. Other than that, it went together well. One step needed 2 people, the rest I easily managed. I suspect that reviewers that complained about the mechanism not working or holding position properly did not read or follow assembly directions. The futon is solid and attractive. It opens and closes properly, even with the very heavy mattress I am using. I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "It is what they offered. Easy to assemble and it looks really good in my apartment.", 
    "The frame was beautiful once we assembled it, and it wasn't too difficult to transform from couch to bed and vice versa. BUT....its been 2 years since I purchased it and the main beam split. Bummer it only lasted that long and now we need a new bed.....", 
    "Nice strong frame and looks great. I was able to put it together alone but I would recommend having a second person to help.", 
    "This futon frame was well built and goes very nicely in our game room.", 
    "We bought this to replace a very uncomfortable 10 year old metal futon that had been through 3 teens and was bent and falling apart. This was fairly easy to put together, which I did myself. It's sturdy and solid. We haven't put it in the sitting position yet just because our daughter decided to sleep on it every night since I put it together. It's the \"extra\" bed in her room.", 
    "This futon is lovely! Very nice wood and quality craftsmanship. I am so pleased.", 
    "It was a little confusing at first putting together the frame but once I figured it out it went okay. You will need two people at certain points assembling it. It's a great, sturdy frame and it goes up and down nicely."
