    "Just received my cabinet, but I cannot build it because the box included 2 Part B and no Part A. The pieces that were included are a nice dark brown color, and for a build it yourself unit it looks to be nice. Another minor complaint, each glass door has a sticker on it that says \"Tempered Glass\". It is not an easily removable sticker, one of mine was behind one of the grids on the windows, and both left very sticky residue when removed. Just little things, but each take time to fix. I was planning to have the cabinet hung within a few days for a party we are hosting, that won't happen now as I wait for a company response and shipping of my part. Also, the knobs are a Brushed Nickel finish, not clear as indicated in the description.", 
    "This was very easy to assemble (1 person) and coordinates beautifully with the oil rubbed bronze fixtures in the bathroom.", 
    "We were looking for an inexpensive but specific size, style and color bathroom wall cabinet. This was it. Agree with other reviewers that directions were a little off but my husband had a good idea of what was needed to assemble the given pieces into the illustrated final cabinet.", 
    "2 doors don't line up very well. it's set up doesn't allow you to screw/nail the cabinet to stud.", 
    "Easy to put together, looks nice. Downside is it came with metal knobs, not the advertised clear Crystal and they do not line up. Visually unattractive.", 
    "It's very pretty although however was in charge of QC missed the fact they gave us 2 left hinged doors, my husband had to re-drill holes to make it fit. Other than that it's very nice. I wish I would have gotten something with frosted glass now that I think of it because whatever you place in the cabinet will be pretty much visible by everyone. So you can't really throw your \"junk\" in there.", 
    "Cabinet doors did not line up so knobs are uneven.Fair quality materials, color was what I expected.I expected better quality for the money.", 
    "Once all in place the unit will level out. Perfect for a small bathroom, I love it.", 
    "I love it. I just wish it was a lighter color. I would recommend overstock to anyone."
