    "First off, the color of the recliner is not even close to the picture. The color in the advertised photo is much, much lighter then the actual color. The only way I can describe the real color is of a coffee with just a bit of cream or if you can see the online photo with the horse in the right lower corner, that brown is close to the real color. I'm sad that the color isn't more true to what I saw when I ordered. The chair is also very firm, but I'm sure it will become more comfortable with use. Love the style of the chair, just the color is not all that great.", 
    "I needed a comfy chair to sit in and read in the sunlight or watch TV. This is perfect. It's nothing fancy. Color is plain and blah. But it's comfortable and easily gussied up with a pillow or throw. I like it a lot. I didn't want to spend a lot of money and this is just right. I would recommend it as a useful little chair. Plan to need a nice pillow behind your back. And it's not high. My head is higher than the back of the chair. I couldn't sleep in it.", 
    "I like the fact that it has a simple design and is still able to recline. We have a small home but it fits right in and the price was just right!", 
    "After opening the shipment, I thought the color was much darker than I wanted. However, after assembling it (took less than 30 minutes and I did it myself), it looked much lighterThe chair is the perfect size and very comfortable.", 
    "Chair is small and great for me. I am 5'4\" and I love the size and comfort. It is firm but comfortable. Great chair for small spaces. I wish I had room for 2. Easy to clean up grandkids sticky fingers. I really like the neutral color.", 
    "This chair is perfect. My dad loves it.The color blends well with the existing furniture . Great buy for the price. will buy again", 
    "The chair arrived a day early. It was easy to assemble by myself. The color is darker than pictured. My family finds it comfortable. I hope it lasts many years.", 
    "Pleasantly surprised of the quality considering such an affordable price. Bought two of these for my sunroom and they are perfect. Color is more of a camel but very nice, leather very soft and comfortable!", 
    "Not as comfortable as I would like. Nicely made though.", 
    "Back flap sewn crooked. No support for head if you're not petite. Otherwise looks nice, material feels nice.", 
    "Nice quality chair for the price. Pretty comfortable but, on the small side. Perfect for my space.", 
    "Very nice chair easy assembly", 
    "We were looking for a smaller recliner and this one fit the bill. It looks nice and reclines quite far back. Easy to clean too.", 
    "The leather feels soft and smooth. Overall it's a pretty comfortable recliner. Only disappoint is the color is nothing like the picture. It's a caramel color rather than the beige pictured.", 
    "It's a small recliner fit well in a smaller room", 
    "I worried about ordering a chair online without sitting on it, and I should have trusted my judgment!! The back angle of this chair is HORRIBLE!", 
    "Bought 1/16. Recliner is super easy to assemble- took minutes! Fits nicely with clean lines and smaller scale. Only thing is picture makes it look cream colored. It is NOT. It really is more like a caramel. I almost returned it because I wanted it a bit lighter as the photo but it's a great chair so I kept it .", 
    "Chair is perfect size for our FL bedroom. Great reading chair that doesn't take up too much space.", 
    "Awesome , worth every penny!", 
    "Product came in just as expected within the time frame given. The chair looks better than the picture, It is a smaller recliner so smaller people find it more comfortable than taller, bigger people. I have two family members who are both over 6ft. so their legs hang off. With that being said they say the chair is comfy just not on their ankles. This chair was easy to assemble and makes a great addition to our living area. I am pleased with the purchase.", 
    "2 years ago I purchased 2 of these chairs in light beige fabric. I love the color however they were very difficult to clean. Spots would come out but a spot would be left from the liquid of the cleaner. These chairs are perfect in cleanliness. As reviewed previously they are darker than pictured. The chair is a perfect size to add to my family room. The seat cushion is hard but gets better with time. Certainly worth the money paid.", 
    "Ordered six for a waiting room, thinking they could get us by for few months but to my surprise they are well made and I think we are going to get much more time. We are not rushing to remodel anytime soon.", 
    "and looks like a club chair when sitting up. perfect combination.", 
    "very comfy and looks nice", 
    "My 95 year old dad loves his chair. He lives in a beautiful assisted living facility. His apartment is adequate and on the small side, so this chair fits the room perfectly. It is roomy enough for him and my little dog to lay by his side. He finds the chair extremely comfortable reclined or sitting up. We are both so pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Comfortable and fit a smaller space well", 
    "Very nice to have and very comfortable", 
    "I have bought a lot of the Christopher Knight furniture and really have been satisfied. This recliner was bought for my bedroom. It is small and so very comfortable to sit back and read or take a short nap. Not sure it would hold up under everyday prolonged use or children, but it suits my needs perfectly.", 
    "Purchased this for my mother who was wanting a small recliner for watching television. She really has enjoyed it and says it just perfect for her. She is 5'.5\" so this is made for a smaller person. Directions are simple and easy for assembly. A very nice chair for the money!"
