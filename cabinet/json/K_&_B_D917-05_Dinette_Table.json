    "Color: The glass is not clear - its got a black backing that is infused within it. There are no indicators or comments on the description to say that this table is black. Looking at the picture, it looks black but we thought it may be lighting or even perhaps mirror glass since everything we have received from Overstock has been misleading based on their lighting in pictures.Construction: Its a minimal set up and only took about 20 minutes which was nice. The problem is that the legs are off balance once the bolts are tightened (but not over tightened). The glass top sits on the plastic corner pieces on the end legs instead of sitting on the several suction cups that its supposed to. Because of it, the glass slides easily when you place your arms on it or anything on it. WHen you apply a little weight to the table, it sways back and forth and doesn't feel super sturdy.Shipping: I give this 5 stars. The package shows its 23 pounds but is much heavier than that (50 +). It had a double frame on the package that took forever to get off because it was well put together.",
