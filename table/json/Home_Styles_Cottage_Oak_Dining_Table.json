    "I love the table. It enhances my entire kitchen and looks so pretty! It has a look as if from Italy. Very nice finish.", 
    "Delivery was timely. Table was easy to put together. Color was way off. Table very sturdy. Would be awesome in Oak.", 
    "The most impressive thing about this table was the shipping. Overstock offered free standard shipping on this table and it arrived in 3 business days. That was indeed impressive. As for the table itself, it is an entirely adequate table. It's sturdy and attractive, and the price was very reasonable. I was concerned about damage during shipping, but there was absolutely none. The table was very well-packaged with plenty of styrofoam to cushion and protect. This table is not high end and it's not a showpiece, but for roughly $$$, you shouldn't expect it to be. It is absolutely a good value for the money. It only took about 30 mins. to assemble, and that was with my dog checking my work every few minutes and giving his approval. As others have noted, the color description isn't accurate. The stain is more of a Red Oak. It's still attractive, and I knew what to expect after reading several reviews, but it's worth mentioning again. We ordered this table to get us through the next few months because the table we wanted is on backorder until spring (not through Overstock), but I am completely satisfied with this table standing in until then. I absolutely recommend this table for anyone looking for a decent breakfast table or dining table at a reasonable price.", 
    "First I would like to start by saying that I really appreciate the customers who take the time to write reviews of their purchase, as this is what I strictly go by when making a purchase here. Why, because the pictures not only do not do the merchandise justice, but it seems that they are usually not very accurate. With that said: I love this table. It is better than the one pictured. The picture depicts an oak-looking table and that is what I was expecting. This is NOT an oak-looking table. It has a reddish stain and I love it. Looks dressier than the one pictured. Goes beautifully with my OS chairs. CONS: Did not come with assembly instructions and required some minor assembly. Arrived very well packed with no damage in 2 pkgs.", 
    "Been looking for a table for a while. Couldn't find one that was the right color. I needed, not exactly cherry but not at all \"yellowish\" like oak. After reading the reviews about the color of this table I decided to give it a try. It matched perfectly to my chairs. Easy to assemble - my 14 and 12 year old nephews put it together.", 
    "I have looked at hundreds of tables and this was just what I needed for my kitchen. The 42 inch is hard to find. I looked in furniture stores and on line and this is perfect.", 
    "I decided on this table after reading reviews from it saying the color was darker than pictured and I wanted a darker wood. The table is every easy to put together and sturdy construction. You can't bet the shipping and the speed of delivery, less than a week after I ordered it. The only thing I am not crazy about is the stain used on the wood is very uneven so the table has light and dark areas and will scratch easily.", 
    "This table arrived damaged, and when I called customer service, it was going to be a huge inconvenience to return it, so they offered to take money off. It's nothing special, and I don't know how long it will hold up.", 
    "It's darker which I like. The top is a bit grainy but it'll for now!", 
    "undelivered only one of two units in this order delivered received the bas badly scratched customer service is poor this company deals in Asian made product so the quality is not good", 
    "This is a real classic and classy table. it arrived in 2 boxed delivered right to my door. My friend put it together in 20 minutes or less. I do not agree with some of the other reviews about the color or quality of this table. The color is a rich cognac color. I does not feel or look cheep in my opinion. It is the perfect size for a small area. I wish I could include a picture so people who are really interested could get a real look at this table when it is set up. I think the best part of my purchase was that my table was delivered on a Tuesday and the next day I was showing a friend my great purchase from Overstock and my table was on sale for $XX.XX less than what I paid for it. Overstock gave me an in-store credit without any hassle. This is the kind of customer service I like! Thanks Overstock!!!", 
    "Very sturdy, and heavy table. pleased with product. Great delivery as usual with Overstock. I saw a similar table at another store for twice as much. very nice indeed.", 
    "Strong and beautiful table, I'm very glad with this.", 
    "It arrived promptly and was easy to assemble. But it's not oak and looks funny next to the oak slat back rustic chairs that I also bought on amazon. Still I did not return. Round table is essential with my wheelchair.", 
    "This table is very sturdy and was easy to assemble. As others stated it is very red. I thought the top looked terrible, hardly any grain unlike how oak should look. I ended up using 2 coats of Java Gel stain on it and painting the pedestal black. I paired it with Abigail dining chairs purchased from Overstock. Now it's gorgeous.", 
    "Love the look, size, and sturdiness!", 
    "I agree with other reviews about the color. It's not orangey at all. I placed this in my little banquet corner \"booth\" in my kitchen with black and white tile floors and medium dark brown cabinetry, and it looks great. It's very sturdy and has nice proportions. It is very easy to clean. I have two small children, so I wasn't looking to spend a lot of money or have a super ritzy peice to ruin :) It was easy to assemble myself. Just what I needed and the price was right. Thanks!", 
    "Very sturdy and good looking!", 
    "Exactly what I hoped for. Very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "It is just as advertised, nothing more.", 
    "ive bought this and i love it,its very sturdy.", 
    "I was originally going to purchase a similar pedestal dining table from Pottery Barn for almost three times the price. I was pleasantly surprised as to the quality and appearance of this table. Most importantly the delivery and customer service of Overstock far and away exceeds what you would get from Pottery Barn.", 
    "Near impossible get straps off to get material to put table together", 
    "very nice table at a good price", 
    "Love the smaller scale--fits into my breakfast nook perfectly. Solid wood, easy to adjust, level legs on tile floor. All in all it was perfectly perfect.", 
    "I've owned this table for several months. I use it in my eat in kitchen, but I think it could also function as formal dining table in a small space. It is beautiful, easy to assemble, very durable, as I have small children. Don't let the price deceive you. Though the table is not expensive it is a good buy .", 
    "The table is KO though it should be a little stronger but it is not solid oaks. That is why.", 
    "I have been looking at this table for going on two years. I finally got it, and am very happy with the quality. It arrived in very good packing.... too good, in fact. It tore my fingers up to try and remove the industrial staples/plastic straps from underneath the table. Hence, the four stars. They have been left in place, since no one can see them. I notified Overstock CS, who were excellent at getting back in touch with me, so hopefully this consumer problem will be fixed in the future. Still. a very nice table!!", 
    "The table is much enjoyed. Always lovers of the round table because of the convenience of inclusion of everyone at the table in conversation we are delighted with it. The color, size and the fact that it is one solid piece of wood on top. so Easy to keep looking nice too.", 
    "Easy to put together perfect size for our breakfast nook", 
    "I was disappointed because this table is not as it appears online. The color of the finish is not a medium oak color, instead, it is a darker more reddish oak finish. I hope Overstock will remove the stock photo from this table manufacturer and have them post one that is more accurate.", 
    "excellent value....sturdy and handsome", 
    "I had been looking for this table everywhere and everywhere I looked I had to wait to get it except at Overstock! I got my table and it's awesome. Just the perfect size for my kitchen.", 
    "We have been using this table for a year and have been really happy with it. We use it in our kitchen nook on a plush shag rug and it is very sturdy and stable. Hubby said it was easy assembly. It has maintained a nice finish and I like that it doesn't collect dust as easily as my last table.", 
    "Looks great. The only problem with the assemby, was the packing staples, embedded in underside of table.", 
    "This table is fine. It is sturdy and heavy. Looks like it will last a long time. The color doesn't match any of my other furniture and they didn't send enough washers to put it together. Guess that is what you get for the price.", 
    "Great value for the money. I generally like more class, but after all it was only $208. Would have liked it better if it was a little larger, but that had nothing to do with the company. Arrived promptly in perfect condition. Trustworthy company.", 
    "The table is nice,I only wish that is was a little larger.", 
    "great serves our purpose as expected", 
    "I would return this if it didn't require so much effort to dissassemble and ship back.The color is not oak. It has a pink tinge and the finish looks very cheap. The thickness of the finish is negligible and I expect the top will be ruined quickly if we don't buy clear finish and re- coat the table surface.The unit arrived with veneer peeling off the sides of the table top ( and area about the size of a nickel) with a few other marred areas around the sideI only gave it two stars because it feels sturdy, doesn't wobble and was not expensive.If you want an oak color table, and you are not prepared to refinish yourself- look elsewhere.", 
    "Good looking table even though it came with small damage but overstock Customer Care resolved the situation which was beneficial to both.", 
    "Quality table with nice style. Plenty of room for seating 4 - could seat tightly up to 6 people. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "Excellent quality. Well made and heavy.", 
    "Solid table! Very nice. Great price too.", 
    "i received my table today and it is perfect...the color is darker like the other reviews have said but it looks better than the picture in my opinion. Putting it together was a breeze had it done in 15 minutes. Great buy for what you get and the price is perfect. Very nice looking table glad i ordered it...", 
    "The price was very good for this table. I love the color on the wood. It is very easy to assemble.", 
    "This is a good table for 2 people. I wanted a table for 3 people and it is a little on the small side for that but we are making it work. It matched chairs I already had so it is a good purchase for me. All in all a nice table.", 
    "This little table is cute. I got it for my parent's breakfast area. I wish it was a little more sturdy. My dad has to lean on it a lot to get up and down. Probably great for young people. It gets off balance and wobbles and I have to adjust it. It is cute and the price was great.", 
    "I would want a credit if we have to fix it ourselves.", 
    "This table is really gorgeous. It's solid wood (although the base is hollow), and the color has a slight cherry color to it as opposed to regular light oak color. We have an eat-in kitchen and this table fits and matches our cabinets perfectly. It's really heavy and sturdy, was easy to assemble. This table is an incredible value and great quality. We absolutely love it.", 
    "The table is a nice color, the top has a smooth finish and overall it is nicely made. We are using it as a game & puzzle table in the loft. The color matches teak chairs and furniture also in this area.", 
    "Description should say \"oak style\", It is not made of oak wood which maybe confusing to some.", 
    "Solid piece. Good quality. Happy with it for the price paid", 
    "very good quality for the price I always wanted a pedestal table but did not want to spend 600.", 
    "This table arrived in just a few days and was easy to assemble.. A great find.", 
    "Perfect table, just what we needed. Easy to put together and solid as a rock. Table is attractive and blended with wood floors.", 
    "This table is wonderful and Just right for two. It is beautiful in every way and everyone thinks it was very expensive when it was not at all. It is solid and heavy and is perfect as a morning tea table, reading or drawing spot, or supper for two. It took two inexperienced assemblers approx 20 min to put together. As others have mentioned the underside of the table has big staples in it - these were a pain to try and remove so we left them! You never see them and while using the table they never interfere with your legs or clothing at all as they are very recessed so no problem at all. The table arrived quickly well packed and without flaws. We are very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it!", 
    "Solid wood and very well made. They even gave me the tools to use to put it together. It was also very well packed and even though it arrived with the box torn and dented, the inside was perfect. I expected it to be damaged, but it was packed so well it didn't touch the table. Very happy!", 
    "Really good quality, rock solid!", 
    "I own a bed and breakfast and think these are a real deal. Well made, pretty and very reasonably priced. If I had room I would buy more.", 
    "This table is seriously beautiful, it has a great color to it and the assembly is really no problem if you've done DIY type things before.", 
    "Well built table, could come a little better packaged to keep shipper from damaging the would in shipping. We had a small damage on ours around the edge of the table. We did not notice until after we got the table together. I blame the packaging for the damage because the shipper does the best they can. The box could have used more packing in it. The table has good instructions and they even give you an extra bolt, washers and nut. A small disposable wrench is provided as well. A somewhat well though out package.", 
    "Unfortunately I did not read the reviews and went by the picture. The right picture for the color is by doing a search on \"Coaster Brannan\". Also Overstock return policy is not good - they will charge for these returns and also they are charging me separately for the two separate boxes that this item comes in. Disappointed by the whole experience and the time wasted.", 
    "loved this and easy to put together", 
    "Yes this is a cute table, however the top is pressed board, and I believe the bottom is oak. I thought I would down size the kitchen table since there is now just the two of us, but honestly, it is very small. I think I am going to use it in an extra room for a craft table.", 
    "Very well made, solid, sturdy and good value. Just be aware that you should get a table pad for the top to keep it from getting damaged, but I'm very happy with my purchase.", 
    "easy to assemble and very nice. BUT I am still angry at how parts and padding was stapled using heavy duty industrial materials to the underside of the table. It took me 3 hours to pull them out, I ruined 2 screwdrivers and destroyed my hands in the process. Totally unnecessary packing!!", 
    "I was very pleased to find this item, and it fits into my small dining area perfectly. I was surprised to find that the base was solid oak, but the top is oak color veneer and not solid oak per description. Gloria", 
    "The table comes fast, it's sturdy and good looking. However, I do have one complaint. The color is off quite a bit from the picture it shows. The picture shows brownish yellow but the real table is a deep pumpkin yellow color, it's almost off yellow, but red.", 
    "Great value for the price", 
    "I am very pleased with this farm table. Looks great in my dining room which is small. Nice value for the money. Easy to assemble. Well-packed. No damage. I ordered a glass table top from Amazon to protect it. I also ordered 4 ladder back oak chairs to complement it. Looks very cute. The photo is very representative of the table's appearance. Love it!", 
    "grain lines strait - look fake - like a processed mdf -", 
    "I like the table. It is sturdy and I was able to easily put it together as a 60 \"something\" woman. It was quite a bit darker than showed in the photo. I'd call the color \"cherry\" and not \"oak.\" I wanted the oak to match chairs that I already own. Fortunately, my cabinets are cherry, so it goes OK in the room.", 
    "Nice table, fast shipping", 
    "Very nice table. Sturdy. The only thing is, it is not oak as described. It is a beautiful wood and looks great.", 
    "You'll find this table easy to assemble and very well packed to avoid any chance of shipping damage. I love the finish and attractive wood grain. For those wondering about the color, it's medium red oak. You enjoy excellent quality at a very attractive price.", 
    "Very beautiful, sturdy, and well made. Perfect size for a small kitchen.", 
    "This is a beautiful, solid wood table, in a size that is hard to find (42\" round). It came carefully packed, and my husband put it together in under an hour. There was a small dent on one edge, looks like maybe a staple gun or hammer could have glanced off the edge during packing? But it was easily fixed with a little wood putty. It is stable, and beautiful in front of our fireplace. Other reviewers noted a difference in color from the picture on the website; I would say it is a little darker and a bit more toward a red oak look (but not dark), we think it's beautiful. A great purchase.", 
    "This table is just what I was looking for. It is great for two or three people, not too large but large enough for a kitchen area.", 
    "I had a flood recently and had to have my floors refinished so I decided to upgrade my dining room table. I found this on Overstock and thought it would work out just fine. I don't have a huge area so the round table works just fine.", 
    "Nice table. Easy to put together. Be aware - it is red, not brown!! Should have listened to the other reviewers. Does not match the chairs I have but a tablecloth looks nice over it and will protect the surface.", 
    "I needed a table to match chairs I already had. This table was a nice match.", 
    "This table is very good easy to put together and I have order more of them.", 
    "table was just like the picture very nice I would give it a very goo recommendation.", 
    "I ordered this item to use a small conference table in my office and it is perfect. Quality is excellent and assembly is very simple. The oak stain matches well with other oak furniture. Shipping was fast as well. I highly recommend the table.", 
    "I really wanted to give this table a better rating. It looks great, assembled without a hitch, and it is heavy and sturdy. But be warned: the surface is simply clear coated and needs to be protected. After the first week of light use there are already light scratches. We noticed a ring from a glass which looks like an actual indentation though no glass was ever banged on the table or even set down hard. Tonight my husband used a folded up paper towel to use as a coaster; evidently there was something sticky under it because when he picked up the paper towel it pulled a spot of finish right off, color and all! But with that said, it is still a good value for the money. I would recommend it to a friend but with a stern warning to top it with a piece of glass right away, or at least use a tablecloth. It's pretty to look at but without added protection it will get dinged up in a hurry.", 
    "we bought this over a year ago, it is still just as sturdy and strong, we still love it, the only thing is the finish is a little uneven, not top quality. But we are happy,worth the price we gave and it will be a good table for a long time. Yes I would recommend this to anyone, it looks great in my eat in country kitchen.", 
    "The table was nice and good looking. The wood quality wasn't too shabby either. In fact, after we assembled it, we liked it a lot. Unfortunately, there was a black stain about the size of a quarter (coin) right on the table surface. It was not soil and no way to be removed or cleaned. We were sorry that we had to return it after we did all the work! Although, overstock's customer service had been very helpful.", 
    "The table is well build but I'm not happy with the top of the table because of the dull finish. Does not look like the picture.", 
    "Nice size table, easy to assemble and sturdy. Fits nicely in my smallish kitchen.", 
    "the table is what i expect and was here on time, so easy to put together i am so happy with my table", 
    "I hate this table. I mean I really hate it. It is so ugly and I am not lying. The top of it I imagined would look like some sort of wood grain as does the base... however it is a solid ugly orange color with no grain and so ugly that I will spray paint before even putting it out for a garage sale. Yes, I should have returned it. I was so dang proud of putting it together that I really didn't see the top until it was done... so yeah. Another thing is that it's super dinky. I thought a really small diameter would be perfect for our small space but I realized that we couldn't even have anyone over for dinner. My husband looks like he's eating off a TV tray when he sits at it. I am now looking for a trestle table that will fit my space. Good luck to me.", 
    "This a nicely constructed wood pedestal table. It was exactly what we were looking for. We found like tables locally for around $500. So this was a bargain. Delivery was very fast and table was delivered in two boxes damage free. Home Styles does a very nice job of packaging their furniture for the rigors of shipping. The table was very easy to put together. The only con comment I have is to agree with other reviewers that the table top has more of a light reddish cherry color to it versus a browner oak color. It does not distract but is not the browner color you would think oak color would be. We also purchased the matching cottage oak dining chairs.", 
    "The picture looks like a beautiful oak table with pretty wood grain. When I got the table, it looks cherry, not oak. There is no woodgrain showing on the top, looks like they stained a piece of plywood. My oak chairs do not match at all. Very disappointed.", 
    "Round table will suite any where in my home and we can dine for all occasions for small family. We can sit any direction we want, and this table looks very sturdy compare our old ones. I expect the table will last for many years. the best extra for me is the leg of the table so I can rest my foot as I wish. Good design and good built!", 
    "We bought this table for our condo in Florida. We needed something smaller as we don't have much room. The table is very heavy duty and seems like it will last a long time.", 
    "My husband and I have put together a multitude of \"assembly required\" furniture over the years, and this is by far the best quality and easiest to assemble, great instructions, extra screws, very well packed, fast shipping etc. We have opted to put a tempered glass top on this as will get lots of everyday use and with glass top is easier to clean. Very pleased with this purchase, and I feel that even if you are an amateur this would be easy to put together. Another Overstock.com success story, thanks.", 
    "This is a beautiful solid wood table. It looks even better in person. It shipped really fast and was easy to put together. I'm very pleased with my purchase!", 
    "I wanted a table that could seat a group of people without fighting the usual four legs. This table fits the bill exactly as I wanted. I also ordered the Rustic Oak Chairs and they complement the table very well. I'm extremely please with my purchase.", 
    "it was delivered on time it was put to gether easelly", 
    "I purchased this table for daily use. I am fully pleased with the looks of it and the ease to put it together. Great table!", 
    "The construction quality was very good and the table is very good and it is sturdy. I on't particularly like the surface of the table because of the rubber wood. The size was perfect for our breakfast room. We solved the surface appearance by putting a table cloth on it.", 
    "Color is more cherry than depicted, which other reviewers have commented on.. The pedestal base looks good, but the top is obviously veneer and did not quite have the look I wanted.", 
    "It arrived on time as product and package was very well packed. All the hardware was provided with the assembly tool needed and even one extra screw provided. We enjoy the table and would recommend this product to anyone.", 
    "product was very well build and was very easy to assemble. it was what we were looking for and fits perfectjly in our breakfast nook.", 
    "I bought 4 chairs one day and decided the \"card\" table I was going to use for our temporary apartment life was not really going to do. The day after I ordered the chairs, I ordered this table. The size was exactly what I was looking for. I couldn't find anything close in the furniture stores and didn't want to spend a lot of money. The table is very nice and sturdy. I like the pedestal look. The finish is a bit darker than I expected. I thought it would be more of a natural oak color but it seems more between an oak and a cherry finish to me. It is still very nice and matches perfectly with the damask gold and red fabric chairs that arrived all on the same day. This was easy to order and put together and Ii am very pleased with it. I will definitely trust Overstock.com in the future!!", 
    "I ordered an Oak table which came in a box that said Oak. The table base and legs are oak, but the table top is CHERRY. It is too heavy to return and I am very disappointed overall with the quality.", 
    "For the money, this was a great purchase for me. It fits great in my kitchen where I needed a smaller table and it blends very nice with the oak chairs I had. I also loved the free shipping. It came in just a few days as promised. The box was damaged but we checked it over right away and it was packed very well so there wasn't any damage or missing parts. I would not hesitate to purchase another item from Overstock.Com. This was my first purchase and am totally satified.", 
    "It is a nice table at a moderate price. Veneer top, probably won't wear well, so I put a glass top over it. Definitely not a high grade dining room table, more of an informal dining area table. Color is darker than oak. Nice appearance, attractive look, especially with glass top allowing wood grain to show. Good poker table or game table. Good, not great quality.", 
    "The table is solid with leveling adjusters on each leg which is an excellent feature. the only problem is that the color is not a \"country Oak\" it is more of a \"reddish\" oak", 
    "Perfect color, size and workmanship. I did not find the table I wanted at other stores.Quite happy with Overstock.", 
    "I am very pleased with the quality of this table for our dinette. It is just big enough for 4 to dine, attractive finish and our antique oak chairs match nicely. I did not want a 48\" table which would have been another dining room table near our rectangular formal table. I was so happy to find an attractive, wood table, 42\" in diameter that fits our space and desired use perfectly. I love it! Easy to assemble, also. Easy to clean.", 
    "Love it, very easy to assemble, beautiful color and finish... Lilttle smaller than what I thought it would be but ok to the area I bought it for", 
    "I bought this table to use with some antique chairs I found. I wish it was more of an oak color, but it is a sturdy table and works well in my kitchen."
