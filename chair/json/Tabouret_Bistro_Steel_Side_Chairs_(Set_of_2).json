    "These chairs look beautiful, as you know if you are here reading this review! They are a copy of a very popular french cafe chair that is priced much higher and are really a very good knock-off. Let it be known though that they are only 13 inches wide in the seat. Check the dimensions of a baby high chair seat or a youth junior chair and you will discover that many or most are wider. So, even though these chairs are a LOVE AFFAIR, they are NARROWER by far than any other chair I have ever experienced. We are pretty small- average here and they are certainly a squeeze. Do-able, but a squeeze if you want to sit back in the chair at all, vs the tip where it is at it's widest (under 14 inches). Do not buy these chairs if you want a comfortable seat for an average adult. Don't even consider for a larger adult- and don't kid yourself. If you have slender kids, (my skinny 14 yr old son is built like a string bean and wears \"slims\") can sit in them comfortably but he touches the sides. FYI there is a very expensive and hip company out there that is selling this chair in a wider version called Remy that is considerably wider and at the second lowest price on the internet on sale now- company name begins with R and the second word begins with H. The original french chair also comes in a wider version but I think only with arms. So, do your homework. I love these chairs (look) and ordered 2 in the shiny white. I was hoping to try them out before ordering 6 more and I'm glad (and a little sad) that I did. We are keeping these 2 for our kids. I considered getting moire for other kids, but honestly I don't want my guests to feel embarrassed if they can not fit. So, these stay and we are supplementing with an eclectic mix of other white chairs and may just order the wider ones I mentioned that are a little larger. Too bad I like this shiny white finish and the look the best!", 
    "I built my own table using pipe and plywood like you see on Pinterest. The table is rugged and I needed some chairs to go with that industrial style and these were exactly what I was looking for. Similar chairs on Joss and Main were $$$ for a pair. I found them on another site and they were $$$EACH. These were $$$ for the pair. I figured they must be different but as I continued to search online I found that these were slightly larger than some on other sites and when I got them in the mail they were so well made that I knew I had really come across a great deal. I bought 6 of them and I have never been happier with an online purchase.", 
    "I love that there were finally armless tabouret chairs that could push in all the way to the table! They look great, are comfortable, and will clean easily with 3 small kids. A couple of my 6 had paint scratched off in small spots from shipping, but Overstock's great customer service took care of it in one, quick call.", 
    "I am so pleased with my chairs! I only wish I had ordered 2 more sets before they sold out. Crossing my fingers that they will come back soon! They are small chairs, perfect for my space. And they are surprisingly comfortable. I love them. Please bring them back Overstock.com!", 
    "The chairs arrived packed very well, no damage. The chairs are solidly built, but light weight at the same time. The chairs are also sturdy, and do not wobble. My family was worried about comfort, but they are quite comfortable. I replaced wood spindle back chairs for the vintage color Tabouret chairs, and they look great with our light/medium color wood table. My kitchen looks more open with these chairs, as they are a bit lower than my other chairs, and more open on the seat back. I am hoping to buy additional chairs when the vintage color is back in stock. Very pleased with the Tabouret chairs.", 
    "Not much to say. Product came within a week and was exactly what they advertised, packaged well and no issues wtih the product or delivery.", 
    "I normally always read reviews before purchasing items online and for some reason i didn't read the reviews on these until after I ordered them. I was very worried that they were going to be too small. I'm 5'8\" and my husband is 6'0\" and neither of us could be described as dainty, maybe just average. I'm happy to let you know, they are not too small and our bums fit in them just fine. They are smaller in general than an average chair but I certainly didn't feel like I was sitting in a small chair. They're fabulous for small spaces. We ordered them in white and they are so beautiful.", 
    "These look fantastic with my farm table and are more comfortable than I expected. They do have a small seat so check the measurements before ordering. The vintage color is amazing, I couldn't be happier.", 
    "I ordered a set of silver and they look just like the picture. They are as comfortable as can be expected from a metal chair. They are narrow, so for me, it is possible to fit more around the table than I had 1st imagined. They are too small to add any type of seating pillow. I'm ordering more!", 
    "The chairs are awesome, they stack, they have protected feet on the legs, and they look great in my office.. I bought the black and they look great with my other black office chairs.", 
    "Lightweight but strong. Perfect for our kitchen. Adds a little modernity. Arrived quickly in excellent condition.", 
    "I am absolutely in love with these chairs!! I am a petite build (5'1) and my husband is 6'4. We both fit in these chairs perfectly! He's never complained about them not being comfortable or roomy enough. My kids (18, 16 and 9) love them too! They are easy to wipe down, durable and very stylish! I bought the white color and it is a creamy white... and matches well in my kitchen. I would buy these chairs again in a heartbeat!", 
    "Perfect fit to our mismatch French country dining set!", 
    "These chairs are really nice. We were worried they would be flimsy or wobble, but they are great actually. I would recommend.", 
    "They take up little space, are well made, stylish and comfortable.", 
    "I'm very happy with these. Some of the better Tolix look type chairs I have seen. The little holes on the seat add character to it and make it look more expensive.", 
    "Perfect for large family with limited space . we love it.", 
    "Actually very comfortable. They look great! Very happy with this purchase. Haven't had any complaints of this item yet. All I've gotten is compliments!", 
    "I got the vintage finish. It's a matte finish with some distressing \u0096 mostly what looks like a little bit of grinding here and there, but nothing too over the top. I like that they're not glossy or shiny. I'd call the color something in the warm gray leaning toward bronze family. They look great with my distressed recovered wood dining table. They seem well built and sturdy. The seat isn't that wide, but works just fine for me. I've sat on them for an extended period of time working on the computer and they're obviously not cushy, but not uncomfortable. I've thought about adding a chair pad, but if I never get around to it they'll still be fine. They are a little lower than my previous dining chairs (which had an upholstered, padded seat), but still are an acceptable height. Overall: very pleased.", 
    "Loved, loved loved the look of this rustic set of chairs, so I knew I had to have it. Worked great for a month or two, awesome fast shipping thanks to Overstock. But after about 2 weeks of use, the legs started bending! Now my husband and I are on the heavier side, but we didn't think the metal welded chairs would be a problem!So heavy set fellers beware, but great design on the item nontheless.", 
    "These chairs are exactly as pictured. They are high style for an amazing price. I got the chairs in white, and I love that they stack for storage and I'm not worried about them being damaged by children or getting dinged up. They are a little smaller than your average chair, so just be aware of that. I have a tiny home so that's perfect for me, but someone with a larger kitchen/dining area might want something a little more substantial.", 
    "My idea was to create a dinette set in the kitchen using a vintage table and these chairs. The black painted finish is flawless and works well with the nearby stainless appliances with their many black details, and the style fits our eclectic decor. The tabouret chairs arrived quickly and were packed extremely well in a large carton.Their light weight means I can move them easily to the dining room if needed, or out onto the patio for summer parties. The hard metal wears on the bum a bit, so I am adding some vintage braided chair pads to extend the \"seat time.\" A very large person might find the seat too small.", 
    "I've been searching for the perfect chairs for our dining room for over a year. The chairs needed to be kid-friendly (stable, durable, double as stools/ladders/forts) but also look nice with our wood farm table. We narrowed it down to the Tabouret bistro, the fake Eames molded chairs with wire base, and the fake Emeco navy chairs (all from Overstock). We first purchased the Eames version. They were beautiful but they were horribly unstable (the kids would lean on the front of the chair to sit and the chair would tip over) so we returned them. We waited for quite awhile before trying again; this time we purchased the Tabouret Bistro. Upon arrival I knew we found our chairs. They are weighty and unbelievably sturdy. The kids can stand on them, move them around the house, and do other non-seating activities on them (like kids do) and they've yet to tip. Extra plus: they stack -- so I can easily get the chairs out of my way to clean the floor. They are also extremely easy to clean. We even have the white and they are easily wiped clean. If you are searching for the perfect kid-friendly yet still aesthetically pleasing chair, these are the ones!", 
    "Sturdy, stackable and stylish. However I had to return them because they were too small for my rustic dining table. The back is short and the seat not wide enough. I am tall and slender . I felt like I was sitting in a chair made for children.", 
    "The chairs arrived very quickly. I ordered 8, and there was only 1 little nick in the finish on one. There's no assembly, which is FABULOUS. But a tremendous amount of packaging material was used, so I have A LOT of stuff to haul to the recycling center. While the chairs do look just like the picture, be aware the finish is very FLAT. Not at all a shiny stainless steel look, but rather a flat brushed nickel appearance.", 
    "Chairs come all assembled and ready to go ... feel sturdy and great :)", 
    "Works wonderfully with my industrial dinning table. Looks great too.", 
    "Functional dining chairs. Easy to clean and great for kids.", 
    "Bought these for my dinning table and they look great! Very sturdy and well made. Easy to clean too.", 
    "Love that you can find these here... All the stores locally sell for 2 and 3x!", 
    "Got these in the white and they are perfect. Not too large just perfect for what I needed. Comfortable.", 
    "These chair are very well made, sturdy. They are super kid-friendly which is what I was going for.", 
    "I got these chairs for my sons room one for his desk and one for extra seating. They are a little smaller than regular chairs i fit fine in them but my 10 year old fits perfect.", 
    "Love these chairs! The price is good and they seem very sturdy. Came packaged well.", 
    "Got them in white and I'm totally loving them. Totally stylish for my little breakfast room.", 
    "very nice with our barn board table-exactly what I wanted. Good service prompt delivery", 
    "Absolutely love these chairs!", 
    "Love these chairs. Just what I wanted", 
    "they look wonderful and they are comfortable", 
    "Looks great and easy to clean. Good durable quality!", 
    "These chairs were better than I expected for the price. The vintage color is amazing and the chairs look great in our home. I only gave them 4 stars because they are a little small but I was aware of that when purchasing.", 
    "Loved these chairs. Exactly as pictured online. Seem to hold up well and sturdy.", 
    "Great value for the front lanai", 
    "These chairs are nice! They are solid, comfy and no assembly required!! Great purchase :)", 
    "great quality and much cheaper than similar chairs of the same quality", 
    "I purchased these chairs over two years ago and still love them! I have two girls and we use these every day. They are still as sturdy as when new and the finish is extremely durable. They also fit your back nicely, unlike some of the more barrel shaped ones that hit against my backbone. I very highly recommend these and am very happy with mine!", 
    "We really enjoy these chairs around our breakfast table. They withstand the toughness of our kids, but are a fun style for our home as well.", 
    "We bought these chairs for our dining room table. They matched beautifully as we've got sort of a modern, industrial look to our table. However, we ended up returning these because, like other reviewers, we felt the seat was too small. We are not big people, but didn't want our guests to feel uncomfortable. (They're already sitting on a metal seat!) We ended up buying similar chairs at a different retailer whose seats are a few inches bigger. I believe the seat height on them is taller as well.", 
    "We ordered these to go with our farmhouse table that we just refinished to go with our newly updated kitchen. My husband agreed to let me get them, but he was not really thrilled. He was expecting them to be very uncomfortable, and he didn't \"get\" why I *needed* these chairs. We got 8 chairs in the vintage color. They go perfectly in our space, both style and color. I LOVE them even more than I thought i would, and despite my husband's doubts, he loves them, too! They are very sturdy and really comfortable to sit in. I am thrilled with our purchase.", 
    "The finish is true to the pictures and looks great in an urban rustic space! Great chairs.", 
    "I love these chairs! They are sturdy, functional and super cute.", 
    "Very disappointed in these chairs. Very small seat and the back leans to far back, so much that you tend to slide down while sitting. Sent back. Overstock however was amazing to work with. Very easy return policy and very happy with customer service!", 
    "These chairs are perfect for what I was looking for. Small but seem sturdy and are great extra chairs for use inside or on the porch.", 
    "Love these chairs! I purchased 4, and loved them so much, I purchased 2 more!", 
    "I purchased these chairs so that my grandchildren could sit at the table and I would not have to worry about my leather dining table chairs. These are great, the kid's booster seats fit nicely on them. They look great and are durable and sturdy. Thinking about purchasing 2 more!", 
    "Nice chairs. In have them in my home office and they are just the right size.", 
    "Function & style all in one. i have these at kitchen table and at office. Look great and are surprisingly comfortable. They easily wipe clean and are extremely sturdy.", 
    "great chairs, easy to clean with five kids", 
    "Happy with the chairs for the price. They are lower to the ground then seems typical for chairs, as other people mentioned.", 
    "These chairs were exactly as described. My daughter and her husband loves them!", 
    "These chairs are just right for a small home, comfortable for dining and easy to keep clean and look great in my eclectic decor", 
    "I bought two sets of 2 for a total of four chairs for my kitchen table. I ordered the antique finish which is more of a deeper brown with a metallic sheen. They go very well with our farm table. Smaller chairs so may not be comfortable for long hours of sitting but for an hour or less does the job well. Very sturdy quality, no scratches, no sharp edges. Love the look and for the price, getting way more than you're paying for.", 
    "They arrived really fast and they are very sturdy and modern. Love them! They quality is great for the price!!!", 
    "Ordered 8 vintage chairs. Order came right on the delivery date given to me. The cartons of 2 chairs each were sturdy and no defects found. I am enjoying the look of metal around my antique wood dining table. Yes, the chairs are on the smaller side as to seat width but the back chair rails do not interfere with sitting. I have place gripper chair pads on them(the Gripper Delightfill Chair Cushion Bahama-in seagreen color). Wow-the pads set the chairs off nicely and warm up the space. Fit perfectly. The chairs are able to be stacked easily. Cannot answer yet to how the finish wears but looking great in my home!", 
    "Absolutely love! we already have the marching bar stools and love them, so we decided to order the matching chairs. We have them in our dining room, and they look perfect with our reclaimed farmhouse table. We have gotten numerous compliments on them. They even have padding underneath, so that they aren't scratched when stacked. This was quite helpful when moving from one home to another.", 
    "These chairs are very nice quality and have a nice weight. They look very similar to some that I saw in a high end catalog for a fraction of the price.", 
    "The rails on the side dig into your hips. Sad because they are cute and priced well. I'm an averaged size gal, didn't fit me well.", 
    "Great chairs, true to color, very sturdy and \"kid-proof\"", 
    "These are really nice chairs. Substantial and comfortable and - best of all - stackable.", 
    "I purchased 6 of these chairs to go with a recently refurbished farm style dining room table. I went with the vintage finish and was pleasantly surprised once i got them out of the box. There were a couple minor scratches on some of the frames but nothing too bad that wouldn't blend in with the natural imperfections of the finish. The chairs are incredibly comfortable and sturdy, even for my 200+ pound relatives, something I wasn't too sure of when I purchased. A side note for those who are thinking of purchasing, the chair height is slightly lower than that of a standard dining chair, not an issue for me and my farm style table but something to think about given the height of the table you will be pairing these with. Lastly the fact that these are also stack-able chairs was just icing on the cake for me, makes cleaning the floors a breeze. Highly recommend!", 
    "These arrived quickly, are sturdy, a good size and are very good quality.", 
    "bought for outdoor table, after I received them I saw they are not meant for outside and are rusting, otherwise well made and slightly small scale but cute around the table", 
    "They're stackable and easy to move if need be. Very stylish and comfy.", 
    "Love these chairs. Great price. I bought six.", 
    "Overall these are cute chairs. I purchased four total and two of them had dents in them. I ended up returning them, not because of the denting so much as the seat is VERY narrow.....and no, I am not a plus sized gal. The only one of us that fit with comfort in these chairs was my 10 year.", 
    "I like these chairs even though they are a little small. They are very sturdy and I have them placed with a round oak table. If you are a large person, you may want to look at other options.", 
    "Perfect rustic/industrial feel. Great quality!", 
    "I was disappointed in the quality of the chairs. They seem that they would bend very easy. The price was very fare for maybe portable entertaining?", 
    "i loved these chairs so much i bought 4 more!", 
    "Love these! They are a bit on the small side and look sort of silly with my dining table as I had intended. But they are perfect for my patio with my small outdoor dining table. They are very well made and attractive and come packaged safely.", 
    "Great chairs! Comfortable sitting and durable. Love the nesting capability.", 
    "love the chairs however they are smaller size than pictured", 
    "These chairs hold up well to my four elementary and middle school aged children. Easy to wipe down. The finish has not chipped or scratched even with heavy use.", 
    "Love these chairs brought the white expecting to paint them the emerald green since the green chairs have been sold out for a couple months. However decided to keep white great height with the table, makes everything feel very open. fast delivery and no assembly required.", 
    "I ordered 4 silver and 2 black chairs. They arrived quickly, were well packed, and I love the look. Be aware that these are \"petite\" chairs, with a 15 inch seat. They are sturdy, lightweight, and stack nicely. I will be getting chair pads for them for my guests, but they are fine without.", 
    "Love! Perfect fit for my nook. Now I'm stealing these chairs and putting them in other spaces because I love them so much!Great price and fast shipping!", 
    "Exactly as described and the quality seems great, especially for the price. They are not huge chairs, more like standard cafe style size. We like them!", 
    "These chairs are fabulous and just what I was expecting from the pictures. Not sure what other reviewers are meaning by tiny chairs, as they seem completely size appropriate to my 6\"7' husband and I. I ordered the white and they are a nice creamy white, not a bright in your face white. They slide directly under our kitchen table which is great for smaller spaces. I gave 5 stars for the quality and price!! You can't beat it anywhere!", 
    "Great Item Love it!!! Would buy again!", 
    "We have a tall family. Compared to other metal chairs these were far more comfortable to sit in for a lengthy amount of time. They also push all the way up to the table. Those with a narrow dining space will appreciate that feature.", 
    "Looked around at a bunch of different sites for these chairs at the right price. These were the best price and came completely done so all we had to do was take them out of the box. They go well with our small breakfast nook table and are very sturdy. My husband is 6' and fits in the chair just fine, I was worried they would be took small or short but they work!", 
    "Overall,, I like the look of these chairs but they are not tall enough. Hard to reach the top of an average sized diner table while sitting on these. And, they get a little cold on the bum in winter.", 
    "Arrived within 3 day in perfect condition. Amazing purchase.", 
    "Exactly as pictured and quick delivery", 
    "delivered in good condition and look just like the picture", 
    "good price, not the most comfortable though.", 
    "We did not like them too small and sharp edges", 
    "These chairs are really cute. I was surprised at how comfortable they are. Also, they stack for easy storage. I plan to use them as extra seating when needed, but they would work for everyday use. Excellent price and fast delivery.", 
    "We love our bistro chairs. They are sturdy, color is perfect and they aren't bulky.They were also delivered very quickly.", 
    "Theses chairs are exactly what I wanted. Solid construction. Nice they added rubber feet. I bought 4 to fit around a small kitchen table. Chairs are about as comfortable as your basic kitchen chair gets. If your kids tip back on to 2 legs the chair legs do not bend. My boys ruined metal stools that way, despite my best efforts!", 
    "Small footprint and stackability were key for us. These look great and are very functional.", 
    "Just what I wanted, just what I expected. Adds a cool industrial touch to our decor. Great, modern-looking dining chairs. Highly recommend.", 
    "not much to say here. the paint is good, and the chairs will hold just about anyone.", 
    "These chairs are fantastic\u2014they're inexpensive but look great and are well made. One reviewer objected at their size, and a few others said that they seemed appropriate for children. I'm a 6'1\" guy and think they're the perfect size. I'm thin but had have had friends who are much bigger than me use them with no problems. In fact, I like their size better than some competitors' variations, as many of those are too big and would have dominated my living space. Fully recommended!", 
    "Love them, get so many compliments!", 
    "We got these chairs to go around a small dining table, and they fit great. The seats are small and we're currently looking for chair pads that will help with their comfort. But they look great, and, except for one box that was destroyed by UPS and damaged one of the chairs (which Overstock promptly replaced), they arrived in perfect condition, stacked, no assembly needed.", 
    "The metal finish is ok and the feet have excellent rubber lining but the scale of the chair is really small. I got them for staging with a white and chrome table and they looked comical up against the table. Returning them.", 
    "I ordered three sets of these chairs and LOVE them! They arrived in perfect condition and look great around my farmhouse table. They are a tiny bit smaller in stature but nothing too crazy. They are comfortable and lovely!", 
    "Love these chairs. They go perfectly with our farmhouse table.", 
    "I love these chairs with my country table. They are comfortable and stylish. Everyone who sees them always compliments them. They are also east to clean, always a plus with kiddos.", 
    "For starters I was so excited when they arrived a day earlier than their expected arrival date. Happy dance! I was super impressed with the care that goes into the packing of the chairs for shipping. They were perfect out of the box. No scuffs or wobbling of the legs. I got the vintage color and they are true to the picture. They are a matte finish and I couldn't be happier with them. I sat in one the other night while doing 4 hours of computer work and was completely comfortable the entire time. And you can't help but smile when you walk into the room they are in because they are so stinkin cute!", 
    "We ordered two sets of these four our breakfast nook in the vintage finish and we love them. They are sturdy but lightweight which is perfect for us.", 
    "A great chair for a great price. They are small though. The look is exactly what I was going for.", 
    "These chairs look good but are not made for anyone over 5' 5\" tall. They are not very comfortable either. I was thinking of getting cushions for them but noticed the paint was very uneven and so returned them.", 
    "\"would definitely buy again....and shipping was superman fast\"", 
    "Great chairs that go for over $200 a piece on other sites. Quality is excellent. They go great with my table and decor!", 
    "Good quality chairs. Using them in our updated dining room to create that industrial meets rustic feel. We use them at every meal, they are comfortable, stylish, and hold up well to daily usage.", 
    "Love them. Have used both silver and antique finishes on design jobs and both are great!", 
    "Sturdy, well made.Would buy again.", 
    "\"attractive and quality, we have used them for over a year in our restaurant\"", 
    "I based this purchase on others reviews and also on the photos provided. Chair is way smaller than expected. Metal back support is pulled away from the body giving you no back support. Seat is also small. I'm 125lbs and I find the chair small without back support. It may work for a quick meal but if you have company over for dinner it would chase your guests to the couch after 10-15min. Chair looks like it was spray painted with a cheap paint, makes the chair look like it's made out of plastic.Chair would work for children not so much for adults unless they are very thin.", 
    "Arrived well packed. However, it's pretty obvious that these are knock offs - the curved bar along the back is a little....crooked and not as graceful as the real thing. For the money it's fine. Just set your expectations accordingly. Slightly wobbly.", 
    "This chairs to my surprise are very nice and convenient and they go great as a stand alone chair or under our patio table.", 
    "These chairs arrived in good shape, ready for use.While their design is attractive, they do not provide the most generous comfort in back of seat and across shoulders. Seat and shoulders are slightly narrow.I use these chairs as accent chairs in bedroom and in a work room so they will be fine for that purpose.", 
    "These are just what I wanted", 
    "Great chairs! The antique finish is perfect. I didn't want anything too shiny but I wanted the metal so this was a great option!", 
    "I really like these chairs. They were a little smaller than I thought.", 
    "groovy, sturdy, retro, great value", 
    "I purchased 2 armless in the vintage finish to match a computer desk. They are beautiful, sturdy, and comfortable ...... good ergonomics. Good back support for sitting at PC, and the size was perfect to have 2 at my 48\" desk with room to spare.", 
    "These chairs shipped in excellent condition!!I read other negative reviews, but learned along time ago to ignore most of them. So, I'mvery pleased with my purchases from Overstock!!!Highly recommend!!", 
    "Loved these trendy industrial chairs for commercial use.", 
    "they arrived and are ivory, not white", 
    "These chairs were the perfect addition to my rustic/industrial table. They are lightweight but sturdy. Easy to clean with lil ones and stackable if I need them out of the way.", 
    "Great quality and they look awesome", 
    "Nice chairs. Exactly as described.", 
    "My husband weighs 250 (and is a tall guy) and commented that the chairs are comfortable for him. I got the white, and they look fab. I think these are a great buy!", 
    "I paired these chairs with a rustic farmhouse table and I could not be more pleased with the outcome. I would definitely encourage anyone to purchase these chairs. Better still, the price could not be beat!!!", 
    "These are great looking chairs if you want the farmhouse/industrial kind of look. They are pretty comfortable but you wouldn't want to sit in them for hours.", 
    "I ordered a pair of these chairs. They are great. Sturdy, comfortable just what I needed!", 
    "We love these chairs. We've seen them a lot at local restaurants and thought they gave our space a more industrial feel. They're sturdy too. The seat is a little small, as others have mentioned before, so if you have guests that are a little larger.. that might be an issue.", 
    "The color is very matte. Its not a rustic/industrial silver that would look great with a wood table.", 
    "These chairs are just what I expected. They are very solid and look very cute!", 
    "These chairs look great with my farmhouse table! A very good purchase for the price!", 
    "I've Ben looking for chairs like this. They were such a better price then other places. Love them!", 
    "These chairs will be around for a while. They are perfect for sitting at a table or standing alone in a corner. Packaged really well so there were no scratches. I think I might have to get a couple more!", 
    "I purchased the vintage color steel chairs and couldn't be happier. They were well packed and literally you just pull them out of the box. They look great!!", 
    "Very sturdy and modern chairs. We love them. We also have the set of four Tabouret chairs as well.", 
    "love the look and fit well with my table", 
    "Great chairs and amazing price! Converted the look of our kitchen immediately!!!", 
    "In buying a weekend beach home, I needed to furnish it quickly. Purchased 10 of these for a long dining table from restoration hardware. The combo of modern and rustic Is perfect. Chairs are sturdy and solid.", 
    "Fast shipping!! Very easy to unpack and great quality for the price.", 
    "A great great chair for the money. Looks very expensive. Love it.", 
    "Exactly what we were looking for, and notably cheaper than on other sites. Came within the week which is impressive.", 
    "Like these chairs...but you can't sit in them too long", 
    "I bought these for the waiting area in my salon and have had nothing be complaints about the chair height being short and the size awkwardly small and the seat being very uncomfortable. The 2 star rating is strictly for their esthetics... they do look great!", 
    "Well Packed, well made, and the vintage color looks fantastic! Table, chairs and stools (all vintage) match perfectly!", 
    "Loves these chairs. Have an old reclaimed wood table and they are perfect.", 
    "Got these for our office kitchen. working out great.", 
    "Beautiful quality and solid for a great price", 
    "Purchased these in white and they are great. Solid feet that are gentle on floors, well constructed chairs, and a good size. A bit narrower than a traditional chair, but that was fine with us since we were placing them in our kitchen.", 
    "These chairs look and feel better than I expected. Very comfy also.", 
    "These chairs are stylish and yet simple enough to use in many places, indoor & outdoors. Good price and you don't have to put anything together, just open the box and unwrap!", 
    "I'm currently furnishing my new home in an eclectic style. These chairs fit the bill. I'm very pleased with the product. They are a tad more bronzed than I would've liked but still awesome.", 
    "I love the shape, color, and size.", 
    "love the chairs, well made", 
    "These chairs are perfect. Sturdy and so fashionable. We paired four of them with a solid dark-wood dining table with a bench on the other side. We've gotten a ton of compliments!", 
    "Just what you'd expect. Sturdy. Look nice. Fit great with my decor. No complaints. Would definitely order again if I needed more.", 
    "I have 4 for my dinning room table and want to purchase more for my patio table! Farmhouse and industrial all in one!", 
    "Good price and very cute.", 
    "I ordered these chairs to accompany a farmhouse table and after reading the reviews I assumed there would be a chance that I would end up returning them. The chairs are perfect and the size is exactly what I need. It is an affordable alternative to the RH model.", 
    "They rust when left outside.", 
    "Little chilly if you put it but the AC.", 
    "I really like these chairs. They are quite sturdy, well made and are nicely designed. They work beautifully in a limited space", 
    "These chairs are exactly what I was looking for. The price is great compared to other websites where you would pay more for just one of them. They arrive assembled and are surprisingly heavy. Not too heavy, but the weight shows a nice quality. Also, the feet are coated and haven't left any marks on my vinyl kitchen floor. I highly recommend!", 
    "Solid kitchen chairs... Exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "Love them..PERFECT. LOOK GREAT IN MY KITCHEN", 
    "a very nice addition to our informal dining area and fit well with separately purchased table.", 
    "The chairs are perfect and fit the description stated.", 
    "These chairs fit well around our dining room table as they are more narrow than our previous chairs. Easy to clean, modern yet rustic...would work well with a variety of styles.", 
    "this is the perfect chair for our farm table & at a fraction of the cost of others like it", 
    "These are very nice chairs. No problems at all. Packaging was sufficient to protect them in route", 
    "These chairs are exactly what I was looking for to pair with my rustic dining table for an industrial chic look. They're cute and comfortable. Yes, they are on the smaller side, but I'm 5'8\" average size and they're completely comfortable when I sit in them. They also fit my larger-sized dining table perfectly. If you want a big, oversized formal chair this is obviously not the right choice. However, they're perfect for the mix and match look I was going for.", 
    "They look better in person", 
    "Nothing wrong with them and a great price!", 
    "I absolutely love these chairs! I ordered them for my kitchen and they look great. I was worried about them being too shiny, but they are perfect.", 
    "just what i wanted...they look great with my Table....", 
    "These chairs are very sturdy. I have toddlers at home and I have little concern that the kids will flip these chairs over. There are pads on each leg so the chair doesn't scratch the wood floor. Also, the chairs have a nice finish and wipe clean.", 
    "I loved the look of the chairs, especially in the bright white but unfortunately they were just too small to be comfortable at our dining table. Sent them back this week.", 
    "I love this chair and the custom service at Overstock.com is so good.", 
    "These are great!! Would highly recommend.", 
    "These are suprisingly comfortable chairs, they are sturdy, and they are a PERFECT addition to our home!", 
    "I was wanting some metal chairs for my new dining table and really searched and searched for the perfect ones. I found these and ordered them and was extremely happy with my purchase. The color is great and they sit comfortably too. Very pleased.", 
    "Exactly what they were sold as and look exactly as you see on all the design shows. Very in expensive and very sturdy. I especially like the quality of the rubber feet as they will stay on and do not markup the floor.", 
    "I ordered two sets (4 total) in the vintage color. They are more brown/bronze than I expected, but they complement the warm tones in my dining table. I have a small table (47\" long) and two of these chairs fit perfectly on each side. Shipping was fast and they were packaged well. I love that they are fully assembled. My 6'4\" boyfriend can sit in these comfortably--he more than fills the seat but the chair is sturdy. I wish there was an option between bright silver and this brownish vintage.", 
    "priced these chairs everywhere. best price at overstock. love these chairs. now i need chair pads to finish the look", 
    "Love my bistro chairs! They are sturdy and very much what you see is what you get. I am very pleased with my purchase:)", 
    "These chairs are a little on the small side which is what we needed them to be for our space. We ordered four to use with a narrow kitchen table. They are exactly what I was expecting them to be and we love them.", 
    "I'm trying to find knock offs to go with my actual ***** chairs and these are just too antiqued whereas the silver ones are too silvery. Reality is I just need to spend the money and buy a few more original ***** chairs.", 
    "Not only a great looking chair but it's comfortable. I love the lines of it. I'm using them with an antique wood table and they look awesome! Very universal.", 
    "I ordered six of these chairs late in October, they are priced very well compared to the Tolix originals and one wouldn't think they Tolix ones would be that hard to replicate. When I received the original batch of six, I noticed that most of them had the powder coating (I ordered the white ones) bubbling on the base of the seat where the backrest meets the base. With my fingernail I scratched the area and the paint came off, down to the base metal. I contacted Overstock.com customer support and they were great about sending my replacements for the defective chairs, free of charge.With the second batch of replacements I knew what to look for. I again noticed the powder coat bubbling in the shadow of where the backrest meets the base, so I took an alcohol-soaked rage and wiped around the area where the paint was bubbling. Again, the defective paint came right off. Again sent them back, this time requesting that the warehouse please inspect the next batch before shipping them to me.Third try same again, so with disgust I gave up and sent all of them back for a refund. From an original order of six I went through 10 chairs with defective paint and received a total of four acceptable pieces. The customer service experience was very disappointing, when I asked for the warehouse to inspect the chairs before sending them to me so my time would stop being wasted I was told that the warehouse is too busy to inspect the chairs before shipping them to me (which in turn means they'd rather ship me defective items than inspect them first!). The customer service rep also let slip that they haven't had a particularly bad return rate on these chairs, to which I asked about the return rate: of the *** chairs of this type they've shipped they've only had *** or so come back. Does that sound like a quality product to you! Last time I'm shopping at Overstock.com!", 
    "Love the look. Havn't used them much. Seem like they will be cold so I may get a pad for the top of them. Shouldn't be a problem as long as we are waering pants! lol", 
    "I purchased the vintage chairs. I like them very much, the only problem I had was the color of them didn't match the picture. They were more of a solid bronze color.", 
    "These chairs are exactly what I wanted for my kitchen island, which has a lower, table-height section attached to the main island. I got the antique bronze color, and it goes perfectly with my Colonial Cream granite. There were scuffs on both chairs on the same corner, probably from being stacked for shipping. Since my home is rustic/industrial, I don't mind the scuffs. The chairs are slightly smaller than similar chairs I've seen, but for my application that is good. For me, they are very comfortable, and even my 6 ft. 200 lb. hubby says they work for him. The color is beautiful and works with both my copper cabinet hardware and stainless steel appliances. Other than the scuffs, the quality seems excellent, and the price can't be beat.", 
    "Very satisfied with quality of product and service we received.", 
    "I bought these chairs to stage a kitchen, but I will be keeping them. They look great.....color (vintage) is very nice and they are stackable for easy storage. Great extra dining chairs.", 
    "So pleased with these chairs and they are very comfortable. I bought eight black ones to go with a seven ft rustic farm table. Perfect!", 
    "I really liked the chairs but the seats are a bit small. We are not super large people but the sides pushed into our backsides and it was uncomfortable. We are spoiled by our current chairs but they are a bit large for our space. Due to this they were returned.", 
    "Just what I wanted. Very sturdy. No assembly required. Note they are bistro chair so not quite as tall as expected.", 
    "We recently purchased a long, rustic table and wanted extra chairs that were not wide (so we could fit in lots of guests, side by side), were stackable for storage, looked industrial but not cheap. These are terrific! We liked them so well, we ordered two more. Heavy and solid, we feel they'll hold big guys. I've seen versions of them at much higher prices. I liked that they have pads on the feet too for our hardwood floors.", 
    "I bought these chairs for a little writing desk. I couldn't believe what a great price they were in comparison to other websites and stores, where the quality didn't even come close. These chairs are sturdy but not heavy in weight. They are small in scale though. Not all shapes and sizes will feel comfortable taking a seat in them. I would be hesitant to use them around a regular dining table because of their size. They are perfect for a bistro or little breakfast nook type table. I am very happy with my purchase and feel like I will have them for many years to come.", 
    "These chairs are great if you are looking for a modern/rustic look. We have them around a concrete table in our kitchen and they are beautiful and simple. We have them beside some very ornate cushioned chairs and notice that guests prefer to sit in the bistro metal chairs.", 
    "I bought two sets of two of these chairs for my dining room. They go very well with my rustic harvest table. I love the combination of rustic with industrial and that's what these chairs give me. I love the fact that I didn't have to assemble them since they come fully assemble. I get many compliments on them. They can be a bit cold when you first sit on them, but that's to be expected. They warm up soon enough. I would definitely recommend these chairs to my friends.", 
    "Awesome chairs. I found the same ones on a fancy designer site for $XXX each. Sturdy, well made, and comfortable. We use them for outdoor dining chairs.", 
    "I really like these chairs! For the comfort and style it's perfect. I was a bit nervous that they wouldn't be big enough for a 6.5\" farm table, but they look perfect! I previously had chairs that were 38\" high and these tabouret chairs are approx. 33\" high. These chairs look better than my previous chairs and are space savers, as well. I ordered 6 and will be ordering 2 more. They will never have stains and they will only look better with age. These will be my \"forever\" chairs!", 
    "I really like them!! The only negative is the seat area is smaller than expected.", 
    "I love these chairs -- they're sturdy and really nice looking. And WAY less expensive than others just like them -- they're a GREAT DEAL!", 
    "The chairs are great. Surprisingly comfortable. Arrived quickly too.", 
    "I rarely write reviews, but decided to do so for these chairs. We bought 4 white ones to replace some old and uncomfortable chairs from West Elm purchased years ago. So happy to have bought these! They are so comfortable to sit in and matches perfectly with our table color. The chairs arrived in perfect condition. No assembly required. Great for smaller NYC apts. Great value.", 
    "Chairs are very sturdy and stylish. I'm very pleased with my purchase!", 
    "Cool retro, industrial chairs that actually mix with lots of different looks. They are sturdy and comfortable and the colors are spot on. I really love that they come with rubber bottoms that protect my wood floors. They also stack really easily. Great purchase.", 
    "So pleased with these cute modern-industrial Tabouret Chairs I just received from Overstock. They are exactly as pictured and described online: nicely finished metal, lightweight, compact, stackable. They are versatile modern-industrial chairs that I am using in combination with 2 Tabouret Tables (using both as side-tables and as dining stools) with my reclaimed wood and metal dining table. I also ordered the Tabouret Tables and they are equally nice. A great price too, for the quality and value that I received. Happy with my first Overstock.com order - I'll be back.", 
    "We got the chairs in the vintage color, which is bronze. It goes with my stainless steel appliances, and blends nicely with my dark hardwood floors. The scale of the chairs is on the small side, but they are sturdy. The chairs were packaged nicely and came in perfect condition. They stack so I was able to get four of them in the back of my mini SUV.", 
    "We purchased these chairs to bridge the gap between our modern wood breakfast table and a rustic (antique) wood hutch. These chairs absolutely fit the bill. They are versatile in that they can be modern or retro. With two large pieces of furniture in the breakfast room, we wanted chairs that wouldn't feel bulky, and these are perfect in that regard. The height of the back is shorter than we expected, reaching only a couple inches above the top of the table. They push under the table nicely and don't stick out at all. They stack which is a major bonus, and are quite comfortable. We have had no issues with them. They're sturdy and I expect they will stand up to the abuses my kids dish out on chairs. There was really no assembly required. We bought 4, but we'll be buying more to be used as flex chairs that can make their way around the house when needed, but be stacked in a corner or closet when not needed. They're light weight so they're easily transported. Even my 7 year old can pick them up and carry them. This was the best price I could find on this style of chair in stores or online.", 
    "I will agree with other reviews that these chairs are a bit on the small side but I knew that when I ordered them. They are just what I was looking for and the cheapest price I could find. I obsessed for months about whether to buy them or not and I am happy I did! :)", 
    "These chairs have great style and quality for a fraction of the price other retailers are asking for them. I paired them with a West Elm dining table for a great look. I was worried the chairs would be flimsy like aluminum stools I had in the past- these are heavy and well made. The seats measurements seemed small, but they don't look odd or small once at the table.", 
    "These chairs are great. They are exactly as described and very comfortable.", 
    "I bought a set of the white chairs and loved them so much that I just ordered another pair! The style is fantastic and is a great interpretation of all the metal chairs I've been seeing in design magazines. They are comfortable to sit in and small format and will push totally flush up to my round dining table. They arrived incredibly well packaged and fast! The perfect new chairs for my smaller size studio apartment.", 
    "Love these chairs....needed smaller scale due to space restriction. Worked great in a covered outdoor situation.", 
    "Perfect with my new reclaimed wood and iron table from Restoration Hardware!It looks like they came with the table! Highly recommend.", 
    "Love these chairs. They came in a giant box, so no assembly was required. The color was great, I ordered the vintage finish and they have a modern industrial look that I was after. Sturdy and comfortable enough. I like that they tuck into our table, unlike some of the tub chairs that look similar.", 
    "Perfect color well suited for outdoor use or bistro parlor I put them on a tresle table", 
    "I purchased the vintage color and am 100% satisified. I have been using them steadily for several months and love how durable and cleanable they are. We have gotten a lot of compliments on their look. The sleek design means more room in my dining area, too.", 
    "These chairs are great. actually more comfortable than they appear! I ended up returning them because they were just too small for the long built in desk. They looked like dwarf chairs in the wall length built in. My sister in law thought they would be perfect in her farmhouse kitchen.", 
    "Love my chairs.money wise,super bargain.They're small & light weight. Easy in & out.surprisingly comfortable. I love Overstock's free & fastdelivery. And their customer care is awesome.", 
    "I have coveted these chairs for years, constantly searching for a lower cost alternative to the name brand Tolix chairs. These chairs exceeded my expectations for quality and cost. They are well made and look beautiful around my farm table (I bought the antique color)--I have never been happier with a purchase!", 
    "These chairs are great- the perfect modern touch for my kitchen. The vintage color is really cool and understated.", 
    "Bought these for the end seats in my 8 person dining room table. Love the color! Sturdy. A bit pricey for the material. Comfortable as well.", 
    "I like the way these chairs look. I haven't actually used them yet because my kitchen is not finished.", 
    "After looking around for a cafe chair these were the perfect option for the vintage industrial look I was going for. Compared to the Tolix chairs these were very similar and priced much better. The chairs are also larger than some of the other Tolix knock offs. These chairs are built well but not the most comfortable. I am not a very large person and found the bars from the back support dig into my hips at times. I do like the look of these chairs and plan on ordering another set.", 
    "These chairs had me so confused. They were good quality, and I thought they were exactly what I wanted. But, they are very narrow at the back and the angle of the backrest is weird. So, if you are an adult of average size, you feel like you are sitting on a kid's chair. They also sort of look like a kids chair. I got them in silver and they are very stark. They don't have any of the depth like it looks on the photo. They almost have an all over silver look like a powder coated item. I think these chairs would look awesome in a kid's room as a desk chair, or around a game table. But I wouldn't recommend them as dining chairs.", 
    "Purchased two orders, for a total of four chairs. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and have no regrets. Items arrived within a week and were packed securely to prevent any damage during transport. Chairs are sturdy and stable and have not damaged my wood laminate floors. Price is reasonable compared to what I saw a local world/import type stores in town. I use these chairs in my dining room with a rectangular glass top table to create a casual and cool industrial look. I have two indoor cats making this very pet friendly...(i.e. no cat fur all over the upholstered dining chairs I had before).", 
    "Great price and super sturdy! These are perfect in my kitchen---great casual dining chairs.", 
    "I love these chairs. I have bar stools from the same manufacturer and I love them. They are extremely sturdy and blend beautifully in my kitchen eating area. So I bought a set of chairs for my daughter's dining area to go with her wood and glass topped dining table. She emailed me a picture of the set when she got it and it was simply gorgeous and yet very cozy, just right for a modern woman in the big city. I thought we were the first to combine sleek steel and traditional wood but then my daughter emailed me a picture of the dress designer Vera Wang posing in front of her own dining set--and it was the exact same look--same steel chairs accenting a wood dining table. My daughter said the only addition she made was to purchase cushions because after all these are steel and she sits at the table late into the night working on her studies.", 
    "These chairs are perfect for the look we were going for in our breakfast nook - and you can't beat the price! Time to get some stools to match.", 
    "really like these, sturdy, great style - just a bit smaller than expected.", 
    "Great finish on the vintage chairs. They were packaged incredibly well, too. Excellent addition to an industrial chic dining room that needed a pop of Paris.", 
    "Love these chairs, both my mother and I bought them for our rustic dinning tables. They go great with industrial rustic.", 
    "Gave it a good review but would not recommend these chairs as the seats are really SMALL as in OMG really small! Good style and quality but not practical for every day usage. If you are a size 4-6 you will not only love the chairs but FIT on them!!!", 
    "These chairs fit so well with my dining room table that all my guests compliment us on them. I love that they're stackable and can be stored in the garage when we're traveling for long periods of time!", 
    "love these chairs. they look great and I was very happy", 
    "Look excellent in my industrial chic home library. Will have to look for a pad for comfort, but the value and style are great.", 
    "As others have mentioned, these chairs are a little on the small side, however they are not as small as i worried after i placed the order and read the reviews. I am 6 foot and over 200lbs and can sit in them, so they arent that tiny. They look pretty nice. I got the vintage finish. I notice that they have what appear to be intentional scuffing for that vintage look, but probably could have done without. They seem sturdy. The chairs i really wanted were $200 each at one of the big name fancy stores, which is ridiculous given what these things are, but these are a good value.", 
    "Arrived carefully packaged and ready to use--no install necessary. Quite happy with it!", 
    "I've been watching these on Overstock for months--maybe years. And I've looked at similar styles elsewhere. I finally took the plunge and am so glad I did. I chose the \"vintage\" color. It's a great neutral, not too brown, not too grey, not too shiny. The finish is smooth. People comment that the chairs are comfortable. I like their sizing. The backs are lower profile--don't stick up high over the edge of the table. I was concerned that because of the curve in the back of the chair that you wouldn't be able to scoot the chair in flush against the table and the chairs would take up too much floor space. Not really an issue. The chairs are much less bulky than my previous wooden ones, and with the curve in the back, the chairs only stick out a few inches from the table. I use them with a white kitchen table and I love the sort of industrial look.", 
    "Chairs were just as described and pictured! Packaging was easy to handle and product arrived without any damage. The best part is that they were fully assembled and we used them for dinner that night!", 
    "The seat is a little lower than your average dining chair, but these were a great addition. Very nice, modern look.", 
    "The finish on the chairs do not match. One's a little more \"vintage\" than the other. You can notice it on the seat part but I don't mind that much. Good quality, sturdy.", 
    "I ordered a pair of these chairs in white and LOVED them. Unfortunately one of them was dented. The customer service at Overstock.com was amazing though and sent a new pair out right away and had UPS pick up the old pair since I still had the original box! Just received the new set and they are in perfect condition! Great customer service and product!", 
    "Not quite as tall as I would like, but sturdy. I like the color.", 
    "These chairs are very nice. They match well with a table I got at World Market, but I didn't like the chairs they went with it. They didn't slide under the table when pushed in. I have a fairly small dining area so having these, which can slide all the way under the table, is perfect. They are small but pretty sturdy. I have a feeling they will be a little small for larger people, but we won't be using these that often so it should be fine. The vintage finish is very nice looking. I have 4 of these chairs.", 
    "Love these chars they are good quality and can update any table. Our table is 10 years old and these made it look updated and brand new. It gave it a pottery barn/restoration hardware look.", 
    "These chairs were exactly what I expected and will fit nicely with our table.", 
    "I ordered 6 of these chairs to go around a large, rustic table for a rustic industrial look. They are great! They're sturdy, and great for kids because they can be wiped down easily. I wondered how comfortable they would be since they're made out of steel, but I was surprised when I sat down on them and found that they were actually more comfortable than my previous solid wood chairs. They have a nice slant to the back so you don't sit straight up. I would definitely recommend them if you're wanting modern or industrial! Great price for 2 as well! I've seen them for much more on other sites and in other big name stores. Good buy!", 
    "Great color (got the silver) and very happy with them. Feel nice and sturdy but at the same time super light so moving them around the kitchen is easy. Debated on going 'armless' and happy I did as they slide under our kitchen table if you want more space.", 
    "wow! I am a hero since I painted my kitchen and replaced my old wooden farm chairs with these sleek airy bistros. The kitchen is instantly modernized and hip. It's amazing how much cleaner and cooler our kitchen looks! My husband was worried about comfort but was instantly sold after sitting on them. No more scratched wood floor too. Absolutely love these. I also just two matching bar stools for the counter.", 
    "I bought these chairs along with the matching bar stools and I love them all. The designer look without the hefty price tag. They look great with my rustic farm table. I wasn't sure about these vs the arm chair ones, but I'm glad I chose these because my table has a low apron and they fit under the table better than the ones with arms would. Great vintage, modern, industrial style. Highly recommended. Oh, and sturdy too!", 
    "These chairs are perfect for my new live edge dining room table. The chairs give the set a contemporary/ industrial look. I bought these 4 chairs and then 2 without arms and mixed them on each side of the table. I couldn't find a lower price!", 
    "I have been wanting these chairs for a while, but they've become popular and a little expensive. However, Overstock has two for less than the price of one and the quality is excellent. I love my chairs and the price so much I bought 4.", 
    "Chairs are beautiful, sturdy and cheap. One came in discolored, but will be replaced very soon. Great customer service! Thanks yo uOverstock!", 
    "We have 5 little kids who were destroying our previous leather dining room chairs. We were desperate for a stylish indestructible chair which is why we ordered these metal bistro chairs. They came exactly as described however we were surprised as to how short they were in real life. We almost sent them back but decided to set them all out around the table and see if we got used to the lower seat height. We did get used to it and so we decided to keep them. So far they have held up well to the abuse of 5 little kids. Overall, these are good chairs.", 
    "We purchased 20 of these chairs to put in our wine bar. The color is excellent (vintage inspired) and the look is perfect!! The sturdiness of the chairs leaves a bit to be desired I think. I think it's safe to assume the amount of weight put on the chair will make a difference in how long they last. At 250 lbs the seat doesn't cover your rear but it also doesn't fall apart. I just hope they last long enough for us to get $1500 worth of use. I really am pleased with the look and feel but wish they were a few inches wider/bigger.", 
    "good looking delivered fast.good looking delivered fast.good looking delivered fast.good looking delivered fast.", 
    "I love these chairs. They are sturdy and look so good with my large farm table.", 
    "Love these chairs! Exactly what we were looking for! Very comfortable and super durable!", 
    "I bought two sets of these chairs for my girlfriend to use in our kitchen. They are very cool, stylish and durable.", 
    "Purchased 6 of these chairs, in vintage color, for a new dining room table. Very happy with the quality and price. Best deal for metal dining room chairs - I did a lot of research. Came very quickly, packaged nicely. Couldn't be happier, would recommend to anyone looking for a contemporary, yet rustic look.", 
    "After looking for chairs like this for a while, we were excited to find these on Overstock. The price was fantastic and much less than similar chairs elsewhere. We are using these for our dining room table and I was concerned they would not be comfortable for people to sit in for an extended period of time, but they are definitely comfortable. They are perfect for those looking for that industrial chic look. I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I am only 5'3\", size 6, and these chairs were too small for me. I liked the style and finish (vintage) but would have had to cut my table down in order to use these chairs.", 
    "I bought these chairs in the vintage color for my breakfast nook and I love them. They are definitely on the smaller side, but that is what I needed for my space. Great value for the money. I'm planning on ordering more.", 
    "I have 7 cats - I have traditionally had upholstered chairs to use at my dining table but the cats have shredded them - I was looking for a cat-proof, attractive alternative and considered acrylic, but was afraid the cats could still scratch the acrylic surface, then I decided on metal - these chairs fit the bill - when I use them I will put cushions on them (although I don't know that will be necessary) - they are sturdy and compact (a necessity in my small house) - I love the VIntage color - it works well with the colors I have in the room - the chairs have a tall enough back to provide support and, since the back is open the chairs don't take up a lot od visual space - they are a bit shorter than I expected (I am bad at picturing dimensions) but, all in all. a good bargain - I am looking forward to their inaugural use for Thanksgiving.", 
    "I must say at first I was little skeptical to buy these due to the fact that I was not sure how well they would look with my dinning table. But they are perfect, sturdy and really compact. They are not flimsy or dance around when your sitting on them. Great buy i bought 4 of them", 
    "Great chairs, great price. I purchased the vintage color, and they look old...exactly what I wanted. Shipped nicely. You wont be disappointed in these chairs...", 
    "Very comfortable chairs. Great back support. Low profile when pushed under table. Industrial chic goes with just about any style of decorating.", 
    "I love the overall look of these chairs. They were exactly what I expected except for one thing... the seats are very small, only 14\" wide and 14\" front to back. In one respect, that is good in that they don't take up a lot of room in my eat-in kitchen but the problem I am having is that I can't find any chair pads or cushions in that small of a size. I really want something on the seats, especially for the winter when that metal will be cold to sit on. The chairs do look great in my cabin and I've gotten many compliments on them..", 
    "These chairs are exactly what I was looking for, warm vintage patina , well made, and comfortable ... Thank you Overstock for another great addition to our home!", 
    "These chairs look exactly like the Tolix chairs at a fraction of the price. I was surprised how light they are but they are good quality. Look great with my dining room table.", 
    "When I ordered these chairs I selected them in the silver /metal color. I was surprised when I opened the package to find black chairs. When I contacted the company, they told me they only carry them in black. I liked the chairs a lot. They are good quality and were packaged well. It is very misleading that they offer a choice of colors to order when they only come in black, but I still rated them high for what they are.", 
    "I LOVE these chairs. I was looking for a new dining room set, but decided to just keep the table and get new chairs. I think these chairs would go with a wide range of d\u00e9cor. I have seen this type of chair in magazines and on other websites for sale and they run $170-$200 per chair. I got the bronze for a more vintage look and they are perfect. This was my first purchase from Overstock and they were shipped quickly and well packaged. The chairs are very sturdy. A really great buy!", 
    "Great looking retro chair, and very well made They look great with the enameled steel 1940's table I found. They look great up against the exposed brick wall in my apartment.", 
    "I'm a happy buyer. The chairs came in perfect condition. I sat on it the first time and it felt very sturdy and comfortable. They are lightweight chairs. I will be using these chairs a lot in my multi-purpose (dining/homework/craft) room. I gave 4 stars because I haven't been using them long enough. I hope they will last longer than wooden chairs.", 
    "Love the chairs, perfect match, love the style however a bit smaller then expected but my family fits them so they are staying! They have the same chairs at Anthropologie and Cost Plus for more $ and they pretty much look the same! Awesome but!",
