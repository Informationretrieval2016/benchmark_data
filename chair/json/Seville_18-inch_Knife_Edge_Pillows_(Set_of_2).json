    "I don't know what people are talking about these pillows are fantastic. The pattern is slightly raised and velvety which gives them a high quality look and feel. They are well stuffed and comfy to lean back on. The colors are true to what you see on the computer screen. I bought these to go on my leather sectional and they go beautifuly. Don't regret purchasing them for a second. I bouhght them in Latte/chocolate nd the brown design is really rich and matches perfectly with our sofawhich was sold as' espresso ' brown. If you're on te fence; gp for itYou wont be disappointed I'm not :o)", 
    "I have same experience like other shopper. The color is much much much darker. The color does not even close to what I have seen on screen. I ordered the antique gold. At night, they look brown. Day time, you need to put them under bright sunlight in order to see the gold color. Also, the fabric is really rough and tough. I returned them.", 
    "Purchasd the Latte/Chocolate and the color looks much different than the photo. I wasn't impressed with them...looked cheap. But I guess that's what I should have expected for pillows at this price.", 
    "I love the design. I bought the cream/chocolate. The main color is cream - the picture makes it look more evenly dispersed than it actually is. They are nice and fluffy, and still worked perfectly with my color scheme. Overall a great buy!", 
    "I purchased these pillows in Merlot to match the Seville Rod Pocket drapes. They, of course, complement each other beautifully. The pillows are on the small side, but I prefer that since they replaced a set of pillows that always seemed to take up a bit too much room on my couches. If you're buying these pillows you'll be doing your home a disservice by not going for the drapes as well, and vice versa. They're a beautiful pairing and give my room a rich, romantic feel.", 
    "I ordered these pillows last week and just received them. I am so dissapointed! They are MUCH MUCH MUCH darker than they appear online. They will not go with my new furniture. I'm so bummed!", 
    "I'm slightly disappointed with these pillows. In the picture they look like a lovely bright, pale blue color. I got the antique blue/chocolate set. In reality it was a more...well, I suppose, antique blue color. The blue looked sort of darker and older than the bright, pale blue I had thought it would be. I guess I expected it to be a bit more of a sky blue color. But, since I've adjusted myself to the disappointment in color I've decided I actually like the pillows. I bought the matching Seville curtains for in my living room, too, so I don't have to worry about the fact that the blue wasn't the color I expected.", 
    "I ordered the chocolate/chocolate color. Note: The velvet is med. brown and the pillow is a deep chocolate. There is not much contrast from the design and the background of the pillow. Otherwise, a very nice pillow.", 
    "Love the design and are a good size for couches but they are overstuffed to really be able to sit on them. They're more for the look then to use.", 
    "I got these pillows in creme/chocolate for my living room that has dark furniture and dark wood floors; the pillows serve as great accents and good contrast. The quality of the fabric is pretty good and the price you pay for two is the same (or less than) you would pay for one pillow at some places.", 
    "I just bought a small red couch for a new apartment, and wanted black and white pillows to go with. These are perfect! They are big enough, but not too big for my couch, and I think they are great accents. I just hope I don't get the white dirty...which may be the only issue. For the price, this set of two is great!", 
    "Pillows are beautiful a real dark rich red. Just was a little darker than expected. They come with tags you have to cut off otherwise you would rip the material. Also a pillow had a little part on the seam that did not get sewed but it's fixable.", 
    "I ordered the Merlot colored pillows, color true to picture! Love them. Good quality. They look very elegant!", 
    "last long time, held up very nice", 
    "Picture shows more red. In person they are definitely a deep maroon. Not even close to a red color. Nice pillow though", 
    "they are a great additions to my room I love them!", 
    "Liked these a lot. The black design is velvety and the colors are crisp white and black. Perfect for the decorative pillow look I was going for.", 
    "Sent as Birthday gift. My friend loved them and they are on her bed.", 
    "Great Quality, they look beautiful in the black and white on the bed as accent pillows!! I highly recommend them", 
    "I like these pillows, but was surprised that the black pattern was raised, velvety; like flocked wallpaper in the old days. They are picking up lint and dog hair. I use a little lint roller on them and it takes care of it. They are big and attractive and have a lot of loft. Look great with my other b/w stuff in my living room.", 
    "i got the antique gold option. They are really sage, which is exactly what I was looking for, also a great price.", 
    "beautiful quality and design on these pillows I purchased for my new sectional", 
    "Cute pillows, but the blue is over powering and drowns the brown.", 
    "These are lovely high quality pillows. I will order more. Color was true and sturdy construction", 
    "Excellent pillows. I am very pleased with this purchase. I will not hesitate to recommend these pillows to other buyer. They have added a unique touch to my sofa.", 
    "Bought bc of all the great reviews, only thing I docked a lil off for was the stitching where it's sewn shut wasn't done properly on mine. But it took me a week to even notice it! For the price I'd definitely buy again. I bought blue/choco and it's a wonderful pop of color and the scroll print helps bring together my subtle antique/vintage feel to my living room :) Everyone I've sent pics to loved them.", 
    "This would get a higher rating, if the pillows I received were actually gold, and not green in color. I'm not sure if they think this color is actually golden, but it's not. So, maybe I got the wrong pillows in the order, but I just didn't feel like sending them back and dealing with that hassle.", 
    "The color was really nice Champaign just as I expected. The pillow is nice and firm specially to use as back support.", 
    "a bit overstuffed but otherwise lovely. wish they came in more colors.", 
    "I bought these pillows to go with the new black / white / grey theme in my bedroom. I was SO happy that when they showed up, the white was ACTUALLY white (and not cream colored or off-white). I use these for throw pillows on the bed, and they are perfect for that purpose. I imagine if you tried to use them on a couch or outdoors, they would get ruined, but they are sturdy enough to use for decoration only. I am very, very happy with this purchase and the low price (throw pillows are crazy expensive!). I would buy again if I ever redo any other rooms that require throw pillows.", 
    "Purchased these pillows and I absolutely love them. They are so pretty and match my sofa and loveseat beautifully. Nice size. Gorgeous pattern!", 
    "Bought 4 sets of pillows and could not be more pleased!!", 
    "We ordered 4 different colors. Two looked great in our living room (Merlot and Antique Gold), and the Copper /Black was too pretty to return so we kept that too for a bedroom. We returned the Chocolate.", 
    "I would definitely purchase these pillows again. They are just perfect for what I bought them for! Highly recommend these!!", 
    "I love my pillows, and you definitely cannot beat the price. I bought these for my bed (queen size) and they complemented my bed and bedding perfectly. They are really stuffed so they arent the best to lay my head on but they are great back cushions when i want to sit up in bed.", 
    "Pretty pillows good for a sofa or bed. They look nice matched with other colors.", 
    "The merlot ones look more red on-screen, they're more dark, deep wine-like color, almost purple in real-life. Also, the felt design looks black/brown on screen, it's just a dark purple. All the seams are wonky & bady sewn. The strings of fibers/filling comes out & pokes through. I returned them & don't recommend them; you get what you pay for I guess & these are cheap for a reason.", 
    "Great pillow to accent furniture. I have it on my couch and the colors are beautiful and so far it seems very durable.", 
    "Due to Hurricane Isaac I received the pillows later than I expected, but that is certainly no one's fault! It was worth the wait because when I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were actually better quality and prettier than they looked online. The brown scroll design has a velvety or felt texture, and the faint blue color is exactly as represented. This is my second purchase from Overstock and I'm very pleased with the quality of their products.", 
    "I bought the pillows to cover a stain I was having trouble removing. They actually enhanced the way the whole room looks. Great purchase!", 
    "We ordered 2 pillows to go in a room with turquoise accents and brown furniture, and the pillows tied in both colors. The pillows are fluffy, look nice, and appear to be well-made. We are pleased!", 
    "Very satisfied. Always pleased with whatever I order from Overstock. Price and quality cannot be outdone from anyone. They have a customer for life.", 
    "These pillows look great on our sofa. Very full so provide lots of cushion for leaning and lounging on the couch. I'm very happy with them.", 
    "Ordered slip coveris and with htese pillows looks like I have new living room furniture", 
    "Seamless transaction, good product, no complaints.", 
    "the pillows are good quality and comfortable. but the color of the picture and the actual color are drastically different (much darker than picture).", 
    "I was hesitant of ordering these pillows online, because I wasn't sure about the color. To my surprise, they match up beautifully. I'm thinking about getting the curtains to match.", 
    "recd these today to be used on our Florida Room chairs-excellent product very pleased and appear very well made-delivery was very fast-thank you Overstock love them!", 
    "The pillows are gret. They matched the urtains exactly. Look great in my bedroom.", 
    "Thse pillows are really nice, not great but really nice. The price is right. I would recommend them to people on a budget (like me). They look nice on my couch.", 
    "The pillows were true to the picture, the only thing is that I wish you were able to take your mouse and be able to click on each of the different colors closer. Otherwise I would purchase these pillows again, I just repainted and the pillows really add a nice touch.", 
    "Good thing it is a decorative pillow because it's too scratchy to actually lay on.", 
    "I love the pattern but the color was a little darker.", 
    "These pillows added just what we needed to the recliners in our movie theater room.", 
    "I do love these pillows. The color and design are exactly what I was wanting.", 
    "These pillow added just the right amount of pop into our family room. I just love them.", 
    "Nice tapestry design in a deep burgundy color material. They look elegant on sofa.", 
    "I ordered these pillows for my European themed room for my guests. I am totally impressed. The pictures do not do justice because it is soooo much better. The pillow has texture and looks very expensive. Give it as a gift or keep it for yourself!", 
    "These are great pillows. They are comfy and look great with the furniture", 
    "Firm and well made, love this fabric, already tested with the grandkids and passed with flying colors!", 
    "Pillows are beautiful and you couldn't beat the price.", 
    "Very pretty colors and they have held up well. I love them!", 
    "These really tie in the darker red curtains and pictures I have on a brown sofa. Look great.", 
    "These pillows are beautiful. I originally bought them to put on my leather couch, but they looked better on my bed.", 
    "Love these pillows; I ordered the antique gold and they work perfectly on the sofa and chair. Color is true to the picture, fabric is really nice and the pattern is lovely.", 
    "I have been enjoying them in my family room ever since..love them !", 
    "These are very nice accent pillows, they were a little slow on delivery compared to anything I've bought on Overstock before, took a little over a week, but worth the wait.", 
    "Very nice pillows. This was my second order of the same pillows. They look great on my couch.", 
    "These popped up as a suggestion to go with a rug that I bought, and I'm SO glad they did! They match perfectly and I'm thinking of buying another set in another color.", 
    "The pillows were very pretty and appear fine and good quality but I didn't even fully take them out of the box because once I saw they design was a raised velour/velvet type material I realized they wouldn't work for my home with multiple pets. I was hoping the design was not a raised material appliqued to the pillow fabric but it was. They would be great for anyone without this to worry about", 
    "The pillows are a great match to the curtains. The merlot color is rich!", 
    "Nice pillows for the price. Nothing to wow me but still, great fabric and nice design. I got the merlot and they are rich in color.", 
    "This was a good quality pillow however I was disappointed that the color didn't match screen image. We bought the chocolate that looked to be light enough for my dark brown leather couch but was actually as dark as the couch. Look at the image for the curtains as it gives a more accurate color sample.", 
    "I ordered these pillows for our King Bed in the master bedroom....we have a navy spread and I needed another bold color for contrast.....they are perfect. The color is true and the pillows are a nice size and firm. I ordered the dark red color and would do so again. Diane D Omaha Ne.", 
    "I ordered the set of Seville Pillows in the antique blue and chocolate brown and I love this set. I was a bit worried about ordering the set online without seeing the color in person, but I am very happy. The pillows are not as squishy and comfortable as down pillow would be, but for the price, look and quality I am very happy. If what you are looking for is something similar to the feel of a down pillow these are not the pillows for you, however, they are beautiful and make a great accent pillow to any sectional or accent chair. They are not uncomfortable to lay on by any means, but they do not compare to a down pillow or down alternative pillow like the ones you could find at ***. I have to say that the color print are beautiful and I receive many compliments on this set.", 
    "I bought a pair of these pillows. I had to wait for them to be back in stock. I also purchased the 96\" drapes to match. The blue is a greyed, steel blue which was perfect for my room. The fabric is rich and luxurious, the pillows very full, well-made and look beautiful on my chocolate brown sofa. I'm a very pleased customer.", 
    "These are great pillows for our couch to dress it up a little. Nice and plump.", 
    "I purchased two pillows to complement my bedding and they look very nice. Good quality pillows and once again a great purchase from Overstock.com.", 
    "Pillows were beautiful. My daughter loved them! Would order them again.", 
    "These pillows are so beautiful & completely added some oomph to my couch. I bought the merlot & the color is perfect! They are stuffed nicely and seem very durable. Would definitely order again!", 
    "I got two sets of these pillows in cream/brown. They are beautiful! A perfect addition to my living room. I held out to find the perfect pillows and I found that in these. I have even spot cleaned with a baby wipe.", 
    "Beautiful design, plush, rich feel. Love these. Colors look great.", 
    "I love these pillows. I don't know why others have commented on them being uncomfortable. I find them very restful. The pale blue fabric has a high end look with a slight shimmer and the brown velet scroll work adds an extra depth of richness. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a little Italian renaissance.", 
    "Bought the blue ones - it looks great on my black sofa. The pillows are nicer than expected from the pictures - great value!", 
    "I love these new pillows on my couch; they are absolutely gorgeous. I did have to resew the top of one of the four pillows that I bought, however (the hand sewn part, not the machine sewn part). Now they are perfect. Just the right size and \"squooshiness\" for me to nap on, too.", 
    "This pillows make a great addition to my solid-colored brown sofa. However, they are great ONLY as decoration. They are not the best for laying on. Don't not buy these pillows if you are looking for something to rest upon. These are more just for decoration.", 
    "Pillows are very chic!! i would definetly have my freinds buy them. i bought them in Merlot!!! Great rich color.", 
    "Like the pillow, but just a little surprised at the color when I get the pillow. I was expecting a little peachy color since I got the champagne, but the color of the pillow really look like the drink -champagne color. They did show the color online, but I just expect something different. But the pillows look good on my couch so I decide to buy another set. However, my other set came but it's so much fuller than the other set I received in the first place. I actually like the fuller set better. Maybe I should have order the 2 sets together.", 
    "These pillows are great. I wasnt able to order my 1st choice color because it was sold-out. But my 2nd choice looks great on my couch in the family room. The pillows are stuffed well and excellent quality for the price. I highly recommend!!", 
    "nice material, color was what I expected. Got 2 for the price of 1-1/2. good quality.", 
    "The pillows are perfect!! Not only are they comfortable, but stylish!! I would recommend them to anyone who wants to get two things out of one item!!", 
    "beautiful, fast delivery , thank you very much I will look for the matching curtains now~!!!", 
    "Can't beat these pillows for the price! They look beautiful, not the softest to use for laying on, but I bought them more for decoration. I got a set in the chocolate on chocolate, & the chocolate on cream to compliment the chocolate on cream drapes I bought in this pattern and they look gorgeous on our cream leather couches! I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for pretty decorative pillows at a reasonable price!", 
    "These pillows are great! They add style to any room and they're soft. I really enjoy them!", 
    "These pillows are gorgeous! They are nice quality and the price was excellent. The pillows are very plush and full. For this price anywhere else you would probably get a hard, flat pillow. I could not have done better in any store - not to mention the time driving around town looking. I ordered the pale blue with the chocolate pattern. The colors on screen seem to be fairly accurate.", 
    "The pillows arrived quickly and appeared to be of excellent quality. I have not used them since they are for decoration only. The complimentary colors work well with my sofa and love seat. The only downside is that I bought the last four in the blue/brown combination.", 
    "I love those pillows! Did not know exactly what to expect but trusted the previous reviews. I got the black and white ones. They look fantastic! The black detail pattern is \"velvet-like\" which makes them look very luxurious. I paired them with other pillows in very bold and bright solid colors on my black sofas and it is SO stylish! I just ordered another set because I am just so in love with those pillows!", 
    "I mean, what can you expect with the price, but I am planning on returning these. Good deal for the price, but you're getting just that, two cheap pillows. They may LOOK nice, but they are cheaply put together, not comfortable and seem like they will fall apart any moment.", 
    "I ordered two of these pillows for one of my couches. When they came they were so beautiful I ordered two more for the other couch. I ordered the black and white deisgn. The pillows are very full and the design looks even better in person. They are well worth the money.", 
    "WOW. Is all I can say. I ordered the black and white set and I am blown away. They are absolutely beautiful. This is a steal of a deal, because you get two! I would highly reccommend these... to anyone that wants to add a splash o color. They ARE busy.... so you need simplicity to go with them, but the complete my beautiful duvet cover I ordered. Fantastic buy... once AGAIN... Thank you O!", 
    "Just got my pillows today they look good putting them on my Patio. Order the black and white ones. Thank you Overstock", 
    "Love these pillows, they add a great look to any room! Have them in bedroom and living room!", 
    "I love my Knife Edge Pillow , I was very please with the quality .", 
    "i just wanted to say that i was very happy with the product. These pillows are very full and comfortable. I also love the design. all and all i would say i would recommend these pillows to anyone who wants to add a bit of flare or class to a room and there is a great selection in color as well.", 
    "I thought these pillow were really cheap quality and I returned them.", 
    "I ordered the black and white one. The materials are rough and look cheap. Unconfortable on top of that. Not sure if any other color combo is any better, though.", 
    "I bought these pillows for a new couch set that we purchased for our dream home. I bought the Merlot and the Antique Gold Sevilles. They are a smaller pillow and should be thought of as decorative only. They are not cushy. They are more of a stiff pillow that is why I write that they are decorative. I made the mistake of expecting a bigger pillows. It turned out okay though. The colors of the pillows are both really pretty. The pictures on the website do not do the pillows justice. I would recomend these pillows to anyone.", 
    "great price. great quality. a bit bulky when i put the 2 together to rest my head while reclining on my couch. but all in all looks really nice", 
    "I ordered the blue and chocolate brown set. The blue is a bit darker than the photo, but for me it worked better. Bought them for my bed and the colors match my walls perfectly. My only complaint is that I thought they'd be bigger, haven't actually measured them but they appear smaller than 18 x 18. The chocolate brown design is sort of a raised velvety desing, it's really nice.", 
    "I really like these pillows. They are perfect for the purpose they serve, which is to decorate. They look good on my couch and keep their shape. They do come with rather large tags attached but I just cut them close to the seam and they look fine. They are plush enough to use as a lower back support when sitting or rest your head on when lying down. Overall a good purchase.", 
    "I ordered these pillows for my couch in the family room and they are super hard and uncomfortable. If you are looking for something that looks good but won't get any use, then these would be ok. Also, I ordered the black on chocolate and it is a lot darker than the picture on this site.", 
    "I love my pillows, they are more beautiful in person than in the pictures. I think I will order more in a different color for another room. If you are considering buying these; you really should do it, you won't be disappointed.", 
    "I love them I have the black and white. with my grey walls and sage carpet all the black and whites crisp it up and the pillows are awsome!! I may have to do the curtains as well.", 
    "These pillows are beautiful! Nice and fluffy and the black embossing feels like velvet!", 
    "love these they look very expensiveand are a great value for the price the only complaint I have is that each pillow comes with one of those huge white \"don not remove under penalty of law\" tags and removing them actually cause the stitching to come loose on a few of them, but I was able to sew back up fairly easily.", 
    "I got lots of compliments about these pillows. They are really pretty and they look great on my couch.", 
    "I bought the pillows in the teal and brown chocolate. They are beautiful and quite comfy! The color is exactly how I imagined from the picture and match perfectly with my chocolate couch and darker teal curtains.", 
    "Beautiful addition to my black futon! I chose the white pillows with the black design. The pillow feels like satin and the black design is embossed (velvet like). I am really happy with this purchase. However as they are white they may get dirty over time.", 
    "They feel cheap, they are pressed wrong, pleats on edges that are way off the mark of the seam...just plain shoddy workmanship. Made in America???? I hope not.", 
    "Wonderful curtains. The only thing I wish is that they were actually blue."
