    "OMG I love this bench. For one, it took less than five minutes to put together which in my book is a good thing. Second, despite the length being smaller than I would have expected (I wanted the length to be as long as my footboard on my queen sized bed), I am shockingly surprised at how much storage space this piece entails. I am a shop-a-holic and amazed at how much stuff I was able to store. Think of a trunk size of a Toyota Corolla...looks small from the outside but once opened, it's an abyss. You should note that the top can only open up to about 3/4 which is fine. Anyway, the leather smoothness all around definitely caught my eye. And the material will not ruin no matter how much stuff or weight you add to the item. The item is strong and sturdy enough for anyone to sit on.", 
    "This is a nice solid bench but the 'dark brown' is really black - with brown wood feet. In this case it doesn't really matter to us but I was disappointed nonetheless.", 
    "LOVE it! Fits perfectly by a window in our office/guest room. We bought it to store sheets, towels, etc. for guests. Love the quality and the look. My only complaint is that the lid does not open fully, (straight up and down), but only at an angle. However, it does stay open which I think is important. I looked a long time for a bench and am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Just as pictured...I love it n my dogs can jump easier onto my high bed", 
    "There really isn't much to say about this bench...if you are considering it...get it. It really completes my living room. I use it as an ottoman/coffee table and it looks elegant and classy! Everybody who comes over loves it.", 
    "I just received this ottoman last night and it is exactly what I was looking for! The size is perfect and it fits my two blow up twin mattresses, two down pillows, and sheet sets for when guests stay over. The piece looks great and is very study. Perfect height to rest your feet as well.", 
    "I bought this to match a tufted headboard I bought at ******* ******* and it works perfectly. The legs screwed on in minutes, and it is the right size even for a King Sized Bed. It is a bit darker than I expected but it's OK for what I needed. I am able to store all my extra pillows in it easily. This is my first purchase with Overstock, and you cannot beat the great price and quick delivery.", 
    "It doesn't look faux. It's held up well with my dogs who can be a little crazy on the furniture. That's why I don't spend much on furniture. The storage capacity is great.", 
    "I was very pleased with the storage bench, it arrived sooner than expected. It fits and looks nice at the foot of my queen size bed. I purchased it for two reasons: I wanted something to keep throws and toss pillows in and as a stepping block for my little shih tzu to get onto the foot of the newly purchased very high bed! Just the right height and narrow enough to still have plenty of room to walk around the bed. I would have rated it 5 stars except I am disappointed in the operation of the hinge. It doesn't allow for a full 90 degree opening, however, it still makes for easy access. I purchased other products from Overstock and was always satisfied, especially with the shipping charges!!!", 
    "Love this storage bench! It looks very nice and is very nice for storing my quilts!", 
    "Needed storage for extra linens and this was perfect. Also very comfortable to sit on.", 
    "Packaged well. Easy to assemble.GREAT price. Looks awesome. Very happy customer here :-)", 
    "After about a year, the material on one corner has torn. I can't expect much more from this item, especially for the price- the torn corner is from people bumping into it with their legs, as it is used in the living room in place of a coffee table. There is a decorative serving tray that is kept on it, but it is otherwise only used for storing extra pillows and blankets in the LR. The dogs have jumped on top of it a couple of times (they aren't allowed and end up in time out on the rare occasions that it has happened) and there have been no scratches to the top of it from that. I wouldn't recommend this item in a high traffic area if there are small children or pets that are allowed on furniture- it will not hold up for long.", 
    "I purchased this bench to store towels and linen. It's good just for that. If I wanted to store queen size comforters, I probably could fit 3 at most in the bench. I recommend this bench for small items that need to be stored, nothing bulky.", 
    "This sits at the foot of my king size bed. I holds the bed pillows during the day and the shammed pillows during the night. It looks great and it's comfortable to sit on the remove or put on shoes. Don't hesitate to purchase this item, it looks like it cost much more than it did.", 
    "This product looks classy and it's exactly what it said it would be. The color is as seen in the images. Opening and closing the chest you can feel the sturdy design. Great buy for the price!", 
    "so happy with a product, i love it so much and i love overstock too", 
    "Love this bench, it is the perfect size in front of our queen bed. Great for storing linens. It would be nice if the bench seat opened a little wider however, it only opens at about a 45 degree angle. Also, it arrived with a puncture to the pleather on the side of the lid, and despite overstock's return policy, I don't have the time or energy to return/exchange it so I will just mark the white foam that is showing thru with a permanent marker. Other than that, love this bench, it's exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "I was very pleased with this storage bench, it exceeded my expectations.", 
    "I have never written a negative review about anything before. The stitching on this bench was ripping at the seems after just a few months. It tears super easily. I know it is faux leather but maybe they should consider putting genuine leather on just the top for better durability with blended leather/vinyl elsewhere. Then they could charge just a tad more. For the price I paid though I am not satisfied at all with this purchase. I would look at something else made of better quality of you want it to last.", 
    "I like the look of the bench, but my only complaint is the buttons on top. I had it less than a week before one of the buttons came loose and fell off.", 
    "It's a good product, I mean, it's exactly what it's shown on website, it worked for me, not that big, not that small, it's ok, I can't complain.", 
    "This bench was a great price! It is also the same price on another big online merchant's website but Overstock doesn't charge tax to my site. The delivery was on time and quicker than I expected. Assembling this bench consists of pulling it out of the box and then attaching the four legs. It is comfortable to sit on and it feels sturdy. The opening, like others have said, opens at an angle so boxes are hard to fit inside it, but soft objects or smaller ones will fit easily. It looks great in our sitting room. We are using it as a piano bench (it could be a little taller), and it can double as extra seating when guests are over. I highly recommend this bench!", 
    "I purchased this storage bench for my hallway where we tend to collect a lot of shoes. This provides a great place to both store and change shoes when entering or leaving the house. It is good quality, sturdy and attractiive. I am very happy with it.", 
    "Awesome product and delivery. It's perfect for my room and matches great.", 
    "I bought this for a friend who was short on storage and needed a bench for her little dog to be able to look out the front window. It's style is quite nice and the \"leather\" is high quality with pretty tufting. It should last for many years.", 
    "I bought this for some of my son's toys. It's a perfect size and looks great in my open concept living space. I ordered the black brown, but it actually looks like black leather. The dark brown legs are extremely easy to screw into the bottom of the bench. The top only opens 3/4 of the way, but not a huge deal. Aside from those two things, I LOVE it.", 
    "We needed something in our den for storage and extra seating if necessary and this is perfect. Sturdy and solid yet classy looking. There is plenty of storage room. Great deal!", 
    "Very nice space instide and material and quality is well made, not to comfortable to sit on though", 
    "The bench itself is very beautiful and sturdy. It's a great accent to any room. The only issue we had was that the legs didn't come with floor protectors so we had to add some so it would scratch our wood floor. Twisting on the legs was the only assembly required so it was very convenient once it arrived.", 
    "High quality item, looks far more expensive than it is! Easy to put together.", 
    "Was even nicer than I expected! Using this at our cottage for storage organization with the bonus of seating as needed!", 
    "I have been looking for a few years for a storage bench to keep at the foot of our king-sized bed. The picture/color is accurate, and it is sturdier than I expected. The box was huge and figured it would take at least at hour to put it together. Much to my surprise all I had to do was screw in the legs. It's a Christmas present for my husband (me, too) and can't wait to see his reaction. I highly recommend this bench.", 
    "Not as wide as I wanted but its a great piece for family room. Store blankets, small toys and it has hinges to hold it open. Comfortable to sit on also.", 
    "I was hesitant to order this bench online and my husband hated the idea of buying something without seeing it first. But I took the leap of faith and ordered it. We were both amazed at the good looks and quality of the bench. It is perfect for our needs. If you like this bench, buy it. I think you won't be disappointed with it.", 
    "We purchased this bench to use at the foot of our kng bed. We were aware that the top doesn't open fully, but that hasn't been a problem in placing anything inside. My husband is a big guy (6'5\" 280 lbs) so we were skeptical about its sturdiness at first. It also comes ready to go; you simply screw in the feet. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for additional seating/storage, especially in a bedroom.", 
    "I bought this as an inexpensive way to storage some of my 14 month olds toys in our living room. We have a fairly space so the piece looks pretty miniature, I was going to sent it back but I was surprised by the amount of toys it can hold so I'm going to keep it! I'll probably relocate to the den. For the price and the amount of storage its worth keeping, plus it seems sturdy, which is important these days seeing how everything gets climbed on!", 
    "Love this bench, just what I was looking for. Free shipping, and a good price. Win win", 
    "We love our new bench. Very classy looking as well as very functional. We shopped locally but found this to be better value", 
    "Good size, not too big not to small, and also the storage is a good idea for keep music books.", 
    "I am very pleased with this storage bench. It is exactly as described. It looks really great at the foot of my bed. It will hold my electric blanket in the summer and my extra bedspread and throw for the winter.", 
    "Excellent quality, looks way more expensive than $$$. Better than any other similar pieces you will see in to tjmaxx or home goods", 
    "I was initially sad that the ottoman was a slightly different color, but I love it now. It doesn't exactly match my other furniture, but it's a very nice ottoman.", 
    "As another customer said, the dark brown is really black. It doesn't look like the picture, it looks black. The bench is nice quality and has a decent amount of storage, but the color is definitely off. Be forewarned.", 
    "Looks good. Don't care for the fact that it doesn't open a full 90 degrees, and available storage space is small.", 
    "This is just what I wanted.", 
    "Put it at the foot of my bed for storage and somewhere to sit when I get my shoes on in the morning. Looks really great.", 
    "I would have preferred real leather, but didn't care for the designs of the leather ones. I don't care to much for the synthetic feel, but we won't be touching it much to notice. It looks great. The dimensions fit perfectly and there were no flaws that we could determine. Arrived quickly.", 
    "It's perfect. Low enough to sit on...roomy enough to store things. Comes assembled except for legs which are easy to screw on (remove screw protectors first).", 
    "It was exactly what I expected. So happy I can put my feet up! Also not worry about my grandson getting hurt with the glass table.", 
    "This fits great in front of my bed which I use to sit on and put my shoes on in the morning. Just enough storage space for items I don't want in view. Very easy to put together and lightweight. I have no complaints with it.", 
    "I needed a low coffee table and storage...this is perfect for what I needed it for and it is very well made.", 
    "Very well constructed. Perfect color. Looks more expensive that what it cost. Would definite buy again and have considered getting another one in a different color (if I can find a space to put it).", 
    "Bought this bench to store blankets and sheets in our master bedroom. It is a very classy piece that holds a decent amount of bedding (2 sheet sets, comforter, and decorative pillows). Seems to be holding up well and looks just like new. A great addition for style and storage.", 
    "Not much room in it. Cant handle the 4 small decorative cushions fon the bed. Also legs uneven, so rocks. Would not buy again.", 
    "Nice! I really appreciate the hinges that hold it open.", 
    "Very pleased with this purchase & quick delivery!", 
    "The storage benched worked out well. We are please with the amount of space and the ease of assembly. Definite addition to any room.", 
    "This storage bench exceeded all of my expectations! It was a great piece to add to the foot of my bed. I have clothing stored in it and my husband uses it daily to lounge and watch TV instead of sitting on the bed. It is sturdy enough to hold my big guy as well as quite a few of my clothes.", 
    "Good price, strong, and nice is more for decoration, I love it!Buen precio, fuerte, bonito es mas para decoracion, me encanta \ud83d\ude18", 
    "I Love it, great space for storing extra blankets and clothing items! It actually has more space than I thought it would. I recommend it to anyone who needs extra space for their linens.", 
    "Great for storage and is perfect for a small 12 x 15 room", 
    "This storage bench holds a huge array of tablecloths, napkins and placemats, plus serves as a piano bench and double seating at the dining room table. It has freed up my cabinet space - so useful for downsizing - and the blue is exactly like the picture in the web-ad. Easy to assemble (put the legs on!) and well-constructed. I'm actually thinking of getting another to use as a coffee table in the small, small living room space I have.", 
    "This bench was fairly inexpensive but it looks very rich. The brown is very deep and saturated color, so it is dark brown for sure. But that's what I wanted. Only had to attach legs. Plenty of storage inside. Looks great in our loft. We are using as both coffee table and storage ottoman.", 
    "The quality of this bench was very surprising. The price was too good to be true. Had been looking for something for storage but wanted an elegant looking piece. This fit the need and very classy!", 
    "This storage bench was torn with in the first three month. Next month would have been two years since I purchased it and its already in the garbage. Piece of junk.", 
    "I'm using it as a coffee table. Love the extra storage!Attractive and versatile", 
    "This bench has plenty of room to hide shoes inside.", 
    "I was very pleased with this item. It was easily assembled and looks very expensive. The size is perfect for my small living area, and I love the storage where I can hide items when unexpected company drops in or pull out my favorite blanket to cover up with while watching television", 
    "Shipped and delivered on time and in one piece quality was good and color was as expected. Would recommend this item to all.", 
    "I love this storage bench - it's just what i was looking for. The storage space inside is a little smaller than I expected but still substantial. It's soft enough on top to comfortably rest your feet on it but firm enough to keep a tray for drinks, candles, etc. Looks really nice. Pretty dark brown color. No complaints!", 
    "I got this bench today and I am so happy with it. The color is brown not black as other reviews stated. I actually think it's a chestnut to walnut color not espresso. Construction is excellent. You get REAL WOOD feet which you will know is rare if you have been shopping for a storage bench. The top is really firm with a little give, more like Styrofoam or egg crate foam than that mushy yellow foam that compresses over time. The finish is matte with dimension not that shiny fake leather. This bench out-classes any I've seen in this price range. Shipping was almost overnight and the packaging was pristine when I got it. Love love love it!", 
    "This bench is exactly what I hoped and expected based on the description and photos. It arrived quickly and the only assembly required is screwing the feet on the bottom, which is quite easy. The one minor nuisance is that the paint on the feet rubs off easily, leaving flakes as you screw the feet onto the bench. I tried to stick non-slip/non-scratch footpads on the bottom but they won't stick to the bottom of the feet. All in all, I'm quite satisfied.", 
    "Love this storage bench. It's well made and holds a lot. Not too big and very versatile.", 
    "I have this bench in the center of my bathroom for an accent piece. Very eye catching!", 
    "I love this it ,was perfect for the foot of my bed!", 
    "I am buying this one again and I'll recommend it to anyone that is looking for elegant and practical", 
    "I love this it's well built and looks great in my living room.", 
    "This looks awesome in my living room. It was a good price considering I have been looking around and something like this costs much more at stores! I love it because I use it in the living room and I don't have to worry about my granddaughter hurting herself on the corners. It's not too big...just the right size !", 
    "Really do like this product.....bought to use as a window seat but decided to use as a sofa bench.....needed some extra storage...would have liked for it to have had more ....but it really looks good...my daughter first reply was \"That's pretty\"...so past her test...would definitely recommend...the color is a very dark expresso brown..", 
    "This is my favorite bench it looks so nice in my room.", 
    "i thought this would be a little bigger, it doesnt hold as many things as i would like. but its cute and looks nice", 
    "Delivered well packed, easy to assemble, rich dark color brown, plenty of room inside, though lid does not fully open to 90 degree angle it opens far enough for normal use and it does remain open using the hinges.", 
    "It's a perfect fit~used for extra seating!", 
    "Color is great. Looked just like the picture. Very sturdy. Only had to put on the legs. The rest was already assembled. Great value for the money.", 
    "Ordered this bench after looking at many benches on Overstock and other places. I was looking for shoe storage for my foyer. As stated in other reviews, they are very nice looking and do NOT look cheap, but they are definitely a very dark brown, almost black color. I ordered two for my foyer and one arrived with a minor ding to the vinyl from a gouge to the shipping box, but they are so dark, it is not noticeable. They weigh 40 pounds each according to the UPS delivery guy, so I did not even think about returning it. I have at least 14 pairs of shoes in each bench including men's dress shoes and athletic shoes, so they hold quite a bit of stuff (two rows, one on top of the other.) So far, they seem sturdy and are great for shoe storage and sitting on them to put on shoes. We will see how they hold up over time. Very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "the only thing to note is that the lid only opens half-way - it doesn't reach a 90 degree angle, only 45 degrees, which is a little weird but doesn't inhibit putting things in it.", 
    "Perfect accent to my living room", 
    "I purchased this item for my sister and she was so pleased with it she really cant stop smiling about this gift, Thank you for putting a smile on her face. and the price also amazing!", 
    "This was a perfect addition in my bedroom,", 
    "Look very good at the end of my bed", 
    "Well, I was sure fooled. For one, the bench is not 42 inches long. It is actually 41 inches, making the inside storage area even smaller. In the sales photo, they surround the bench with tiny books and vases on miniature cube shelves to try to make it seem bigger, but this bench is really child-sized. It reminds me of something you might find at ****. Other than the size illusion, it is exactly as pictured, and seems to be made of decent material.", 
    "Very easy set up. The quality is great. I love this product!!!!", 
    "Love this, it was exactly as described, and very beautiful. Would purchase again.", 
    "For the price this is an excellent buy. The faux leather looks pretty real. It is darker than pictured, almost black. Nice that the lid hinge holds the lid open so fingers don't get slammed in it.", 
    "I purchased this bench to put at the end of my bed. It's elegant and very well priced.", 
    "Great quality and durability. This piece texture of leather is durable and soft. I recommend the storage bench to compliment any area of the home.", 
    "I was very pleased with this piece. Perfect for my daughter's first apartment.", 
    "Roomy storage area and looks great on dark hardwood floors.", 
    "This is a very tiny bench. If the average size person sits in the middle of it, there will be about 2 inches left on each end. The feet actually sit crooked...I check them every few weeks because it looks like they want to break but each time I check they are still screwed in tight.", 
    "I think it is a good quality with plenty of storage space unit. I like that it opens up big and provides us a spot to put on our shoes, its a good piece to have", 
    "Love this item. Looks great in my home.", 
    "Is an excellent storage bench. Not terribly comfortable for long term sitting but looks great and serves the purpose.", 
    "exactly as described. perfect at the foot of the bed for storing extra pillows and blankets.", 
    "Very nice accent piece for your room. The chocolate color is beautiful. And it is very firm and stable. It is in front of my bed and I sit on it sometimes when I'm watching tv.", 
    "Poor quality - dog jumped on top of ottoman and immediately ripped the leather look vinyl. After a couple of days, legs start bending inward. Legs and supports cannot withstand weight/sitting on ottoman. Wish I could return it.", 
    "The dimensions of this bench were perfect under the window in our family room. It arrived on time, was easily assembled, and looked just as shown. It is multifunctional; serving as closed toy storage and extra seating. The hinge is well made and there have no pinched fingers as grandchildren can easily access toys.", 
    "This is a beautiful piece of furniture. I highly recommend it if you are looking for elegance and style.", 
    "Exactly how they described! Very nice! Good quality!", 
    "use at the end of my bed got it for a jumping step for my pet looks great", 
    "For the price, this is a super addition. I put this in my entryway, so people would have a place to sit when taking off their shoes. I was looking for something that wasn't too big and too bulky or so beautiful that people are afraid to use it.........this was my perfect compromise. It is classy yet not over the top, decent size, sturdy, good amount of storage and high enough off the ground to put a shoe mud tray underneath which is a must for my family. It came all assembled except for having to twist the legs in. Super easy, convenient, and nice looking. I think it's a great buy for the price.", 
    "Look nice for price. All intact, assembly easy--attach screw in legs.", 
    "Sturdy, comfortable and very nice piece of furniture in our family room.", 
    "Looking good. Very practical for use. Good quality.", 
    "A must have. Great price and very durable", 
    "This leather bench looks beautiful at the foot of our queen size bed! The tufting gives it a very elegant look. The top opens with ease because of hinges that don't let it fall down when you let go. It doesn't open 100%, but almost completely. I absolutely love it & have gotten complements on it.", 
    "This bench adds beauty and functionality to any room. I just wish it had a deeper storage pocket inside to hold more than two comforters or throws. Overall, it has a very sturdy base and weight that it's not easy to slide around when bumped.", 
    "Love the detailing! It is really dark, not quite black but pretty close. Took me 2 mins to puts the legs on. Super happy with this purchase. Looks a lot nicer than more expensive benches I have seen elsewhere. Inside storage is large. We currently have a swim bag, 2 backpacks and a helmet stored in there.", 
    "Bought this bench so my dog could jump onto my bed. It's much better than dog steps (which I have) since I can also use it for lots of storage. Great quality, great price & it looks awesome at the foot of my bed!", 
    "this is the perfect storage bench the end of our bed plenty of storage to hold up to 4 blankets and is very durable. Putting it together look maybe 5 minutes it took longer to get out of the box. Once again you can't go wrong when order from Overstock great items at reasonable prices and the quality is excellent.", 
    "I purchased this about 15 months ago and all the seams are bursting exposing the cotton material underneath. Complete waste of money. Overstock said it was out of the time limit to do any sort of return or replacement which I understand but it's kinda sad how quickly it fell apart.", 
    "This looks excellent in my room. It holds enough stuff to keep the clutter down, and looks very expensive. Super easy to assemble. Wish I had another area for anther one.", 
    "I have wanted a bench for the end of my bed forever! This one is perfect...and the fact that it also has storage is a huge bonus since our linen closet is so small. It seems very wel made and was so easy to put together (only the legs had to be out on). Very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "We bought this storage bench to put blankets in for watching tv. In person, it looked smaller than what I had anticipated. However, it actually fits a ton of our blankets and we are very happy with the purchase. We've had it for a few months and it still looks and functions like it is brand new. I was worried the buttons might pop off, but so far that has not happened.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for. It's much nicer than a ***** purchase etc...It has feet and looks great in the living room, we use it for toy storage. Opens up enough, not all the way but no problem for kids.", 
    "This was a real beauty. Goes well with my new couch and chair. Would recommend this product to anyone.", 
    "Pro: Looks great, thought it was a good purchase. If you'll never sit on it, it would be perfect. Con: Inferior workmanship, especially the support structure for the legs. I only sat on it to put my socks on and it has needed a few repairs.", 
    "I have this one at the end of my bed and keep extra clothing in it. Looks good and matches my bedroom furniture well. Good quality, sturdy and a very nice color.For the price a great deal.You won't go wrong with this purchase.", 
    "this is a perfect coffee table / bench for my living room.", 
    "This is a great storage bench. I was surprised at the quality of workmanship. However, the storage space is not as large as I had hoped it would be. I highly recommend it to anyone.", 
    "Looks really nice at the foot of the bed. This bench arrived in perfect condition and took 2 minutes to put together. You just need to screw the legs on. Very sturdy and serves its purpose.", 
    "I really like this storage bench. It is very decorative and nicely done. My only criticism is that the lid does not open all of the way. It would be nicer if it did. For the price, I think it is a good storage bench.", 
    "A basic storage bench. Easy to assemble. Looks decent. Like mentioned in other reviews, this looks kind of black. I'd like it to be more brown. Overall, satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "Plenty of storage room, comfortable. Great enhancement to any room.", 
    "Was a bit concerned about the style of this piece, however it definitely looks better than pictured It is both durable and functional.", 
    "This is the second ottoman that I have ordered. The first one was listed as 18\" high and 14\" deep. Those numbers were reversed and was sent back as 14\" was too low for the application. While this one looks and feels great, AGAIN the listing is incorrect. This time I called to request that the height be verified as 19\". I was assured that it was indeed 19 inches tall. That AGAIN was incorrect. It is only 17 inches and this barely works for the application in which I am going to use it. WHILE THE WORKMANSHIP IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE COST, THE LISTINGS ON THE WEB SITE ARE WORTHLESS!!!!! ASSUME THAT THE MEASUREMENTS LISTED ARE NOWHERE NEAR CORRECT!!!!!", 
    "I wanted something to put in the living area to store blankets and pillows for the guest futon. This bench is lightweight and does not eat up a ton of space. It fits 1 twin comforter, 1 twin fleece blanket and 1 standard pillow. I wish it had another 2-3 inches of storage height so I can squeeze in another pillow. The color is a textured dark brown and the legs are a bit of reddish brown. The only assembly needed is screwing in the legs. The top does not open 90 degrees -- closer to 70 degrees, but I found that sufficient because the bench is not that deep. A great piece!", 
    "After only 6 months, with little use, the buttons are beginning to pop off.", 
    "I ordered this bench to put in my bedroom along a wall of photos that I was hanging. It arrived earlier than expected! The bench is of excellent quality, I only needed to screw in the legs and it was ready to go! The bench provides a nice hinged top that stays open when you open it, which allows you to store items inside the bench. I did not expect this bench to be of this quality and couldn't be more pleased!", 
    "Excellent product. Easy to put together. Looks great, Holds quite a bit.", 
    "Very dark in color. Not a lot of storage, but holds a few blankets", 
    "I got the item in a bad condition because ups dropped it and just left it in front of our door bell. So when I call for replacement, they replaced my bench with a new one. The customer service was very courteous and polite explained me what to do with the old one. I am pleased with the product.", 
    "Got new bedroom furniture and wanted a bench for under our window. This was perfect! I keep all my scarves inside.", 
    "The color blends in perfectly with my Mauve/burgundy/black accent living room. It sits in front of my Bay Window and provides a little extra see seating for when I entertain. The storage area is perfect for my throw blankets for those chilly Winter nights. I definitely recommend this bench!", 
    "We wanted this piece for the foot of our bed, in the Master bedroom. The size is great. I actually wanted something just a bit taller, but those items are few and far between, and much more expensive! The price point on this is really great for the quality of the item. It arrived promptly, well packaged and in perfect condition. All you need to do is screw in the 4 feet which are enclosed in the storage area of the bench. I must say, one was a bit off and I considered asking Overstock to replace that foot, but we placed that on on the rear and when the bench is in place it does not even show at all. The bench sits square and level, so I don't think I will bother replacing it.It is synthetic leather, but looks great! We are very pleased with this purchase! Thanks Overstock!", 
    "I love this bench. I was unsure of what I would get, but I'm very happy with my purchase. It's sturdy and I love it!", 
    "I just love this bench! It was exactly what I was looking for. It is a darker color , but that is what I wanted, as I just purchased leather couches the same color. The tufted top makes it appear very high quality. I love the added storage in the lift top bench. But beware it doesn't open fully, but it isn't a problem, as you can get extra blankets and pillows into it. The only thing that I would of liked, is if the top of the bench were a little bigger. It was such an easy process ordering it online and I received it in 4 days. I am never disappointed in the quality products that Overstock sells.", 
    "Very fast service. For the price good quality material", 
    "I'm really happy with this bench. It looks nice, holds my pillows and blankets when i'm sleeping.", 
    "Exactly what I needed in front of my bedroom sofa. Perfect for keeping a few extra blankets.", 
    "Love, love, our storage bench, very well made, we keep it by our French doors and use it to store our shoes that we wear each day. . We purchased decorate cushion to protect the top and just to give it an added touch. When delivered it was well packaged and already assembled, all we had to do is put on the legs. Great piece for the price we paid.", 
    "Very nice, It was a little smaller than I thought it was going to be, but I placed it at the end of my bed to store my sheets and a blanket in. Looks nice.", 
    "does the job of holding the throw pillows from the bed", 
    "The ottoman is the perfect color. It matches my bedroom set and adds a nice touch to my theme. I absolutely love it!", 
    "Nice dark brown bench. Using it at the foot of a king size bed. Great to sit on and has storage inside for extra blanket. Easy to screw feet onto bottom. Happy with this purchase.", 
    "I bought this to use in a bump out wall of the master bedroom to sit on to change shoes, etc and for the storage. Initially I was concerned about how strong it was as my hubby is a big guy who weighs over 250 but it is strong enough for him to sit on. It comes assembled except for the 4 roundish feet which just screw on so anyone can handle that. I like the color. It is very, very dark brown. Almost, but not quite, a black. Doesn't look cheap at all. Looks very nice. Has a good depth to the interior. I like to swap out my bedspread/cover according to the seasons and, since we have a king size bed, our cover is rather large and bulky but it folds up and stores nicely in the storage area of the bench until needed again. One less thing to put in the closet. I am really impressed with this product. It arrived quickly and was well packaged and not damaged at all. It is a little heavy (which is a good thing!) so I had my hubby bring it inside when it arrived. This would also look very nice in a front hall or at the foot of a bed. I had even considered putting it in our large, walkin closet to sit on while changing in there. All in all it is a good deal and looks nice and really seems strong too.", 
    "Wa exactly as I expected it to be. Its isn't super soft to sit on, but it the height is great (we are tall and I worried that it might be low to the ground). Classy and functional. Great value!", 
    "Looked nice when we got it. Seemed like it was durable and good quality as well. We just needed something a little bigger. Was our own fault for not looking at the dimensions more closely.", 
    "this bench is made very well , it's very comfortable , looks great in the bedrooml only wish it was deeper --- I LOVE STORAGE! I could use a little more height to it I would highly recommand!", 
    "This is the perfect dimensions for the end of a queen size bed. The top is very firm so it may not be comfortable for long periods of sitting. The fact that it only opens 3/4 of the way does not bother me as I thought it might. The hinges allow the top to stay open on it's own without holding it open. I have put all my extra sheets in it and still have lots of extra room for more. Delivered quickly and had no problems. It came in perfect condition and you just need to screw in the legs. I wish I could add a picture for you to see, but I do not see on Overstock where to do this. Overstock, you need to make your site able to have customers add their photos of items purchased. Home pictures speak volumes!", 
    "I'm so happy with my storage bench ~ I purchased it for my master bathroom to sit in front of the tub area. It's used for a seat mostly and place to drop towels. It looks beautiful and very streamlined like I wanted. The other reviewers commented on the fact that the lid doesn't completely open, which isn't a trouble for me. My only concern is that it feels very light. It's not a heavy piece and I hope that doesn't mean that it isn't sturdy. So far, it's doing fine. Very happy with my order and would definitely recommend it to someone looking for an attractive and useful bench.", 
    "Very Easy to put together. It's a great size! Good amount of storage!", 
    "I purchased this bench for my bedroom to store my duvet and a set of extra sheets. The top only opens about 40 degrees which is going to make it difficult to get anything into it and impossible to see while standing. Also, this bench is black not dark brown.", 
    "Ok not as much storage room as I would have liked"
