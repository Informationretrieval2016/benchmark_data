    "My first negative experience with Overstock after years of many purchases... First let me say that I finally have the correct table and it is very nice, the 3 star rating comes from the poor customer service. This table first arrived EXTREMELY damaged. I honestly can't imagine how there was any oversight to allow that to be sent out. I called Customer Service (a very lengthy phone call) and they arranged to send me replacement pieces...several days later...the package arrived and I was eager to assemble my table, particularly because I had already assembled the matching end table that I'd ordered with the original. Unfortunately the parts were completely wrong, and the wood did not even match. This worried me because even if the parts were right I needed them to match the end table. Another lengthy call to Customer Service and they arranged to send an entire new table. But wait...first I had to repack and send back the damaged table. Yet another waste of my time because the table, packaging materials and box were in very poor shape (which caused the original problem). However, I complied and another several days later I finally had my table, which is very nice. I have read reviews like this before and have kind of ignored them because they don't reflect the product itself. When it actually happens though, the experience is really negative. I think Overstock could do more to make sure that this doesn't happen, but also to recognize that they should compensate or at least acknowledge the time and energy that this takes from their customers.", 
    "Super fast shipping as always!!! The picture does not do this table justice, I put it together in 35 minutes!!! I have come to the conclusion that some of the people reviewing this table are crazy. I mean, the packaging was fine and I just vacuumed the foam particles, not a big deal. The table is perfect and color is superb. Do not think about it twice get your today worth every penny!!!", 
    "i love this table. very classy and beautiful color. easy to put together; my husband had it together before i got home and didn't complain! worth the money.", 
    "I was looking for a cost effective alternative for a tv stand. I wanted to spend less that $150, have it be attractive and, possibly, have another use when we move in a couple of years. Mission accomplished with the Lewis Wood Sofa table. easy to assemble. Sturdy enough for a flat screen tv. a welcomed addition to our apartment living room! great buy!", 
    "There were many reviews on this product that reported damage in shipping. Mine arrived just fine, and in great time too. It was very easy to put together, as others have suggested. My one suggestion on assembling this table is to make sure to get all hardware in place before tightening everything down. This may help keep the table balanced and avoid that unevenness that several people have reported. My table isn't wobbly--all four legs sit evenly on the floor. One reviewer did comment that she would not let her 15 month old pull up on this table, and she is right. Overall the table is very sturdy, for things like setting down a pile of mail or car keys, or displaying a vase of flowers; but, it is not meant for climbing on, that is for sure. The warm espresso finish is so welcoming. The finish is a smooth, satiny finish--not shiny, which I like, but it may be helpful when ordering to know this in advance. I think the finish is well done, and as others have suggested, this piece does look more expensive than it is. It really is a great value, and the size is really nice for smaller spaces. I have it in my foyer and it doesn't overpower the space at all. The one criticism I have of the piece is that the fit of the legs into the shelf and table top are not so snug. This is the difference between a \"good\" review and \"great\" for me. If someone takes the time to look very closely, they will see gaps where the legs attach. Overall, amazing table at a more than fair price.", 
    "Very excited to receive the table. Loved the color right away. Looks fantastic in my entryway. However, after my husband assembled the table (easy to do), the legs are uneven and the table wobbles. My husband cut out cardboard from the box it shipped in and placed it under two of the legs and now it doesn't wobble. Probably wouldn't wobble on carpet. May have to change the location in which we have it.", 
    "The actual color is a little bit darker than picture. Nice wood and easy to put together.", 
    "When I first received this table it had a defect. There were bumps on the table top from the screws underneath. I filled out the return information online and quickly received an email from Overstock which included a prepaid return label and a message stating a new one was on it's way. The second table that I received was great. Easy to put together and looks great in my foyer. I am going to order the end table to match.", 
    "This table is just what I was looking for. It took me less ten minutes to put it together once I got off all the packaging. It looks great and its the perfect size. I put it in my entryway and get compliments everytime people walk in. The delivery was super fast too I ordered it Tuesday and had it by Friday.", 
    "I purchased this sofa table months ago, but just recently moved into my house and assembled it last weekend. I bought it to match the espresso Lewis Wood coffee table and end tables. A friend and I were able to assemble this piece manually in about 20 minutes, and we're two 20-something year old girls, so that demonstrates how easy the instructions were to follow! This piece looks wonderful in my living room - the finish is gorgeous, there are no imperfections, and it's a very sizeable and quality piece of furtniture for the price I paid. The wood is very stury - not cheap looking at all - and I anticipate getting many years of use out of it. I absolutely recommend this table and am extremely pleased with all of my experiences with Overstock so far.", 
    "This was a pretty table and would have looked nice in the room had the wood color been lighter. It is much darker than it appears in the picture. It's almost black, like a very dark walnut. But the finish is nice - sleek and modern. Also, the hardware bag was broken when I received it so I'm not sure I could have put it together even if it had matched. I had to return it.", 
    "Was skeptical when ordering, but fit beautifully with existing furniture, extremly sturdy and solid. It's definitely a bargain.", 
    "I would have given another star if I would have received a better deal for the damage. Who wants to return a big shipment for a scratch? I think they may count on this...? But because I'm putting it in a low visibility area I bit the bullet and accepted their measly $** concession.", 
    "Perfect for our entryway and looks great too. The table has overall solid construction.", 
    "Very pleased with this sofa table bought almost 2 years ago on Overstock. It's still in great shape, looks great and no alteration.", 
    "It took me 5 minutes to assemble the table while I was on the phone with my husband[he's deployed]. I received instant compliments when my friends and neighbors saw the table. I will be ordering the matching coffee table and end tables.", 
    "As a new homeowner I am looking for furniture to cover walls. This piece of furniture is beautiful! I was hesitant to put this together because i'm not handy at all. This was the easiest piece to put together! The color is perfect, dark walnut color. This table is very sturdy and nice and heavy. (35#) I would def reccommend this to other people!!", 
    "We purchased this table for our front entry. It is the perfect addition for the room. The table is solid wood and looks more expensive than it costs. We have never bought a piece of furniture sight unseen and were worried what the quality of the table was going to be. The sofa table wood is great quality, low price, and you won't be disappointed.", 
    "This sofa table is absolutely magnificent! The pieces all fit together so nicely, and assembly is easy. The picture does not do this table justice, it is a super-heavy extremely solid piece that you will love! I just purchased two matching end tables to go along with it.", 
    "The table arrived after a few short days of ordering. I am an \"older\" female with no mechanical skills and I was able to put the table together alone with absolutely no problem. This table resides in my terrace level entryway and has received compliments from everyone who has seen it.", 
    "This is my first order through Overstock.com and it will not be my last. I received my shipment quickly (within 5 days) of my order placement. My table was packaged inside the box tightly and securely with Styrofoam and the small pieces were wrapped to prevent damage. Everything arrived in one piece! Assembly was easy with the included hardware and took me about 30 minutes. The piece is solid (35 lbs) beautiful and rich looking. The design and style compliment the entryway of my new home and I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with the finished product.", 
    "Bought this and the Lewis side table. Really like them both. Expected them to be cheap but they are really good looking. Were also much easier to put together than most of the furniture I've purchased online. And I love the curve to them--very pretty. Would buy any Lewis stuff again.Caveat: took careful tightening of bolts to keep them from having any wobble, but it worked.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Tool 15 mins. Great to view and it seems strong. It not solid wood but looks like solid wood.", 
    "The table is beautiful. It looks just like i expected.", 
    "I let my daughter have my piano and needed something else for that wall. This table filled in nicely. It has a very nice shape, and the height and width is what I really appreciated as there were many tables online that were too short or not wide enough, or both. It looks great next to my cream colored wall. I put framed photos on top and a planter of greenery on the bottom, and have received compliments on it.", 
    "I purchased this table for my foyer. It arrived within a reasonable time, and the set was easy. My 11 year old daughter put it together. After she finished assembling it we moved it to its designated area. Its light weight, sturdy, affordable, and beautiful.", 
    "Even nicer then I imagined!! Love it!!", 
    "put this in my dining room, looks great. would've given it 5 stars, but 1 of the legs is a bit shorter than the rest. but looks nice with some flowers and photo frames. good bargain.", 
    "Just received this table yesterday and it was very easy to put together (15min) and looks beautiful in our foyer.", 
    "My wife wanted a table for our entry hall. After looking in furniture stores and not finding what she wanted, she found this online. It's a good size for the hall and looks very nice,( and I don't have to go to any more furniture stores).", 
    "Elegant design, not busy with a contemporary and subtle feel (dark espresso color).", 
    "Using it in hallway. Great price and looks nice for hall table", 
    "Love this sofa table,been trying to do this since I got it in October thanks", 
    "This table was exactly as described and provides a great counter space at the top of a stair landing between two doors. The curved top especially accommodates the space - instead of hard corners to bump into between the two rooms, the curved edges provide enough room yet also the counter / table top for a small amount of items. The shelf beneath provides extra storage as well. I have a decorative box on the lower shelf that hides lots of \"stuff\" that I don't want to leave out but want handy access to.",

    "Nicely constructed- easy to assemble", 
    "Just what I'd hoped it would be. It's narrow, but deep enough for my TV and stereo w/ speakers. Assembles very easily, looks smart and lovely with the sleigh bed, and it fits against the wall allowing walking space past the bed. I'd recommend it to everyone, it's one of those \"glad I bought it\" things!", 
    "This is a very sturdy piece of furniture. It was very easy to assemble. We like it very much.", 
    "It's great I love the table.", 
    "This was very easy to assemble, perfect color and height for what I needed and classy.",

    "Looks good.. Easily assembled. Blends in well with other items in my condo.", 
    "Love this table. Perfect in entryway.", 
    "Looks exactly as pictured. Perfect size, contempory style. Only complaint is package of packing beads broken and they were everywhere.", 
    "A bit light. Came damaged, but Overstock was very good about replacing the damaged part.", 
    "This sofa table is very nice and looks very expensive, no one would ever guess that it didn't cost that much.",

    "Love it, easy to assemble adds character to the room", 
    "Very annoying to open a package and spend time getting the parts in order to assemble only to find out that the factory packed the wrong pieces. We received 4 back legs and no front legs. We can make them work if we drill new holes for the screws. But very poor quality assurance.", 
    "Very nice addition to our foyer. It has a very rich color and made from solid materials. It was easy to put together and matches almost everything. Very pleased with this purchase", 
    "I love it, fits perfect in my living room!",

    "great table that looks great in our den!", 
    "Easy to assemble and it looks great. It looks expensive too! I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "This table has been in our lobby for 2 years and is sturdy and timeless. Easy to assemble.", 
    "This table is perfect for the space I wanted it in. Very easy to assemble. I took more time and trouble to inbox it can clean up the mess. Wish we could upload pictures so buyers can get a better sense of what it looks like in use.", 
    "It fits nicely near the entrance and is beautiful to look at. I have my favorite pictures and lamp sitting there. It's a welcome piece everyday.", 
    "Looks great, good quality and very easy to assemble.", 
    "Perfect color and perfect size for the spot we wanted to place this table. It is dark wood and the color of the wood is uniform. The table was easy to assemble.", 
    "Great little console table which is being used at the end of a hallway in our church. We place informational brochures and holiday decorations on it. We have had it a few years now and it still looks great, even with church hallway traffic.", 
    "I purchased this table over 5 years ago. I have moved with this table several times and have always been able to take it apart and put it back together. It's true to the picture and is sturdy. If it bangs into something, it will chip a little.", 
    "I rated this one as 4 stars because I really like the look and color, the setup was very easy; however, this product is strongly overpriced. I've purchased accent tables comparable to this one for no more than $89. the only reason I'm keeping it is because it does look nice and I purchase it for a client and it fits the decor.", 
    "Very happy with this table. I have had it a few years now; used it as entry table for a while, used it as side table to desk for books with small shred machine on lower shelf, and now I am using it to hold 42 inch flat screen TV in my effort to streamline and simplify furnishings.", 
    "THSI SOFA TABLE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL BUY. IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND ELEGANT. VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER . THE COLOR IS PERFECT AN BLEND WELLS WITH MY FURNITURE", 
    "With all the animals & children walking through my foyer I expected this table to scuff or possibly even require an anchor on the wall to avoid tipping but it's been a perfect addition to my home. I think it's been almost a year already and I still LOVE this sofa table.", 
    "Fits the space really well. Great purchase.", 
    "This piece looks very high-quality and exceeded my expectations.", 
    "Has worked great for us. We love it", 
    "Not a heavy piece, but still well-made and it was easy to assemble. No dings on it when it arrived which is always a plus.", 
    "I am so happy this looks great in my hallway", 
    "I love this table. It was just what I was looking for. Wood was darkerthan I thought but it still looks nice!", 
    "very pretty table. easy to assemble. Looks great behind my sofa.", 
    "This is a simple table. Was very easy to put together. Looks way better than the cost. Was perfect for where we needed it - in our hallway. Picture above, lamp, plant and some books underneath - looks fantastic!", 
    "Great beautiful table. Just like picture easy assemble. Looks great.", 
    "Looks very nice in my living room.", 
    "Great quality, felt like the price was a little much for such a small piece of furniture. Overall beautiful piece to add to the living room.", 
    "Love this piece. Nice addition to my foyer.", 
    "Looks perfect with all of our furniture being espresso color. It's classy and looks really nice!!", 
    "The first box arrived damaged, so we didn't even open it, but contacted Overstock who took care of it immediately and sent us a replacement table. My husband assembled it with no problems and it looks perfect in our foyer. I am very pleased with the quality of the table and the service provided by Overstock.", 
    "The table shipped quick and looks great. It looked just as it did online. It was easy to assemble and priced great. One leg did have a dime size chunk out of it but no other problems or scratches so we chose to just fix it ourselves with a little wood filler and you can't even tell :)", 
    "I purchased this console for my daughter. She said it was very easy to assemble and looks great in her new apartment. It also arrived in less than a week of ordering.", 
    "Beautiful table. Fits perfect under my TV that hangs on the wall. I put it together in less then 15 minutes.", 
    "I purchased this piece about 4 years ago and it is still in beautiful condition. It's a great looking piece and fits almost anywhere. I loved it then and I still love it now.", 
    "The product color and quality is as described in the listing. Looks great in our entryway.", 
    "I like it . It is very good with the mirror on top of it .", 
    "Beautiful. Classis and not overpowering. Light weight, easy to assemble, arrived in just a few days and was well packed. Blends in perfectly.", 
    "would recommend, easy to assemble and it looks really nice", 
    "Works great in the entrance with a mirror. Not very sturdy and only a good decorative piece.", 
    "The table was packed very well with styrofoam blocks, panels and sheets, so it was in pristine condition on arrival. Assembly was simple, but it helps to have a power screwdriver instead of only the Allen wrench to attach parts. Color is as pictured, a dark brown finish. The shape is good for a foyer or area with foot traffic, as there are no corners to bump.", 
    "Just want I wanted for my foyer. Nice piece for the price. As described. I am happy with my purchase. 2nd time buyer from overstock and I am pleased.", 
    "Very pleased, easy to put together quality excellent", 
    "First, let me say that the shipping was so fast, it was amazing. I was so excited to receive my table and it only took my 13 year old and me about 20 minutes to assemble. The wood is beautiful and looks perfect in our entryway. If you are considering this table, read all of the great reviews and order yours immediately.", 
    "The price and value of this product was exactly what I was looking for. Small amount of assembly required and it was quick and easy.", 
    "Nice piece at a good price.. Easy to assemble. Looks great.", 
    "This table is perfect for my entryway. Looks very nice.", 
    "Again, I ordered this product at the last minute and it still arrived on time. The assembly was so easy, my 15 year old son assembled it in 15 minutes. It is beautiful", 
    "This is a lovely table that was very easy to assemble and fits nicely in our new home's foyer. Good quality wood and simple lines make this an elegant piece and the price was great. I wasn't expecting such a nice piece of furniture for the price, but that's what I got. Very pleased with the entire purchase. The table arrived without a blemish, too.", 
    "This wood table was so easy to put together, legs and bottom shelf fit with so much ease. Only tool me less than a half hour to put up. Look great in the entrance hallway of my apartment. Everyone thinks that I paid mor than it did. It's my secrect :)", 
    "I really like my new entryway table. It looks expensive and has a high quality looking wood. It was a little tricky to put together, but didn't take too long. The way the wood was cut in one spot, required some force to fit the leg in, and you also have to first just screw everything in loosely, line everything up exactly right, then tighten the top, then the bottom. But eventually, it all worked out and I have a very nice looking piece of furniture. It looks fancy, but not too frilly. Simple and sophisticated, with a little bit of flair with the curvy legs. It is wider across than most I think, but doesn't stick out too far from the wall, if you have a narrow hallway. The color is dark and rich and smooth, with a bit of subtle grain. When my kids touch it, it leaves fingerprints behind quite easily though. I think it creates a nice first impression when someone enters your home. It has plenty of room to put a lamp, a decorative bowl with spheres, and another ornamental statue thing I have on the top level. Underneath I put a couple books and a photo frame, and a silver mirror above it on the wall. It looks amazing!", 
    "I purchased this table several weeks ago. Price was excellent & it arrived very quickly. It took me less than 30 minutes to assemble. The finish is beautiful, probably a little darker than it appears in the pictures, but I love it. It has been a nice addition to my living room. I've received a lot of compliments, everyone wants to know where I got it. I would definitely recommend this product!", 
    "Absolutely beautiful table. Super easy to assemble. Will be purchasing another one for another area in our house.", 
    "This table was better than I expected for the price. The color is great and it looks more expensive than it is. It's the perfect size for my foyer.", 
    "Love the style of this table so much. Love looking at this table. Fits perfectly where I stationed it. Was easy to assemble.", 
    "Great quality and easy to assemble. Looks great against a wall.", 
    "Looks great. Easy assembly. Would definitely buy again", 
    "We moved into a new home and I needed to buy my first sofa table. Really looks great!", 
    "We needed a sofa table to put behind our transitional styled sectional. It needed to look good near our dark, antique dining room furniture, and it had to have a slim profile. This table fit the bill perfectly! Looks nice with the mahogany dining room wood as well as the black brown wood in our family room. The curved legs gives it a very small footprint which was extremely important for us. It was easy to assemble, seems sturdy and though is not top quality furniture, it looks very nice. What this table lacks in quality, is more than made up in function, style and price!", 
    "I purchased this for my living room and it is a beautiful addition to my living room. Lots of compliments on how nice it makes the entry way look into my home. I'm very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I am glad I ordered this table. It is very good quality and extremely easy to assemble. It's beautiful and would fit great in any d\u00e9cor.", 
    "Great table for entry or hallway. Is solid piece that looks very nice. For the money it is a great accent to any home. Color slightly lighter than pics but close.", 
    "Like the look of the table. Originally it was missing hardware to assemble, but company shipped missing hardware in a matter of days to my home.", 
    "I was looking for a table with a unique design for the hallway and this fit the bill perfectly. I like the round edges and curved legs, gives a softer and different look than the usual \"square\" furniture. The finish is nice, sort of a dark brown/espresso color, a little glossy. I'm docking it one star because it is light (25 lbs?) and can tip over, probably they use a less dense wood, but I guess you get what you pay for. Also the bottom shelf doesn't fit into the notches exactly, but not a problem since there's brackets holding it in place. Overall it is decent quality, definitely not high end but good enough and looks expensive which is what I was going for. I would say it is a fair value for what you get, stylish design without the expensive price.", 
    "Simple to assemble, and nice sturdy build. Very stylish, and seems to be pretty well made. Color is quite dark, as an espresso is supposed to be. Perfect entryway table for us, and very happy with the quality, shipping and price. Would order this again and recommend.", 
    "Very happy with the table. Easy to assemble and a quality product.", 
    "Looks great in my foyer, product shipped timely, exactly as described, easy to assemble and elegant. Loved the price too!", 
    "Love this table. Went together easily and looks great.", 
    "The price of this table is far lower on O than local furniture stores for great quality product. I have it as an entry table and I gets raves from visitors on the uniqueness and durability. Another great buy from O!!", 
    "Very Happy with the purchase and quality of product", 
    "Never have I read through so many reviews before purchasing an item!. But since I have more time than funds now that I'm retired, it paid off to do my homework. It was reassuring to read that those who had problems in shipping got replacement parts or another table. I was surprised that many who mentioned a flaw in the table still l liked it enough to fix or ignore the flaw. I even found one reviewer who had used this table to replace a piano, just as I wanted to do. Fortunately, I was among the large majority of purchasers for whom everything went right -- tracking, prompt delivery, unusually well- packed, excellent condition, all the parts. My husband and I, not notable handypersons, unpacked, sorted and put it together on the padded dining room table, carefully following the really simple instructions and remembering various reviewers' hints. Although darker than my other dark woods, it fits in just as I'd expected. . I couldn't find anything I would like as well. for anywhere near the price. I will recommend that friends and family check Overstock.com for furniture items", 
    "I cant convey in text how happy this table makes me lol. The table costs very little but looks like I spent much more getting it at places like Pier One. The size is great which I was scared about it being too small but its just the perfect fit. I've got a candle holder, a picture, and a lamp sitting on it with room to spare. Its sturdy and holds up to my full grown cats always jumping up on it and lounging. Great table I couldn't be more happy with it.", 
    "this table is very beautiful. It looks expensive and the price is cheap compare with the ones I saw at the furniture stores. It is very stable, especially when I put it against the walls and it helps with 4 legs instead of 3. Delivery was very fast and It took us only 20 minutes to put it all together. I am so happy with this purchase. Love it.", 
    "Very pleased with this table. The quality is excellent ,easy to assemble and looks great in my home.", 
    "Nice side table. Good value. Pictures accurate. Would recommend.", 
    "This is an excellent table and works with in a foyer. It was very easy to assemble and everyone loves it.", 
    "I bought this table 2 years. I bought it to put my portable CD player with 2 speaker on it. It worked out great. Also, I bought 3 baskets to put my CD's in and I put it on the bottom shelve. That worked out great. I love this table. Just the right size for my bedroom.", 
    "Easy to put together. Did it myself in 30 minutes. Table looks very expensive and elegant. Great for entry way.", 
    "This table fits perfectly in the entry way and I am very pleased with it. I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to friends.", 
    "This only took me about 30 minutes to put together. It is nice quality, and looks nice as an entry way piece.", 
    "I was extremely surprised with the beautiful quality of this sofa table. I wanted something new that had the look of something older, and this fit perfectly. It is a very nice size for a smaller room to give the room character. I purchased it for a dining room to go with an antique china closet, and am thrilled with the way it blends the old and new.The table is heavy and stable. It was very easy to put together. It took about 15 minutes with my husband's help. The top is very nice quality, and I would buy it again without hesitation.", 
    "It was easy to put together. Nice wood grain. Instructions missing final step to do a final tightening of the leg screws once the mid table screws are tight. I tightened the edge leg screws first so that nothing would end up crooked and it came out nicely leveled.", 
    "Love this new table! Great quality and easy to put together. Looks beautiful in my living room!", 
    "The table fits really well for what I needed it for. The bottom of the table didn't fit exactly perfect but there was enough bolts that holds it on, so no big deal", 
    "Table arrived on time. Table had many wood filler areas in which the wood filler was much lighter and did not match stain. Deep indentations and scratches that were stained over. I would stay away from this product. Very disappointed!!", 
    "My husband surprised me and put this table together in about 20 minutes. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Great purchase!", 
    "I really like this table. I purchased the coffee and end tables that match, and they look great in my living room. Easy assembly. Pretty presentation.", 
    "I am so glad I purchased this console table. I put it in our hallway and it is beautiful!! It was easy to put together too, it only took my husband 10 minutes.", 
    "Legs are a little off alignment. Wouldn't want my 19 month old to pull up on this table. Great product for the price. Would recommend.", 
    "Table matches my other Espresso furniture very well. Fit perfectly in my hall. Very easy to assemple. Took me less than 30 min. No problems. Wood had no scratches or blemishes. Perfectly packaged. Shipping was fast & on time via UPS. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "This table sits under our wall mounted 32 inch tv and is next to a doorway into a hall. It is exactly what I wanted. The curve of the table doesn't allow the table to block the doorway, so it is great for small rooms. It looks very classy.", 
    "This table is a beautiful color and very well made. We get lots of compliments on it.", 
    "Table arrived safely, and after reading the instructions, simple to assemble.", 
    "This is a nice sofa-table. I put it together in about 25 minutes...good instructions, labeled parts, easy for one person to do! I am using this for a television stand for a 39 inch flat screen television...and it looks great!", 
    "This table is stunning. Very rich color and very solidly made. It is far more sophisticated and beautiful in person than what you see on the monitor. Was super easy to assemble. Instruction were very clear. I've received numerous compliments and they have been amaze when I told them how little I paid for it. I ordered 2, one was damaged and returned with no issue. Customer service was outstanding and solved the issue promptly. If you are considering this table, do take the plunge you will be quite thrilled you did.", 
    "Great foyer table to throw keys and mail on, but it looks so nice, I won't let anyone put anything on it! This is great for a small space because the rounded shape helps traffic flow around it and the little shelf on the bottom is great. Wonderful product and it will last a long time!", 
    "A perfect fit for the back of my sofa. Perfect color and great quality and great price.", 
    "We got our table yesterday... it took my husband maybe 15-20 minutes to put together and its perfect! The color is so rich and beautiful we absolutely love it! We want to find end tables for our living room that are similar. The quality is superb, especially compared to most things you can buy off the internet. Highly recommend this product!", 
    "Smooth assembly, I had all the parts that I needed and I think it looks great as a wall table in my dining room. The color was an exact match to the picture and description. There is a slight wobble, but nothing significant. Considering the price, I think it is a great value.", 
    "I love this table. It was just what I was looking for. Color and size are great. Much nicer than comparable tables for a lot less cost.", 
    "Looks great, just as pictured. Quality is great and it took all of 10 minutes to put up!", 
    "Delivery was prompt, the box arrived unharmed and well secured with styrofoam packing. It was very easy to assemble, everything lined up perfectly and it sits completely level. I chose this console table because it's legs match the curved out legs of my Ashley furniture end tables. The only negative I found was the stapling of twine to the underside to secure the table during shipping. I was not able to remove the staples so I just removed the twine like rope. I can't see the staples and they don't protrude through the top. It is a beautiful table and well worth the prize. I'm glad I chose it.", 
    "This was a great buy especially for the price. there was a small issue with the table being off balance on a hard surface but a small tack at the bottom of the front leg balanced it perfectly. If it were sitting on carpet it would not have even been an issue at all. I have purchased a lot of furniture online over the years but this table had to have been the easiest assembly yet 15 minutes at the most.", 
    "This was a Christmas gift for my mother and she absolutely loved it!", 
    "This is a great table for the money, looks beautiful in my entrance way. The table is sturdy , delivery was fast and assembly was easy. I pondered about this table for over a year, don't hesitate, buy it. You will not be disappointed.", 
    "Was a snap to put together, perfect size for the space I needed it. Great price.", 
    "I love this piece, it really changes the total look of the room, very rich and formal looking!", 
    "This table is a good addition to our den. The deep cherry finish is rich and matches our other wood pieces.", 
    "the table looks very nice however the table top came with many small scratches in the corners, the legs also wobble so we had to shimmy it with cardboard, overall for the price it is a nice table", 
    "This table is just what I was looking for to put behind my fairly low profile couch. It arrived really fast and it was not difficult to assemble. It is much heavier than it looks in the picture... it feels like a much more expensive table. The color is pretty much as shown on the site... a deep espresso, but not too black (a lot of that color description turns out to be way too dark)", 
    "Was looking for an entry table which wouldn't take up too much room. This was a great option. Size is perfect! Color exactly what I expected based on photos. Easy quick assembly. Not as solid as some of my more expensive furniture items, but quality very good considering the affordable price!", 
    "Besides I had to call customer service for other parts of the table, the table is beautiful. It was easy to put together and the quality is great. It looks darker than I expected but it works well with all other furnitures I have in my living room.", 
    "Malaysia made,good quality and nicely packed and delivered on time", 
    "Bought this table over a year ago.very easy to put together. Solid,stable nice looking table. Looks much more expensive like from a nice furniture store. People can not believe I got it from Overstock.com",

    "Great value. Wonderful addition to my family room. The top originally arrived damaged, but after calling Overstock.com, the person ordered a new top and kept me updated via email. The new top arrived in perfect condition. Easy to assemble. Overstock.com has great customer service...a real person on the telephone line!", 
    "The table looks great after it is put together. However, I found it somewhat difficult to put assemble. Some of the table legs did not match the holes in the table top. So it was harder to get them in place. However, the finished product is great and looks good against any wall in the house. The lines are beautiful and the color enriches any room. Great buy!", 
    "We were very happy with the quality of the table especially for the price. I also used a coupon code and had free shipping too. This table looks as if it was bought at the local furniture gallery. It looks great in our foyer and can hold alot of items. We plan to decorate it for different holidays as well. Definitely worth the price. We are very satisified!", 
    "This table is in my foyer and looks great. Holds a lamp and various items and is not cluttered. Really enjoying this table.", 
    "I have used the sofa table for over 1-1/2yrs now and it looks great--one small chip from a grandchilds toy but a little touchup stain and it looks like new again. Was very easy to put together and I expect many more years of wear and beauty from this peice.", 
    "Perfect table for my entry hall. No problems with packing, or putting it together. A fine addition to any household at a good price as well .",

    "I am extremely happy with this table. It is extremely well made and looks very beautiful.", 
    "Extremely impressed with quality of this table. It went together easily and quick. I think it took about 20 minutes in total. Box was a bit beat up when it got here, but everything was well protected. It is gorgeous in my entry way. Couldn't be more happier with the purchase.", 
    "look...it's perfect for the purpose. looks good and quality is better than average. easy to put together.", 
    "I am very pleased with the product and would purchase it again if the need would arise", 
    "Table met our expectations and was a great buy and the quality Is excellent!", 
    "This is the perfect simple console table. I put it against the wall in my entryway and put some decorations on it to spice it up and I love it.", 
    "Great table for the price. A piece that you could use anywhere in your home, not just a sofa table. Quick shipping and very easy to put together. Extremely happy with this purchase.", 
    "I love this table, very good quality peice for the price", 
    "I have several pieces of furniture from Overstock and they are of very fine quality and very beautiful.", 
    "I absolutely love this table. It looks gorgeous in my foyer and looks way more expensive than what I actually paid for it. If your undecided just go for it because you will not be dissappointed. Im glad I purchased it and it looks even better with all the accessories I put on it. Love the sturdy quality of this table as well.",

    "Awesome service. Received the item and one leg was broken. Called customer support and within 2 days had a replacement.", 
    "We had been doing a ton of research on many different websites and stores looking for the perfect sofa table to match our already existing TV stand that we purchased at Best Buy. I stumbled upon the Lewis Wood Sofa Table a couple months back and saved it on my computer. When we had no such luck with any other websites, I came back to this one and still was completely in love with it! Ordered it and it came in 3-5 days. Assembled it in 10-15min! It fits BEAUTIFULLY into our home! I could not be happier with this purchase. It's sturdy and the color is spot on to our entertainment stand which was my one worry. It's not too big but not too small. I would definitely recommend this table to others. You will not be disappointed! :)", 
    "Table more beautiful in person. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Love this tables. They were very easy to put together and the final product is great.", 
    "I purchased this not knowing if I would use it behind a sofa or as a hallway console table. I ended up doing the latter. It's a very versatile piece, looks more expensive than it was and fairly easy to put together. I did it myself without too much trouble. Looks great!", 
    "This table was very easy to assemble; took about 30 minutes. The instructions were very straightforward and it comes with all the bolts and Allen wrench to put together. It looks great in my foyer, as I've been looking for one of these tables for quite some time.", 
    "I really like this table. It fits perfect in my Foyer. However, it was delivered with scratches on the edge of the table top. I purchased a furniture crayon and filled in the scratches. It looks okay. I considered returning product but the hassle of repacking was too overwhelming. Assembling table was fairly easy. It is light weight and easy to move around. I did have to level the table by placing skid tabs under base of legs. After I did that the table no longer wobbled.", 
    "I'm a hard girl to please, I was looking for a particular style that would match my living room and not break the bank. I found just what I needed in this table it fit the space perfectly. Its well made and sturdy I had this table for six months and would recommend this purchase.", 
    "Looks very elegant with the curves and dark wood. Very easy to put together.", 
    "I need an entry way table. Wanted something that looked good but not expensive. Local stores had very similar tables for close to $200. I found this table on overstock and am happy I did. This is a very plain table; meaning not a lot of scrolling in the wood or router work done. Assembly was easy with all hardware and only took 10 min. The table is well manufactured and solid. When you put the table together it is assembled upside down. Do not tighten the screws completely till it is fully assembled, only snug the screws. Turn the table right side up and get the table settled in and on all four legs then tighten the screws.", 
    "Product rcvd was very good and we have no complains. we have assembled only one as of now and see no problems on the first one.", 
    "Very nice sofa table at a valued price. I get many compliments on the table. I will recommend this table to others.", 
    "very pretty looks like a nice peice to have in your foyer, etc. the wood is not as heavy (quality not color) as I would have liked for our use but it is a nice table.", 
    "this table is elegant with solid material and easy to assemble", 
    "This was a good value. I feel the price was good for what I was getting. It looks nice and was easy to assemble.",

    "I looks exactly like the picture fits perfectly easy to put together", 
    "It has been over a month so I can't send the table back. I love the table, but feel betrayed by the damage to the table.", 
    "I needed a sofa table that was wider then most & this one fits the bill I have a home that was built in the early 1900's and adding this piece fits my living room well I'm very happy with my perches & look forward to buying the coffe & end table", 
    "A very beautiful table - perfect fit for foyer, easy to assemble ( DID IT MYSELF!) Love it!", 
    "At first I was a little dissapointed when I opened the box. To my dismay I saw the wood on one of the legs of the table was chipped pretty badly. Almost as if a piece came off. The assembly of this product took about 20 minutes which was great but after I put it together I had a bad case of buyer's remorse. I put it behind the entrance door to my home that leads to the staircase for upstairs. I have a stained glass window above it but the table is not centered with the window because of the stair case. For about an hour I tried to work with the placement of the table and it just seemed off. It wasn't until I got some accessories to spurce up the table did I finally begin to like the way it looked. I was ready to return it so my advice is really check the dimensions of it before you buy. Its decent quality for the price but definetly needs some fun accessories to liven it up.", 
    "Having looked for a table of some kind for my entry, I have seen dozens of tables of this sort. All were priced 3 to 5 times what I paid for this piece. When I ordered the table, I read the praiseworthy reviews but rather doubted that the quality would meet my expectations considering the Overstock.com price. When the table was delivered and the box opened, I was extremely surprised to see how nice this table was. The materials and construction were superior! The table went together very easily and it looks fantastic in my entry!", 
    "Excellent quality table, pefect color and size. I was a little skeptical about both the quality and color, I've been disappointed before. This table is Beautiful!! Very easy to assemble, it took about 15 minutes.", 
    "Overall, I am pleased with my purchase of this table. The assembly was relatively quick, all hardware and tools included. It's got a great, sleek look and is the perfect size for an entryway. Only problem I had is the tip of one of the legs was cracked off when I pulled it out of the packaging (definitely had been done before I received it). Instead of going through the mess of returning it I just woodglued the piece back on an hope no one will notice it really. Also, it has a funny chemically smell coming out of the package so be prepared for that, and it collects dust extremely well so it requires a daily dust down. But overall, again, decently happy with this purchase.", 
    "I am so happy I ordered this table. The reviews were spot on . I will be ordering the matching tables soon.", 
    "My husband put it together and it looks great. Only thing is it's a little wobbly but it's fine because it sits against a window and is perfect for me to put my pretty orchids on. Great price too!!", 
    "Lots of compliments. Looks expensive because of the curves. Keep the L wrench that comes with it. Screws loosen in coffee table when people put there feet against it. End tables small but just large enough for a lamp and drink.", 
    "Loved this piece. Fit perfect in my entryway. Just what I had been looking for.", 
    "Reviews and description are accurate, and I am very happy with my purchase. Very easy to put together too.", 
    "nice would recomend, great entry table, love the color",

    "This table looks very nice in our entryway. Matches our other furniture.",

    "It's exactly what I expected it to be and I love it! It goes perfectly with the rest of my furniture and was a great price!", 
    "Very pleased with this purchase - contemporary style", 
    "Super hall table to accentuate my entrance hall. The dark wood finish is stunning with my beige walls.", 
    "Bought this table over a year ago - forgot to write a review. It still looks fabulous, I painted it to match our new home - black distressed...I get many compliments. It's not too big, but big enough for behind a sofa, a foyer, a console...whatever your needs may be. You will love it.", 
    "The table was beautiful, except it was poorly packaged & damaged in shipping. It was so bad there was no way to fix it. Overstock.com handled the problem quickly & to my satisfaction (I got a full refund rather than having to ship the heavy table back.) I will continue to be a loyal customer because of their outstanding service.", 
    "I ordered this table and 5 days later it arrived. It took about 1/2 hour to assemble. Nothing complicated, everything fit perfectly. The table looks great and is solid and sturdy. It also fits perfectly in the room with other wood shades. Nice table, good value, good delivery, easy assembly. Only negative is that I didn't order it sooner.", 
    "I love this table. I use it in the hall with some lamps and a mirror above it. It looks great and is not too deep so it works great in a hall. I love the table and would purchase again or recommend to others.", 
    "I couldn't be happier with my new table! I got it on sale with my O rewards and ended up paying less then half of what I would expect in a store! It showed up right on time and not a scratch on it I was able to put it together myself (23 yr girl) while simotaneously making dinner was done B4 it came outta the oven seriously easy peasy! The peice has a good weight to it and a nice style that works with both contmporary and classic styles which is great for me! Oh and sorry for the review name I tried like 5 b4 they accepted one!", 
    "Xmas gift for family member, they seem to like it.", 
    "This Sofa Table was exactly as described. Love the color and shape! I am a fairly handy person, but anyone can out this together. Very easy to understand instructions. I assembled it in about 10 minutes with a screwdriver.", 
    "Well I received the table very fast but when I opened up the box to look over everything there were no directions or hardware to put the table together with! So I am not very pleased that I have to wait another two business days for the parts dept. to get back to me. I have noticed it is now out of stock on their website so I hope I am able to get the parts to put it together with. I will wait to further update my review.", 
    "I love this table! It looks great in the area that I put it. I really like the dark color. It was very easy to assemble.", 
    "Table looks much richer than what I paid for it. Easy to assemble. It is a nice accent piece in my great room.",

    "After looking at several different websites and tables I decided to buy this one due to the reviews and the price. This table looks exactly how it does in the picture and measures in length, width and height just as specified on the website. My husband put the table together and he said it was easy to do and only took about 30 minutes. I would definitely recommend this table for its quality and price! Its worth the money for a decorative piece of furniture!",

    "I actually bought two of these tables, the quality is excellent, it was delivered in less time than I had expected and it took my husband a total of 40 minutes ton put both of them together. The color is what I expected. I will continue to buy other products here. The shipping costs are so cheap. Thank you.",

I'm 5' and I easy took it inside the house opened the box and saw that each piece was individually wrapped to avoid damage....down side, tons of foam pieces end up everywhere but no worries, as long as my table was good then I was good. A snap to assemble. I did it my self with no help and in under 10 minutes. Seriously, I think it took me longer to unwrap the item than the assembly itself. I am giving it and excellent rating... Overall the table looks great, good size, good value, easy to assemble- what else could I ask for...", 
    "I have been looking for a little extra something for my living room. I found this and took a chance after reading the reviews. It came in one box however the bottom shelf was chipped. I called the manufacturer and a new one was sent to me in a matter of days at no extra charge. Im so glad I purchased this. The price was a steal for how it looks.", 
    "Easy to assemble, pretty sturdy, good value for the cost", 
    "I am so pleased with my purchase. I have been on a decorating frenzy after just purchasing my new home & this piece warmed up my front room so much.

The bottom tip of one of the legs was damaged probably during shipping/handling, but called the 800# directly from the assembly directions and they were very nice and a replaced was ordered and now being sent. Wish this did not happen as I would have had it put together and placed in my home. Nice table, color and quality was what I expected and may even purchase another one to go along a wall in my dining area where this table would fit just right. Great purchase for the $$$.", 
    "A beautiful table for the money. I'm very pleased.",

I would definately buy another one!!!!",

    "This table was very easy to put together. All items were marked and fit together very easily. There were no scratches and the finish was very nice. It is a very sturdy table that looks great.",

    "I have been looking for a console table for months to use in our entryway, and ordered this after much debating since I couldn't see it in person. The table is much heavier and slightly wider than I figured it would be, and it is made of nice, solid wood. I usually try to shy away from veneers due to chipping, etc, but this one is nicely finished, and if there ever is a problem, it seems that teh base is nice enough that I could have no problem stripping it to refinish. Elegant lines, perfect in my entryway, and much nicer than any of the tables I had seen in person going through countless furniture stores, not to mention competitively priced. I assembled the table myself in under 20 minutes, including taking breaks to check on my kids in the next room. It couldn't be easier. As some others noted, I received the package, and called the manufacturer for replacements for two of the legs and the bottom shelf due to manufacturer damage (one leg was cracked, another had too much of the finish pooled in one spot, and there was a small part of the veneer chipped in the back corner of the lower shelf that I would have kept as-is were it not for the problems with the legs since it would have been hidden in the leg notch). The replacement parts were shipped out quickly, and I received them within three business days, no questions asked, so no complaints there. I will definitely purchase furniture through Overstock again, and would not hesitate to recommend this sofa table to anyone.", 
    "Great qualit, fast shipment and very easy to put together. Thank you,",

    "For the price of this table, I was expecting something a little cheezy but to my surprise, it was beautiful. The lines of the table are graceful-looking and the espresso finish is smooth and rich. Once put together, it was a very sturdy piece of furniture. The only downfall I found was that there were small gaps where the legs join the table top which really isn't a big deal because you really have to be looking for it to see it. I was also very pleased with the promptness in receiving the table. Bravo to Overstock.com.",

No worries though, Overstock shipped out us a new one and we are waiting on the arrival of the second one. For the money you cannot go wrong with this classy but modern table!", 
    "This table arrived in less than a week. I put it together in less than half an hour. Was missing one screw which was replaced in a couple of days, It is very sturdy, and the color is as pictured. I can't believe how sturdy it is. I am 68 & a female, does that tell how easy to assemble?",

    "This table was received in a few days with no damage. It was easy to put together and very sturdy. Finish is exactly what I expected . This is a beautiful table that was used in a long hall to anchor the space and provide place for a lamp. The graceful lines and shelf provided eye appeal as well as additional space for display or storage. Great value........highly recommend.", 
    "My one year search for a family-room sofa table had to meet several criteria before purchasing: (1) reasonably priced; (2) be a dark espresso color; (3) have uniqueness in shape; (4) 1 lower shelf with limited space; (5) 30 to 32 inches in height; and (6) the leg-shape must coincide with my dining room furniture as well as the oval table shape & color because both rooms are close in location. After wasting not only my personal time and money for gas driving to all of the local furniture stores and malls (several times) as well as travelling to a few out-of-state stores; I should have done the \u0093Overstock\u0094 online thingy first. As soon as I saw the Overstock half-oval Lewis Wood Sofa Table and read the details which met my criteria, that was it!!! I placed the order and it arrived on the scheduled date. Unfortunately one of the received front legs was damaged and I did not trust assembling it. After reporting the damage on the same day of receipt, a cordial and understanding professional at Overstock assured me the replacement would arrive within a few days; and definitely before Christmas. As promised the replacement arrived within a week after reporting the damage. I assembled the table with ease then polished and staged it -- now it looks gorgeous!! It is slightly heavy and very sturdy. When family and friends visit, comment, and want to know where I purchased the sofa table, I give Overstock all the credit; then give them the website. I made an on-time, thumbs-up purchase. Due to the damaged leg, unfortunately I cannot give a rating of 5; however, it merits above 4.50. Many Thanks and Seasons Greetings everyone at Overstock,", 
    "This table is beautiful! It is a dark espresso color and very easy to put together (although it helps to have two people do it). Great amount of space, as well.", 
    "Bought this table for our entry hall way....it looks amazing. They shipped the wrong legs at first, but quickly sent out an entire new set! Looks much more elegant and expensive than the price! Love it!", 
    "Got this table yesterday - was very easy to put together and looks great! The color is dark espresso and is well constructed. A great value for the price!! Highly recommend it...", 
    "This item was exactly as described and of very good quality for the price. Very satisfied!", 
    "This table is beautiful. I bought it to fill in an empty corner in my room and it looks great. I got the matching coffee table a while ago and it is also very nice. It is sturdy and has a beautiful dark walnut finish. I did however spill nail polish remover on the coffee table witch ruined the top but I loved it so much that I had to refinish the top but it still looks great. It was delivered very fast and with no damage at all. The only problem i have with this table is that I put candle holders on it and they have a felt bottom and because of the finish on the table top it leaves marks on the table. So whenever i move the candle holders i have to wipe down the table, but it is still for sure 5 star worthy.", 
    "This was everything that was promised. Easy to put together and looks fabulous in our home. Wish I had purchased it sooner.", 
    "Item came on item, but the shelf that goes into the bottom was damaged. Called customer service and they sent another piece, the damage on the 2nd one was worse than the first. Disappointed that the quality was not maintained despite the price of this item.", 
    "Purchased this table and like a previous reviewer claimed I had it set up within 20 min after ups delivered it to my door. It is beautiful and elegant. I love it.....so glad I made this purchase!", 
    "UPS guy dropped this at my door at 2:00 and I was putting a lamp and tchotchkies on it at 2:23. Looks good for the price!!", 
    "Exceptional, even more attractive than the picture. Easy assembly. Receiving compliments on this piece from everyone who enters my home.", 
    "Very sturdy table and it looks nice. Quick and easy assembly.", 
    "My husband and I ordered several furniture pieces at the time of this one, and it is honestly the one we love best! the color and style of the table have a very finished high end feel. Our only issue was that the box was obviously previously opened( returned by someone else) and the directions were missing. On a good note my husband was easily able to put the table together in about 15 minutes or so, even without the instructions. I highly recommend this table, it is sturdy and very nice.", 
    "Recieved the table and very pleased with the product. the assembly was fairly easy, table study and appear as high quality with the price at half of what you see in local furniture store. The color is dark brown.", 
    "I am happy with the quality. The color is just what I wanted as well.", 
    "I just recieved this table about 3 weeks ago and I love it! The color is a bit darker than what is shown on the picture (it's similar to ikea's black/brown colored furniture) Which was okay for me because much of my decor is the \"blk/brwn\" color so it goes perfectly. Only down side is, I was missing a few washers due to the hardware package being open during shpping I suppose. I put the table together anyway and so far I haven't had the need to call the number provided for missing hardware. The table is good over all....no regrets!", 
    "The table was very easy to put together. It is well made, heavy and very stable. It blended very well with the other pieces of furniture in the room. I did not find any flaws and have received a lot of comments on how rich it looks. I would recommend it to anyone. I've spent a lot of time looking in furniture stores and did not find anything equal the to the price or the look.", 
    "Love the table. Very easy to assemble as I did it myself since my husband was golfing...so anyone can assemble. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the legs were a bit uneven and it wobbles. So had to put a piece of the cardboard underneath one of the legs to level it off.", 
    "This came quickly. I only took about 15 minutes to assemble The color is much darker than the picture. I was hoping it would be. It is study and does not take up a lot of floor space. I will probably purchase another one in the near future.", 
    "I like this table. it is quite plain for my taste, but with a vase and some contemporary decor i think it will look great. All in all, its great for the price, and it didnt take long for my husband to put it together. the wood is good quality too! would recommend!", 
    "The table looks great. It was very easy to install (requires two people though), and the price was very reasonable compared to large furniture box stores.", 
    "This sofa table is fabulous! It took me about 15 minutes to assemble by myself, and it was very easy. The table looks great in my foyer. The wood quality is very good and doesn't look or feel cheap. It was such a great buy!!",

    "Very pleased with this table. It is the perfect size and shape and looks great in our living room. The one we received is a little darker than the picture on Overstock. It's really more of an Espresso color than Mahogany, but it still looks very nice. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the finish is not perfect and has a few minor blemishes. However, I would still purchase it again.", 
    "Got the table fast and in great condition. Love this table!! Looks like an expensive piece without paying the price. Looks wonderful in our entryway. Would definitely recommend this piece to anyone consider purchasing it.", 
    "I assembled this table very easily on my own. It is stable and nice. The color is a bit darker than it looks in the photo.", 
    "I purchased this table after reading reviews. It met expectations except for damage to the corner of table that occurred in shipping I would have returned the table for an exchange had it not been out of stock. I like it enough to deal with the damage, although I may still call Overstock and see what my options might be.It was very easy to assemble and has great lines. I have received many compliments,Enjoy!", 
    "The table is very nice for the money. Assembly was quick, once the correct part was received. Table comes with 4 legs 2 letter \"B\" front leg, 1 letter \"C\" rear leg and 1 letter \"D\" rear leg. My table came with 2 letter \"C\" legs. Had to wait 1 week for the manufacture to send the correct leg. But once it came in and was assembled, it made a nice addition to my living room.", 
    "This table was in perfect condition when it was received. It was very simple to put together. - took my husband and me about 10 minutes to assemble it from box to standing. It is not wobbly at all. I love it- just wish it was a little bigger for the wall I have it on.", 
    "this came in from delivery and it was just what i had pictured size and all, i felt that i owed a good comment on their product, have fun shopping!", 
    "I love this table. It was reasonably priced and was easy to assemble. This piece screams style. Even my husband likes this table and he's not the furniture- loving kind. This piece coordinates well with other furniture that I have. I would definitely recommend this item to friends and/ or family. Anyone considering this table will not be disappointed.", 
    "the table came and was easily put together in 20 minutes. however it wobbled. the front legs were shorter than the rear ones. we're getting replacements so the jury is still out. however, the table is handsome to look at and fits the space it was intended for perfectly. i can always stick little pads under the legs if the new ones don't workout. i won't return it though because i do like it.", 
    "This table shipped quickly. It was easy to assemble and it looks great in our entryway. There is a spot on each of the two front legs where it appears that the stain was not applied properly -- but it is not that noticeable once the table is set up.", 
    "Great finish. Nice piece of furniture for the cost. Took just as long to get out of the box as it did to assemble it (about 15 min ... by a girl...) :) No problems with any fit.... sits quite level on tile floor without rocking. Only wish it was just a little bigger.", 
    "This table is perfect and looks very classy. It arrived on time and without any scratches. It is a beautiful cherry wood and matches perfectly with the cherry wood table and chairs I have. It is actually larger than I expected. It only took about 30 minutes to assemble. I would definitely recommend.", 
    "I've watched this item for 6 months and finally decided to order. I received it within a week and I must admit. It is \"Beautiful in my Foyer\", it took about 30 min. for me (non-mechanical female) to put it together. I would recommend this table to anyone. The color is great, rich cherry and very elegent. The box contained all parts. Love it!!!", 
    "I love this table fit into a spot between 2 doors and no one has in it as they go into each area of room. matches dinning set perrrrrrrrrrfect fit and priced very reasonable also.",

    "After reading the reviews I sold. This is a beautiful table and I am so glad I bought it for my entryway.", 
    "The table arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It was easy to assemble and looks great.", 
    "Like most stuff from China, this one had problems with fit during assembly. One of the legs would not fit in the table and had to be shaved down and hit in with a rubber hammer in order to fit into the table slot. Also, after assembly there were about 1/8 inch gaps between the legs and the table where they joined together. I had to fill the spaces with a dark chaulk. But the finish was good and overall I am happy with the finished product. To bad they don't do a fit check at the factory.", 
    "After reading the reviews I purchased this table for my entryway. Shipping was extremely fast and putting it together was very easy. The table was better than I expected and looks amazing. I am very happy with the purchase.",

    "This table is exactly what I was looking for and was easy to assemble. I get lots of complements on it as well. Perfect for an area with lots of traffic since it has rounded edges and sits flush to the wall. Perfect for an entry table. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Delivery was quick. It was delivered in the rain and They left it in a dry locaction. It wasn't difficult for my husband to put together. It adds a very nice touch to our living room. The color of the finish is rich looking. Looks great right now with Christmas decor displayed on it.", 
    "We just purchased a house and had no furniture in our foyer. Seen my wife looking at this table for weeks on overstock trying to find the right one. So I ordered this table and had it put together in less than 20 mins. Put the table in foyer and when she came home from work....so cried \"I LOVE IT\" For that reaction ....this is worth 5 stars..", 
    "this is a nice looking and sturdy table. i put it together all by myself and it took less than 15 minutes. looks good and nice table for the price!!", 
    "This is a great table. Besides being easy to assembly, I especially like that it has no corners for the grandkids to run into! The beautiful, rich finish really completes my living room, adding an elegant touch. Highly recommend it.", 
    "The table is great for the price. I was able to assembly in 20 minutes. They do suggest you have a second person to help lift the table upright when completed. The table is beautiful. Only one of the three rubber tips that go on the bottom of the legs were included. Since I am putting felt floor protectors on the table legs, I won't need the tips.", 
    "I love it. the color is a little darker than it appears in the picture, but it was the exactly color I wanted", 
    "The quality of the table is excellent, the color is beautiful and rich, also the detail is profound, and it has a very sleek look. I am very happy with it. It is in my entry way, and it is a gorgious and usefull addition to my home. Can't beat the quality for the money!", 
    "This table is very nice, easy to put together (I did it by myself in 30 min), but be careful, the wood is kind of soft, so you can scratch it easily to.", 
    "I am so very happy with this table.....it's gorgeous!!! Quality is excellent and very easy to assemble. Very sturdy and beautiful. Exactly what my foyer needed. I found a mirror to match at another store for a more complete look. Now I have a place for seasonal decorations in my foyer. Highly recommended!!!!!!!", 
    "Beautiful table. Easy to put together, however the legs don't fit exactly snug so if you are really picky this may not be the piece for you.", 
    "This table was everything I had hope for and more. Direction very easy to follow and quality of wood was nice as well. Table was well worth the money.", 
    "I love this table! It is just as beautiful in person as it is on the website. It has such a beautiful shape to it. Fairly easy to put together and brings the room together!", 
    "I'll start off by saying that this is an adequate deal on this table. I was hoping for something that was very nice, and ended up with something that's adequate. The millwork on the legs is a bit wavy. The finish is applied unevenly. The veneer on the edgework has a very unfinished look and feel.I was expecting more of a gloss finish, but this table has more of a satin finish. It's not smooth at all. I was even thinking of getting some very fine steel wool to enhance the finish, but decided it's not worth it. Table still looks nice, just not as nice as I had hoped. It was under $200 when I bought it, so despite it's shortcomings, I'd still say it's a pretty good value.", 
    "piece wasn't cut right to fit leg into bottom of table but called company and they sent the correct piece within the same week and now the table looks great!", 
    "This table is very nice looking, a great value for the money. It was easy to put together, and looks just like the picture.", 
    "I think this table is very beautiful, however it is a little unsteady. It also arrived with the back corner slightly damaged but was easily hidden. Overall, it looks very nice as an entryway table, but I wish is was more sturdy for the price.", 
    "As a decorator I look for quality items as well as a resonable price for my clients. I found both in this Lewis table. It has a contemporary style with simple, yet strong lines. It can be used as an entry table as well as a sofa table. Overstock knows how to supply the look and the price that is affordable. Thank you.", 
    "I am very pleased with the purchase of this table. It met all my needs for the look I was trying to achieve. In my opinion it can fit in with a traditional theme or a contemporary decor. The lines are graceful and smooth and the rich dark finish is asthetically pleasing to the room.", 
    "Simple sleek table with a dark finish providing a contemporary look. Serves the purpose as a light-weight console table which was exactly what we were looking for!", 
    "Liked it a lot on the computer screen, liked the price and in real life it is perfect too. Lots of compliments and from our interior designer as well. Love shopping Overstock, love the speed, the service, the variety and the value. Many thanks.", 
    "It took my husband and I 10 minutes to assemble! Looks great, and I love it!", 
    "I am an avid fan of Overstock purchases and this product lived up to that standard. First, the price was right. This is a great value. Second, the quality, from the hardware to the instructions, to the table components themselves, are all very good quality. The assembly took me about 15-20 minutes. The solid weight of the table was also a very nice surprise. This is no wimpy table! Finally, the overall simplicity, color, and lines make this an elegant and affordable piece for my front foyer.", 
    "I was looking for a demi lune console for ages. I finally came upon one at a very reasonable price and good quality. It adds the finishing touch to any room.",

    "The wood color is mahogany, rich and beautiful. Assembly was very easy, pieces well marked. Takes up very little room due to its curved length and height slant. Both shelves are very strong too, well supported. Looks great with our furniture.", 
    "Lewis Wood Sofa Table - This table is well built and was very easy to assemble. Each part was labled which made it a breeze to put together and it looks fabulous. Could not be happier with this piece as it looks like it cost much more than I paid. I have recieved several compliments already from visitors who noticed it right away. I have it displayed in my entrance way so it is the first thing that people see.", 
    "This table is gorgeous. It has a somewhat modern look to it, I love it.It shipped quickly, took 20 minutes to assemble and looks amaizing. The color is warm and rich, and it looks a lot more expensive than it actually was. I would highly recommend it.", 
    "I don't think the picture does the piece justice! I absolutely love it and everyone asks me all the time where did I get this piece from. The wood is more a mahogany color and matches my other tables perfectly. I found a matching mirror to hang above it and you would swear it came as a set. I had never ordered from overstock.com, and they were so quick to help and kept me inform about the product. I put it together in like 15 minutes. I would highly reccomend this to anyone looking for sofa table to complete a look in their living room...Well worth the money and the size is perfect!!", 
    "Quick arrival in one flat box, a few screws to join legs to top ad shelf and we have a beautiful entry hall table", 
    "If you need a petite entry table buy this! Just make sure you check the dimensions. It works very well in my small apartment entryway, but may be dwarfed in larger homes. Also, when I pulled it from the box the top piece appeared a shade lighter than the legs/bottom piece... and I was a bit worried. But once I put it all together it blended just fine. (So don't worry if this happens to you.) It's a bargain!", 
    "Received the table within the week it was ordered. It was very easy to assemble and it's appearance is very nice. It goes well with my decor. I had spent several days shopping in furniture stores for a sofa table and this one from Overstock was by far the best value for the money. I am very pleased.",

    "This is a very nice looking well built piece of furniture. It's solid and feels like a quality piece.", 
    "I ordered this table for my entryway and it looks perfect!! Very quick and easy to assemble. Just add a few accessories to complete the look. Definitely worth the price.", 
    "I love this table! I had been checking on this table for quite a while. I didn't know if I wanted to spend that much on an entryway table but I'm glad I did. It looks very nice in my entryway. The color is a little darker than in the picture. It worked out perfect since I wanted to go with a darker colored table (like espresso) in my entryway. I did notice a couple of dark blotches in the wood, almost looks like a problem with the stain. However no one else has noticed it but me. Its still a very pretty table and is just what I needed.", 
    "This table looks great , its very sleek and elegant and apart from one issue, assembly was quite easy. One of the pre-drilled holes was misaligned and I had a difficult time screwing a support bracket in place. I eventually managed to attach the bracket by bending and manipulating it into place. I would have rated it a five but I can't overlook the issue with the mis-aligned hole. I also purchased the matching coffee table and end tables.", 
    "I got my console table today. I put it together in about 30 minutes. It looks really nice and matches my seating bench in the foyer perfectly. The color is actually a little darker to me than what is pictured.It's what I wanted!!",

    "I like this table but there are visible marks and flaws. It looks more like a \"second\" or even floor sample. It was easy to put together and is sturdy. Not a great \"bargain\" nor a total rip off.", 
    "We LOVE this table. It looks even better than I anticipated it would and is definitely a fantastic value. It looks like like a piece that could easily cost triple or more. I was surprised at how well made this is, considering the price. Fairly easy to assemble, and arrived with no dings or problems.Love Overstock.com!", 
    "I love Overstock.com and my new Lewis Sofa table. My table arrived in 3 days, It was easy to assemble, and it really compliments my other living room furiniture. Most of all the price was a treat after seeing the cost of sofa tables at nearby furniture stores. The craftmanship of the table looks as if I spent more $$ than I did. I'm looking forward to my next purchase with Overstock.com.", 
    "I love the table, however when I opened it up the corner of the table was smashed . When I called to return it they did not have anymore left. The table looks great in my livingroom, I wish thou I would have gotten one in perfect condition for the price.",

    "I am very satisfied and happy I bought this console table. It looks so elegant and classy on my foyer. I could not believed it only cost me that much! The craftmanship is definitely above average... you would think it is expensive. What you see in the web is definitely what you get. The color is rich expresso which I liked. There is nothing negative that I could think of to say on this product. I just hope that I could get a smaller version of this to buy for the hallway on the upper level of my house.",

    "one edge on top and shelf are broken, and hardware is broken too. so cannot install the furniture. The overstock customer service is really great, they refund my money very fast. I am happy with that, but have to buy another console table.", 
    "I ordered this table, but never received it, I follow up with UPS and was told the shipping formation had been cancelled by the shipper. So now I have to follow up on how I get a refund, not what I planned or wanted to do.", 
    "This is easy to assemble and looks lovely. It is a beautiful espresso color, flawless and looks much more expensive than it was."
