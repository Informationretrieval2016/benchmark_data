    "Let me start by saying this is the perfect size for a small apartment, and I got it on sale when it was about $ plus free shipping (join O Club and email: totally worth it, free shipping, frequent 10-15% coupons). The other thing I consider a plus is that the seat back cushions velcro to the back of the couch which means they don't slide around and lose their shape. The cons are that it's VERY firm, only comes with the chaise on the left side, and it's more of a neutral tan tweed than grey. Also be aware that the order is processed by Overstock within five days, but then it goes to a shipping warehouse which took about 6 weeks to deliver (great communication and service though). Overall, I would recommend this to a friend who wants a small sectional for cheap, but if you're looking for quality and comfort, this isn't for you.", 
    "With the purchase of this sofa, my living room is complete. It is a beautiful grey color and fits with the chairs I also purchased from Overstock. The size is perfect for a smaller room and was a very easy to assemble. BUY !!", 
    "Comfortable to sit, great back support and perfect for my apartment.", 
    "perfect for a small living room", 
    "This couch is great. Perfect for 3-4 people to sit on it. The fabric is easy to clean and is durable. After hosting 5 kiddos for our wedding weekend I was nervous but it survived the weekend and was no worse for wear. Easy to assemble and a great addition to our home.", 
    "This couch looks awesome in any small living room or loft. I mixed champagne/gold pillows with tribal black and white and it looks AMAZING. It is a little difficult to get out of the box so you will need a box cutter and an extra pair of hands. Color is just a hint of grey. A great foundation to build on.", 
    "This couch is fantastic. Perfect size and looks expensive. We've had it for about a month now, and everything is still great. No crazy wear on the fabric or anything. Fabric color is just as pictured. One thing I thought was kind of weird - the little metal plate that says \"Abbyson Living\" on the side of the sofa is affixed crookedly. Not a huge issue, but when paying around $$$$ for a piece of furniture, the details should be taken into consideration. 4 stars because of that, as it is clearly visible.Sidenote: Super disappointed with the company who delivered the sofa and put it together ( *** Movers - beware!), because they completely ruined and scratched all of the wooden legs. Overstock is taking care of it - be sure to buy the protection - but be wary of this moving company.", 
    "I don't love this couch in person. I wanted to, but I can't. The material is very coarse and fuzzy - it feels as if it might pull over time as well. The couch itself does not look like it was stuffed properly and is very lumpy and uneven. When you sit on it, it leaves bumps for quite some time until you fluff it again. Color is definitely tan and not at all gray. Higher quality can be found for the money.", 
    "Great size; does not overwhelm my small room. Clean design. Firm."
