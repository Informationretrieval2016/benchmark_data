    "I loved the way this buffet looked online and the price was great too. There are a lot of pieces but luckily they are numbered so it wasn't impossible. My husband and I were able to put it together fairly easily. Keep in mind it is particle board. One of the edges arrived dented. The wood was so warped in several places- the sliding door does not fit flush against the left side or the right side. The right side holding the cabinet and drawers is warped as well. The top drawer only closes with force if you maneuver it properly and the cabinet door is completely crooked. I hope it's sturdier than it looks. Wish I could have given this product more stars.", 
    "We were looking around the internet (and IRL) for quite some time for a bar/wine bar/buffet, and after really thinking it over we finally went for this one really liking the design and the price. We are very happy with the decision! It was the exact size we wanted and looks exactly like what we thought it would. It was a little bit of a pain to put together (it took over 4 hours...) and some of the instructions were confusing; however, it was really nice that all the pieces were numbered to help with the confusion. It also has a ton of space--the cabinet, drawers, and shelves are great, and it fits a lot of wine bottles! My only real complaint is that our red wine glasses don't fit on the rack, so we'll have get new glasses, but that's a small issue. Overall, a great purchase, and we're so happy with it!", 
    "Would give a five star review if it weren't for it taking almost two hours to put this together. However, has lots of space for wine glasses, shot glasses, dishes, etc.", 
    "I had been looking for a bar for quite some time and hadn't really found anything in my price range that I liked. This had all the features I was looking for (wine storage, drawers, wine glass rack) and fit perfectly into the space that I needed. I wish it had two doors instead of just the one, but it is still a really nice piece.", 
    "Very decorative, I have an apartment and it works really good storing some dishes and looks really nice with a few wine bottles! It was also very easy to put together.", 
    "Moved into my new place two months ago and when I saw this I just had to have it in my home. Took a few hours to put together, but once it was done it was pretty obvious that no other furniture in my house could hold a candle to this. It's just beautiful and definitely has been getting lots of praise from visitors. I'm happy.", 
    "a LOT of pieces to put together, but worth it once it's done.", 
    "I bought it because ir looked like it had everything that we needed. But when I tried to put it together the instructions didn't say if it was the back or front or where some of the parts should be facing. It was not the quality I expected. I bought furniture much cheaper that looks more expensive than this piece. dissapointed", 
    "I LOVE this, is more beautiful as the picture", 
    "good price and sturdy. Perfect for my dining room , very happy with purchase although it took roughly 4 hours to put together.", 
    "I'm really please with piece of furniture it fit perfectly in my dining room", 
    "Love this bar! It looks awesome and holds so much. It was somewhat complicated to put together but once we got it, we absolutely love it!", 
    "Very poor product quality and inadequate assembly instructions", 
    "Wine glass holder is to narrow for most wine glass stems", 
    "Looks great. Assembly not too bad if you first lable your parts (they did place them in individual bags, but were not labled. Boards had numbers that you had to search for on ends and diagram not extremely detailed but had enough information to get the job done.", 
    "Looks great in aa beach condo.", 
    "This bar is gorgeous and looks like something from West Elm--we've received several compliments from guests. It is a nightmare to put together--a plethora of parts and pieces with only mediocre instructions so it took roughly 3 hours to assemble. Not giving 5 stars because the drawers do not align perfectly or slide smoothly, but they function and provide a good amout of storage. Overall, we are pleased with this purchase.", 
    "We needed extra storage and this wine bar stores everything with an updated style!", 
    "We absolutely love how this server looks. So sophisticated and stylish! The reviews are right, it is time consuming to put together. Partly because there are a lot of parts, but mostly because the instructions are terrible. They are very bad about showing details about how to orient the different pieces together, and some of the hardware is listed incorrectly in the instructions, which was super frustrating. However, we figured it out, and just love how it looks--was worth the temporary frustrations! Also warning that the wine glasses holder won't fit larger glasses. Just fine for normal glasses though.", 
    "Many pieces to put together. Only and experienced man with a power drill should order this item. Once assembled however it is a nice looking wine rack.", 
    "My son put this together and although it took some time to assemble it, the result is an attractive and sturdy piece. However, if I had to assemble it myself I would likely dropmy rating to 4 stars. But its clean lines, and timeless look adds just enough modern elegance to your home. I placed a large painting over it, a lamp, picture frame with feaux hydrangea plant on top of buffet. Note: There is only one sliding glass door in front so some items will be exposed in either the left or right open areas of the buffet. Then again, it is probably a feature that makes this buffet neat.", 
    "Love this buffet! Look great in my dining room!", 
    "The piece looks great and is exactly what I expected. It was a little cumbersome to assemble, some pieces didn't work perfectly, but overall assembly went fairly well and was completed in a few hours", 
    "Overall, the bar looks really nice. However, I would say the quality is poor. The top drawer on the right side of the bar is not flush with the size, and is difficult to close. In addition, the sliding door is not flush with the side of the bar when slid to the left (in front of the wine section). The glass door and drawer are almost the last things to be put together, so we didn't realize it until the very end of the building process. We followed the instructions exactly, so it's not a building issue. We believe the size of the products is slightly off.", 
    "Many pieces to assemble, but you can do it if you are used to assembling this type of furniture. It adds elegance to my dining area.", 
    "I have one good size room for both my dining and living rooms so I use it to separate the rooms and it looks really beautiful. It holds a good amount of items. It is excellent storage.", 
    "Took about four hours to assemble. Very nice server. Instructions and numbering of the components are awful.", 
    "Very happy with this server, its the perfect size for our dining room, this gave the perfect touch. Was not difficult to build as long as your follow step by step instructions given. Price was good and overall we are very happy with it.", 
    "This thing is an absolute piece of junk. It arrived with a defective piece, and when we contacted Overstock about it, they said they would try to get another piece out to us sometime. We bought this to have in our home for Christmas, so the \"someday\" delivery date doesn't really help us much.Upon further inspection, the top right drawer doesn't close properly, and the sliding glass door doesn't sit level, so there's a smaller space at the bottom and a larger space at the top.Not only has the product been a mess, but customer care has been disappointing. I've ordered 4 items from Overstock in the past 60 days, and all 4 of them have had some kind of issue. I explained all of the problems with this product to an Overstock rep through their online chat, and their resolution was that it would take up to 2 weeks for them to send the needed part out, and then when I asked for a partial refund they offered a store credit for a future purchase. Really? I've had problems with 4 items in less than 60 days and you think I'm interested in buying more? I don't think so.", 
    "Nice has a lot of pieces look great", 
    "The wine glass hanging rack does not fit 3\" base glassed. A little disappointed.", 
    "First off, this bar is great and looks exactly like the photos. We ordered the Light Oak version and couldn't be happier with the way it turned out.It took my wife and I about 1hr 30min to fully build once we got all the pieces unpacked. The biggest issues we had were some of the numbers painted on the sides of each piece looked like they had a stroke. The number 5 looked more like a trapezoid than a number. We seriously couldn't read half of them and had to guesstimate looking at the instruction book.The instruction book was also a nightmare as it didn't really show the orientation of the pieces and removed some of the imagery for no reason. For example, one of the pieces has a sliding metal piece connected to it for the drawers however that piece is removed from the illustrations within the instruction book so you can't tell if the piece should be facing one way or the other. It was very frustrating but once completed we truly love this piece of furniture and it is very sturdy. I highly recommend using an electric screw driver or drill for all of the installation besides the glass on the sliding door, that should be done by hand to avoid breaking the plastic pieces or glass. I think that really helped speed up our build.", 
    "3hours to assemble it and enjoy it", 
    "Absolutely love this piece. MDF with light oak laminate, but still extremely sturdy and 'feels' solid. Tempered glass panel is very nice, and the sliding door is perfect - moves noiselessly and smoothly. Only issue I had was with the instructions, which were a step below IKEA style. Diagram only, with pieces numbered - no names. Nothing to suggest specific edges, and, as such, after following them as best as we could, I ended up with a piece upside down and backwards, which is now impossible to fix without taking the whole thing apart. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't vital for installation of the swinging door. All in all, though, we are very pleased with the piece, as it makes a beautiful addition to our home. Would definitely purchase more furniture from this company.", 
    "First of all, the shipment arrived in perfect condition, with all parts accounted for undamaged, which is unusual in this type of shipment. It was a pain to put together, and we had to take some pieces apart more than once for putting them together upside down, backwards, etc. It took 2 people about 3 hours to assemble, but after final assembly, the piece looks great and holds all of our glasses and spirits bottles for which it was intended. I will reiterate what others have said though, that the hanging wine rack was too narrow for the base of my nice wine glasses to hang from. They look pretty standing in it though!", 
    "It looks nice but had a problem with the bottom board was a little warped and we had to use clamps to get the screws to line up. Plus it had a slight musty smell when we first unpacked it, that I no longer notice. Nice scale for our condo dining room.", 
    "Somewhat of a challenge to assemble but worth it!", 
    "Love this piece! It was easy to put together, the only thing I don't like its the racks that hold the wine glasses, I have 3 kids and they do a lot of jumping and stomping, the other day my daughter was running near the server and one of the wine glass fell out. I will look for a stopper or something to keep the glasses in place and safe . Other than that I love it", 
    "Love, love, love! Took some major time to put together but it's worth it.", 
    "This piece looks very nice, not cheap. It fits all our glassware, bar supplies and bottles. Its a beautiful way to display nice glass wear. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is one of the pieces of wood was slightly warped, which we didn't notice until assembled. Its hard to notice unless someone points it out. Were very happy with this piece!", 
    "I'm obsessed with this piece. I bought it for my new apartment and it works perfectly. It holds everything I need and more!", 
    "It may have taken a little bit of time to put together, but the end result is so worth it! It looks great and holds a lot of stuff. The color is also great, looks vintage and distressed without the price tag!", 
    "I'm so happy with this item. It's small enough to fit in a narrow space, but it holds a LOT of stuff. I use it as a buffet in my dining room.", 
    "Beautiful and holds a good amount", 
    "Took some skill and time to assemble but looks beautiful when done and very useful!", 
    "This bar set is exactly what I wanted! There was a lot of assembly but it was worth it. It looks great in my house!!", 
    "This item has all the features I wanted and works well. I would have given it 5 stars if the color in the picture was true to the actual piece. The color is more gray than a light tan as shown in the picture. It turns out that the gray color will work in our room, so we kept it. I had no problems putting it together. I wish it was a wood veneer; it's more like a wood grain plastic veneer. I guess I can't really expect wood for such a low price. All in all, I am happy with the purchase.", 
    "It took me about 4.5 hours to assemble this by myself, and there were some issues with the pieces. Not all of the pre-drilled holes were drilled in the right places, so the base of the cabinet is not all the way fixed to the cabinet itself. Our glass sliding door also will not stay in the middle section, so we have to keep it closed on the left side. Other than that, it is very nice looking and a great storage solution for us.", 
    "I love this buffet! The combination of wine rack, wine glass holder and storage. It is perfect for my small kitchen. Do need some skills and patience to put it together. As long you follow the instruction and all the pieces have label with number. Accept the nuts and bolts. I suggest not to mix it up.", 
    "Love the way this turned out. Yes, took a while to assemble and my hubby broke one of the shelves doing it but it looks great. It is particle board, but much better quality than the tv stand I purchased at the same time. The instructions were clear and it looks like I spent a lot more than I did!", 
    "I love this item, it is beautiful once put together and works great for the space I needed it in! Great quality of material and easy to put together.", 
    "Haven't put the item together but I am sure that it will be great."
