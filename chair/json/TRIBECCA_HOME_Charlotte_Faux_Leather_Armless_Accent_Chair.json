    "I am in love!! Timely shipping, jumping up and down when it was being delivered. I am redecorating the living room and hadn't planned on adding any red - or color at all - until I came upon this chair. My mind was made up immediately. The color is very true to the photo. The chair was constructed very well, all screwed and glued on the inside with a nice hardwood. The underside of the chair (that you can't even see unless you turn it upside down) is woven together with a very thick nylon and studded with leather knot buttons. Gorgeous!! It is a very large chair. I am 5'3\" and my feet dangle off of the edge when I sit all the way back. The seat sits 18\" off of the ground and is about 23\" from front to back. It was very easy to put together, all ready for me to marvel at its level of comfort in under 15 minutes!! Buy this chair!!", 
    "I ordered two Charlotte chairs based on the other reviews. I received the chairs in two separate boxes very quickly in less than a week, maybe even in four days. Assembly was easy. The directions were clear and the allen wrench is included. The only glitch was that the first chair I assembled did not sit flat on the floor. It bobbled a bit until I slightly loosened the two front legs, sat the chair flat on its feet and then tightened the legs again while the chair was sitting on the floor and I was sitting on the floor. It was a bit awkward to reach up and tighten the legs that way and there might be an easier way to ensure that the chair sits flat, but that's what I figured out. The \"leather\" on the seats has a great soft feel and really looks like real leather. The seats are firm so you are not going to lounge in these anytime soon, but they are fine for seating when having guests over. As previously pointed out, the chairs are pretty wide and deep. This makes for a nice visual impact. I'm using these two chairs and a couch for my livingroom set, so I like the larger size. As a previous poster pointed out, there is a little touch of rust on the red. Amazingly, the red of the chairs matched my accent wall, very cool. The legs are solid wood and stained a dark brown. I would say that the color is dark walnut. The chairs look very modern and chic and are really spiff up my livingroom. I now need a new couch because my couch looks pretty icky next to the chairs. I should probably paint the walls too. And change my dining set. While I'm at it, I should probably change my TV area to something nicer like these chairs too. Perhaps new kitchen cabinets...... LOL.", 
    "One star? Yes, only one; and what's worse, I love this chair. You see, I bought this chair in March 2011, and had I reviewed it within the year I purchased it, my analysis would have been dripping with Greats, Beautifuls, and Amazings (well, maybe not \"Amazing\"). It is, however, the condition that this beloved chair is in today (June 2013) that brings me to write this review. Beware. If it is your intention to use this chair regularly, seek another; this is not the chair for you. However beautiful its color and bold its lines, if you are looking for more than a seldom used splash of eye-candy, look elsewhere. The \"Faux Leather\" fabric and stitching decompinsate aggressively with regular use. Flaws became aparent within the waning months of the first year. This chair has great bones, no question; and she's as sturdy and bright as the day I bought her. The problem lies in her skin, the upholstery; it ages in dog years. In the two years since I purchased this chair, I have likely used it on the order of 3 - 4 times per week. I pride myself on by ability to stretch a dollar, and keeping my belongings in pristine condition is paramount. In particular, every item of furniture that shares the room with this chair was purchased within the same month. Only this chair has withered. Only this chair is tattered. My living room today looks as fresh and vibrant as it in the summer of 2011, save for one decrepit flower, that wilted before her time.", 
    "The other reviewers here were the ones who sold me on these chairs. Thanks ! I was pleasantly surprised. The \"faux\" leather is very comfortable. I bought these two to use as desk chairs. I work from home and have a dedicated office, but I get tired of being \"at work\" when I'm doing personal on line business so I have a writing desk in the living room for my laptop. Since another reviewer here said they used their chair as a desk chair, I thought I'd do the same. The height is right. The color and style is GREAT. However, I don't like the slight recline of the back for a work desk chair. So I will be buying lumbar pillows for a little back support. I'm 5' 5\" and maybe I sit at my desks differently than the other reviewer... But my comment does not detract at all from my satisfaction with these chairs. I'm very satisfied with my stylish new chairs. They really added some pop to my living room and my home office.", 
    "I didn't do my homework on these chairs. They are bigger than I expected, but I didn't take measurements. My fault. Nevertheless, I like them a lot. They are not very comfortable, but, yes, stylish. I'm small framed and can sit cross-legged on them with a small pillow for my back. I bought them for extra seating for company. I would recommend that you NOT buy them as your primary seating. As described, they are good \"accent\" chairs. I got the white, and the color is pretty close to the picture - more like an eggshell white - very close to pure white. Definitely not cream or ivory. I bought two. One of the packages had a few corners crushed in from the delivery. (Why can't anything ever be delivered without crushed packaging? Grrr!) But there was enough styrofoam padding to protect the chairs. Assembly is easy. Just like one of the other reviewers commented, one of the legs screwed on shorter, and the chair wobbled on a hard surface. Ours sits on a carpet so it's not noticeable; we can always add a rubber footie, if needed. Value? Well, I always wait to get a coupon from overstock. I might feel that quality was a little lacking if I had paid the full price. If used gently for just company, then I expect I'll get my money's worth. We have cats. It didn't take long for the faux leather to get punctured by a kitty that wanted to know what it tasted like. Again, that's my fault. But overall, I am very happy with the style of them.", 
    "I love this chair and it really adds pizaaz to my home office. It was not at all hard to put together--bascially 11 botls--and it feels sturdy. The \"leather\" looks like the real thing and the wide seat makes it very modern and stylish. A great find - I'm happy!", 
    "This ia a wonderful addition to any room in the house and the color you see online is true when delivered. It took me about 10 minutes to put together. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "The chairs are a wonderful addition to my home. They are exactly what I was looking for, are quite large, and very comfortable. They were also quite well priced I thought. I received an overstock coupon just a few days after making my purchase, and they still honored it, which I appreciated very much. the only thing I will say is that they were not easy to put together. I have a friend who always puts my stuff together for me. He is a whiz, there's nothing he can't handle. It took him quite a long time to get the first one together, the second was a bit easier. Just for folks like me who find putting things together a challenge, be forewarned, you will definitely need help.", 
    "This is a really nice chair and I'd had my eye on it for a while. The reason I gave it 4 stars is 2-fold. While the chair is definitely a nice look I would not really recommend it for a living room \"accent\" chair - to me it looks more like an office chair, but maybe that's just my taste. The 2nd issue is that the chair isn't comfortable at all and it sits far back - you actually feel like you're falling into it when you lean back. A pillow would help but then it covers up the details of the chair. I ended up putting it in my bedroom since it matches my decor, and it's a nice chair to put bed pillows on and sit in when you're putting on shoes.", 
    "I love this chair and was so happy that I took the chance and bought two instead of one. For the price and the look and comfort of this chair I did very well!! This chair would compliment any area. I bought it in red and it is awesome.", 
    "The chair is very large and comfortable. The red color is a good complement to many decors; it is not too overwhelming.", 
    "I received this chair this morning, it's been 5 hours and two trips to the hardware store (missing screws) and it's still not together. Some of the holes do not line up and many of the holes are not drilled to the correct depth so I have to borrow a drill in order to finish the project.I'm still giving it at least two stars though because I do think that the finished chair will be gorgeous. Be advised that it is a LARGE chair. If you are buying this for a \"tight spot\" it is no little chair the seat is actually wider than my recliner.", 
    "This chair sit very well. Note that it is a very bright white and although I wanted a creamier white it looks great. Easy to put together. Contemporary while remaining comfortable.I will be ordering a 2nd today,", 
    "I purchased two of these chairs for our tech center in red. The leather on these chairs are soft and plush; looks like real leather! Very easy to clean if necessary. Great value!", 
    "I ordered 2 of these in sky blue and they are wider than expected, very sturdy and beautiful living room accent chairs. They are perfect for the room. Love it.", 
    "I had bought one chair a year ago and rearranged my living area and orderd a second one because I liked the first one so much. It was fairly easy to assemble and the quality is very good. No one knows that it is faux leather because it looks and feels so good. A steal for the price with free shipping and no taxes.", 
    "This is a beautiful chair and certainly looks like leather and the color is perfect; however, I had to have my contractor put it together and it would have been easy except the two front screws were way too long to fit. He said he could either cut two bigger wood block/s for support or cut down the screws. We decided he would do that. He will finish putting together the chair and I'll see it next time I'm at my AZ home but what a disappointment not to be able to see the chair fully put together. I as a mature woman could never have put the chair together myself I must say. I laid out all the pieces and parts but didn't want to tackle it.", 
    "I loved the chair when I saw it on the site and loved it more when I actually had it in my home! It is a rich, deep red color which is just beautiful, puts a warm glow in my bedroom. Loved it so much I purchased a second one! The picture is very accurate, the chair can fit in nicely in different spots, you will be glad to have this cheering up your home.", 
    "Nice construction, great color. I went with the red, and it's a nice rich red, not too dark, not too bright. These chairs are nice and deep. My husband approved of the width and length of the seat.", 
    "Loved the color and full seat; not really comfy- a bit hard. Had to contact customer service to get a replacement leg because one did not line up with the holes. But customer service responded in a timely manner. Only drawback was the chairs smell musty; been a while and they smell a little less musty but not totally gone yet.", 
    "Ordered the Red Chairs and used them in our lounge coffee Shop.Comfort and welcoming to many!", 
    "Nice heavy oversized chair. Easy to put together. Great value.", 
    "I liked it so much ordered a second one to match using in home office.", 
    "Cozy accent chair compliments my room", 
    "This was a replacement chair, and if a tantrum breaks this one..we will buy another. YES...it is just that good! Love that it is armless for big size comfort. Great for any room.", 
    "The chair is beautiful would have given it a five star but one leg is a little off but for the price and look the chair (in the red) it is so high end looking. It makes my husband's music room look so rich and the comfort is great too. We love it!!!", 
    "Beautiful accent chair for my living room. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Needed a nice looking chair. It looks great and easy to put together.", 
    "We are very happy with these chairs. 1came with a tiny nick in the leather but we plan on calling to order an exchange. Nice large size and comfortable", 
    "Chairs were packed nice and very easy to assemble. The chairs are very heavy and are comfortable to sit on. Would buy more from this manufacturer!", 
    "I love my cherry red chairs!", 
    "I get compliments on these chairs all the time, and they're super comfortable for people of all sizes, too.", 
    "I bought two of these for my new skincare spa and I love them. They are very nice ... looks like the picture but the chairs are larger than expected which was great. Perfect accent chair!", 
    "Chair was purchased for an office waiting area and it has stood up to the traffic very well", 
    "I bought several of these for a medical office waiting room. They look very classy, are of a generous size, and are comfortable. Recommend!", 
    "Arrived with split front leg. Awaiting response from customer service. So pretty tho....", 
    "This chair is oversized and so comfy. Love it.", 
    "Love the chairs. They look great in my office.", 
    "Great chair, perfect size and comfortable. I've literally seen this chair multiple retailers for double the price so I knew what I was.getting before I bought it.", 
    "We staged our home and they sold with it! Easy to put together. Check size they are very wide!", 
    "I ordered the blue chair - the color is a little off from how it looks in the picture. As an occasional chair it serves its purpose.", 
    "I purchased two of these in the dark brown faux leather side chairs, and I am very pleased with their appearance and quality, so far. They have a large enough seat that I can sit cross-legged in them and they don't take up very much room, which was a concern. Very good purchase for the price, too!", 
    "I just love this chair...I have it blue.", 
    "While the chair was attractive, it was way too large for my small space. But, the overwhelming reason for the return was the odor coming from the chair. To me, it smelled moldy. I hoped that by putting it outside on the porch the smell might dissipate, but upon returning it to the living room the smell returned.", 
    "Excellent Chair. Great Shipping.", 
    "I bought two matching brown chairs. Everyone that has walked into my house were surprised by the price. Look very stylish and modern.", 
    "What beautiful chairs these are but I did have a little trouble putting them in the holes.", 
    "I had read most of the reviews many times before I finally decided to place the order. While I was running an errand a couple days later, the chair arrived and my husband had it together and sitting in our living room when I got home. When I saw it, I couldn't believe how great it looked. The chair is very sturdy. The seat is firm but quite comfortable and the white faux leather looks more expensive than the price would indicate.", 
    "I have this chair in red. It is a favorite!", 
    "Very disappointed in these chairs. Very hard to sit on them. Not well made. The bottom of the seat is suppose to hold with velcro, but doesn't fit properly. So the black lining shows. Also very large which is deceiving.", 
    "Gets a bit wobbly, so not sure about the long term quality, but it is a comfy chair and looks great at the end of my kitchen table.", 
    "Beautiful chairs, easy to assemble", 
    "These chairs are easy to put together and look nice in my living room. I don't expect them to last very long and we barely ever use them, but they do the job for occasional seating.", 
    "I bought 2 of this chair. I love how true the color is as shown ( white) . It was very easy to assemble. At first, I was going to put these chairs side by side but after assembling them I was pleasantly surprised that they are pretty wide and they could be placed one on each side of my sofa right across each other. They look great!!!", 
    "I bought 2 of these chairs and they really are great. Comfortable and fitting in a living , or tv room or even bedroom. My friends are willing now to buy the same. Wish I could send a picture to help you with my review.", 
    "Ordered two red chairs, and the quality is fairly good. One of the chairs came in somewhat defective, but we decided to keep since we didn't want the hassle returning one of them.", 
    "I bought two of these chairs in white leather and it was a great purchase. Fits really well on our living room. For this price nothing cant beat it!", 
    "This is a lovely chair, I bought it for my living room, and had it reupholstered to Mach the sofa, it is elegant and well made. Easy to assembly and it looks like a set", 
    "Purchased this chair in 2010 and I loved this chair for years. It looked so beautiful in my apartment. It is very spacious and the frame feels solid. Unfortunately, last year I noticed that it was unraveling. We stopped using it for occasional seating, but the seams were still splitting and tears in the fabrics have spread from the corners. I love this piece, but I wish the fabric had been designed better. It is unusable right now, but we hope to get some fabric to replace the seat. The first few years I would have given this 5 stars, but since it is unusable right now, I can only give it 2 stars.", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks fantastic", 
    "I have ordered these chairs before for my office and were pleased with how they looked. We are expanding office space and I was glad these were still available. They are very sturdy and durable and that is what we needed.", 
    "When the chairs arrived I noticed on the wood that it had imperfections and appeared to have a partial accidental screw hole which had destroyed about an inch diameter in a very visible area. Then the buttons holding the underside together started falling off as I was taking the seat from the box, and the underside was ripped. I will be sending these back. The leather is so shiny it looks like plastic.", 
    "I purchased 2 chairs in red. Easy assembly and looks great. I like the wider seat b/c it makes it more comfortable to sit in. The red is a deep cherry red and looks very nice.", 
    "I added the Sky blue chairs to my office and they look beautiful. Many people have commented on how comfortable they are as well. Great buy!!", 
    "I was amazed how fast it was delivered, only 4 days. I love the chair. The seating area is wide enough for a larger person. It is however meant to be a side chair and is not soft. Still I'm happy with it.", 
    "These chairs are much larger than I thought they'd be. They look nice, not that comfy yet, but I would not have ordered them had I realized how large they are. Just know, they are large. There is nothing dainty about them. They do look nice.", 
    "I bought the sky blue chair. It is big and really comfortable. Everyone that comes into my living room comments on how cool the chair is :) I love it so much... it's such a cool piece, I know I'll be keeping this and working it in to my decor for a long time to come!", 
    "Love this chair. A little difficulty assembling, however. Directions include troubleshooting tips. Had to use long screws where they said to use short then it went together fine.", 
    "I love my chair it's just the right size for what I need it for, and I love the fact that you knew exactly what I wanted, I think you guys are wonderful,", 
    "Order 2 of the red chairs, shipped fast and were easy to assemble. The dark red chairs are perfect!", 
    "its a great chair pretty baby blue sturdy and comfy", 
    "The red is a deeper red and gorgeous. Looks very expensive. Easy to put together. The seat is very large and wide. Not wobbly", 
    "For faux leather, it sure looks real. The red is a nice shade; not the blues of a burgundy, but also not too orange. Kind of a deeper cinnamon, if you will.", 
    "Nice and firm. Not too low to the ground. Firm seat, but still cozy. Looks great..not cheap and vinyl-y.", 
    "This is my second chair like this. Bought this for my office. It is deep enough to fit the men that come in. I also put a pillow on it and it is perfect for shorter people now.", 
    "Came in beat up box and found indent on front after assembling. The top portion (backrest) was fine. Overstock customer service was great in allowing return. But when replacement arrived - also in a beat up box- the top portion (back rest) had a tear. They hadn't picked up the original so I unpacked and switched out the torn top for the original shipment's backrest. Chair is comfy and looks great.", 
    "These chair has held up well and very comfortable.", 
    "Bought these for our Real Estate office reception area. Attractive and sturdy! I bought the brown because of our western d\u00e9cor but love all the colors. These replaced some we had with arms which were problematic and embarrassing for larger folks. Now our more ample sized clients won't have to worry. I would recommend these chairs to anyone.", 
    "This chair is substantial, deep and masculine. I chose black.", 
    "Love these chairs, better in person. Very strong , wide to accommodate a larger person. Color is beautiful. Easy to put toghter.", 
    "This is a very attractive, solid, and easy to assemble (10 to 15 minutes required) chair. It also looks great in a mid-century modern d\u00e9cor setting. Highly recommended!", 
    "Was looking for a light blue chair for a bedroom. This is perfect!. Very stylish and comfortable.", 
    "I think all the reviews I read - were for the red version of this chair. I got the blue one to go with my color scheme and it is...AWESOME!!! The color is more pale teal blue than baby boy blue but either would've worked. Was relatively easy to put together by myself, about 1/2 hour. Very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Going on 2 years now and still love them.Went through 2 sofas and coffee tables, but kept the chairs.", 
    "Great extra chair for my office. Nice color, sturdy. Very easy to put together.", 
    "This chair is firm and comfortable and very big, it looks beautiful.", 
    "I love this chair. This is the 2nd one purchased for my living room. They are comfortable and look great.", 
    "This chair is awesome. The color is vibrant and comfortable!", 
    "Once again Overstock comes true - Very happy with this chair. Seat is HUGE. One thing the directions to assemble were off - the short bolts Must go in the front chairs (the long ones wont fit) Other then that LOVE IT !", 
    "Chair was easy to put together. Appears to be very durable to handle continuous use. Feels more comfortable than it looks. Profile of chair is low enough that it will not overwhelm a small space but not to low to get up from.", 
    "Purchased 2 of these as part of Youth Sunday School Room \"Coffee Shop\" makeover. They are very wide and sturdy and look like they will stand up to use by teenagers. Can easily wipe clean. Nice rich red color. Definitely look more expensive than they were. Very pleased.", 
    "Got two of these chairs on the strength of all the great reviews. I am very pleased/ I am a 63 year old female with arthritis and put each chair together easily in about 20 minutes each, follwing the excellent instructions. Very. very comfy and attractive. They look great flanking a buffet in my dining room. I could see these fitting in almost any room in the house or even in an office reception area. Excellent value.", 
    "love this chair, everyone that sees this chair wants one", 
    "This chair is huge. Im a big guy ex defensive tackle and I fit in the chair and have space. It also sits decently high. The color is really nice and building it wasnt to bad. It also adds a pop of color to the loft. Everyone who walks in is a big fan!", 
    "This chair is more of a pinkish color than red. The quality is poor and it looks cheap as well. I bought it based on the great reviews that I read about this chair. I regreat buying two of them and will definetly return them.", 
    "I have been wanting to order this chair for a long time. So glad I finally did. It is very comfortable and a great value. I saw a chair just like it at a furniture store for double the price. It is a larger than I thought it would be but I made room for it!", 
    "i loved this chair it did get lost in the delivery but it was worth the trouble i went thru to finally get it ,great value ,price was super for this chair i wouldorder another one but my studio has no more room bur for a small sofa which i hope to get here on overstock great chair im very very happy with my purchase", 
    "Arrived well packaged, easy to assemble, surprisingly comfortable. Using in a small room library; many compliments.", 
    "I was very surprised to see the accuracy of the color of the chair. My 13year old daughter assembled it upon arrival to our home. I was very surprised to see the size of the chair. Very impressed w/the workmanship of the chair. Very sturdy, impressive. A beautiful addition to our living room/family room. Thanks very much.", 
    "This has been an economical new addition to a home that needed furnishings (but couldn't handle big expenses). It looks great and is a comfy occasional chair for when company comes.", 
    "This chair looks great - very sturdy and went together very easy.", 
    "Purchased this chair for my small living room and it fits like a dream. When a vistors comes its the first chair they head for to check it out. Always good comments.", 
    "Placed in the music room where it invites musicians to sit and pick up an instrument. I love how this chair has changed the flow in the room.", 
    "Great red leather chairs for small spaces. Very wide width, a lot of chair and comfortable.", 
    "I Love this chair I can not say that enough...Even my Fiance loves it, and that is a wonderful thing because you know Men!!! I only wish I had enough room in my space for two of them however; I had to settle for one, and I am extremely happy with this beautiful Red chair What a way to give my space a pop of color...Amen!! Peace n Love", 
    "If I knew the color would be closer to pink than red i wouldn't have bought this chair. I was very disappointed as I expected a real red and not pomegranate /pinkish color.", 
    "it's a nice chair and even bigger than I imagine, happy with that. not hard to put them together, the color of the leather is awesome, match my deco very well. However, after 3 weeks sitting on this, I feel it's becoming shapeless.....I use it like a study chair so I have sit on it very often, about 2-3 hours a day, now the front edge of the flat top is turning down.... which make me feel not that happy ... however, you pay what you get..", 
    "I love this chair! It's very comfortable with a wide seat that doesn't slant back like most chairs do. The back is supportive without being overwhelming. I'm a novelist and I can write in that chair for hours and hours without getting tired. It's a beautiful rich red color, and the leather is pretty believable to me. The construction is sturdy and it's very easy to put together (a nice combo!). I tend to sit cross-legged and this chair is perfect for that. I also use it as a meditation chair very frequently and it works great. Highly recommend!", 
    "I was very nervous about ordering this chair. I ordered 2. I knew I would have to put them together...it was so easy! My 11 year old grandson did most of it. These chairs are very sturdy so I was pleases with that because I have some heavier clients that would be sitting in them. I really like the wide seat. I have gotten TONS of compliments on them...the size, the color and just the overall look of them. They look more expensive then they are. The only problem I'm hearing from my clients is the chair backrest leans back a bit too far. I am very satisfied with this purchase!", 
    "These chairs are fantastic! Very stylish, comfortable, and affordable. I am 6 ft tall and love how roomy they are. Incredible price and arrived quickly. Very easy to put together. I bought matching curtains from Overstock as well in the red color.", 
    "Great chairs. My 15 year old had no problem putting them togther. Arrived early. Love them!", 
    "This is a great chair for the money - bright red, sturdy, easy to assemble and looks quality. Be prepared though, it is large & a person would sit very deep in it if using the backrest. I would describe it as almost a chair and a half. I bought it for my bedroom and it is perfect for that use since it won't be used to sit on other than to put on shoes.", 
    "this chair is exactly as shown and very close to others reviews. Larger than thought even though measurments were given.", 
    "I bought the chair for our liviing room, mainly for decorative purpose. The chair is not at high quality but with the price, it is good enough. We rarely sit on it so I don't know how long it will last. The color matches exactly like the picture on the web.", 
    "Ordered two for someone else and got the chance to see them. I was sorry I didn't get one for myself. Great for small home living. because the seat is extra wide.", 
    "I bought this about a year ago. After it arrived, i went on O and ordered a matching one. These chairs are so comfy that even though i have a couch, people gravitate towards it and when they sit on it they dont want to get up. I have it with my dinning table. But caution these chairs are huge. I am a 6 foot tall girl so i like that i can cross my legs under me and my boyfriend is taller so he loves the chair but i think if you are a smaller person and you are looking for something smaller you may not want to go for this. But i love them and they bring an awesome pop of color to my living/dinning area. Definitely recommend it.", 
    "I was so excited when my chairs arrived. They are so beautiful.Everyone who visits my home loves my chairs. Very comfortable and has a lot of backside room for those who have junk in the trunk.:)", 
    "Love this chair, better in person! Easy assembly. Absolutely eloquent looking.", 
    "Expect a big seat, didn't realize how big it was! Very strong and looks nice!", 
    "sent a set to my son for his birthday .....love them................", 
    "You can't go wrong with this chair. Huge and comfortaale for ample bottoms.", 
    "I love this chair, it is very comfortable and fits in any room", 
    "I love this chair. It is sturdy and very roomy and easy to put together. It looks great in my office and is suitable for all shapes and sizes. It was inexpensive but doesn't look it.", 
    "This chair was bought to brighten a corner of the bedroom. The design is classic. The size is substantial, but perfect for the corner.", 
    "Exactly as pictured. No problems assembling. Recieved the chairs just a few days after ordering. Got many compliments on Christmas day from my guests. Comfortable and perfect for my family room.", 
    "These chairs are great!!! I bought 2 to use in my office and my clients like them very much. They are weel made..large area for your bum and sturdy. I was sent the wrong bolts for 2 of the legs...but went to home depot and got new ones...no big deal...for the price and quality.", 
    "I'm trying an eclectic look on my livingroom. I bougth 2 chairs and put it beside 2 white leather sofas.... It gave to that room a punch of color, warmth and elegance I was looking for.", 
    "I bought two of these gorgous chairs for the lobby in my salon. I painted a ruby red accent wall in the entry way and these chairs really help to tie it all together. I originally found identical chairs at a 'close out' store in my town, the only problem was they only had one display model left and the next nearest store was two hours away, and when I asked if they could order me one they said they only dealt with discontinued and overstocks, and wasn't able to take orders. Not to mention that my car was not big enough to transport them anyway, so frantically I searched all over the area only to find that nothing else really caught my eye, or was a good price. I reluctantly went home and remembered something the 'close out' store employee saying that they only sold overstocked merchandise, I thought Overstock.com and continued my search. It took a few clicks and found the exact same chairs. I was a bit skeptical that they wouldn't quite be the same as the ones I had seen, but they were identical. I get tons of compliments on them from all the clients that come to my salon, and they are so comfortable!", 
    "Love these chairs! What a great value. Easy to put together and they look perfect in my living room.", 
    "For a chair that under *** its a good value... There are a few things that I don't love about it like the color isn't what I was wanting and being a chair you have to put together having the back wood frame exposed makes it look like low end furniture... But you get what you pay for as this chair for me in my home just fills a space and dose the job until I find something more ideal...", 
    "Loved the chair, not too complicated to put together, arrived quickly and look great!", 
    "Love these chairs! Bought two for our living room. My husband had them put together in about 45 minutes for both. Took a while to level them and one chair has slight damage (splintered wood). Overstock was great, offering to send us new chair or small discount. We opted for the latter because the damage was covered once we put together the chair. We have a young cat so vinyl is a better bet than leather - regardless I think these chairs look modern, funky -- and are comfortable. We both drive small cars so the free shipping (O membership affords) is a huge perk. Happy with our purchase.", 
    "Chairs, yes I purchased two, arrived within a week. The first chair went together easily. The second chair, not so much; but upon completion both look great! The color is brick red and they make a unique statement paired together in front of the fireplace.", 
    "A well made, comfortable, good looking chair. Perfect for my entryway as I'd hoped it would be. The color is attractive and bright without being cheap looking. I had no difficulty putting it together and thought the hardware was more than adequate for the job, I think I'll have a sturdy, solid piece for a long time to come. I'm happy!", 
    "it is more wide than expected but it a wonderful purchase.", 
    "What a great chair! After carefully reading the reviews on many chairs I ultimately decided to purchase two of these. I was not disappointed. The chairs were easy and fast to put together and they look great in my living room. With brown curtains and a beige couch I really needed a pop of color and these chairs really did the trick. They look expensive and are very comfortable. The seat is nice and wide. They really make my living room more comfortable.", 
    "I purchased two of these for a model home's living room ... Although they are faux leather, they definitely have the look and feel of real leather and greatly enhance the look of the room.", 
    "Good product for price. We got similar brown ones from Ashley's furniture ( prebuilt). They did not have the red ones. IT is slightly lesser cost or O.com ( however need to assemble). Looks good. Would recommend.", 
    "I wondered if the chair would be sturdy since the price was so low, but I was swayed by the enthusiastic customer reviews that I read. I had my brother put it together for me and it went together smoothly. It fit perfectly in the spot in my bedroom where I envisioned it. As others have said, the seat is wide, so people of all sizes would find it to be comfortable..", 
    "I love this chair. Let me tell you it is big. The seat of the chair is large enough for me and my 5\"11 husband to curl up on. It is firm but comfortable. The style is modern but versitle. The color is like that of a deep ripe strawberry, that type of red. Worth every penny.", 
    "This chair was easy to put together, it matched the description. It is a great occasional extra chair for seating in my living room. It is not a chair for comfort to snuggle in (obviously) but a chair for conversation, short visits, extra seating, drinking a cup of coffee. Thanks O.S. for a great buy...just what I needed. Love the color and the quality and sturdiness of the chair for it's purpose.", 
    "finally ordered these chairs after reading the reviews many times, I thought they would be too much red, but boy was I wrong. Everybody that sees them loves them. They are are soooo beautiful. Easy to assemble and very sturdy. Look wonderful with my informal kitchen sitting area and now i cant get anyone to leave the kitchen. I will purchase two more.for family room.. If you are hesitating.....don't. You will love them.", 
    "Love this chair! Love the color and the seat part is much wider that expected, which is a nice feature.", 
    "I love the versatility of this chair! It makes a great side chair for a bedroom or living room. I am using it as a large desk chair because I liked the color and shape. The base (seat) is very large and a little on the wide side for a desk chair, but is is comfy and provides good support. I love the look and the rusty red color.", 
    "this is a great chair, comfortable, looks more expensive and perfect as an accent chair in my living room - modern but now stark. I put it together without any difficulty - wish I had room for another to have a pair.", 
    "I couldn't believe how absolutely gorgeous this chair was! The red is a very rich and elegant red. Not too loud. It was also extremely easy to assemble...just had to attach the legs. All in all I am very pleased with this purchase. I ADORE this chair. I should also mention that the chair is definitely larger than I expected too. Not your average/typical size.", 
    "Check the measurements - somehow, I expected a smaller chair (but I'm very happy with the size). I bought this to put in front of a fireplace - didn't want it taking up lots of visual space, since the fireplace is the focal point - and I love that it's relatively low and sleek. It's big enough to curl up on (even my 6'4\" husband can curl his leg under him on this big chair). It's comfy and cushy despite being so sleek looking. The color is gorgeous. A bit darker than lipstick red, but still a true red. Assembly had me cursing a bit. Tip - just barely start all the screws on the back of the chair before tightening any of them at all. It's rather cleverly constructed - the bottom lining attaches with velcro, so you can open it up to attach the legs, then sip it closed again. It wobbles a tiny bit, but not when someone's sitting in it - I'll hace to check whether the legs are adjustable, or if I've assembled it a tad incorrectly. Assembly consists of attaching the 2 front legs and the back 2 legs (the back and back legs are one pre-assembled piece), so not too bad, and everything attaches with the included hex wrench. No other tools are required. My only regret is that I only ordered 1; I think a pair would be very nice. It's a nice versatile shape and size, good for a living room, reading nook, or bedroom.", 
    "I have seen this chair it a furniture store and the cost if fairly more and it is a lovely chair. I am excited to see it on Overstock, however, I would love to see it in an off-white cream color which is the color I need. Waiting to see other colors available. The price sold here is a great buy.", 
    "I bought two chairs for my sitting area -- they are beautiful and look great! They look like high end more expensive pieces that you'd find in specialy furniture stores. One word of advise, if space is an issue check the dimensions before purchasing. I didn't do that and the chairs were much bigger than what I wanted and was expecting, but I loved them so much I didn't want to return them. On the plus side, because of their size they are very comfortable and sturdy. I highly recommend!", 
    "i bought 2 chairs and they are just as they look in the picture, they are occasional chairs so they are comfortable enough for that purpose", 
    "Love this chair...very well made and easy to put together...I am a larger person and this chair is very sound and comfortable. I will more than likely order one more", 
    "Love this chair. Generous size, looks like real leather, well built. I'm ordering another as soon as I finish this review.", 
    "I ordered this chair as an accent for my new home. Assembled it myself and am pleased with its condition and appearance--is a deeper red than the photo shows.", 
    "LOVE THEM!!! I ordered 2 chairs. They are beautiful. The pictured color is a little off, to me it looks like there is an orange undertone. That isn't the case. The color is a beautiful merlot red. They even match ottomans I bought years ago. Assembly was pretty easy. One chair took a little time. The legs were wobbly, so I had to go back to square one and redo. I would say YES order them.", 
    "I'm very happy with my purchase of the chair. The previous reviews helped me know what to expect - so thanks to everyone. The chair is dark red, not a bright cherry red. (I got the color I wanted.) I assembled it myself in less than 20 minutes. It was pretty straightforward - though the directions were pictures and numbers only, no words. That was one change I'd make. It arrived in less than a week - in great condition. As a another reviewer said, the chair isn't soft. It's comfortable, but not soft, or cushiony to sit on. I think it's a good chair for the money and would recommend it.", 
    "the picture doesn't do it justice- beautiful red chair. easy to put together, took about 15 minutes to do- i would certainly recommend this chair-", 
    "It is the perfect chair to have in our den, it goes really well with the red accents in the room. Like the previous reviewers stated, the chair is wobbly if it is placed on a hard surface floor. But we have carpet, so it is not a problem.", 
    "I have already recommended this chair to at least three other people. I assembled the chair alone, it would have been easier if I had help, but it was not problematic. It is quite attractive, but doesn't really look like leather as some reviewers have commented. I was expecting a brighter red, but the darker red matches just as well. It is very comfortable and the curved back supports the back very well. I love sitting in this chair with my legs tucked under and I am over 50. ;) The price should be about $125.00, I paid $*****.", 
    "This is a gorgeous chair and the shipping was very fast, as I received it in 4 days! The color is a very true red although I thought the picture here looked like there was an orange tint. Very easy to assemble and packaged well. The only bad thing to say, that I also read in previous reviews so I was prepared, is there is a slight chemical odor to the faux leather. Hopefully is goes away, but I still give 5 stars because this is a great chair for the price!!", 
    "I had been eyeing this chair for a while but had been out of stock until recently and jumped on it! Really glad I did because it is really EASY to put together and very solid and very comfy. I'm using it as a desk/computer chair and because it is such a large chair I have a pillow behind me which makes it just right. Am a recently disabled Veteran and among plethora of health issues, have degnerative disc disease and neuropathy, which this chair has alieved right away! Although it is not real leather, it certainly does NOT look like a cheap vinyl chair AT ALL! With incredibly solid construction and very thick cushion, I actually am thinking of purchasing another as a bedroom vanity chair. Even with neuropathy in hands as well as feet, after hand-screwing/starting bolts then using cordless driver, it could not have taken me more than 15 minutes to put together, finding the brief but adequate instructions self-explainatory! Thanks OS for getting this back in-stock, getting ten dollars off and free shipping! My Christmas gift to myself! Buy this chair, do not hesitate, just do it!!!", 
    "This is a very good quality chair, regardless of the price, which is very reasonable! My husband spent just a few minutes with assenbly, and we have a very pretty and extremely sturdy red chair. I really like it because the red is not a bright red, but still a true red. It was the perfect chair to sit the dog in to take his Christmas picture! Good job O!", 
    "Easy to assemble ---- and good looking. The seat is deep, so best for taller people -- but we have some pillows handy for when needed. The chair looks more expensive than it is.....good buy.", 
    "Chair is great and I agree with others and would buy another one. Its a solid chair with an great price. I didn't read all the reveiws but would also like to mention that the chairs do have a chemical smell to them, otherwise would have given 5 stars. I know its fake leather and the it looks real but the smell (at least for now and I hoping it goes away) confirms the faux lether.", 
    "This chair really adds character to a room! Although it is 'red' it almost has a kind of neutral tone to it that doesn't look odd in a home-y living room. With a few red accents around, it ties the whole area together. Very good quality too. It was very easy to assemble as well. LOVE IT!", 
    "Very beautiful and elegant chair. Easy to put together. Planning on ordering another one.", 
    "I bought 2 of these chairs and I am very happy with the quality. I shopped for chairs locally in the same price range and none were as nice as these. They were just a little larger than they seem in the picture but that wasn't an issue for me at all.", 
    "Instruction were not clear, but it was simply to figure out which screws goes where. I installed two chairs by myself and it took under 20 minutes after I figured where the screws goes. My husband came home the next day and loved it. It's elegant and comfortable. We had it staged by the window of our loft and everyone that visit loves it. Note: the long screws goes on all corners and the short screws goes in the middle of back frame of the chair.", 
    "This is my first on-line furniture purchase, so I was a little nervous. After reading the other reviews, I decided to take a chance on this chair. I'm very glad I did! It arrived in less than a week, was easy to put together and there were no missing parts. The quality is excellent. The chair is solid and all the hardware pieces lined up perfectly so there is no teetering from uneven legs. It's very solid and looks awesome. It's a beautiful deep red and it's actually comfortable to sit on. I'd definitely recommend it for it's quality and great price.", 
    "I ordered 2 chairs after reading other reviews. They arrived on time, simple & fast to put together. They are not stitched too great but good for the price. One was wobbly but put a skid pad on 1 leg so now it's okay.", 
    "Nice chair for the $$. The picture doesn't fully show the deeep vibrant color of this piece. Looks more expensive. Would definitely order again.", 
    "Great addition to the corner of guest room. Easy to assemble! Great for a splash of bright color in the corner of my newly decorated guest room.", 
    "Really love these two...they add to a very elegant room...", 
    "Very happy with this purchase. Looks just like the picture. It is a fairly large chair. I assembled it in apx. 30 minutes with no problems. I would definitely buy again.", 
    "I bought 2 of these chairs for my son's living room in his new house. They look fantastic, and he loves them. He said they were very simple to put together. I am so glad I bought them.", 
    "This chair is exactly what I wanted for my office. It looks and feels like real leather but the best thing is the color. It's the perfect red.It makes my all black and white office POP. Thanks Overstock I love you .", 
    "I just acquired this piece, and it looks fantastic in my hallway. I fits perfectly, and everyone loves how the color stands out with my dark furniture. Perfect!", 
    "...I didn't buy TWO. I absolutely love the chair. The bottom portion is huge though, I've got to warn you. When pulling it out of the box, you're defiantly going to have wide eyes at how large the seat is, but once you put it together (which, setup is super easy, took 20 minutes tops), you'll fall in love. It goes perfect with the Provence Crimson Red Microfiber Flared-arm Sofa (also got on overstock, check it out!). A good firm seat, that is comfortable. Arrived in perfect shape. I really wish I had gotten two, and perhaps I will in the near future.", 
    "i bought 2 of these and couldn't be more pleased. they were a breeze to put together and are a perfect solution for me. they are bigger than i imagined and fit my back and legs like they were made for me. i was going to put this in my spare room for sewing, but it is going to be my 'internet chair' because it is so comfortable!!", 
    "I just love my chair I wish I could have order ottoman to match my beautiful red faux leather chair, it big and have enough room for two people to sit. This is one awesome well made chair and worth the money, this is my first time ordering from this company, and I will be ordering again Thanks", 
    "I recently bought two of these chairs after reading the reviews. They are beautiful, comfortable and large. The color has a hint of rust but are still a true red. You won't be sorry! Amazing for the price!", 
    "I really love my chairs! They match perfectly with my curtains and they were really easy to assemble. My 14 year old son put them together for me in about 20-30 minutes. Everybody who comes here tells me they are comfortable and some even want to take them home. Great buy and i am very happy!!", 
    "This chair looks great and comfortable. Easy to assemble. However, it is larger than I had thought. Overall, I'm happy about the purchase, especially for the price.", 
    "Received order quickly, went together quite easily, color is just as in photo. Quite happy with purchase. Should be aware chair is large, as stated in other reviews. Have been happy with everything from Overstock.", 
    "nice big chairs, easy to put together and they are so cute!", 
    "Purchased this as an accent chair. Assembly was simple, color matched online photo, comfortable.", 
    "Everyone loves this chair and are jealous of the upscale look in my new kitchen. One red chair added the pop pf color needed in my space. Buy it, you'll love it!!! Easy to assemble, quick delivery.", 
    "I love my chair, the color is so beautiful. The chair matches my couch, it looks like a set.I recommend this chair to anyone that wants to add flavor to their living room.", 
    "As others have said, this chair is larger than expected. Very comfortable to use no matter your size. Put together in about 10 minutes. GREAT COLOR and LOVE the style. Delivery was quick, and as always, the chair was packed fantastic. No damage at all. Was using a coupon and having trouble. Customer service helped out on chat and get everything corrected. I love the chat option. No holding or perhaps talking to someone you cannot understand. Everything was terrific on this purchase.", 
    "I've been looking at this chair for several weeks now. I read all the prior reviews and finally said this is the chair for me. I wanted a accent chair for my den and decided on this one. After I placed my order I anxiously waited for its arrival. I opened the box and said oh, my god what a beautiful punch of red the bottom seating is very wide. I put the chair together which was very, very easy it took me no more than .30 min or so. I set it up exactly where I wanted it and just stood back in amazement at how good the entire room looked. I immediately took pictures and sent them to family & friends. I should have saved the picture because I intended to attach it to this review. I then opened my 2nd box and put that chair together this time it took me less than .30 min. My room is absolutely gorgeous now with the purchase of my two chairs. They look good, very comfortable, and were easy to assemble. Thanks Overstock.", 
    "This is a great piece for the money. It is a nice large, contemporary chair and comfortable. The only reason, I'm taking away a star is that putting the legs on was a bit tricky as they started no problem (the screws) and then 3/4 way through it became very difficult to continue with the allen wrench. I backed out and in a couple of times and thought maybe it was supposed to push through something solid. Turns out I cracked the leg on the inside (both legs). You can't notice and is still sturdy but will take away a star due to that. Overall, I would buy another one though.", 
    "Overstock had it delivered within four days of ordering; good packing for shipment; fairly easy to follow instructions for assembling. The chair sits wells and it looks great in the living room.", 
    "Its bigger than it looks, but a really cool chair, We love it!", 
    "Love this big chair! Purchased this chair for my barber shop. I have a few very large men that are clients. Needed one large chair just for them. Didn't want anything to feminine, you know how males can be! Put the chair together fairly fast, except four of the bolts were to long. Went to ***** bought four shorter ones, and it's all good! Thank you Overstock! Genie", 
    "This chair is a great value and a great chair. It comes well packed and protected. Easy to assemble the back and legs. Easy to read instructions. The chair is a great size, large enough to feel substantial and but not too large for a bedroom or living room. Makes a great accent chair and can easily be moved from room to room, as we do. The chair sits well and is comfy for long conversations and relaxing. I'd definitely recommend it to my friends. And, as always Overstock shipped quickly. Love it.", 
    "Really nice chair; It was a bit larger than I expected, but great look and comfortable.", 
    "I recived the Red accent Chair in 4 business days. I thought that was very fast given the size of the chair. It came UPS shipping. The chair was very easy to put together and bigger than I thought it would be. The quality was Excellent. The chair is sturdy and level. The chair is very comfortable and firm. I put the Accent Chair in my livingroom next to my fireplace.I love to sit on it and relax after work. I'm very happy with my purchase of the Red Accent Chair. Thanks Overstock! NADEGE", 
    "Arrived in great condition, assembled in 10 minutes and ready to use. Comfortable with deep seat, very sturdy and a beautiful addition to my library. My kids call it my inspiration for how I want the room to look. Love the look, quality and price!", 
    "This is one more product from overstock that i have no complain of,this chair is really big and really expensive looking,they're really worth it!!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "I was very leery of ordering chairs online. I took a chance. I am so glad I did. I love these chairs. I received 2 chairs within 2 days. These chairs are very sturdy, extremely hype and comfortable. The red match to my deco perfectly and great for my Christmas Party!!! Can't wait to see my friends reaction when they see the chairs in my living room.", 
    "I ordered two of these chairs for a formal sitting room based on the rave reviews. I'm certainly not as impressed as most of the purchasers. My husband actually took these out of the box first and wanted to send them back upon first glance. His exact quote was, \"You bought red pleather chairs?\" I think most people *should* be able to tell that these are not real leather because it is quite shiny, not quite plastic looking, but on that spectrum. They are soft to the touch more like real leather though. I love the design of the chair and the relaxed, reclined position it puts you in for sitting. We added pillows to the back which makes the chair quite comfortable. BUT... my biggest problem with this chair is that I found them at a home store called \"** ****,\" which used to be called ****** *****, which is owned by ******* for $ cheaper!", 
    "No !!", 
    "Very Pleased... so much I would buy another one. Very Comfortable for an occasional chair. Easy to assemble."
