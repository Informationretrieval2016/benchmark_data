    "The table arrived very quickly and was easy to unpack and my husband was able to assemble it in less than 2 hours. The table is exactly what was stated in the description - unique! The color and finish (plywood covered with a shiny, sleek veneer) matched the product description, so I was very pleased as I bought it specifically to match my ivory sectional. No, it is not real wood, but for my purposes it is exactly what I wanted - a unique, contemporary piece of furniture that is very pleasing to the eye, matches my decor, is very easy to clean (damp cloth) and will not easily scratch. The dimensions were perfect for my space. Overall, I am extremely pleased and am glad I purchased this product at such a reasonable price! Thanks, Overstock!", 
    "Easy to put together, solid and sturdy. Looks really great when put together - can't even tell it came flat pack and needed assembly. Sure enough there will be people that don't like it but for the previous reviewer, if you could find solid wood table that look this good for this price tag - would you mind taking me there?????? With all that said, I love my new coffee table!", 
    "Sturdy, nice deep, dark wood. The surface top is larger than I expected (a big size for a coffee table). But, for the price, a good buy. I will likely be able to use it for several years.", 
    "Overall this is a very nice and good size coffee table. I like the fact that it sits low to the ground, same height as my sectional. Makes it perfect for snacking and a good game table top. Would definitely recommend to anyone!", 
    "Not one of the reviews I could find accurately described it as a bit cheap in workmanship and quality...The picture on the website doesn't truly do it justice...It's solid and does look nice but on closer inspection as well as touch, it's quite clear that it's a bit cheap.There is a nice feature in that there's a hidden compartment in the center to store things which we weren't aware of at first.It does the trick though and for the price it's a fair deal...Just not quite as impressive in real life as the picture might have you believe", 
    "I love this table. Very easy to put together, sturdy and looks gorgeous in my family room.", 
    "Just got my table! didnt expect to receive it so soon. Everything was well packed and didnt take that long to put together. It does seem alittle darker in person, but it still looks great and im excited about the new addition.", 
    "Coffee table is sturdy, high quality, and easy to put together. We love the secret door. We decided to install a handle on it and it looks great!!! Love everything we buy from o.co!", 
    "I love the table and the fact that it has a door you cant really tell is there. I received my order right away and its a great piece of furniture for the price. Im definitely happy with the table.", 
    "Great looking table and I love the little secret compartment, I keep all the extra remotes in. I received my order pretty fast asme week I ordered it. Everything was well packed and I had no issues putting it together. The edges are alittle point but from the picture you can tell that, so it wasnt a surprise and if you have a young child like I do. I just went to the store and bought The edge covers and ive had no issues with it. So all in all im happy with the new table.", 
    "I love my new pagoda coffee table with its hidden storage compartment. It took me about 90 minutes to put it together by myself. It's solid and sturdy. And it's unique. I've received several compliments on it already. One thing I would say it that the surface scratches easily. That is the only drawback I have found.", 
    "The amount of room that the table top has is incredible and it is very sturdy and if you see the color and qaulity in person, you would be ssurprised. It's very good quality. The panel underneath can also be used and it's also very sturdy. All in all the whole thing is quite sturdy and it was easy to asseble altogether.", 
    "This is a fabulous table. It really compliments my living room. I bought a beige rug to achieve the exact look they have on the picture. The table looks longer on the picture, but in reality once assembled it's more square looking, but this didn't changed my mind about the purchase of this table. It's really nice and gives your living room a different, more modern look. I have received many compliments on this table. It's really nice!!!", 
    "no complaints - nice piece for the money, had to have help to assemble", 
    "I've never seen a coffee table like this before, it's a great table. I got mine in just 2 days and very easy to set up. The quality is also great, a very solid wood used for the table, and the price is better, and what a bargain. I highly recommend it, it's a great table for a very low price.", 
    "Marvelous table, it's very unique in its style, easly to assemble, and quality beyong great especially with such low price that I paid for it. I'm very impress with my coffee table it's an outstanding table!", 
    "i love my coffee table! easy to assemble. looks expensive and very contemporary. highly recommend it!!", 
    "The product came promptly, it's great for the price. The one thing that made it a 4 instead of 5: the wood had an extremely pungent odor... like chemicals or something. It's slowly going away but every now and then I get a whiff of it... it's horrible. That's the only complaint. Otherwise, beautiful color... looks just like the picture.", 
    "I was looking for a very dark brown table that would match my entertainment center and this was a perfect match. The size of the table was perfect for the space I had to put it in. It matches the decor of my living room. Everyone that has seen it loves it. They thing I paid lots more that I actually did. I read a review that stated that their table was delivered with a lot of scratches. My table was delivered in perfect condition. It was also very easy to put together.", 
    "When we saw this, we knew it would fit perfectly in the mid 50s modern house we had just moved into, and with the other dark brown stained furniture we had so far furnished the living room. The house is wide and low with flat & square roof sections with overhangs, so the table design literally echoes the house itself. This is a design we'd not seen anything like elsewhere; we'd spent months looking at and sharing links to other tables on the web, and I think this design is the first one we both said \"yes\" without hesitation to. Although this table is not as high end as most of the other furniture we have (those pieces are solid natural wood, while this table is venerred flatpack MDF or whatever its called), it doesn't look out of place & is all we would expect at this price point. The \"secret\" storage under the table surface is a nice plus. Assembly took me maybe 30-45 minutes, and the smell so many complain about was there, but not bad and disappated quickly.", 
    "This table adds an oriental touch of class to our den! The dark wood and pagoda shape add a beautiful accent to our room. Highly recommend this piece...great value and a great table!", 
    "This product has to be the best deal on the market. It was very simple to put together and looks amazing all of my friends are wowed by it.", 
    "Such cute table with good quality. Price is incredible for the quality that it has. Easy to assemlb;e and arrived really fast. I'm glad I bought this coffee table, it goes with the rest of my things.", 
    "I waited a while before finding the right coffee table. This table looks exactly like the picture. It was easy to assemble. It is very sturdy and really goes well with my living room furniture. I love it and would recommend it. It is a little larger than I thought it would be, but that is okay, it still fits well in the room.", 
    "I love this table! It is exactly as pictured. I think the quality and color are great and its very durable. The surface wipes clean with a damp cloth. It only took me 40 minutes to assemble everything and it was very easy to do! Great table for the price!", 
    "I love the style of this table, it looks just like the picture. I have a sectional and it fits nicely in the center of it. I am not good at putting things together....but somehow this only took me 45 minutes and i did it all by myself. Everything was pre-drilled so there was no wondering where things were supposed to go. I've gotten numerous compliments. Would buy it again in a heartbeat", 
    "I'm very impressed with the style of my coffee table, is something that I've never seen before and I love it very much. The strong and sturdy quality, the stylish tower design, and to top it all that, I love the afforable price. I was afraid of purchasing a furnitre online but I crossed my finger, and received this coffee table in just 3 DAYS!!, in perfect condition, and the assembly was very easy to follow and it only took me 30 minutes. Very well written manual. I'm very happy with my coffee table, it looks great with my other furniture.", 
    "This coffee table shipped fast, was well packed and after somewhat long afternoon of assebly...it looks beautiful in the livingroom. The door was a surprize. Welcome storage. I was impressed by the quality and loved how the pieces were sectioned off in sealed plastic compartments, so you had everything you needed. My friend who helped asseble it now wants one!", 
    "I love this table,so nice and it has that asian modern style look! Very very easy to assemble and the quality is great and quite sturdy. The price is great and so was the shipping. I'm very happy with my purchase of this marvelous coffee table.", 
    "I love the size and the storage unit on this table. The color matches very well with our other furnishings.", 
    "I have to echo what others have said about this coffee table. It arrived earlier than I expected. It took me about an hour to assemble. And it looks lovely in my living room. Fabulous purchase! Don't know what I would do without Overstock :)!", 
    "Love this coffee table! Fits perfectly in my living room! True to color and very affordable! Yet it has a sophisticated classy look!", 
    "The Coffee Table came in great time (as always, thanks Overstock!) I have never put a piece of furniture together by myself but this time I had to, I found it fairly simple by following the detailed instructions and had it assembled in less than an hour! It is a great addition to our Living room, looks stylish, is not too heavy and looks way more expensive than it is :)We liked it so much we ordered a second one!", 
    "I really love this coffee table. The color is nice if you're style is dark wood & the overall design is very modern to me, which I love. It was easy to put together. My mother & I had it up within an hour. My one & only complaint is I wish it sat just an inch higher/taller.", 
    "Great product, assembly instructions could have been a bit better, it takes about an hour to assemble.", 
    "The table is PERFECT! It was very easy to put together. I love the height of the table and the secret storage area. I would definitely recommend this table. GREAT BUY!", 
    "This table looks even better in person. It is very stylish and looks more expensive then the list price. It is modern and top quality. I am overly pleased with this table.", 
    "Beautiful table and design. Very easy assembly. Was looking for an Asian design with a modern feel. This table is a perfect accent for my other furniture.", 
    "I recommend the product if you need a good size table for a small space. I use it as a centerpiece and it really dominates the area. What's also nice is the storage space beneath.", 
    "I am always pleased with Overstock purchases. This table was a great steal because I am furnishing my new home in Atlanta. It was easy to put together and the end result yielded great results!!", 
    "This coffee table was perfect for what I was looking for. Another home run for Overstock which works for me. The color is great, a nice rich dark wood and it was easy to put together. I was able to put this table together alone with just using a phillips head screw driver. Thought I would need a power drill, but nope I did not. I will be ordering again from Overstock. Thanks!!!", 
    "The table arrived very fast. The instructions were great. All pieces were enclosed. It took me 90 minutes to put together by myself. I love the design of the table. I placed it where I needed it. It looked beautiful and I was very delighted I made a good choice. That was at night. The next morning when the light came into the room it showed 2 rippled lines the length of the table. I think it is where they seamed the table together. It looks like the tables was put together in thirds. Since I threw out the table it replaced I had no choice but to keep it. I am going to try to order a glass to place on top of the table to see if it will disguise the imperfection. This will cost about ***. Now I know why the price.", 
    "overall i love the product and i would definitely recommend it a friend.", 
    "it is a great table. nice color, size, style. I highly recommend it.", 
    "I wanted a coffee table in the espresso color to match my decor. This table matched the color and the decor of my living room. It took a while to choose between this table and another. I thought this table would be too big, however it fits perfectly. It also was simple to put together.", 
    "I'm very happy with my coffee table, very nicely done in how is made and the materials used is of good quality. I like it very much because it's also unique and it goes well with the rest of my furniture. The quality is very nice and the price is great, plus delivery was very fast. I love my table.", 
    "I like it becuse of the two table top that comes with this model. Top and bottom. Very sturdy, quick assemble, just a few pieces to put together. Color finish is perfect for the sofa I bought to go with it, and it's very sturdy and several used of this table and still in perfect condition just the day I got it.", 
    "The table looks very great in my living room. The height which is a little bit taller than my couches was perfec, it's easier to reach for stuff without stressing your back having to reach low like the other coffee table. This table looks amazing and it is sturdy like others say and yes very heavy wood.", 
    "I got mine a couple of months ago or maybe more but I still can't help but to stare. I love it! It's a nice coffee table and it stands out from the other coffee table out there. Like others say, the quality is great and the in looks great even in person, and they're right. My coffee table is very nice!", 
    "Product arrived damaged.Multiple scratches on table top.Overstock was very easy to work with in sorting out this issue.", 
    "This table is beautiful for the money!! It's a perfect size to fit my sectional with plenty of room to walk around. Looks very stylish. Assembly wasn't hard, took under and hour. Only cons are it shows any kind of smudge, but I just wipe it down. Not really a problem. The corners are sharp, so if you have little ones just get the corner covers. Over all I'm incredibly pleased with this table.", 
    "Arrived in probably the best packaging I have ever seen! I wish everything came this well-packaged! Not difficult to put together. I wish it was heavier than it is as it tends to slide around on the wood floor. I will correct that by getting a rug underneath it. It comes with plastic 'feet' versus rubber so it slides. The other issue that may bug some is that it marks relatively easily with oil from fingers. All in all, love the price/quality/styling combo.", 
    "This coffee table is very stylish and affordable. It is very low compared to other coffee tables but again definitely the look I was going for. Putting it together was easy, this was an awesome purchase. And so much less than what you spend at furniture stores with free delivery.", 
    "Easy to assemble, nice looking. It gives a feeling of a very sturdy furniture, and I think it will last long.", 
    "It took 2 of us less than 1 hour to assemble the coffee table, given that we are not very handy, I think assembly is considered easy. The design is nice, pretty good quality.", 
    "My husband and I are a rather a young couple and our whole place is very modern, except for the table we had. So i searched everywhere to find the perfect one, and taaa daaa this one was it. It arrived in a timely manner, and was pretty easy to put together, and best of all it looks great! It was the missing piece in ou decor. For the price it was a great buy!", 
    "Easy to assemble and love the hidden door that the children have no clue is there.", 
    "The color, style and look of the table is FANTASTIC... absolutely love it. Was a breeze to assemble it", 
    "The product was delivered on time. we really love this coffee table because the color is so rich and it matches our design theme in the house perfectly. The table is unique, sturdy, and would definitely recommend to others!", 
    "It matched what was seen on web site.The color looks splendid.", 
    "I took a leap and boy was it a great one! I needed a small yet stylish coffee table for my living room space. I wanted something different that would catch attention however match my decor at the same time and this was perfect. It is very sturdy, easy to assemble (literally walks u through with diagrams too!), and the hidden storage compartment is a hug bonus for remotes and things. Would definitely purchase this again if I were looking for another coffee table!", 
    "This is a perfect little table. Easy assembly and the secret door is a good place for storage. Very durable and great for family games. It looks modern and fits nicely. As a center piece in the living room.", 
    "Arrived on time in good condition. Assembling was easy n once all together.. the table in my sitting area gives a very expensive look.. goes very well with my chocolate and creme color leather sofas. Glad I ordered this product. Overstock has never disappointed me.", 
    "It is a wonderful table! We like to use Asian-inspired decor in our home, and this table is very complimentary to that theme. It has a great storage nook that you don't even notice. It was fairly easy to assemble. It tends to get dirty pretty quickly; we have a 6 year old and a 10 month old, so that doesn't help. Don't buy this table unless you are prepared to wipe it down daily. The 8 corners are fairly treacherous to the kids, but no ER trips yet. Also, it isn't husband-proof. He dropped a pan on it (don't ask) and it left a big ding (apparently solid looking top isn't solid). Somehow hubby got most of it to flatten with a mallet, so you don't really notice it now (except for where the ding took off a smidgen paint). Overall, we love the table and would buy it again.", 
    "This product is like everything else I have purchased from overstock, GREAT! Nice inexpensive coffee table. Did not take my boyfriend too long to put together and after a few months still looks great. The hidden compartment is great to hide tv remotes or hide coasters. Has a great surface area!", 
    "This is a wonderful table. I needed this exact size to go with a new sectional I bought. My husband had no trouble putting it together and you cannot beat this table for this price. Do not hesitate to buy this!", 
    "I didnt realize how large the top part of the table would be. I was disappointed at first cause i just imagined it smaller but after rearranging my living room, it looked perfect. I'm glad with my purchase.", 
    "Looks very modern. I will get custom glass top to avoid scratches since I have little kids in the house.", 
    "Great little table for the price. Easy to put together. Easy to clean.", 
    "If you are looking for a sleek & trendy coffee table this is for you. Very easy to put together and the picture is true to description. However, be sure to clean with a towel and water. Pledge will leave noticeable grease marks.", 
    "this table is great and very sturdy. I have gotten plenty of compliments from family and friends", 
    "I liked this very affordable table for the function and style. Be careful the top is not stable to lean on. Must be an engineer to put it together. My friend was a real sport to do this and the degree of difficulty was off the charts. The shelf which is the base of the table is perfect for keeping the remotes and other things that clutter the table top. Sleek look and the size make the table perfect between two loveseats. I like it and so glad I didn't have to put it together. Family mocks me about warning everyone about the instablility of the top for leaning on.", 
    "This is a great coffee table that matched our new living room furniture. It's a great looking piece and very sturdy. Easy assembly right out of the box with easy to understand directions.", 
    "We bought this for your living room. Husband is super picky when it comes to furniture so anything we buy has to be somewhat stylish as well as high quality for a low price. This table worked out perfectly. It seems very sturdy and was super easy to put together.", 
    "Very nice table. Easy to put together. The only problem was that there were no holes for the hinge screws, but I just superglued the hinge! You need only a screwdriver to put this together. My daughter and I put it together in half hour. Table looks very stylish and solid. Ideal if you are looking for a low center table", 
    "I can't believe how wonderful this coffee table was! It is made of good and heavy wood. It's shiny, and a wonderful dark chocolate color. The bonus drawer is a plus. This coffee table gives my living room a modern posh look. I was aiming for a japanese style pagoda look, and this fit it perfectly. This is a big table! I don't think the pictures give it justice. Installation is easy! I'm a girl and easily put it together by myself in less than 1 hour. Very well assembled and sturdy.", 
    "This is a beautiful table! It looks wonderful in my family room. It took two people to put the table together, the directions are only pictures.", 
    "I don't think that I would buy another one, but I wouldn't send this one back.", 
    "The table was larger than I expected. Very good-looking piece of furniture. My 19 year old son assembled it for me without any help.", 
    "This is a nice coffee table that would match many styles. It was not hard to put together. It took my brother and I about 30-45 minutes. I really like the secret door in the middle. It is more like a very light wood grain than white. Quality is about 3/5. Nothing was defective, but after it was put together you can see the beam indents on the top of the table. Also, not sturdy enough to sit on the edges. Overall, a good buy.", 
    "Wouldn't buy this item again, and I wouldn't recommend this item either.", 
    "Very nice table. Color is darker than the picture but is very nice.", 
    "Great coffee table for my living room. So unique, stylish, and the quality is great! I'm very happy with my coffee table, so easy to set up, and the price is amazing for such a great table.", 
    "This is an amazing addition to my living room. It looks very modern. Unfortunately, there were scratches on top :( which i cover with a suitable cloth so it works well. amazing piece for the price you pay.", 
    "A great table at very reasonable price! Very happy with the buy.", 
    "The price is so great, I needed a coffee table for the livingroom so it doesn't look so plain with just the sofas but also one that I can afford. This table such a bargain price and the quality itself is amazing. Sturdy and not sure if it's real wood but very thick, solid type of wood. I also like the style, is like have 2 table top, and the I like the fact that I didn't wait very long for my table, Overstock shipped it to me right away in perfect conditions. Left on my porch nicely and no damages what so ever. Love the service and my table.", 
    "We have had this table for a few days now and absolutely love it! It was super easy to put together. My can't-ever-put-something-together-correctly-the-first-time boyfriend actually did it 100%! The instructions are super easy to understand, and the pieces are easy to read in regards to what goes where. It is absolutely gorgeous and very sturdy!", 
    "For the money, you really can't beat this. I think it looks more expensive than it is. It came w/o assembly instructions, but Overstock emailed them to me very quickly. I especially love the hidden storage compartment. Easy to assemble, only took maybe 30 minutes at most. Beautiful deep brown color and easy to clean. I'm very happy with it.", 
    "This table is somewhat in the simplicity side which I love but it also has that very modern design that makes it better than simple. It didn't take very long to assemble but the result was amazing. Good looking coffee table, very sturdy, and the quality is great. I like the idea that you can actually place somehing at the bottom and it's so sturdy that you don't worry about anything being unbalanced or falling for that matter. I love this table, really great! The price is also great that's why I got it and it comes with fast shipping without paying extra.", 
    "I've had this coffee table for a year now and it's stylish and very sturdy. It has a small compartment for storage and is hidden quite nicely. When cleaning, avoid using rough material as it can scratch the surface. Other than that, it's awesome!", 
    "Fairly easy to put together... with one or two minor mix ups that were correctable with some fiddling around. Has a masculine look to it, although there is a definite architectual curiosity about it . Once put together it was level and sturdy. My daughter claimed it immediately and uses it as a computer monitor/keyboard table with a comfy beanbag to hunker down on. Since it is a big opaque square it does better with a plain rug or floor since it hides designs under it.", 
    "Table is great and sturdy and was easy to assemble and it didn't take very long. The quality is great, lovely color finish and most of all the price is great. This table goes well with all of my furniture in the house. I love it this table!", 
    "I love the Pagoda Coffee Table. It is low lying so it doesn't overpower the furniture. Unfortunately the top had a visible nick in it, but the customer service department handled it efficiently and will replace the top. I like the lines of the table, and love Asian accent pieces, so this blends beautifully with the rest of my decor. The hidden door is a great place for invisible storage. I think I will be very happy with purchase for years to come.", 
    "I went back and forth about ordering this table...and I finally did it. I'm sooo glad I did. I love my new table it is a great addition to my new sectional. I love the contempary feel that it gives. It looks great. It was really easy to put together, I did it myself in about 2 hours. My only dislike about it is that you can kinda see groves in it, I guess it's from the pressure of the packaging, I'm hoping this goes away. Other than that I would have given this table 5 stars. It has a great look, and looks more expensive than it is, I really love it all in all.", 
    "I was worried that it was going to be too low to the ground as my last coffee table was higher, but it's the perfect height. Nice dark color and sturdy. Took a little while to put together but I was able to do it by myself and it wasn't complicated. The directions are very helpful and I love the little hideaway storage in the middle!", 
    "The style and the quality is outstanding on this table. When it arrived in just a couple of days, as I was assembling the table I noticed how the quality of all the stuff that came with the table, it's of good quality and solid panels. It was easy to assemble and it's just perfect. Look every where else, you will not find such beauty of style, pretty tasteful design.", 
    "Table arrived extremely well packaged. Took about an hour to put together, but all the parts were there. Wood is heavy and solid. A corner of the table arrived damaged, but it's a small area and a very heavy piece to consider returning, etc., and it doesn't bother me too much. Overall I'm very pleased with the table's appearance. It's a mahogany stain, slightly shorter than it appears in the picture, and has a \"secret compartment\" contained in the center of the table between the two levels.", 
    "It was a suitable fit for our living room: 1. Color matched with other furnitures. It was same as shown in picture 2. Easy to assemble. 3. I checked the dimension 36*36 before purchasing. It fits good in our living room. 4. Good packaging.", 
    "Just love how it's designed and the quality is great. Very sturdy table and provide a great room for all my guest and my friends always ask me about the table and they love the style and color. I love my table, it goes well with all of my other things in the house.", 
    "Yes on this coffee table. It's great in every way. It's sturdy and the dark brown color is nice with this coffee table. if you order it now, you'll get it sooner than you know, even in the same week like I did.", 
    "The table caught my eyes because it's a very attractive coffee table and when received it, it was very heavy and the setting up was quick. The dark brown with a hint of cherry is perfect, the color finish brings out the style of the coffee table. Just perfect table for my pad.", 
    "great table that comes with good solid quality wood. It's exactly what I was looking for and I love it so much! It looks so so nice with my sofas and very sturdy too.", 
    "Is a thing of beauty. The color is great and very heavy table wich proves to me that it's good quality. The deliver that Overstock was also great, it was fast and it only took me under 3 minutes to assemble. Great table.", 
    "The table is just the way I like it. A lot of table top space and the table was easy to set up and really nice looking. Plus the table is sturdy and the design looks great.", 
    "I am very happy with this table it matches my living furniture perfecty. I love the price, its looks very experience. Its bigger then its looks in the picture but its ok. Still a great buy.", 
    "Overstock made me a happy customer! First delivery within literally 3 days, easy assembly manual to follow, and the table is full of great quality. I highly recommend this coffee table, I'm one satisfied customer!", 
    "I'm happy with my purchase. Overstock delivery was fast and hardly spent anything on shipping and the way instructions was created with pictures, is a great idea. I'm happy with my top of the line coffee table.", 
    "I've had table for quite a few months now and still feel the same, I love it! So easy to assemble and it looks very nice! It's like having to table top all in one. You place something on top and at the bottom such a smart idea who ever invented this table. The table is great and of course sturdy not cheap.", 
    "The well detailed design is very impressive. It was easy to put together and the quality is sensational! I use pledge to clean and the beauty stands out all the time. I'm so glad I bought this for my home, is very top quality.", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks great on the wooden floor. We liked it very much and definitely recommend this.", 
    "Love the style of this table but thought it would be a wood veneer. Also it is so big - even though we knew the size - it seems so much bigger than I thought it would be!", 
    "I previously purchased the Canescent Modern Contemporary Sectional Sofabed from Overstock. I have it set up as a sectional and the table fits perfectly into the remaining square. I had someone assemble both products for me, as it appeared to challenging. But I love the appearance of both items. They both look, in person, exactly as they appeared on line.", 
    "I love love love this table, It is not small but it works for my space. I love the storage piece at the bottom. Loooks good also.", 
    "Love it, love it, is a prefect table for our living room . Color and size is just right and of course hard to beat Overstock price.", 
    "I just bought this recently and and it was very easy to assemble and it looks very expensive. Even the quality and color finish is great like I bought it from the department store. I can't wait to show it off to my family during the holidays.", 
    "This table gives a living room a nice contemporary touch without breaking the bank. Is perfect size and is really easy to assemble. I was expecting the wood to be nicer quality but its not bad.", 
    "Beautiful table. Yes, it's not real wood, but the color is lovely and goes nicely with my Asian decor. My husband assembled in about 45 minutes. Instructions were quite funny considering they were written by an Asian manufacturer - not easy to understand their version of English - but table came out fine. There was a slight defect in the top of ours. Hardly noticeable & not worth returning for replacement. Nice hidden door on one side to hold magazines or smaller items. Overall very happy with purchase - great price!", 
    "This table is nice and low. Looks good with or modern sofa. It has a small compartment underneath. It came fast and was very well packed. It took about 25 minutes to put together and looks very nice. Only negative is its made in China.", 
    "This was the first piece of furniture that I bought online and I couldn't be happier with it.. LOOKS AMAZING in my living and really makes the place feel like home. I also love the little compartment underneath, it's a great place to put my remotes and smaller blankets.", 
    "This table was for my livingroom. I needed something to make a statement and coordinate with my existing furniture. This item is perfect. Shipping was fast and I was able to bring it into the house without help. My nephew assembled it without any assistance in less than an hour. I love, love, love it and I wish their were matching end tables. I'd buy it again.", 
    "I bought this coffee table for my new apartment and I just love it. It looks so elegant in my living room and all my friends who visit my apartment, look at this table and say \"wow\".. Am very happy with it..", 
    "I have been looking for a coffee table for months!! This was a great find and you can't beat the price. Easy to put together and I have had a ton of compliments on the unique shape. Very easy to put together and found out after I purchased it that it also has a small cabinet for storage. GREAT size table for playing games with the kids.", 
    "The product arrived as expected and with many pieces to put together as expected. Not to worry though because it came with all hardware and a fairly thorough instruction manual that got me putting it together in less than an hour time frame. It does look very cool in my condo and so fair no scratches or dents (2 weeks) - A bargain price tag for a nicely design table. I am still confused to why people complaint about the price tag vs quality but then again every person expectation is different. If it meets your taste buds - then I definitely say you buy one. You won't be disappointed unless you're expecting gold. :)", 
    "I had my eye on this table for quite some time before ordering. It's a hot item and I could see why. Got my order a week ago and I am enjoying it every day! It is sturdy and at a perfect height next to my 3pcs sectional. It was extremely easy to put together too. This was a terrific buy for the money!", 
    "Absolutely beautiful-the character is not lost from the veneer wood, and the stain is beautiful- warm and rich. My husband agrees, this table was a wonderful find. Never rub, always wipe and cotton cloth are the three rules to keep your furniture. I've been using Murphy's Oil to clean all my furniture for years and it worked great. It will remove all residue on the furniture but also restores the shine. Make sure after using the oil on your furniture to use a cotton cloth to wipe clean. People like to use Pledge but, I personally, prefer not to because it will just cause built-up rather than cleaning. Water is not prefer because it will damaged the furniture over time, but if that's your only resort then make sure to well-wrung the cotton cloth before wiping and always wipe clean immediately, unless you want to say bye-bye to your newly bought piece of furniture. Stay clear from liquid detergents and anything with wax, it'll just saturate the veneer and you'll end up with a piece of junk. We've been a loyal customer of Overstock for years and bought numerous pieces of furniture from them. Never been disappointed. With proper and little care of your furniture, it'll save you a ton of money in having to buy overly marked up pieces. Trust me!", 
    "I was so excited to receive this coffee table! I purchased it for a small \"den\" to be used in front of a love seat. It is the perfect length for a love seat and exactly what I was looking for - well made and original. It was packed well and came with everything you need to put it together. Assembly was less than 15 minutes. All pieces fitted perfectly to the \"T\". This is a real keeper!!", 
    "I like the table and it looks good in my living room. However, the directions weren't easy to follow and the hidden door did not have the correct holes drilled to install it correctly. (I have yet to find a solution) The table attracts hair from my cat and a ton of dust, and you have to make sure it's perfectly cleaned and dried if you are wiping off the table, or else it ends up streaky. It is a nice looking table, but given the chance I probably wouldn't buy it again.", 
    "This is a nice coffee table especially for the price. It isn't solid wood but I have it in a sitting room with little use. It is a cool piece.", 
    "My review is very much like the others on this item, satisfied! The quality is exceptional, the price is fabulous and the assembly is fantastic! Looks GREAT in our living room. If you want this and it's available and you're still debating on whether to get....debate over, get the table!", 
    "This looks attractive and strong. Also at a good size. This item purchased made a big difference to the look of our living room, our livingroom looks stylish and sleek now.", 
    "I am thrilled with this coffee table, it looks absolutely fantastic. It is excellent quality, chunky and very sturdy with probably the easiest assembly I've encountered. REAL value for money!! Don't let negative reviews let you pass this great table up.", 
    "I was really excited about this table with its secret storage in the base and thought that it would stand up to our children but after only a week of having it, there were chips out of the laminate and it looks crappy!", 
    "My new coffee table is PERFECT in every way. It was easy for me to assemble and it looks great!", 
    "Looks a little overwhelming to assemble, but just follow directions and you will find it is pretty easy to put together. Looks great!! No complaints here!", 
    "The size is a square and it is listed as a rectangle. beyond that the table is good", 
    "The Wakiaka Unique Pagoda Coffee Table is quite unique. . .Love it. . .its a lot bigger than I thought; takes up lots of space but a nice piece", 
    "I am enjoying my coffee table, it looks good for the price I paid for it. I will say that i am disappointed in how easily it chipped and the wood was peeling off, by the time i finished putting it together. I just really like the look of it and it goes great in my home. If it would have cost me any more, I would have sent it back. So i guess I would recommend this piece just warn you to be careful when assembling it.", 
    "The table came assembled and well packaged. The table looks great and it is very stylish. The wood is very sturdy, not flimsy at all. Absolutely love it.", 
    "The picture for the light oak color does not do it justice! I Love Love Love the texture, the style, how big it is, & the color. I thought it was gonna have a smooth shiny feel to it but it looks & feels just like real wood. I would recommend this coffee table to everyone! Im in love with it as you can tell. Such a good price plus free shipping just cant get that anywhere else & it arrived within 2 buisness days which i was very surprised & impressed!!!! 5 thumps up from me!", 
    "We bought black along with two side tables for our FLW house den....seamlessly blends in with the architecture.I find everything I need at Overstock .", 
    "I've been very happy with this. Solid construction that's held up well, even with young kids leaning on it and messing around. (Although I did have to re-glue it at one point.)", 
    "I really liked it, its exactly the same as the picture...", 
    "Love it! Very contemporary!", 
    "Love it... Gives style to my living room", 
    "Everything is fine except the bottom door doesn't work", 
    "Pretty good for what it is... Fairly complicated assembly - took nearly 45 minutes. Otherwise happy with it.", 
    "This coffee table is pretty much what I expected. Good value, fairly easy to put together, and is an interesting and attractive piece of furniture. After using it for several months now, I can say that the finish is very hard to keep clean. It shows EVERYTHING... finger prints, dust, dog nose smudges. But it cleans up easily enough.", 
    "Sturdy, and is holding up well. It looks very nice in my living room, and I have received lots of compliments on it. I really like it.", 
    "It's sturdy, large enough to casually eat a meal at and I love the extra little bit of hidden storage space!", 
    "Beautiful piece of furniture! I received it yesterday and it was super easy to assemble. This black table looks beautiful with my grey sectional and teal accent chair. Totally recommend it! :)", 
    "This table is beautiful and the storage is actually bigger than I expected.", 
    "I love the classic design and its pretty steady. However their is need for improvement in the locking mechanism of the door to the draw. The magnetic lock does not keep it closed.", 
    "Worth the money big and sturdy", 
    "Great coffee table! Has woodlike texture and look to it, isn't plastic looking.", 
    "I didn't like putting together but finished product is great", 
    "Great price and great look for a more contemporary look for my family room. The shape works well with my \"L\" shaped sectional.", 
    "not a good product hard to put together.", 
    "Very nice piece. Goes great with my decor.", 
    "Have had this table for just under a year. It is very striking in person and I love the hidden compartment to quickly stash books/magazines when guests come over. It is very durable - I have 2 dogs who play hard in the living room and have not been able to damage it in any way. The ONLY downside is that the espresso color shows dust very easily.", 
    "Returned it. Looked cheap. Would've loved it if it were real wood", 
    "Love this table looks good, easy to put together...", 
    "Very nice table. Good quality", 
    "I purchased a pedestal dining table about a year ago from overstock and wanted a matching coffee table!! PERFECT!! I love it love it love!", 
    "Sturdy table with a nice hidden cabinet. Hard to clean the surface and is easily scratched.", 
    "looks so good anyone would love this", 
    "Perfect size, perfect color, perfect price. It goes very well with all my decor , Ive been looking for something like this for a very long time and I'm very happy I finally found it! As a plus, Shipping was super fast! I definitely recommend buying from overstock!", 
    "I was very happy with this purchase. The coffee table is made of sturdy materials and was not too difficult to put together. All pieces should of been marked and it would have been easier if there had been written instructions.", 
    "The shipping was fast and it was beautiful.", 
    "Not excatly the quality I expected, but you get what you pay for", 
    "I LOVE THIS TABLE. It's so pretty, sturdy, well made, and has a little storage box for remotes etc.", 
    "great table for the price.", 
    "Great product for a great price", 
    "I love this coffee table and the pagoda style. This is the second one I have purchased. I am so happy they had it in stock!! The first one we had for many years. Our baby granddaughter lived with us as she was learning to walk and we applied safety corners to it, they didn't stick well and we had to superglue them. Once she and her parents moved out, we tried to remove them and were unsuccessful. The first thing I did was check with Overstock and order another. It is a perfect size and height and has a hidden panel for storage under the table. You can't go wrong! I highly recommend this coffee table!!", 
    "This was the perfect fit for my living room, I just wish there were end tables too.", 
    "i've had this for about 2 years and its still holding up. i love the compartment to store throw blankets. my husband had put cups on it etc and its easy to clean. def recommend it.", 
    "fits the square space where 2 couches meets perfectly!", 
    "I was surprised at how nice this table was for the price. It's sturdy and easy to assemble. It's a good table for those starting out", 
    "Nice looking but not very sturdy. It honestly feels a little cheap. A friend was helping us move and lifted it up from the top and the entire thing came apart", 
    "If i ever needed another coffee table. i would probably get this again. Easy to assemble. Good storage in the middle. Very sturdy. A bit heavy to move so i used 4 carpet sliders and now it is even better. Only downside is that, it is a bit of a finger print magnet.", 
    "My table arrived in a week and I'm very happy to say that I am pleased. It is a tadbit smaller than I thought but it is actually what I needed. It was very easy to put together, my son did it in about an hour and that's only because he didn't have a drill. One thing that he did have to do, which is why I didn't give it a 5 star, is push in tighter, one of the screws that were in the table already but it wasn't a big deal at all. I would purchase it again though, very nice item.", 
    "doesn't really put together tight and the top if you move it will surely fall off. Not really quality but looks good, just don't move it", 
    "Made of compressed wood but very smooth lovely appearance. Light.would buy again", 
    "I purchased this for my office. It looks very elegant.", 
    "It was a little hard to put together but well worth it I love it", 
    "Good item. Excellent furniture.", 
    "Took a little time to put together, but all in all, it is a beautiful piece.", 
    "It's an ok table but not good if you have a toddler or infant because it immediately becomes a danger zone. The door wouldn't fit well and the glue didn't hold the pegs in place well", 
    "Very unique and modern look to my house.. but little scratches on the top of it are disappointing.. just little but still scratches..", 
    "Looks unique , cool storage compartment. Just gets fingerprints on it easy.", 
    "sits low with a modern feel. Easy to assemble and the secret storage compartment is useful!. Happy with my purchase.", 
    "looks nice, easy to put together", 
    "good sturdy construction, more brown than I thought but for a decent price and good looks it is a go.", 
    "Looks nice but a little too bulky. I wish it was a little smaller.", 
    "Easy to put together and looks great! Took me about 30 minutes to have it all together. Looks exactly like picture shown.", 
    "No funny smell like other reviews stated. Bigger then expected but overall nice addition.", 
    "Very difficult to assemble but the quality is real good.", 
    "This table looks really great but for some reason after I assembled it the compartment door that is on the side would not open and there is no way to get it open without disassembling the table, which wasn't worth it. Other than that the table looks great.", 
    "I bought this table for kids to play board games on and it's perfect for that and was easy to put together!", 
    "Nice square and sturdy center table", 
    "Bought this 8 months ago and I'm very happy with it. Same as it looks on the picture.", 
    "I brought it in white, goes well with white furniture. Not expensive looking but can be dressed up.", 
    "Absolutely love this table received it in super fast time it was easy to assemble and it looks expensive and nee", 
    "Visually, this table is attractive and exactly as shown in the picture. It looks more expensive than what it retails for. However, upon closer inspection, it is light as a feather. I can literally push it across the room with my index finger, and so can my 8 year old. I will have to put something heavy inside of the hidden compartment to stabilize the table.", 
    "Perfect for my small living room and chery leather sofa. Looks rich in color and elegant in design. The storage at the bottom is a great idea, only wish the door is easier to open.", 
    "We are very happy with this table we love it !!", 
    "Nice finish. Has a door by the base that can hide mags, etc that would normally be left on top of the table.", 
    "It was easy to assemble and compliments the other furniture. Looks nice!", 
    "Great table for its price", 
    "This adorable table arrived on time and didn't take long to assemble. It appears very durable and looks amazing and sleek in my living room. Great piece for the price!!", 
    "I have no complain about its appearance. It looks way more expensive than what I paid for it.", 
    "It adds a modern flare to my downstairs family room. Love the dark color.", 
    "Great for the price good quality& I love the hidden door for remotes & little items you don't always want out You can put a small basket in there with a few books magazines eyeglasses remotes tissues. Or even a throw blanket love ot", 
    "Unfortunately, the table turned to be too large for a coffee tables. It monstrously occupied the whole living room.", 
    "This table is fantastic - it was relatively easy to assemble and looks great in our living room. There is a door for storage in the base that is nice for TV remotes.", 
    "It might look nice, but the quality is beyond terrible.", 
    "This table looks really expensive and unique in the photo, but a little less so in person. One of the pieces was broken during shipping--I suppose because the composite is relatively thin and soft. I contacted Overstock parts for a replacement--and they first sent the wrong color! 2 weeks after receipt of the table, I was able to put it together, but it's not terribly stable, and only looks good when it's spotless. We always use coasters, so that the surface doesn't bubble, but I've also found that Pine Sol works better to clean it rather that wood furniture polish, as it is not real wood. It certainly is a unique table, but the next one I buy will be solid wood and already assembled.", 
    "I really loved this table the shape, it was perfect for my contemporary sofa height. The only problem is the corner was chipped... They sent a replacement table top and that one was also chipped! Bummer, I really loved the style of the table", 
    "It takes us some time to put this piece together. It looks bigger than I thought but it looks nice. It definitely adds a nice accent to your living room.", 
    "Building this wasn't too tough. The table is sturdy and is made from good quality wood.", 
    "This coffee table is perfect for area i purchased it for. Very sturdy and although it wasn't that expensive and looks as if I spent a good amount of money on it. I get complements on it all the time. I love it and was very easy to put together.", 
    "when i opened the package, there was a huge chip in the wood. It was not only this table, but almost every item i ordered from this site came with noticeable scratches or dents. Not to mention, broken glass", 
    "Love this one ...a piece of cake to put it together.", 
    "I was looking for a very dark brown. The size of the table was perfect for the space I had to put it in. It matches the decor of my living room. Everyone that has seen it loves it. They thing I paid lots more that I actually did. I read a review that stated that their table was delivered with a lot of scratches. My table was delivered in perfect condition. It was also very easy to put together. Love It!", 
    "Bought this for my son. He has a tiny 1 bedroom apartment. This table fit perfectly with 2 chairs & a love seat in his living room with plenty of space to spare.", 
    "Works great in our basement family room. Love the square shape as it looks proportional with the sofa , love seat setup. It is very dark and the grain does not look like real wood but I dont mind that . Easy to clean up. I will be needing a furniture market to touch up some nicks already but the price and shape were perfect.", 
    "Looks good in my room and wonderful collection.", 
    "Love it! Great lines, easy to put together, and looks like it costs a lot more than it was.", 
    "This was the perfect coffee table for my family room. Very easy to put together and easy to clean!", 
    "The overall look of this table is nice and contemporary feel. The assembly is not overly difficult and can be done by someone with basic assembly skills. The down side is that it is laminate exterior with a glued cardboard honeycomb center. This keeps it light in weight, but not quite what I expected. I found this out because I used a hole saw in the center to have a lamp and an AV repeater powered threw the center. I finished the holes with a computer wire escutchen.", 
    "Dangerous sharp corners, not great for a high traffic area.", 
    "Easy peeze to put together. Excellent product!", 
    "Easy assembly. Good instructions.Table actually has a slight wood grain (faux) texture. It's pretty cool. Better than expected. Heavy, feels sturdy after assembly. But watch those corners if you have little ones!", 
    "This product is very sturdy, looks great, and is somewhat easier to put together than most of its kind.", 
    "The table is sturdy and looks great in my living room", 
    "use in my den love the design", 
    "Looks great easy to put together", 
    "Pretty decent looking table for the price. Fairly easy assembly. It's a very dark brown, almost black. This isn't fine furniture, but perfectly functional for everyday use. One thing to note---the specs say the table is 36\" x 36\", but it's actually 35.5\" x 35.5\". Most people wouldn't care about that, but I had a glass table top made based on the online specs and now it's too big.", 
    "The material it's OK! exactly like the picture", 
    "Easy to put together. Looks great in our family room.", 
    "This is just what my daughter need for her apartment it went wellwith her furniture great addition.", 
    "This unique table has far exceeded my expectations. I was operating on a budget, and was worried about a \"put together yourself\" table. I did it in a couple hours, but I took my time. Probably can be done sooner. I especially like the hidden compartment. All tolled, it was worth every dime.", 
    "perfect size love the dark color", 
    "Just what I wanted. Easy to assemble and perfect.", 
    "Beautiful, well-made, heavy", 
    "I love my coffee table. I have been looking at this coffee table for a while now and around Christmas time it ended up being out of stock. As soon as I received an email that it was back in stock, I had to order asap. It was easy to put together and it looks so pretty in my living room.", 
    "Great table. Perfect for a big living room. Not kid's friendly though. The corners are too edgy and sharp. That's why I gave it 4 stars only.", 
    "This is just the size we needed for our L-shaped sofa. We love the unique design. Fortunately, my husband is clever at putting things together - I probably could havedone it but it would have taken me much longer. This is a good value and I would definitely recommend to others.", 
    "I put glass on top and it looks like a million bucks.Easy to assemble", 
    "Love the design, hate the materials. Should be expected at this price point I guess.", 
    "i ordered this table for my gameroom and am satisfied. I had previously ordered the \"espresso wood LCD TV stand console\" and it looked as if this would match well. I would say that it matches \"ok\" and isn't quite as nice in quality. However, it does have a nifty \"under the table\" storage feature where I can stash remotes when I want them out of sight.", 
    "large, use in a big livingroom", 
    "We bought this to go with the Normandy Tobacco Brown End Tables. There is a slight color difference, but not very noticeable. The table itself was easy to assemble. I like that it had a little cubby in the middle for small storage. We love it!", 
    "I am very happy with my purchase it looks beautiful exactly like in the picture.", 
    "So the table is not as tall as a regular average coffee table its definatel shorter than used too. Its dark in color, almost a black brown. It does seem to scratch easily but did not want to return because it would have been a hassle to unassemble it. The assembly was a breeze. Very lightweight also so we will see how it will hold up with two toddlers!!?", 
    "We received this table with a small damage, but overstock customer care was handling this. They sent us a new piece right away. We are very satisfied with the customer care and quality of the product.", 
    "We needed a new coffee table for our den that needed to have certain dimensions. This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced.It is not real wood, and the finish does stain and get discolored from water, but they disappear if you wipe it down with a damp cloth.,It's great for our needs.", 
    "Needed a new modern coffee table, This table is just right. Beautiful wood grain and table has a hidden push door. True to description online.", 
    "My husband wasn't convince to buy through the Internet, thanks to your quality he changed his mind!", 
    "Better then the photos on line. Love it. So modern and really a perfect size.", 
    "I'm waiting on a response from overstock or the furniture company , the top of the table came with a huge hole in it .", 
    "Firstly the table came soooo fast after I ordered it. Ups delivered it. Came in a box unessembled but the instructions were great and easy to follow. The outcome....the table is perfect!! Exactly what I wanted!!!!", 
    "Great table! It was a little bit bigger than what we wanted but it looks very nice with our decor. Make sure you read the directions carefully.", 
    "I like this coffee table a lot. The look of it really intrigued me, I bought it based on it's unique look and decent reviews. Unfortunately, it does not flow well in my living room. I have a sectional and I need a longer table to look good with the couch. Plus the edges are quite sharp and my dogs bump their heads on it all of the time. Plus the area under the coffee table is prime space for pets and kids to hide and thus more head bumping (my poor dogs). Anyway, like I said, it looks cool but if you have a sectional, kids or med-large dogs, it may not be your best choice.", 
    "I bought this table because I need a square table that all 3 family members can sit to have breakfast in front of the TV.This one matches what we want and the size is just fit. we have no difficulty to put together this table in less than an hour and its color matches the sofa we have. Of course it is not made of solid wood but at this price, it is really a nice and sturdy table.", 
    "Looks good and everything but it's a little lower then I expected. Not that it's a bad thing. And it's easy to put together. I would recommend this product to a friend any day. :)", 
    "Very easy to setup. Took less than an hour. Very sturdy, does not wobble or shake and the design is very elegant. The compartment in the middle is very hidden, and an additional plus. Love it.", 
    "really nice table for the size of my living room and iit is a really nice color to and I love the shape of it.", 
    "It looks very beautiful with modern furniture, fits perfectly height wise and size wise with our L shape sofa. Enjoying the low maintenance and wise surface.", 
    "Table is just as described. Assembly is easy--my 15 year old son put it together for me. The only thing I don't like is that it keeps hand/finger prints when you touch the table and are not easy to remove. Other than this, the table is perfect for out living room.", 
    "It was damaged during shipping. Overstock has the best customer service. They fixed the problem. I love overstock !", 
    "Great table for the price, looks just as listed. I get lots of compliments on it.", 
    "We had been looking for a contemporary coffee table in several stores for a over 2 months. It was so difficult to find something which was good, looked contemporary and wasn't too high on the price. Finally I looked on overstock.com and within next few minutes, I had placed an order. This was our first purchase from overstock. It was delivered on time and in perfect condition. My husband and myself are very pleased with the purchase. Assembly was easy. Love the look and feel so far.", 
    "The size is slightly off the table it actually 35 1/2 INCH other than that its an excellent table", 
    "The table looks exactly as pictured and fits my living room perfectly. It's a very modern look.", 
    "I purchased this table as an addition to our family room decor. The color and size were perfect and the inconspicuous storage area make this table a stylish but functional piece. The whole family loves it :)", 
    "Relatively easy to put together if you are used to assembling products made from flat panel wood slabs. I recommend reading the instructions completely before you begin assembly because completing some of the steps (ex: putting the screws in the low profile door) in the latter portion of the instructions before completely assembling the table will make things a lot easier. I also had to drill a hole in the door because there was no hole to screw in one of the screws. But again that didn't pose much of an obstacle because I'm used to building these types of products and I had the appropriate drill bit handy. Once the assembly is complete, you will be amazed at how beautiful this table is. Seemingly durable and rich in appearance and texture, it can truly serve as a centerpiece to a modern minimalist or contemporary decor. I love it and couldn't have asked for a better looking table (combination of size, low profile, and overall aesthetics) for the price.", 
    "Received my table quickly after ordering! It was fairly easy to assemble, which I did by myself in about 90 minutes. What I must have missed was how to install the secret door - the directions showed the door was installed last, but it's impossible due to the pin hinges that come with it. That said, it's perfect hide out for the cats! The table is heavy, sturdy, nice looking, and I have not noticed any odor at all. Overall, I'm glad I made the purchase! It looks great with my asian antiques and news sofas!", 
    "I needed a simple yet stylish coffee table for a decent price while re-doing my grand room. I didn't expect too much but was very pleasantly surprised after it was put together. It has been up for a couple years and has withstood teenagers, dogs, cats and a husband!! Very good value for the price! There is a nice hidden cubby in the middle to hide magazines, remotes etc. It was a pain to put together but honestly we have trouble with all furniture.", 
    "This coffee table is just right for a small room! The color and design are beautiful.", 
    "Item is just as described and sturdy. It was a little big for our living room, but keeping it, as it adds a good and modern look.", 
    "My wife loves her new table. It is the perfect size and shape for the living room. It was fun putting it together and I was pleased with the final result", 
    "Easy to assemble. My only issue is the storage door once it shut for the first time when I reopened it, the magnet that holds it shut came out. I put it back in the same way it was in before, but now it doesn't shut all the way. I am anal, so this bothers me.", 
    "Needed something that would work as an end table and could replace ottoman when we had company. I think this fit the bill perfectly and the hidden cabinet is a favorite little extra.", 
    "I ordered this along with another coffee table. The overall quality is good. Looks really nice....especially if you have a contemporary feel to your living room. Just remember....its not REAL WOOD. Overall...I'm happy with the purchase.", 
    "Although it might be a little expensive, the delivery and quality were awesome . It took me a while to build it but it worth the effort .", 
    "Good product. The table is bigger that I thought. Very easy to assemble. I like it", 
    "I just love it very nice color good material and is easy to assemble", 
    "Great quality for the price. Shipped very well with no scrates or issues - which says something. Looks great in my living room.", 
    "This is a very good table. The problem is that it is too light, relative to weight. Something heavy on an edge may tip the table over. I keep dumbbells in the storage area for stability.", 
    "Beautiful table. The table was delivered on time and in perfect condition.", 
    "Table looks great. When put together it looked just like picture, no surprises. Easy to put together. Love secret compartment.", 
    "Love my coffee table can't believe the price goes great with my decor thank you overstock", 
    "This is a very nice, good quality table. Very nice addition to my sectional sofa. Thinking about putting a clear finish on top to give it a shine.", 
    "I love my table!!! It's very modern and is a great feature to my living room space!! There was only problem!! There was a manufacture mistake. Once we put the table together we were not able to place the door in for the secret compartment. They had a hole in the table for the bottom of the door but not the top. However my dad drilled a small hole in the top and it fit perfectly! Other than that it's very stylish and different!", 
    "I get so many compliments on this table! It is elegant, modern, and rich looking. I am a woman and my friend and I put it together in 20 minutes with no problems. It arrived very quikly, no scratches or missing parts. Obviously, its not real wood so it will scratch easily but there is no doubt that it is a great buy! Don't hesitate to purchase this before it is gone!", 
    "Glad I bought this product . I am happy with it's overall style and function.", 
    "Good table if you are looking for something clean lined. Very easy to put together. The table sits low to the ground like an Asian inspired look. Love the hidden storage.", 
    "I love this coffee table. Bought it a couple months ago and it looks very nice in my living room. I have gotten complements from everyone about it. The look is very contemporary and it's pretty stable piece. The onlyissue I have with this table is that I can't seem to figure out how to correctly install the door, but other than that it a good purchase.", 
    "I like this product because it is unusual and is a conversation piece. The only thing I don't like is the drawer. It is really out of reach and you have to bend under to get to it. So I don't think I will be putting things in it that I will be using often.", 
    "Love the table. It is very simplistic and goes great in the living room.", 
    "It took longer than I thought for my husband to put the table together, he did it and it looks great.", 
    "Great table, what's more to say? It doesn't weigh alot, but would definitely recommend it!", 
    "the table was nice for the price. i liked it but i returned it as it is big for my living room. ovestock accepted the return promptly and deducted shipping fees for prepaid return table.", 
    "I had somewhat lower expectations because I had a hard time believing that this would be as good as it looks for the money. In the end I was very pleasantly surprised. The wood is good quality and it really fits my space and modern decor well. It was fairly easy to put together also. If you are looking for a good coffee table for a great price this is for you.", 
    "Great table, matched my tv stand perfectly, easy to put together.", 
    "I had some doubts when I ordered, but this turned out to be just perfect for my needs. It was easy to assemble--I did it by myself--and I love the storage compartment! Great bonus.", 
    "It was just the style I was looking for - very sleek, modern. Definitely worth the price - obviously it's not wood, but very sturdy. Two reasons I didn't give it 5 stars: the two little screws that go on the inside of the door wouldn't go in, so they stripped and I had to find two new ones (did anyone else have that problem?), and secondly, the main thing I hoped wouldn't happen that a previous reviewer wrote, did - the table top had a little scratch right in the center (go figure! ugh!). But it's not noticable enough though to go through the hassle of returning - I'm just anal about stuff like that, and the fact I know it's there (even though I'll have something in the center of the table that will cover it) bugs me. But overall, I'm very happy with it and glad I bought it. It looks more expensive than what I paid. One more thing - since I have a feeling it will scratch easily, I ordered a piece of glass for the top (cheapest I found was $60) - this way I won't have to worry about any scratches or marks. So, although it ended up costing me a little more, I still think it was worth it and love it.", 
    "Big scratch marks throughout. One was about 6\" by 2\". I have to go find some espresso wood paint to cover it. Besides that, everything else good.", 
    "This table looks nice, but the top won't stay on. The wood is brittle, and broke during assembly.You can't see the broken part, but if you lean on the table, the top flies off.", 
    "My table was successfully put together after only an hour. The directions were clear. The only component I had issues with was the door latch. The screws would not go in straight. The kept turning and the compressed board doesn't allow for retries very well. As for the rest of the table, simple and easy. There is one part where you screw the bottom leg on and that doesn't make sense. The screws are smaller than the opening and I'm uncertain how anything was actually fastened. AFter it was completed it looked great though. I will get a piece of glass for the top because the material is soft and scratches easily. I hope it holds up because it looks good!", 
    "Nice table for small area. Looks good, pretty sturdy and matches the furniture", 
    "Love it. Bought the ivory one and it's perfect in my living room. Worth the price.", 
    "Tabpe looks great and price wasn't too bad either!", 
    "This coffee table fits perfectly in my living room with my couch which is beige & mocha. I like that it has a little storage area with a door to keep the clutter out of site. I'll be looking for an end table or accent table , overstock.com of course, to match this table.", 
    "This table looks great and compliments my furniture nicely. Nothing light-weight about this....the base even provides storage space!", 
    "I love this table. The color is great and really lightened up the living room. The style is so different and adorable that I just love it more every day. My only complaint would be with the door. It is not exceptionally well done in terms of staying shut. I don't use that aspect of the table, so it is no matter for me and I love the table in so many other ways.", 
    "Point blank..nice table, very modern looking. Putting it together was easy. It was a little larger than expected, but the measurements are posted, so that is on me. I love the table.", 
    "looks expensive. fits perrfectly with my sectional -- everyone has access to the table.", 
    "The table is very heavy. Although it has a glossy finish, it still looks nice. Does not have a \"real wood\" finish, but it still looks nice. Looks a lot more expensive than it really is. Fast shipping!", 
    "The table was a little tric ky to put together. I made a few mistakes but was able to fix them and it looks good now. The table is heavy and the hidden compartment is the best part. I have it in front of my sectional and it fills up the space well. I wish it had a little more texture and was not super smooth but that just adds to its class I guess. Good buy!", 
    "Ordered my Pagoda Coffee Table just a couple of days ago and was very surprised to receive it so soon. 2 days from when I ordered. Took the instructions, wood pieces, hardware counted and laid them out just like the instructions said. Followed instructions and diagram to piece the coffee table together and finished it in a lil over 1hr. The instructions and diagram were so simple to follow and for those who don't know I'm a girl and I put it together with ease while my boyfriend watched... lol All I can say is what a beautiful piece to add to our living room. Perfect for living rooms that have the modern style low profile couches like what we have. Also great table to have family game night =) One thing is I don't recommend this table for anyone with a young toddler or baby because of the sharp corners... but other than that It's a beautiful table and so glad that I ordered from overstock and will be using them because of low cost of products, speediness of service and very nice products. The best part is there shipping was only $2.95 for a 50lb pkg. and for those who are curious as to why I didn't give it a 5 star was because the top of the coffee table had a little bit of what looked like warping to the veneer which you can only notice if you were looking at it eye level. My bf didn't want to hassle with sending it back and I can finagle anything by covering with a pretty vase of roses. The minor flaws were not a deal breaker for me enough to send it back. Very happy with the purchase beautiful! beautiful! beautiful!", 
    "Daughter loved the table - big and low and the light color punched up the other vivid colors in the room - bright blue rug underneath - it is great for doing games or artwork and sitting on the floor - works well with the couch though, too...easy to put together and feels very sturdy - no problem with spilling wine either!", 
    "Worth every penny! The directions leave a little to be desired.", 
    "We are are satisfied with the purchase. Good product for the price.", 
    "I've had table about one year. Recieved table with damage to the top that was a disappointment. Not wanting to ship it back I did my best to cover it up. I really like the table. Has a neat hidden compartment with a hinged spring/magnet door. I keep board games, playing cards and also coasters in there. Another Overstock purchase that I am enjoying.", 
    "enjoy the coffee table, need to figure out what to store in the middle compartment.", 
    "To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to assemble! I was helping my roommate move in and some a couple of neighbors/friends saw the door open and came in to say hello. Ask to check out he table...before you knew it, one of the guys grabbed a pair of pliers and a screw driver and put the table together without looking at the instructions! I was impressed! Love it! Thanks!", 
    "This is a great table. I ordered the coffee bean and the finish is beautiful! It took me about an hour to assemble. Once assembled, it does look bigger than the picture, but it fits perfectly in my living room. The style is unique and still classy at the same time. Great purchase for the price!!", 
    "My only beef was that it had some sort of sticky glue stuff on it, but it seemed to wash off okay. I like this table a lot, I bought it so that I could paint it stark white....I didn't realize it was vaneered so the paint hasn't adhered well, but I think it will do. I can't dock it for the fact that it doesn't paint well, seeming thats my personal choice and has nothing to do with the quality. Just thought it might be useful to others that might want to paint it. I can say that the wood grain is much prettier in person than online, it is much more attractive in person. I've gotten lots of compliments on this odd table, and I think it suits the room perfectly! I'm thinking about decoupaging it now haha!", 
    "Unique table, not your typically table you see everywhere. Finally, a table me and my boyfriend agree that we like, it fits our budget and matches our taste. Very nice piece, it took us no time at all to get this table togther and really doesnt require to much of a handy type of person. I mean if i could put it together in sure really a child could. :) The table also is pretty functional because it has a bottom storage underneath the base. I love everything about this coffee table. Recommend", 
    "Great design on this coffee table. Very simple but artistic at the same time. Easy set up, fast delivery service (UPS), and it looks nice. Perfect for the space I had planned to put it. No regrets on this one, good price for a good looking furniture.", 
    "I love the table. I was excited when I opened the package and put it all together. But One of the pieces was messed up. I called customer service and they had a new piece sent right away. I got the piece finished putting it together and it looks great. The item was easy to assemble and Ive had no issues with it. Happy", 
    "Right out of the box it seemed really easy to put this table together. The instructions were very clear and I got to the very end of putting it together in very less time and all by myself until i hit the hurdle. One of the pieces that go at the very bottom of the table doesn't fit the puzzle. It doesn't have appropriate holes in it to fit the screws and is out of place. It was probably switched while putting this package together or something. Now I will have to figure out a way to drill all the necessary holes in that one piece to finally finish the table. The quality of the table is pretty nice but this was a real bummer.", 
    "We needed a coffee style table for our living room; more for board games than to hold a cup of coffee. I love puzzles but hate having the dining room table monopolized by something that usually takes more than a couple of days to complete. Finding a square table has not been that easy, but, as usual, Overstock.com really came through. I ordered this last week and it was delivered within a few days, packaged great. The assembly instructions were clear in their directions. All parts and pieces were included. It took me several hours to assemble, using a simple phillips screwdriver, not included. Currently, I'm working a 23 inch by 29 inch, 1,000 piece puzzle; It fits great leaving room to spare for the pieces. And, there's a neat drawer underneath that will hold more than a couple of puzzle boxes.", 
    "I finally got the table. I had ordered it but the delivery service had damaged it, so I called they they shipped another table out right away which made the little mis happen not to big of a deal. The assembly was a no brainer and The items were well packaged so everything was in good shape the second time around. Im happy I bought the item and It looks great in the tv room.", 
    "Got this table to put in my little lounge area in the room and I love it. It looks great and is so simple. This piece was easy to put together and I had no issues with deivery. Im happy with the purchase", 
    "Perhaps better packaging to protect heavier packages.table had a small defect on one of the corners..........", 
    "Simple in its own unique way. The way it was designed, very well done. Set up was so easy, only took 10-15 minutes not a lot of pieces at all. IT's also sturdy and you can use both bottom table and of course top which is so unique. I like it, I wouldn't trade for any other coffee table.", 
    "We love this table!! We bought it to go with our sectional couch. It's the perfect size! Other tables were too big or the wrong shape. What I love most about it, is its uniqueness. The cut in middle adds more dimension. I love the storage too! The only thing at bothers me about it is that it really shows fingerprints and dust. I have to clean it alot more, but it looks great once it is cleaned. Definitely would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "Arrived quickly, easily assembled, sturdy. Size is perfect, price is great!", 
    "I wanted a table in my livingroom that would not overpower the room or the space. this table did the trick. I love the rich chocolate brown color.", 
    "This is a fantastic table for the price. It isn't solid wood, which does allow to scratch easily. However, it looks great, it really is unique, and the price can't be beat... and I love the secret compartment!! We bought it for our brand new condo, and it fits in perfectly with our kind of quirky yet simple style.", 
    "The style is nice, but the tabletop is not smooth. There are indentation marks from the support beams below that protrude on top.. looks very cheap. I gotta buy a glass tabletop to hide that. Has scratches on it too.. seems everything I bought from O has arrived damaged and scratched..", 
    "Great table for the price. The laminate has a funky smell -- I wonder if it is just my table because I don't see other comments about the smell.", 
    "Fantastic purchase! Does not look like you paid \"overstock\" price for this piece at all. I was worried that it woudl look cheap and \"veneery\", but this table is great - modern, clean lines, not too shiny, kind of a \"satin\" finish that doesn't easily smudge. I would have paid double for it and probably been just as happy. Easy assembly if oyu know how to follow instructions \"ikea\" style - took about 45 minutes for a girl to put together. Measure your space, it's bigger than it looks in the picture. Very stable once put together, does not shake or move if you put your feet on it. Of course, delivered in 3 days.", 
    "Great table for the price. Only disappointment is there were nics in the table. Easy to put together though.", 
    "It is not what I really thought. I do like it but it is not as good quailty as I thought. I would have liked a better wood for this type of table. It was not to hard to put together that was a good thing about it but it is not what I really wanted.", 
    "I loved the way this table looks...I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it had some slight damage when I unpacked it...and the top piece is formica which is easily scratched. That said, it was very easy to assemble and has brought favorable comments to all who see it.", 
    "The coffee table was package very well. It's a nice table, I just wish it was real wood instead of laminate.", 
    "For us, this table works well ... we have a small house, with a small living room, and a small futon. This table fits perfectly in the room and because it is a bit shorter than a standard coffee table, it works well with the futon. The small storage door is nice ... overall the table is very clean looking. The only problem I had was aesthetic ... for the price I would have preferred a solid wood table, this one (though very sturdy) is wood veneer, which has a fake look (in my opinion). Other than that, the table is great!", 
    "When I opened the box the table had a really pretty dark finish. I think we'll be very happy with it. It's for a new house so we haven't put it together yet ... hope it will be as functional as it is pretty.", 
    "I have seen these at much higher prices so when I saw this table on Overstock I couldn't pass up the great deal. Its heavy and sturdy and when I move it around it doesn't leave scratches my wooden flooring. I'm very happy with the purchase.", 
    "Love this table! Easy to put together, nice finish, hidden storage. Very unique table. If you want to stray away from ordinary four legs and a plain top table, this is a definitely the one for you. Under a nice area rug - looks very nice!", 
    "Anytime I have to put something together it usually looks cheap and like something I put together. This table looks so good and I put it together myself with no help from the husband. The description of the table however does not say specifically that there is storage within the base with a little door for access. This was an much appreciated surprise as it's perfect for the magazines, extra remotes, etc. Highly recommend it!", 
    "This coffee table is simple and elegant. Such a great price. It has a generous sized table top and a secret little drawer for remote and snacks storage in the middle. Very happy!", 
    "Design of table of beautiful. Finish is satisfactory. Has some minor blemishes. Not a $500 table but is nice for the price.", 
    "This coffee table was a great purchase. It has a unique shape and contemporary style. It was relatively easy to assemble and looks great in my den/guest room. Would I recommend this product to a friend? Definitely!!!", 
    "Great value for money, solid table, generous size. Item was well packaged for delivery. Some pieces were more cheaply laminated than others and edges/corners were scuffed, but these are in inconspicuous areas.", 
    "This table has a clean design and looks great on my white shag rug in front of our leather sofa. It's a substantial and solid piece that was easy to assemble without much tools needed. Excellent!", 
    "You won't believe how stylish and sturdy this brilliant coffee table w/storage unit is. The self assembly instructions are clear and easy to follow and the final result is a solid piece of furniture that looks good in a contemporary or traditional home. What a terrific deal for the table.", 
    "Love the design and the wood color. It goes with my living room perfectly and I have a not so spacious living room. I just really love the beautiful look of the table and the convenient storage. Blends very well with everything. Other furniture usually takes up a lot of your time, but not this one - this one was a piece of cake. Follows the instruction and you're good to go with a very nice looking piece of furniture. Thank you Overstock for a very pleasant purchase.", 
    "Ordered this table after reading very good reviews about it and I am glad to say that I am very happy with the product, this order as a whole. Quick delivery and product arrived without a scratch. I love the finish look, very smooth and clean lines. There isn't any rough edges and it fits really nicely in my studio, definitely doesn't overpower the room but still offer that sleek eye candy. Thanks Overstock for a very good online shopping experience.", 
    "I searched high and low for a coffee table that would match my leather couch. I was so happy when I found it here and at such a great price! My boyfriend was a little unsure at first, but after we put it together he loves it as much as I do!", 
    "This table really looks nice. The only drawback is the tabletop scratches easily.", 
    "We love the look of our new coffee table! Easy to put together and we cannot believe how quickly it arrived. I agree with another reviewer though and the dimensions it listed is not correct. We wanted a square table and took a risk going by what another reviewer stated the true dimensions were. It is definitely a square shape, exactly what I wanted. Love the hidden compartment! I would recommend this product, great modern piece for the price!", 
    "Fabulous table. Holds up well. Chic. Goes with any furniture setting, and the perfect shape and size. It blends in with our current decorations, but, adds that modern elegant touch that we were looking for.", 
    "Assembled very easily, great color, great design. This is a great table to own. It is so unique and artistic that you will always receive compliments on it. It is also very functional and can hold remotes, and light snacks in the middle compartment. It looks great with my chocolate velvet sofa and other contemporary furniture. We'll enjoy it for year to come!", 
    "It is not your typical coffee table! It is unique and balances other modern geometric furnishing and accessories quite nicely without overpowering the space. It has both a formal and casual feel to it. The color and style fits perfectly with our new mid-century decorated home but still has that traditional touch to it. It has a fun look, and I've received many compliments on this. Will recommend for sure!!!!", 
    "Table arrives quickly and was relatively easy to put together (my husband said). It is not heavy duty quality but it is well worth what we paid for it. We are very happy with it.", 
    "This table is very nice looking and made very solidly. I love the hidden storage, very nicely in the middle bottom. The color blends in very well with my living room and it is just the right height too. Very good buy!", 
    "I got this really quickly. It took me about 45 mins to put it together and I did it by myself (my hubby isn't really good with this type of thing). The only problem I had was that the hidden door's magnetic clicker thing isn't working properly, so I can't open the door. It should be an easy fix. The color is perfect espresso and it's very nicely sized. Fits well with the decor of my home.", 
    "What more could you ask for in a coffee table? Good price, good quality and good design. Love the unique block design. Everything is just right! I wish they have it in black, it'll be so great for my office - as for right now I am loving my coffee table. Got a lot of compliments so far,", 
    "I don't think i could get a better looking table than this, especially with the price I paid. It's made of hard sturdy wood and the finish texture is smooth and beautiful. What makes the finish product looks so great is the not so matte look which a lot of tables look. It looks exactly like how the online picture shown. Very good in size with an easy access storage area. Wonderful design. It definitely beats a lot of traditional style coffee tables like some reviewers said. I am very pleased and happy with my purchase that's why I am leaving my review for the first time.", 
    "Living in NY means everything needs to be measured in dimensions. The table is square in shape and not rectangular as mentioned on the site. The actual dimension for the upper are around 35.5 X 35.5 X 16 and not 38 in. W x 24 in. D x 12 in.", 
    "I love everything about this table. The wood quality, from the color to the texture. The design is very unique and one of a kind. Simply and elegant at the same time. I love how easy the assembly was. Took me less than 30mins. The color works very well with our leather sectional. Overall, I am very happy with this coffee table. If you are looking at it and considering it, I honestly suggest you should buy. You won't regret your decision. Great coffee table for its price.", 
    "I love this table. I got mine yesterday and is in awe with this table. Assembly is so easy, this is probably the first piece of furniture that took me about 15mins max to put together. The wood texture is very pretty and nice to the eyes. Like many reviewers said, the style is one of a kind and so far I am the first out of my family and friends that doesn't have the typical coffee table. Very cheek and stylist. Will recommend it to anyone, if you are thinking about it then don't wait any longer. Just order it!!!!", 
    "Someone else mentioned -- that it is a little cheap looking...I do agree with this, but it's still a nice looking table that is suitable for a casual family and/or play room.", 
    "Ordered and got mine faster than expected. Was very excited when I received it and upon opening the packaging and finished putting it together, this baby does not disappoint one bit. Beautiful wood color, didn't know what coffee bean means before but now I do. It's a beautiful rich color that blends well with our living room. The construction is unique and seems sturdy enough thus far. Definitely a pleased customer. Thank you Overstock, I will continue with my future purchases with your company.", 
    "If you're tired of traditional coffee table designs, this is definitely the table for you. Finally, the husband agreed to tossed the four legged table to our dent and I grab at the chance and purchase this table. Very nice piece. After you put it all together, which took I would say 25mins or so, it is really a nice and unique piece. You don't see too many people have this type of coffee table around and I am glad I am one of the few. It's unique, functional because it has a bottom storage underneath the base. I love everything about this coffee table. The shape, the color and definitely the price that Overstock is offering. All in all, very happy!", 
    "I ordered this table (along with 2 5 foot bean bag chairs) to go in our grandkid's play room. The kids love the bean bag chairs and table. The table is a perfect size for playing board games and cards. It is a good piece for a casual room such as a game/play room or sunroom but would not recommend for a formal area. It works perfectly for what we needed!", 
    "Very nice table with hiden storage compartment. Easy to assemble and looks like an exspensive table.well worth it.", 
    "I LOVE this coffee table!It came in a box that is rather heavy-so you may need another person to help you move it. And you may want to assemble it in the room where you want to place it.I assembled this coffee table by myself and it took me about 1.5 hours.The neat thing is that the assembly instructions have you assemble it in an \"upside-down\" fashion, which is perfect for a Pagoda style table when you think about it. Then when you are done you just flip it over! I found it really easy to do. But you may want to find another person to help you when you try to flip it over, because at that point it is very top heavy. It came in a box that is lined in foam board and then wrapped in heavy-duty bubble wrap, so they do make sure it gets to you without incident. It is laminate but is very well made and sturdy, so I am very pleased with my purchase!", 
    "Bought this table for my moms family room and the table brought the room together for a nice modern look esp with her dark leather couch and tv console. It is sturdy too cus my 5 year old stood on top of it. Not the most expensive peice of furniture but works well for the price and design.", 
    "For the price, this is a wonderful addition to a home. Relatively easy assembly, came wonderfully packaged. Can't beat Overstock.com for value and price!", 
    "This Table is wonderful!!! it look very nice and its easy to put together... its solid and the best part is the price!!! i extremely recommend this coffe table", 
    "The quality of this piece of furniture exceeded my expectations. The table is sturdy and handsome! For the money, this piece is a great value!", 
    "We bought this coffee table for our new home and were extremely pleased. It's good quality -- very solid -- and beautiful, too. If you are thinking about buying this table, go for it. I don't think you will be disappointed.", 
    "Looks great, and goes perfect with our modern decor! Also, it was very easy to put together...less than an hour!", 
    "We bought this coffee table for an apartment in FL. We wanted something that looked modern, wasn't too big and didn't break the bank. This unique table fit the bill.", 
    "Great table for the price, you can't beat it. It is little smaller than it looks in the picture but I love it.", 
    "The quality of this product is nice. I guess I should have looked at the measurements before ordering because it's way shorter than my couch. Other than that I like it.", 
    "I bought it because it look more modern and I was surprised how nice it looks in our home. The material is fake but u really can't tell from a far. It's easy to clean, just use A moist rag. Don't use oil or pledge, remember its like a veneer wood. So far, I am very happy with it.", 
    "Nice table, but very hard to put together but over all nice and study .", 
    "The table was delivered in a very fast manner and putting it together took about an hour at the most. It is not real wood which is okay for me. A similar design in real wood would have cost me double if not triple the amount. The hidden storage compartment is also a plus. The top is much larger than the photo shows but it works just fine for me.", 
    "This is a gorgeous coffee table. I rated it based on functionality, quality and attractiveness. The major problem I have with it is the sharp corners. If you have small children, rugged animals which love to play or are clumsy, steer clear from this table. The edges are sharp. We plan on using pipe insulation spray painted oil rubbed bronze to protect the total of 8 corners.", 
    "VERY poorly made. I know you get what you paid for but this was terrible. Our table had a dent in it as soon as we took it out of the box. We decided to assemble it in hopes that it would be hidden. None of the pieces were flush against each other and not all of our pieces were numbered. It was a nightmare and then to see the final product it was below average. The style is fun, modern but the quality could not have been fooled.", 
    "Very disappointed with this table, after 2 years we give it away. Look nice, but poor quality.", 
    "The table is great.. make sure though you look at the table size online before purchase.. i am not good with mesuarments.. so for my living room it was a bit too low.. it looks highter on the pic.. its loooks different on the livingroom..", 
    "this table is of very low quality. the other pieces of furniture i bought from overstock are of quality wood and solid construction and this table just looks cheap next to them. it's a particle board core with a wallpaper finish. something one would see at walmart but quarter the price. on the bright side i don't have to buy drink coasters or worry about guests putting their feet on it because i hope within a year this table gets wrecked so i can replace it.", 
    "I like the design of the table, I wish it was larger. However I am disappointed in the quality of the table.", 
    "I first purchased the table because I thought it would fit perfectly in my living room size-wise, style, and color. Upon arrival I was a little disappointed that the table turned out to be EXTREMELY dark, almost black. I had expected a dark wood obviously based on the picture, but wasn't expecting it to be quite THIS dark, again almost black. Its hard to really know the color of a piece based on a picture though, so I do not fault the product for this at all, I just felt it should be noted. Additionally, the table gets streaks on it easily making the table look dirty often. Touching the table, or putting anything on the table leaves streaks/marks (nothing you can't wipe off, but it sucks having to wipe off the table every other day or more.) I'm constantly wiping it off to remove streaks or dust that gathers, both of which are VERY noticeable on the table due to the tables material and dark color. The table also has an appearance of a lot more wood-like texture than appears in the picture. On the positive side, the table is sleek and modern looking and fits perfectly in my living room. Additionally, it is VERY easy to assemble. Overall its a nice table for now, but in the future I'd like to find a nicer, higher quality piece.", 
    "I ordered the cream colored finish. It was so so to put together. The biggest problem is the read through on the top surface. By that I mean you can see were they applied the glue that prior to adhereing the laminate surface. When the light shines in you can see where every drop or brush stroke was put. Like they say...You get what you pay for. Very cheaply made product. Maybe the darker finish would be better I don't know.", 
    "It looked great in the pictures posted with the item. Unfortunately, it's finish leaves a lot to be desired - it's unvarnished finish means you'd have to be extremely careful with liquids of any sort around the table, or risk staining it. That, unfortunately, doesn't work too well for a COFFEE table! As much as I like the design, I think I'll be replacing it soon. :(", 
    "We purchased this as an accent table. It's not great quality (similar to ****). The directions for the door closing feature is not great. The closing mechanism should be attach during the first steps. If you attach the closer last, it will be difficult.", 
    "Really cheap like a plastic piece of crap. DO not buy this you will not be happy. I have nice furniture and bought this, embarrassing, going to through it out and buy a real coffee table.", 
    "I should preface this by saying that I have made Overstock/Ikea purchases in the past where I have needed to build the entire piece from scratch. I haven't had any major issues with putting together furniture thus far. With that being said, the directions advise you to build the coffee table upside down, and then flip it over. When I flipped it over, it completely fell apart. All fifty-five pounds of it just. fell. apart. So I did what any young adult would do and rebuilt it using a hot glue gun. Needless to say, it looks great, but I wouldn't dare put so much as a coffee mug on the table in fear of it falling apart. Invest your money in a better piece of furniture.", 
    "If you are looking for a quality table, do not buy this. It is pressed board and looks like it is one of those put together items. I am not sending it back because I would have to pay the shipping and started to put it together. I could not figure out how to put the table together, and had to pay a guy to come to the house and do it. I will have to get a pretty scarf to cover the table and get a piece of pottery to take away from the cheap looking table. I will look for accessories on Craigslist. I think these pieces are put in good lighting for the pictures that are posted online. I was going to order a sofa and loveseat but changed my mind after looking at this table. What a waste of money!", 
    "Got the coffee table today. Was pretty excited as this was my first apartment. The product was in complete shambles when it arrived. Very Dirty. Broken pieces. Hard to assemble. As soon as I began to assemble it, one of the boards, made out of extremely weak wood (saw dust, i guess) broke off rendering the table useless. I have to file for a return now and returning such a big package is extremely painful. As crappy as crappy gets. Never imagined my first review would be for this absolute waste of money on a complete piece of junk. As tempting as it may be, considering the price, save yourself some headache and pay some more for a better table.", 
    "The color of this table is NOTHING like in the picture. My nephew put it together while I was away, and you have to glue the screws, so I was unable to return it. Overstock also gave me a discount when I voiced my concern about the color. But it doesn't match anything in my living and dining room. I am now thinking of spray painting it. For me it's a wasted $ dollars!! If the color were like the picture, it would have been perfect. But it's not. Not happy with this purchase at all. All other items I bought from Overstock I was very happy with.", 
    "This is a waste of time and money. First of all it is a different color from in the picture, it arrived with scratches and it was cheaply made. Don't think you can hide the cheapness of it"
