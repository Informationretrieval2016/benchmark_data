    "shaky, fell apart, still have not put together, would not reccommend", 
    "Easy to assemble. Nice for a teen.", 
    "it's not a bad bookcase but it's definitely not the $** i paid for it. it's literally held together by super sticky double sided tape. but so far it's holding together", 
    "I found it to be a lot more sturdy than I imagined for the price a great deal.", 
    "Economic, but sturdy. Needed small cases for under my kitchen counter overhang into my apartment dining area. Short on space, we needed shelving to place some of our serving pieces. Two fit perfectly. Easy assembly. Melamine finish protects the nice dark color.", 
    "I purchased this bookcase for my son's room, and it was exactly what I needed. It's not too big, and not too small; it actually fitted very well the designed space, and it holds enough books for a 9 year old kid room. The quality is not bad for the price. I think it's a good choice, and it looks exactly as the picture shows.", 
    "I purchased 2 of these and placed them atop a cabinet (also Inval brand, with 4 drawers) and it really made the office come together. These are sturdy and stylish.", 
    "I picked out this bookcase because it looked nice and because it was a reasonable size. When inspecting the production information, it says that the material is WOOD. Thus, I wanted this bookcase as I wanted a good quality bookcase. However, upon getting the product, I was shocked to find that it was actually made of PARTICLE BOARD. That is not wood. The quality pales in comparison with wood, which was why I was willing to spend so much (this price is not cheap for such a bookcase) on this particular product. If I wanted a PARTICLE BOARD bookcase, I would have spent half as much by going to ***.Even though this bookcase looks nice, the quality of it is not worth the price as the labeling for materials is INCORRECT. Anywhere else I look for products that are made of PARTICLE BOARD, it says PARTICLE BOARD in the material description. I feel cheated by the mislabeling.If you are looking for a quality WOOD bookcase, this is not what you want. If you want a cheap PARTICLE BOARD bookcase, this is it. But I would recommend **** or elsewhere because the price is WAYYYY too much for a PARTICLE BOARD product. PARTICLE BOARD is dirt cheap and not worth much.", 
    "I needed bookshelves in espresso that didn't exceed a specific height. The color, dimension, and modern look made these a perfect choice. They were easy to assemble and look great. That being said, they are not the quality I would put in my living room, but they are a good value for the price I paid and work well for a guest room.", 
    "It is ok bookcase. It is easy to assemble, it took me a 5.4, 110 lb female about an hour. I use a power drill and started working on it near where I wanted it to be.", 
    "The bookcase was easy to assemble. The quality is fair.", 
    "This is a great bookcase that met my need. I only wish I got espresso and not white.", 
    "Hello dear browser, okay yes, def this wood on this product is great, acutally really very good. However once you put it together, its not sturdy. it wobbels", 
    "These were easy to assemble, and look very nice. I bought two of them, and they are a good value.", 
    "very happy with the products, I ordered two to fit behind a couch and they have worked very well. Easy for one person to quickly put together.", 
    "Easy to assemble, solid and sturdy, looks good and is small enough to tuck into a nook.", 
    "The bookcase is really sturdy and made from strong heavy materials. It's easy to assemble and the shelf is adjustable. It's perfect for storage in a small space.", 
    "The bookshelf is much better quality than the accompaning desk. It's heavy but easy enough to move. It also has a more \"polished\" appearance since the pieces fit together nicely. The only downside is that the back panel is split into two pieces that are held together. I'm a little worried that if something gets shoved into the back of the bookshelf they would dislodge. Other than tha it looks great and fits in perfectly with my office."
