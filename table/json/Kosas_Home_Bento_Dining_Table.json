    "This table is afocal point of my home and after a year of having it, I still don't think I could have made a better choice!!!!!! It has a very rustic, grayish look to it and I matched it with 10 rustic chairs from restoration hardware. 10 chairs is a bit too much for this size and it would much better fit 8, but we do use all 10 when necessary..........and it works :) Please note: it has an unfinished look and feel and it does stain easily. If you want somethiing that is easy to maintain, you will need to coat it with something. I like that is \"rough\" and stains are just a part of the rustic look :)", 
    "I have been searching for a dining room table when I came across this one on Overstock. It is awesome! The table has a very beachy look to it. I would definitely recommend this table but not only the table but Overstock! They have been great to work with. Everyone is very helpful, friendly and professional. They have GREAT customer service. I am very happy with my purchase and will be shopping with Overstock in the future.", 
    "I was very skeptical about buying a table that I could not see and feel. I leaned on the reviews to help me make a decision and I certainly do not regret it. This table is absolutely gorgeous!!! I did put a matte was very skeptical about buying a table that I could not see and feel. I leaned on the reviews to help me make a decision and I certainly do not regret it. This table is absolutely gorgeous finish clear coat on it because it is very porous. I have 4 young children and was afraid it would stain. The matte finish did not take away from the finish at all. It did bring out discoloration sin the wood more, and I like it even better!", 
    "This table is a great table it is huge and chunky and looks great in the dining room. The only reason why I gave it a 4 is because it is a lot lighter in person than the picture shows. They need to get a new picture of it with the actual color. It is NOT as dark as this picture and doesn't have quite as many distressed markings like the picture shows.", 
    "The picture doesn't do the table justice. I had to seal the table before use. It is a raw wood when delivered, but once sealed the grains on the wood come out so beautiful.", 
    "This table looks like it's from ********* *********at $*****+. It's lighht in color but not white. Goes with light beige grey chairs it is massive. Comes in two boxes. Originally they only delivered the one box but overstock did a great job finding the leg box and gave me a credit. Love overstock", 
    "We love this table! It's very sturdy and well made! It's large enough to seat 10 people or more!", 
    "Yesterday, the Bento Dining table I ordered with a zinc top arrived. It is beautiful! The wooden base is a darker-stained wood with gold-ish hues. It was delivered in two boxes. The table-top is quite heavy, but it was easy to connect with the base, which consists of two sturdy legs and a connecting board. I have dark-stained hardwood floors that look great with this piece.", 
    "Love this table! Added a sealer to it so it wouldn't stain...", 
    "Everyone always comments on the table when they see it.", 
    "Large, sturdy, expensive looking", 
    "My husband wanted me to order a large stately piece of furniture for our formal dining room, I wanted something that was a little more modern and versatile that could go with my ever changing style. I just couldn't find something that pleased both of us then I came across this dining table on overstock. I was hesitant about ordering a large furniture piece without ever having set eyes on it in person. I went ahead it arrived so much quicker than expected, about 2 weeks. It was in 3 pieces very easy to put together and it is beautiful!!! It is honestly the most beautiful piece of furniture I own and the quality is impeccable!! Extremely sturdy, the finish is a little raw, personally I love it and since it's not our everyday table it works great!! If considering I highly recommend this product.", 
    "great style - great quality - only 3 stars because I think our particular table was never finished - not just raw - just looks like plain pine picnic table ? I'm going to stain myself....but sort of bummed to still have to refinish a new piece that should have shown as in the picture but didn't. A bit disappointed in the finish, but not the quality and style.", 
    "The table is solid, and came perfect without incident. We put 3 clear coats on it to protect it from staining and it looks even better! Very pleased with the purchase, first time buying a piece of furniture without seeing it first....!", 
    "Absolutely BEAUTIFUL table! Overstock rarely fails to please on their furniture! Delivery was convenient, they came on a Saturday and even waited for us to unpack the table to inspect for damages prior to accepting. The table is almost IDENTICAL to a table at R********** Hardware, but only a fraction of the cost. The table is very heavy, sturdy, and solid. Great quality. The grey wash color provides a rustic/vintage feel. The only warning I have is that this table has a raw finish. I would not recommend for anyone who is worried about stains or has children. If a glass of red wine were to spill the table would most likely be ruined. The only solution would be to apply a clear sealer yourself (risk losing the rustic look) or keep place mats on the table while eating. I however am willing to take the risk and keep it as is, as this table is absolutely stunning! I have only used a damp cloth to clean it. In addition to this table, I have another round table from the same manufacturer, Kosas Collections. Love them! Way to go Overstock!", 
    "The stain they used was not sealed properly or something. It literally wipes right off, making it look like a completely unfinished pine table (which would have been half the price). Very disappointing."
