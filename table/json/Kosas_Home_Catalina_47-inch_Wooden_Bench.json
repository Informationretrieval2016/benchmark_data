    "I was nervous purchasing this to go with my distressed farmhouse dining room table, but was pleasantly surprised with the style and overall durability of this product---it's incredibly sturdy and solid. The picture makes this bench look a bit lighter than it is in person, but I'm sure it varies with each due to the wood type. My boyfriend put it together for me in minutes and shipping was very quick. I would definitely recommend this piece if you're going for a distressed look to add your home!", 
    "I was a bit apprehensive at first about this bench because it was tough to tell by the picture how good the quality was. I wanted a bench for the end of my bed and knew it needed to be rustic. When I received it at my home, it was very well packed. Around here, the freight carriers are really rough on packages, so I was thankful for that. When I opened it, it was SO well built and it came with an actual, full-size wrench for which to put it together. I was shocked. This spoke volumes to me about this product and its manufacturer. Very, very pleased. This beautiful bench was perfect for my space.", 
    "Love, love, love it. Was looking for something different for our entryway, so kids have a spot to place their backpacks for school and my enormous purse. After struggling with IKEA for a bedroom set, my husband refused to let me purchase anything else complicated. This was perfect. Good quality and easy to put together. We love it.", 
    "It is a perfect bench for my main entry way.", 
    "solid and the distressed look was subtle", 
    "I was concerned about the description that said a maximum of 220 pounds. But after seeing them I can't imagine that it wouldn't hold more than that. They have a nice semigloss finish to them and feel extremely solid. They have a slight texture And are quite heavy. I haven't yet used them but I have three of them and I look forward to it.", 
    "Awesome bench. Sturdy a stylish.", 
    "I was looking for a sturdy bench for my front foyer with just the right touch of rustic chic. This bench is wonderful! I agree that it is darker than the picture but it still has the variance of wood color that I was looking for. I added a shabby floral pillow and ivory linen pillows and simply adore this area of my home ever time I pass by it.", 
    "This is well made and looks awesome in my entry way. I added some decorative pillows to complete the look. Easy to put together.", 
    "Sturdy, as described, easy to assemble", 
    "Easy to assemble, solid construction and looks old!", 
    "Perfect compliment to Hampshire table"
