    "Very nice looking and looks just like the picture. I needed something that would fit in my office that could also double as a bed when my grandchildren visit. It was very easy to put together, you just have to attach the legs. It is easy to fold from bed to sofa. It is comfortable to sit and lie on, but I think I will buy a mattress pad to make it a little softer for someone to sleep on. It sits low to the floor which is perfect so I don't have to worry about the grandkids getting in and out of bed.", 
    "Item very low in height compared to a regular seating. If you choose it you need to know that the height is different than traditional furniture and may present a presentation challenge. Also must consider height of coffee table.", 
    "Adding the legs on was pretty easy and simple (once I figured that the fabric over the screw holes needed to be cut away). Shipping the legs in the pouch in the underside of the sofa was clever).The only thing I'd note is that the legs are a couple of inches short, so the level of the sofa is lower than ideal.", 
    "We bought this to go in our guestroom/office. I never though it would be this comfortable...I am thinking about taking the mattress pad back that I bought for it. It does not take up much space and works great for smaller places!!", 
    "All in all I like this love seat. It is somewhat firm, so if you like cushy sofas , probably won't work for you. I also got an ottoman which helped a lot for the comfort of sitting longer periods of time.", 
    "This sofa is attractive and easy to put together. It's pretty hard to sleep on, but works well with a twin foam mattress pad.", 
    "Beautiful sofa sleeper, Thank you Overstock!", 
    "The reclining back is a good feature and the quality is good. Only complaint is that the futon is on the smaller side. Would not comfortably sleep someone over 6' tall.", 
    "wanted something to double as an office couch plus a bed at night. will install a TV on wall thus far it is exceptional", 
    "Used in my stepson's bedroom for extra seating. I got the brown and I really like it. Looks like leather, just not quite as supple. Great for the price, easy assembly.", 
    "I bought this for my teenage son's hangout room. It was easy to assemble, and while it will mostly be used for sitting, we occasionally need an extra bed. So it's perfect for converting when we need it.", 
    "This futon style sofa looks beautiful. Not cheap at all! It's very modern and sleek! Great for guests.", 
    "We love it! Great quality for the price!!", 
    "As a busy Mom of three, with a new puppy, I did not have time to do a lot of furniture shopping outside the home. Sitting with my Ipad was the better way to go. This couch was used to update my living room to prepare for my son's upcoming First Communion. I think for the price it was reasonable. The leather does look a bit cheap in person but it is holding up with the puppy jumping in it to sleep and take naps. It is somewhat comfortable but I'm not sure I would want anyone to sleep on it without some additional padding. I had to scrub off a number 3 and 2 written on the leather in plain sight. It faded and I'm throwing a blanket over it so it will fade. I just don't have the time to deal with returning/exchanging things so I try to make them work. We like the open ends of the piece so it looks casual and fun. If this piece doesn't work out for the long term, I won't be too disappointed because it was reasonably priced.", 
    "Perfect addition to a small apartment"
