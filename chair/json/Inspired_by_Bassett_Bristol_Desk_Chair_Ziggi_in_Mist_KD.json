    "Bought this for my daughter as a gift for her NY apartment. The size is perfect; stores away under desk and is comfortable for studying all evening. I would have given 5 stars but the color is more muted then expected", 
    "Love the chair though the white isn't white. Or cream. It's more of a tan but my 9yo loves it in her room", 
    "I'm very pleased with my new chair. Was easy to put together\ud83d\ude00 Had tool and same size bolts. As a 73 yr old women I appreciated the ease of assembly!", 
    "I purchased four chairs for my office. They work wonderful with my decor and I have received several comments from my staff that the chairs are comfortable and really stylish. Many have inquired where I purchased them and do they come in additional colors. I would highly recommend these chairs.", 
    "We are very pleased with these chairs. My computer does not always show colors accurately. The color is absolutely gorgeous, sort of a beachy soft blue teal. The directions were easy to follow for assembly. This chair may not be comfortable for long hours of sitting, but is just great for use in my husband's office for clients who visit for about an hour at a time. Classy looking. Highly recommend.", 
    "good slipper size chair. comfortable.", 
    "It looks great. It was constructed a little bit incorrectly so I had to do some work to get the legs to attach. Once I got it together, it looks great. It's not the best for back support so I'm not sure if I'll be able to use it daily for a desk chair, but for an occasional work at home day it is great.", 
    "Unfortunately the picture on the website IS accurate so do not assume it will be crisp white and turquoise when you receive it. The \"white\" stripes are actually a dirty looking sort of yellowish color. Too much trouble to return it or I would.", 
    "This chair is great in my living room for a pop of color. Not too big not too small!", 
    "I am soooo happy with this chair. Its beautiful, very well padded and easy to put together! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!", 
    "I ordered 2 of these chairs. When I finally got them, they looked nothing like the photo. I am really disappointed."
