    "I bought this table because I purchased 6 Robyn side chairs with distressing and the table looked like it would match the chairs. I read the reviews on the table and they were great and it was within my price range. The table was delivered by a semi truck and was carried into my house because it weighs 140 lbs. It was packaged great and when I got the table out of the box all I had to do was put the legs on and it only took 10 mins. to do that. It took my son and I both to turn it up right after putting the legs on because as I said, it weighs 140 lbs. The only thing I caution you on is not to pull the table out too far when you want too extend the leaf in the middle of the table. My son pulled too hard and almost pulled the table apart. There is a drop down leaf in the table so be careful when extending the table. I have gotten many compliments on my table and it fits my 6 oversized chairs without the leaf up and would accommodate 8 chairs nicely with the leaf up. I am very happy with my new table.", 
    "Happy with this purchase, This is a great looking table and just as nice as things I have found at Pier 1 or Potterybarn. Worth the money.", 
    "The pictures does not do this item any justice. It is one of the best purchases I have made online (and I am an avid online shopper). The quality and craftsmanship is superb. You will not be disappointed. It looks like the furniture pieces you see in the Amish furniture store. Amazing buy."
