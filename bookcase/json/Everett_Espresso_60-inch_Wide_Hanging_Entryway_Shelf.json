    "This piece looks good and holds a lot of extra stuff in the mudroom. It went together fairly easily, but note that it is VERY heavy. They have accounted for this in the way it installs on your wall (you attach a long bracket to the wall studs and then attach the shelf to the bracket), but you will likely need two people or one very strong person with a good wingspan to get this up.", 
    "This product took a long time to get to my house because it was shipped from another country and had to pass customs. When the product got here it was in a long box. None of it was assembled and the bottom shelf was cracked. Some of the corners looked like they had been wet because the particle board looked like it expanded some. It was not easy to put together and some of the instructions were spelled wrong etc. It took us two hours to put it all together. We made a mistake on one of the shelf separators and when we tried to take it apart to fix it more pieces broke. The shelf is beautiful but the quality is cheap.", 
    "Bought this for my daughter, who has twin boys and another on the way. She needed a place for coats, hats, gloves, back packs, etc, since their house does not have a coat closet. We got this along with the matching bench with shoe compartments. These two items provide ample space for all the shoes and other things needed by a busy growing family, while adding to the decor and taking up very little floor space.", 
    "This product is made of MDF with the surface being a laminated material. It's not solid wood so don't expect it to hold up to time and become an heirloom piece. It's easy to assemble but be aware that you will need to buy additional screws to securely mount this to a wall. The kit provides 4 3.5\" wood screws to attach the wall mounting plate to the wall but none to secure the unit itself to the wall once it has been hung. The kit relies on 2 0.5\" tall overlapping tongues running the length of the unit to hold the unit on the wall. As this piece weighs in at 42 lbs I don't trust that to design to work for long by itself. The instructions say that \"you may want to attach the unit directly to the wall using similar screws\" which again are not supplied. Ideally, you'll want to mount this to 4 studs. If that's not an option you'll need to use REALLY sturdy (high load bearing) wall anchors. Once it's time to mount to unit to the wall you'll need someone to help as this is an awkward, heavy piece to lift and hold by yourself. Outside of that the unit is completely functional and serves its purpose well. It probably won't survive more than a couple of moves since it's not solid wood but if that's not a concern this is a nice piece.", 
    "I purchased this for a friend. They were impressed with the speedy delivery AND are enjoying the shelf. Reasonably priced. Easy to do business with.", 
    "It is a great shelf, very sturdy and looks wonderful in my laundry room.", 
    "This shelf is just what we were looking for. Be careful installing it though as the board itself is a little flimsy.", 
    "We had a few extra screw cover caps, but it was generally easy to put together and install. It looks nice and does encourage us to put our purses and backpacks in the same place everyday, which, of course, makes everything smoother.", 
    "love it! so big and can hang up a lot of coats. most of the shelves only can hang 3-4 coats, not this one. This is good for a big family..love it, I am very please and recommend it", 
    "I bought this over a year ago and I finally to put in a review. First I'll say it's great quality, and the price was great. Like everyone else mentioned, this is HEAVY. My husband was almost afraid to hang it on the wall because he thought it might break the wall - we've never hung anything that heavy before. But there were so many great reviews I doubted it would fall off. Anyway, it's still up a year later. The color is just like the picture. You definitely need baskets to cover the not finished part inside. It definitely too a few shopping trips to find the right size basket to fit in the cubby. Overall I am happy with the purchase", 
    "When I opened the box I worried it might be too long for the hall, but it turned out that it fit perfectly. Could have used some advice on how high to hang it but we managed to figure it out. It's a pretty good quality shelf, it definitely is serving it's purpose. We hang out coats and hats on it nicely. But, the part that you attach to the wall for the shelf to sit on has an unfinished underside which is not very attractive, seems funny that everything was thought of but that one little section... I'm fairly sure I put it all together correctly! Anyway, a nice addition to the hall and will look even nicer once it's been decorated with our clutter.", 
    "This turned out to be exactly what we needed in our front hallway. Now all our coats are readily accessible in a stylish manner. It took my husband and son about 30 minutes to have this up and functional. Very sturdy, great item!", 
    "This shelf is just what we needed for our entryway. It looks just as it does in the photos, and was relatively easy to assemble. It took me about an hour to do it on my own. It's extremely sturdy.", 
    "Love the way this looks in our entryway. Great purchase for the price. Easy to assemble and hang.", 
    "This shelf looks exactly like the picture and matches the espresso cubbie bench perfectly. The package arrived without damage. Aside from what I consider to be typical complaining from my husband, he was able to put together and hang in about an hour. Overall a great product and I'm very pleased with the purchase.", 
    "just the right size and right price", 
    "a little bit hard to put up, but once up I LOVE IT", 
    "It's bigger than it looks.", 
    "Great place to store items hang jackets, hats, or purses.", 
    "This shelf is very nice looking. It was exactly what we were looking for in our hallway.", 
    "I have plaster/concrete walls, so my installation is admittedly a tougher job, but I ended up deciding against installing this item because I wasn't convinced it would survive the process. Ended up returning it. But drywall may be another story.", 
    "Exactly what you expect. Heavy, solid. But back is only 2/3rds solid. Kindof odd.", 
    "Great product, functions exactly as expected. It's nice to have teh large space in the mudroom.", 
    "We paired this with the matching shoe storage cubbie and it is an awesome pair. Easy to assemble and hang on the wall. Got baskets at pier 1 that fit perfectly in the slots", 
    "This is a large sturdy and heavy shelf. Looks lovely on my entry wall. Holds a lot. Love it!", 
    "Just take little time to assemble and hung up but not difficult after set up very useful item in the entryway", 
    "good quality, very sturdy and easy to install", 
    "Good product, easy assembly. Just wish that the wall hanging was a bit easier, you have to tap it pretty hard to make it sit properly.", 
    "Looks just like the photo. A very attractive, deep espresso color. A great addition to our entryway.", 
    "Love! Very well made, looks great. I was impressed with the quality. Very sturdy and heavy. Looks great on my wall. Highly recommended.", 
    "easy to put together and looks great for the price", 
    "Looks good on the wall. The only suggestion would be to indicate in the instructions that the dividers must be facing in the correct direction. We installed two of them facing the wrong direction the first time and it was somewhat difficult to get them out so we could flip them. The other minor complain is that while the large hoods are metal, the small ones are plastic. But, otherwise, it is a good product so far.", 
    "I tried 3 X to get this, it was tough. Mail destroyed first 2. Last one wasn't cracked but was missing some hardware. Good thing I kept hardware from first two broken attempts. Overstock was great in addressing the problems.", 
    "This shelf looks great, and was easy to assemble. However, one of the hooks had the screw holes in the wrong place (backwards from the rest and the pre drilled holes in the shelf) and one of the screws that mount it to the wall is a twisted up disaster and completely unusable.", 
    "Very heavy, nice piece....recommend", 
    "Though packing was poor the pieces were fine and looked nice when assembled", 
    "As described and perfect addition to our laundry room. It is exactly what I needed for jackets, gloves and hats in our varying climate in Colorado. Our cabinet company (just built new house) wanted $2500 for built-ins similar to this piece and the matching Everett bench! Crazy!! So glad we DIY-ed it and very pleased!", 
    "Living in a Victorian, is fun but challenging when it comes to closet space. This is the perfect solution. Love it. Well made and not too difficult to assemble.", 
    "Very cute .Hard to put together", 
    "Product is of great quality. A LOT bigger than I expected, read measurements", 
    "I was hoping for a better quality item. The material is cheap and hooks are lightweight. The drawer side came in cracked, although still usable. The corner of one piece was chipped on a back side. I did not inquire for replacement because returning is so annoying.", 
    "Purchased this instead of custom made cubbies. Saved a ton of money. Looks great in our laundry room. We use the hooks for keys, purses, and dog leashes. Well made and sturdy.", 
    "Easy to put together but somewhat flimsy. Be careful with a rubber hammer when applying force. It did not take much to damage the item when inserting the plastic dowels.", 
    "This went together in a straight forward way with two people working on it. It is well-made and very heavy duty (I think it weighs about 45 lbs.). Once on the wall, it does not feel like it's going to come down...ever.", 
    "looks great in the entryway", 
    "exactly as shown, really love storage cubbies for husbands baseball caps", 
    "I love this shelf it does not take much room is very functional and well made. I would purchase it again", 
    "Very large and has lots of storage room. Holds all 3 book bags and my purse, keys, etc and look attractive.", 
    "This beautiful, useful and inexpensive shelf is now the centerpiece of my room! Make sure you have studs to drill into, but once its up, you'll love it!", 
    "very well made..looks great in my foyer", 
    "great for organizing items in my home", 
    "I needed a place for guests to drop their stuff off and this works great. I have at the front door and the color is rich and warm. A nice welcome into our home I think.", 
    "This is probably one of my favorite pieces of furniture in my entire house. My only issue is when we were installing it, the piece that screws into the wall snapped. And I've had a hard time getting that replaced.", 
    "It's good for the price.. When you put it together may look cheap.. But when it is up, looks not too bad.", 
    "Quality product, easily assembled, durable, and looks more expensive than it was.", 
    "This works great in our mudroom! It's huge and holds everything!!!", 
    "What a beautiful and elegant addition to our home. It not only looks good - it is practical storage at the same time", 
    "We ordered this and realized it was too big for the area we needed it for looks really cool tho!", 
    "A lot of space for storage and to hang coats.", 
    "1 piece arrived broken. Took a while to get the replacement but finally got it. Easy enough to put together. It looks nice, just hoping it is durable enough.", 
    "Good Product. Installed easily. Don't know why I need 50 characters when simple statements say it all.", 
    "Picture is a little deceiving. The model boxes they've displayed in the picture hides the back \"bar\" that is mounted to the wall (def recommend mounting to studded drywall) and required to hang this entire piece. It just didn't look great have that portion exposed, even if it is colored the same as the entire shelving. Ours came damaged on the corner. It felt solid, but looks a little cheap.", 
    "The material is not strong and it came apart when I was hanging it and had to trash it..", 
    "Large piece perfect size for family of five. Easy to put together. First item was damaged in shipping. Overstock made right immediately and second arrived no problems. Very well built and looks great in our home. I wouldn't hesitate to buy furniture from overstock in the future.", 
    "This shelf style is great, it was just what I wanted but the quality was very poor. It is made of a cheep laminated fiber board that did not look like it would hold up to much use. The description did not say what it was made of but I guess for the price I should have known.. It arrived broken so I never put it together or put it up on the wall. Overstock credited my account quickly and easily and I will defiantly shop with them again.", 
    "This is worth the money you pay. The so-called wood is particle board with a black/brown film covering it. It weighs a ton so it will cost you $XX to return it. If you want something for your garage this would be sufficient. If you want something nice for the inside of your home I would recommend spending a little more on something nicer. Save your money!", 
    "Looks great in my entryway. Friends and family can hang their coats, and purses instead of cluttering the couch and floor when visiting. Also my hubby no longer misplaces his keys. He has his own personal cubby hole! Dark espresso and good quality.", 
    "Goes together pretty easy. Great piece for the price! Only downfall is behind the baskets there is only half wood the other half would be exposed wall so if you do not have baskets in there it looks somewhat cheap.", 
    "I am using this in the play room for extra storage space. I only wish the shelves were bigger.", 
    "This was an awesome buy!! We hesitated a little bit after reading the reviews, but couldn't pass it up. It was easy to put together and of good quality. It has organized our mud room and was just what we needed for winter coats, snow pants, and all the other winter gear. We purchased the cubby bench also, very happy with it!!! Highly recommend!!!", 
    "Product is made of pressed board which is fine - expect to assemble it which again is fine. However, don't expect to take the product with you. I assembled my product brand new today and liked the look of it. We had a measurement issue and had to move just the base wall board over by two inches which I didn't think was a big deal. However, when I took the screws out the board cracked in half. So I was able to mount it to the wall but won't be able to salvage it for a move. So nice if you will never move it but if you are in a profession that moves you expect to leave the product on the wall for the next renter.", 
    "I debated for a while before buying this products due to the mixed reviews but I was not disappointed. It arrived pretty quickly with all pieces intact. Only took me about 30 minutes to assemble. I live in a one story ranch and had no coat closet, my front entry way was an open space that wasn't getting used. The shelf fit perfectly and we're getting so much use out of it. I've gotten so many complements since putting it up.I couldn't be happier! :) (Wish I could post a picture of it)", 
    "Has plenty of uses, I can hang coats to dog leashes and store keys and papers, love it", 
    "I received the shelf fairly quickly and it was un-damaged. The assembly hardly took anytime at all and was very easy to put together by looking at the instructions. I would say it took around an hour to assemble. It recommends (3) 3-3 1/2\" screws as a minimum at 16\" on center for the main mounting piece. I put (2) of each screw in the mounting block. The is holding very well. I do wish it came with enough screws to mount to the wall, as opposed to going and buying screws. I didn't know it needed them until I got the shelf assembled. Everything else was great and everything fit like a charm. I paired this shelf with their show storage bench to put right inside my front door.", 
    "This item was very easy to put together. It did not take much time at all.", 
    "This was easy to assemble. I had to have help to mount it on the wall. It's heavy, at least for me. It needs to be mounted to the studs. It is useful for many purposes -- hanging outdoor clothes, dog leashes, etc.", 
    "So far I didn't have any problem. The shelf is sturdy and looks very nice, material is good, color matches with picture. Easy to put together. You will need to buy some drywall screws and screws covers since they are not included. I can't complaint about the purchase or shipping service.", 
    "The entryway shelf is fine but I think it would be more for a garage entryway area as it is not very \"fancy\" looking, but it looks ok. The first order I received, all the large pieces were broken in half--don't know how that happened. I had to take pictures and send in thru email. Since it was over 50% broken, I did not have to send it back and they sent me a new one that was not broken. It looks fine for my garage area. When you hang it on the wall, you will need to get some wall screws and a small drill in order to get it hung up properly. Overall, I think it is fine for what I need to hang and store things.", 
    "I was very impressed with the product and overstock as a whole. I have recieved tons of compliments on it already! I took about a 30 minutes to assemble. It did not include the screws to hang it to the wall though and you need to hang it to studs in your wall due to the weight.", 
    "If we still had the box and could take it apart we would send it back", 
    "that was too big for my place , I made mistake get large one . looks nice ,but steel can not use yet ,"
