    "Great value for the money. Definitely not a full size couch, a bit larger than a love seat though. It's perfect for my small apartment. It's also very firm, not something you're going to sink into. One of the other reviewers mentioned the cushion moving around, I believe he said \"with the slightest amount of horseplay\". First of all, who says horseplay. Secondly, the seat and back don't move around in the slightest once in place, and all I do is horseplay on this thing. I love horseplaying, I'm awesome at it.", 
    "I received this sofa today, and let me start by saying that the box it came in was halfway torn off. This caused the upper sofa cushion to have filth and grime on it from the logistics of getting it to my doorstep. The stains will not come out, So I will need to request a new one. All that aside, this sofa is way smaller in person than I had imagined. If you're an average size man who's fit and lean, you'll have a problem with the size of this sofa. Also, the bottom seat cushion is one piece, and simply drops into place. Nothing fastens it into place, so if you wiggle enough, or have and form of movement on the couch other than sitting (like scooting over to the other side of the couch, or the slightest horseplay) it will more than likely dislodge the bottom cushion and allow for it to fall all the way through. I dunno. Probably the last time I order living room furniture online. Bookcases and accents are Ok, but a sofa? No... This isn't a sofa... this is a small persons loveseat.", 
    "This is a great sofa for the price. I wasn't expected much and exceeded my exception for around $300!!", 
    "I really like the style and the smaller-than-your-regular-sofa size. I've only had it for about a month but i'm already feeling that the middle cushion (which is the one I sit on the most) is already starting to have some noticeable wear. also, as another reviewee pointed out, the \"seat\" portion of the couch simply just lays on top of the frame. It would have been much, much better if there were some sort of latch or any simple way so that it wouldn't just slide. I feel that if you move too quickly, it may move the seat portion and it would cave in. all you have to do is pull the seat portion about an inch forward/out and the back end would fall in through the frame.", 
    "I'm very happy with my new sofa I received today! I was able to put it together by myself in under half an hour. The fabric looks more expensive than I thought it would; although it's a little darker than the pictures, I like it. I decided to just throw out the black caps that covered the screws - they're less noticeable without them in my opinion, and the chairs I have (Eames eiffel tower chair repros) already had exposed screws so I don't mind them at all. This is definitely not a soft couch, so better if you like more structured seats. It's the perfect size for my small apartment, but then again I measured before ordering so I knew that! Overall, very satisfied."
