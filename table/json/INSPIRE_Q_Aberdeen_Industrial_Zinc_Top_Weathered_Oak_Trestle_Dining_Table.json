    "I was a little worried once I made this purchase and hoped I would be happy with it knowing that it wouldn't be easy to return such a big item. It is STUNNING! I am in love with this table. I added a bench in a nice linen color and two tan and off white zebra covered chairs. It looks gorgeous. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Even my husband liked it and he doesn't like many things.", 
    "I ordered this table in the end of June. They promptly contacted me and we set up a delivery date. It came exactly when expected. And let me tell you, it is HEAVY! I was able to put it together myself easily, but couldn't flip it upright without help (obviously. It's huge and very heavy). The wood \"legs\" were even better looking in real life than they look in the picture. That was a huge plus. Unfortunately, my table came with a large scrape on one of the sides/corners (which I believe happened before it was packaged as the box was completely undamaged). I didn't really want to hassle with sending it back because re-packing it would've been an ordeal and I didn't want it to run out of stock, as I had already waited for it to be back in stock. And I decided that I could live with it that way because it wasn't in an incredibly visible location. Anyway, I contacted customer service and they agreed to send me some touch up paint so I could attempt to fix it myself. That took a couple weeks to receive and then when I went to do it, it wasn't really the correct type of finish.... It almost looks like grey nail polish. I will probably end up scrubbing it off and trying to hide it with some other paint technique eventually, but I contacted them again and they were able to offer me a small discount for my troubles. Seeing how the scratch isn't on top, I was ok with that.... Now, for the rest of the review :) So, this is a metal top. I have 4 kids and wanted something basically indestructible. In one sense, it is. it doesn't dent. The metal is strong and thick. But whatever finish is on it (from previous research on zinc top tables, I thought the \"finish\" would be more of a chemical reaction that tarnishes the metal to the desired look. This is an actual finish of some sort) got little pocks in it within 3 days. Like, the finish flaked off in tiny dots. It's hard to describe and it definitely wasn't from wear or even kids being rough on it. It's not terribly noticeable, except that the actual metal underneath the finish is shiny, like galvanized aluminum or something, so, in the right light, there are shiny flecks on the otherwise dark, tarnished-looking table top. In total, there are only about 10 of these little pock marks, but, keep in mind, I've only had the table for a month. The next bummer is that my kids colored with markers on paper. These were regular kid markers form ******. Not permanent markers. We're talking coloring book markers. Anywhere that it got on the table will not come off.... I haven't tried anything special besides water and dish soap because you aren't supposed to use chemical cleaners on this table. So, I'm not exactly sure what I will end up trying as I'm afraid it will ruin the apparently wimpy finish! So, you can't dent it, but it stains and chips... Regardless of all this, I still love the table. It looks beautiful and the flaws are fairly hidden... I'm hoping that even with the flaws, it will come across as gracefully aged some day, rather than totally beat up :)I would recommend it to someone that isn't afraid of some wear or someone that will not use it as an everyday table. It is our every day table, so I'm curious to see how it stands up after years of use. Metal does not = indestructible :)", 
    "was a little large for my roombut im going to make it work 7 foot long! be sure to meausrereally pretty even though its industrial, soften it up with some pretty florals or feminine touches", 
    "This table is beautiful and absolutely perfect! Extremely heavy.. When I read this in other posts, I thought yeah right it couldn't be that heavy. But wow, it is a really sturdy table! Some people posted about the scratches looking silver, but after researching I learned that all zinc is shiny before the patina that it comes in. My husband scratched a small area when he was putting it together. It doesn't look bad but it is shiney silver. This table is stunning and looks better in real life!", 
    "Table arrived quickly. Unpacking was easy, no damage or blems. Exactly like the picture, a substantial table ! It has a sturdy thick zinc top, some of the tables we saw in stores( RH ) didn't feel as thick, I really like how the metal is attached underneath. It looks really well made. The zinc has a nice finish, my wife doesn't like the \"water spots\" finish on the top( look closely at the photo of the top ) but it has grown on her, she really likes the zinc and it probably will get more distressed over time.", 
    "This table is expertly packed, weighs A LOT! and is very well made. perfect finish on all the peices and easy construction. NOTE: this table will scratch at the drop of a feather. the tabletop has a perfect dull gray with slightly darker spots all over the top. looks great! but nearly anything you put on the table will scratch it. and acidic liquids and other various liquids will stain the table dark to black. know this. websites say a good looking patina takes years of bad looking stains and scratches before it starts to meld together and look great. mine still looks perfect right now but i expect it to mar and I'm prepared for it.", 
    "Table is great. Looks simple but heavy. It scratches easily too so be aware.", 
    "This is gorgeous, everyone who walks through the door loves it, the metal does get worn however not at all noticeable. Heavy, sturdy, great value.", 
    "Table is very sturdy, beautiful, and easy to maintain", 
    "This zinc table top is massive and large but extremely classy looking. The industrial cross wood legs accentuates the table top. Easy to assemble. Very please with this purchase.", 
    "The table is beautiful and was easy to assemble. We've owned it now for over a month and just love it's look/feel and size", 
    "I got this on a tremendous sale for around $***. Worth every penny and then some. Look online about zinc care before you buy. Super easy, especially if you'd like it to patina naturally. If not you can turtle wax it on occasion and rub off any stubborn spots with fine steel wool. Back to factory new. I chose this table because I homeschool 4 artsy, messy kids and got tired of ruined wood tops. Super easy to put together. Great with a modern industrial look. I put those metal chairs from Target with it. They are super sturdy and tuck all the way under. One cool surprise is the end caps on the trestle joints snap on with strong magnets so you can easily tighten loose screws down the line. Now that I've seen it in person and used it, I would've paid more and been happy, especially after having priced a zinc top table at my local Stash at $1800! I had no shipping issues or damage. HEAVY so 2 fairly strong people needed to flip it once it's assembled. The delivery folks brought it into my kitchen for me. Extremely happy with this purchase!", 
    "love the industrial look. have kids so gets beat up a little with crayons, scratches. anything wipes off. the scratches make it look worn in, which is what we like.", 
    "Just got this table, very easy to assemble, very heavy, two damaged places, these where due to shipping damage. OS customer serv was great took care of it pronto, OS really does have great customer serv. I am using the Tabouret Bistro steel side fairs in vintage on one side and the same 60 inch bench on the other, I can seat three on each side and in a pinch 4, I am loving this table, it will be full for a MERRY CHRISTMAS.", 
    "Beautiful heaven zinc topped table I get many compliments! Mine arrive with a pin hole on top and overstock sent me a credit and we are going to try to patch it", 
    "Just got this table. WOW it is beautiful ... BIG but beautiful I feel like we can for sure seat 10 or 12 for family time. Sleek, so for just the two of us it works well. Plenty of space for a beautiful center piece or holiday deco.Love it.", 
    "I just put my new table together. Very easy but soooo heavy. You need 2 strong people to turn it over. It's a gorgeous table, I was very nervous to order it online, but took a chance bc it had good reviews. If you like the photo, and the size is right for you, don't hesitate to order it. You won't be disappointed.", 
    "This table was exactly what we were looking for to furnish our summer home. It is very heavy and extremely sturdy. I is just perfect for the casual dining area, which gets lots of beach traffic! On the downside it does take a while to deliver-- as it is an oversize item and we thought it was lost in the delivery process. Worth every penny you pay for it though.", 
    "got this table today and just finished putting it together. it's nice but somehow looked sleeker in photos. the top seems to be concrete wrapped in zinc, very heavy so make sure you have 2-3 people on hand if you need to move it up a flight of stairs.", 
    "We love our table. It's exactly as pictured and a very heavy durable piece."
