    "Great set, looks nice with our reclaimed wood dinning table and bench. Used chairs as two accent chairs. Added chair cushions for some color.", 
    "I ordered three sets, so six chairs total, in white. The white in fact very white. Not cream, not ivory, not off white. They are bright white. The seats had rustic charm to them but they did not appear to be sealed so they were not smooth. In fact, they felt rough to the touch- not a big deal unless you're wearing something fine, like satin or other materials that can snag. Two of the wooden seats had cracks in them. Two of the white chairs had significant scratches. I ended up returning the entire set due to the minor flaws. Otherwise, they are attractive and nice chairs!", 
    "Use them in my art studio", 
    "The wood seats are a little rough. I will need to sand then down and re-stain. Other than that, they are exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "love them--great color--love the wood seats", 
    "nice sized chairs, light, easy to move"
