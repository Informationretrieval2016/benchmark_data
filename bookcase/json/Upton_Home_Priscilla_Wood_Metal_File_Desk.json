    "Small well built. fashionable", 
    "I like this desk very much and am fundamentally happy with my purchase. Good quality and very easy to assemble. The file folder rods are solid and create great functionality in a smaller desk. The one challenge is the drawers don't fit perfectly and close easily. Despite this issue I still recommend this desk.", 
    "Great desk. So glad I picked this one.", 
    "Is just like the photo show, very good quality and structure work well, easy to ensemble", 
    "I ordered two of these for a home office. I love them! They were VERY easy to put together, highly functional, and look great. I'm very happy with these desks."
