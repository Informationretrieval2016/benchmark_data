    "The chairs are exactly as pictures and beautiful for anyone needing affordable mid century decor. I purchased them in white and the wooden/ metal legs are gorgeous. They are easy and fun to assemble. I don't foresee the life of the chairs being more than 3-5 years, the plastic of the seat shell reminds me of cheap grade school chairs. It has a slight bend to it when weight is applied and I'm pretty petite. I imagine at some point it will show some wear from this.", 
    "These chairs are sturdy and SO comfortable!! They look very trendy and go with all my decor which is a mix of styles.", 
    "I shopped these chairs for a while ! I was ready to order on Amazon and then found them for a better price on Overstock plus free shipping, They came so fast , packaging was super protective. All of them came in tact . I put them together myself. Very easy to assemble . These chairs are a bright white with a Matte surface, very sturdy, and comfortable . They look amazing . Could not be happier !", 
    "I drooled over these chairs for a while, I looked at the fiberglass ones which were waaaaay out of my budget. These are a great solution to getting the look without paying the price. They are easy to clean, too. My husband works at an auto repair place and he often has dirty hands. I have been able to easily wipe them clean. Great buy!", 
    "These look pretty much like the photo. Haven't had them long, so we'll see how they hold up, but they feel reasonably strong and are comfortable. I got the black ones, and one had stains of some kind on the seat. Overstock didn't have a replacement, so they refunded the cost of one chair.", 
    "Got the chairs. They look great. However, the construction/materials are of shoddier quality. One of the chairs is slightly unbalanced and a bolt sheared off when an ~180lb person was sitting on it. A bit disappointed but, at the price, can't complain too much", 
    "These chairs sit very low. The highest point in the seat is 18\" inches but you are sitting at 16.\" With the height of my table and the fact that kids will be sitting in these chairs they aren't going to work!", 
    "Beautiful chairs - they look fantastic in my dining room. Nice and lightweight (but still sturdy) and super easy to put together. Highly recommend!"
