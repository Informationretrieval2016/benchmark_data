    "If you are wanting to change the look of your room for not a lot of money (especially for a king size bed) this is a good option. we got the teal and the color is exactly as pictured. Also, it looks very nice, the pintucks are very luxurious looking. The material is definitely cheap, though, and not as soft even as items from ****** or ****. Also as a result, the shams are kind of \"floppy\" and you'll be reliant on the pillow for them to have any \"stand-up.\" I was a little dismayed about the fabric. And I would never use it with the chevron side up because it looks like the white pattern is printed on, not woven in (that's the only part that's definitely not like the picture). the pillows are nice and square. It has no odors. Slept under it last night and temp was very comfortable (it is currently May). Overall, it's fine for the price, because you really can't get a nice-looking set for less. But, i'm feeling like we might upgrade if a better option comes along, and I'm not sure how it will hold up.", 
    "The Venice 7-piece Reversible Comforter set is too much wonderful. I loved it because it is so comfortable. The quality of the set was very high. Even the color matches the picture shown. It was delivered on time. Very glad to purchase this wonderful comforter set.", 
    "This set was ok, but the inside Chevron print of the comforter is actually a gauzy type material. You know that stuff.. cheap and gross.Then when you want to return it, you get charged shipping to send the low quality item back.", 
    "I received this entire bedroom set comforter, sheets, curtians ) from my dad for christmas ... I absolutely loved it , beautiful color , soft...... but unfortunately the material is coming apart and I have done nothing except sleep :( wish I could upload a picture, need to tell my dad but I hate to.", 
    "The color is beautiful, the price is great, and the quality seems to be in line with the price. No complaints, and happy I made this purchase.", 
    "I was so disappointed in this item. The material felt like a cheap sleeping bag. I returned it and had to pay $$ for the return shipping. I have ordered a quilt and will be finished with Overstock if that comes in the same quality as this comforter set. The beading on the pillows was also hideous.", 
    "This comforter has held up through several washes in machine. The teal is a great color and the reversible option is nice for when you want to change up look.", 
    "Easy to wash but not the best material. Otherwise, it has a nice modern appeal.", 
    "Nice quality for the price", 
    "This is a beautiful, quality set.", 
    "Beautiful bed set, true to color. A very happy customer.", 
    "Perfect color I have the burnt orange and it was everything I wanted. Color was perfect. My room is complete.", 
    "Beautiful Comforter great for the price except the color wasn't what true other that that its grea .", 
    "This comforter is very light weight and perfect for summer. The color was just the right shade. This isn't a luxury set but for the price it's quite nice.", 
    "it's not what I expected it to be.", 
    "The set was okay. Color and quality wasn't what I expected. Material feels light and sheer. It's for a guest bedroom so I'm not upset about it. Just not what I thought it would be.", 
    "The color and material were not the same as online. Hated it", 
    "The material on the underside (zig zag pattern) seems very poor quality and not comfortable to the touch. It was not soft.", 
    "Very nice quality. Good fabric. Very heavy.", 
    "So I love this comforter color and feel. The problem I have is the fabric holds dog fur. Its like a suede material so it tends to hold on to fibers. However, if no pets then its just perfect. Just not for my household because of my dogs!", 
    "Love the color, burn orange. Great price for all the pieces you get.", 
    "Definitely worth the money. Beautiful and the exact color I was looking for.", 
    "It's soft and comfortable, and is perfect for our new master bedroom!", 
    "This set has received nothing but compliments and as single man i never knew i had that Quality Great Set !!!", 
    "Great item! Especially for the price. Good quality. True to the pictures.", 
    "Quality not quite up to par.", 
    "I feel like I was expecting a little higher quality fabric...the reverse chevron side looks cheap and I would never actually use this side....over all though it looks very nice on my bed", 
    "It looks hideous...I took it to Salvation Army", 
    "Color looks much different than what's shown in picture. Fabric looks and feels thinner , cheap looking !", 
    "Not crazy about the design on the reverse side.", 
    "I have gotten so many compliments on my recent purchase. The terracotta color looks great in my bedroom. It did not receive 5 stars due to the material of the comforter that is of a cheaper quality than I expected. Overall I am well pleased.", 
    "I love The Comforter set. I never dreamed it would be so warm and comfie.", 
    "This is a beautiful set, warm and fits my bed perfectly. Love it!", 
    "Love this !! The pintucking is awesome !", 
    "The color is beautiful as pictured. However, the pi tucks are not as tight and neat looking as the picture. I also expected a higher quality material. This material is very light weight and wrinkles easily and I doubt it will hold up long after use and washing.", 
    "Perfect colors, Lightweight, complete set with Dust ruffle, Comforter, Shams and decorator pillows. Instant Glam!", 
    "It's not shiny or durable feeling. Very dull and cheap looking. From a distance, it looks great.", 
    "The color is beautiful, just as pictured. The striped side material feels a little rough but the solid side is soft. It definitely brightens up my room, which is what I was looking for. I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "I was nervous that the color might be off but my set looks just like the picture. I thought the comforter would be a little fluffier but it's not flat by any means. I love it. Great purchase", 
    "LOVE!! Got in red, looks simple & expensive! Great quality, dresses up room but still simple.", 
    "It's thick and soft. We love it.", 
    "The comforter is fluffy and comfy. I bought this in the summer and we got hot very easily. Now the temperature has dropped and it's the perfect comforter for snuggling.", 
    "The color part is stunning, the reverse not that much but the color is beatiful.", 
    "though the reversible chevron print is not my cup of tea, the spread itself is beautiful. very comfortable. So comfortable, in fact, I just ordered some throw blankets to go with it. So in love with this color.", 
    "This comforter set is gorgeous. It fits the bed perfectly and the color is as is described. I would tell anyone to purchase one.", 
    "Very pretty color. Really brightens up my bedroom without it being too loud. Just enough splash of color to add to a somewhat dark room.", 
    "Excellent comforter set. The color is just exactly what is shown on the site. The comforter is very soft and comfortable also. What hesitate to buy another one like it.", 
    "It's a great set for the money, it adds a nice touch of color to the room and you can choose between the two different patterns", 
    "Love love love it !!! great quality", 
    "I bought this king comforter set in the teal color and absolutely love it. It's very thick and soft and comfortable. It feels like sleeping in a luxury hotel bed.", 
    "Happy Birthday present esrly. She loves it.", 
    "Great set, material could be a little softer but for the price it is amazing color and was a great purchase!", 
    "Comfy and soft. Nice pillows!", 
    "The material is not what I expected.", 
    "Lovely set but it's a little rough/scratchy", 
    "Returned this item - too much orange for us. Not as detailed as the picture shows.", 
    "Upon arrival the color and look was close to what was described but the size was all off. The comforter was a few inches smaller. Also, the decorative pillows were poorly made.", 
    "I love this new bed set! The color is rich and makes a room look great! The fabric isn't the softest, but I think this is a great buy for it's price!", 
    "Lightweight cotton exterior which feels that it may tear easily but I like the overall lighter weight and the very deep teal is very pretty. (darker than pictures) As noted in other reviews, chevron part is rough, but I don't have it against my skin so it's not a big issue. Keeping because of the light weight and color. Check the accessory pillow sizes, they are smaller than you may see on other sets. if that is important to you.", 
    "Since I purchased this set for one of my guest rooms, it will do but quality is not as good as pictured.", 
    "I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that the material is odd on the underside. Feels like the inexpensive tote bags companies give out for you to carry groceries in. I'm a little concerned as to how well it will hold up in the wash. On the other hand, the comforter is lighter weight than I expected while still providing the same warmth that a heavy comforter would give.", 
    "Color not really teal, more hunter green look. Other wise very happy with quality.", 
    "This set is worth the money. It is soft, durable, and stylish. The white isn't completely white, but I don't mind it. It is almost like grey dots, but very light. Other than that this was a great purchase.", 
    "This comforter is stiff, and smothering lol :)", 
    "This item was a bit lighter than I expected when ordering but the real issue I had was that it was actually a very dark, nearly black hue of Blue so I returned it mostly based on the color issue.", 
    "Looks nice with the color and the chevrons", 
    "This comforter is so soft and comfy, I'm not really sure what those other reviewers are experiencing. I know that I'm experiencing a great nights sleep. Contemplating getting this comforter in red.", 
    "Love the quality, and how fast I received my product", 
    "I read some reviews which mentioned that the quality of material on the comforter was not that great for the price. I don't know if it was revised, but the product I got is very very comfortable, apart from being stylish. Very happy with the buy!", 
    "Arrived quickly.....looks fantastic", 
    "Beautiful set at a great price!", 
    "I love this set, it is lightweight and so comfortable!", 
    "To my surprise this set is not made with good quality fabric. It looks and feels very cheap. For the cost I expected more. This is below walmart grade.", 
    "Lovely comforter set, amazing quality and so elegant. The delivery was on time, looks same as the photo. Glad to have this wonderful set. Highly recommended to all who are looking for a top class comforter set.", 
    "Great Item, I absolutely love it! Looks just like its pictured.", 
    "I bought 1 for my bedroom. It was so nice my 15 year old son wanted 1 too!! They're great for the summer.", 
    "I brought the taupe it goes well with my flooring. It's soft and pillow like. The pattern jacquard is amazing and I love the pleated bedskirt. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to change to a summer comforter.", 
    "I am okay with the comforter and it is one you have to get use to seeing when entering the bedroom. I understand the shortness due to the fact it comes with a bedskirt which I won't use as I have drawers underneath. The fit will do but what I don't like are the pillow cases. I didn't realize how you have to put them on - I have never liked are the pillow cases that are put on at the end rather than the middle. Maybe it is because I don't know how to use the overlap. Overall it is comfy for me and thick. It is nice that it came with 3 throw pillows to fill in the open space between the pillows. Also I purchase this because of the color plum which is very hard to find and just like the picture. It is a good purchase from Overstock and arrived within a week.", 
    "The quality of the material on the Chevron side is cheap. Feels like a paper gown that you would wear at a hospital", 
    "I purchased this bedding, it took a very long time to arrive and it is probably the worst quality I have ever seen in my life, very thin and not soft at all.. in fact the exact opposite of soft. I was disappointed the moment I opened the bag. The pillows were deformed and the comforter was so wrinkled I had to wash it. After washing and drying the comforter I had noticed that there was a very large rip in it. I would return it but my significant other had already cut the tags off and broke the box that it came in down. If I could give 0 stars I would. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!", 
    "A very nice addition to my room. My only complaint is that it isn't terribly soft. But great quality for the price point. Would recommend it to anyone looking for bedding in this price range. Love that it's reversible so I can mix it up if I would like.", 
    "It is good quality but was not the color I ordered. It is more of a dark green than teal.",
