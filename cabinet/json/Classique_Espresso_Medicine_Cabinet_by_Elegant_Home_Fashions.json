    "We bought this for a wall in our bathroom that is only 18 inches wide. This cabinet is listed as being 18 inches wide, and we weren't sure if the cabinet itself was 18 inches, or the molding at the top and bottom that stick out further. It turns out that it's the molding that's 18 inches wide, so it fits great! There you go, in case anyone was wondering. It looks great in our bathroom. We like how it's not too deep. One thing: it has both a magnet and a latch on the handle (you turn the handle to open the door, like a doorknob. It seems kind of redundant to have both, so we just took out the magnet. The magnet felt stronger than it needed to be anyway. I don't want to be exerting too much effort opening the cabinet to get out my toothbrush at night when I'm really tired (and I don't want to yank the thing out of the wall either!) Assembly wasn't so bad. It comes with everything you need, except a screwdriver and a drill to get the anchors into the wall. If you're looking at the mirror close-up, it looks great. But if you're more than 6 feet away from it, it may look a little \"fun-house-ish.\" Our cabinet is on the wall opposite our bathroom mirror, so we can see that. It's not a big deal, don't worry about it. Can't think of anything else. We've had this hanging in our bathroom for about 3 days now. So far, so good. A great find, great price! Love the color.", 
    "This cabinet is small in size so it is perfect for a smaller bathroom. It is relatively easy to put together just follow the instructions carefully. It took me about 45 minutues from taking it out of the box to having it fully assembled. It looks great in my bathroom. The quality is great not cheap or flimsy looking. I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Cabinets look great, and seem very high quality. Disregard the reviewers who said these were \"black\"...they are definitely espresso brown. One word of warning on the installation instructions...the template they include for the pre-drilled holes is off by 1 inch. You will need to mark your own holes on the wall. Other than that, very nice cabinets and very easy to assemble.", 
    "This was my third purchase with Overstock and I am truly amazed by how the products come shipped. Overstock takes packaging and shipping to a whole new level. I purchased this to go in my master bathroom with the new Glass Vessel Sink/Vanity Combo Item #12299919 and Classique Espresso Floor cabinet Item #12504420. There is slight difference in coloring from the vanity but not so bad that you can tell. All three pieces that I purchased have the same lines and style,but all three pieces coordinate so well together. They have turned my late 70's master bathroom into a modern day(spa-like) look with reasonably priced items from Overstock. It was so easy to put together and looks wonderful above my vessel sink vanity. All the hardware matched in style and the sheen was closely matched. This was an excellent choice and buy from Overstock. My husband and I have remodeled our whole bathroom from Overstock. I now have a bathroom that I love to show off and refer to Overstock.", 
    "I was very skeptical about purchasing this cabinet. It is small, but holds a couple of bottles of shampoo/conditioner and some rolls of toilet paper (probably not a double roll). I purchased this cabinet to hold those items or maybe some bars of soap. I was very please when the cabinet was assembled and put up on the wall. It looks very nice, not at all cheap. This cabinet doesn't sit next to the vanities that I have, but it is close in color to the Ronbow vanities that I have and doesn't look junky at all in comparison. If you want a large cabinet then this might not be good for your use, but it looks very nice above the toilet and is a great contrast against our tea green walls.", 
    "This is a great medicine cabinet. It matched beautifully with our Linen Cabinet we also bought there. Assembled very easily, and template provided was dead on to hang the mollies and cabinet. I had tiled behind the cabinet on wall and left room according to template so I didn't have to waste tile. Was very happy when I went to hang cabinet and it was perfect quality. Looks great now, and has a lot of storage space with the shelf, I can now \"hide\" several of my pill bottles and lotions, colognes that used to sit out in the open on sink.", 
    "Love the look of this medicine cabinet. It was a little tricky to put together but totally worth it in the end. Very durable and practical. Looks great in our small bathroom!", 
    "Exactly what I needed great asset to the bathroom", 
    "Way too hard to put together. Far too many parts and it was smaller than I expected. Decent looking.", 
    "Not that big but it hold a lot. Perfect to hold colognes or perfumes about 15 in mine", 
    "Nice but not impressed by it material is not too good.", 
    "The assembly was not hard, with the exception of the cam locks, I had to do a swap of many of them to find ones that fit right, some just circled around and never locked. The assembly was going along fine until the very end when I attached the latch. Everything was aligned, but the latch was not long enough to catch and the door just swings to the back with a jolt. I know it wasn't right because I had put together the floor cabinet and that latch worked okay. Then, we I tried to play with the latch on the medicine cabinet, the turning part just broke off in my hand. So now I have this cabinet, but can't close the door. Not worth $*** for sure.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for my new compact bathroom and it fit the space perfectly. Its small, so don't expect a ton of cabinet space. Good buy.", 
    "Matches my vanity well. Just what i was looking for.", 
    "Nice unit & relatively easy to assemble.", 
    "I was really happy with the quality of this product..it looks lovely in my bathroom.", 
    "Perfect size for the bathroom and matched the color of the other cabinet", 
    "this espresso color is awesome, getting everything ready for the @Jagandco showroom", 
    "Assembling it took time but the product looks exactly as shown in the picture. Satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "This was a gift for my husband and he loves it. It was simple to set up and I love the look.", 
    "Nice and great quality. I really Recomind it.", 
    "Nice and rich looking. Easy to assemble.", 
    "These look really amazing over two reclaimed pedestal sinks I installed with bronze fixtures. With the marble floor, claw foot tub and crystal chandelier, these helped me create a luxurious look at a bargain price. Well made and easy to assemble. Arrived right away. Plenty of room to hide all the unsightly clutter. Love them!", 
    "This medicine cabinet is pretty cheap looking (hard to put together in a clean way so gaps seem inevitable). It is pretty shallow and the door closure isn't easy to use.", 
    "This product is solid, sturdy, and stylish.", 
    "this is a nice and small medicine cabinet, perfect for small bathrooms. good color and has 2 shelves. the only thing is the little door knob seems a little flimsy, could be better. but overall great product for the price", 
    "Looks great and was super easy to put together!", 
    "Involved in a total bathroom remodel this full match the vanity that I bought the espresso color fashionable great price great style very excited very high-end look", 
    "Fits all I need it to. A little wobbly but that mostly goes away when mounted.", 
    "It is attractive but, not well made. The backof it is paper'like. But it looks nice for now. Not worth the price by any means.", 
    "For me it works. Sure the door is slightly off but it still closes shut. It looks nice, just don't inspect too far.", 
    "We bought this when we changed all the decor in our bathroom to dark oil-rubbed bronze and this matches everything very well. It was not difficult to assemble, and it looks very nice in our bathroom. It holds a good amount of stuff too. I would recommend it.", 
    "Nicely made. I did not look to closely at the dimensions. But that was my own fault. Pretty easy to assemble.", 
    "Really nice and I love it !looks great in my son's bathroom", 
    "Very pleased with purchase and quick deliver.sturdier then anticipated, matched perfectly with my expresso colored vanity purchased elsewhere. It took about twenty minutes to put together, but was done by someone mechanically incline. Great buy for the money.", 
    "I have a small bathroom and this item was the perfect size. very easy to assemble", 
    "We needed some storage for an older bathroom prior to doing an overhaul renovation in a few years and this fit the need without blowing the budget.", 
    "Well, we got it put together, and it looks good now. But the diagram provided with the instructions was off, the screws for mounting it were poor quality and the wrong size, and it was really just a mess. Quality control on parts was lacking.", 
    "Size, color, fit and finish all excellent for value. If you do not want a built in medicine cabinet then this is the one for you.", 
    "I love the color of this cabinet, the quality is pretty good and it wasn't too hard to assemble. It has just enough space for necessities and is not too large, so it works well in the secondary bathroom where we needed it. Glad I purchased this!", 
    "No Complaints here. This little medicine cabinet holds more than I thought. All my toiletries and then some, sturdy and sleek design for a trendy bathroom..Did not take long to put together at all.", 
    "I ordered two mirrors. They were both scratched on the face area. The back part is slightly better than cardboard. There were many parts to put together. One screw wouldn't embed because the part it screws to was too flimsy. I will return them both and find a better pair of mirrors.", 
    "Packaged well and relatively easy directions to follow if you have used cam locks before. All the parts were there. The quality is generally poor. The latch is broken, does not turn or latch, so I will have to replace. The door with pre attached hinges and predrilled holes is not square to the opening so will need to be shimmed under one of the hinges. I didn't expect super high quality but I did expect something I could use after putting together. On the whole, I am disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone.", 
    "This product came from China and is of the same poor quality that is common in most China imports. It was not conspicuously clear that the medicine cabinet shown in the photo required assembly. The multiple pieces are like flimsy cardboard rather than of sturdy material which photo leads you to believe. For the very same price, I purchased a fully assembled medicine cabinet in a brick and mortar store where I could see what I was getting, had the assistance of a store employee and had immediate response to my questions", 
    "We are dissapointed with this medicine cabinet. It took over 2 hours to assemble because it came with many, many small pieces. After we assembled it, the lock broke off and we had to spend **** to purchase a new lock. It's a nice style and good for a small space but I would not recommend it, it is very cheaply made.", 
    "This small cabinet is exactly what I needed in my new bathroom!", 
    "I bought three cabinets for our three bathrooms. I bought two of these and one other slightly larger and very slightly more expensive. I assembled and installed the larger cabinet first with great success. It is sturdy and looks great. This cabinet is much smaller but is an OK size. The fit does not seem to be adequate. It's not tight like I would have liked. I assembled both cabinets and both had a small gap at the top. It is a good looking cabinet and I like the idea of the mirror for front, side, and rear viewing. It is a decent price and though I chose these because of the size and the mirror I wish I had purchased three of the larger better quality cabinets for only $XX difference per cabinet. I also had trouble hanging these cabinets as I had trouble with the toggles/anchors so therefore they are currently still sitting on the floor. This cabinet will not hold a LOT of items but will be good for tooth brushes and other small items like this.", 
    "This product was easy to put together and looks greak. You have to be careful with particle borad. I used some Weldwood cement. i had no problem putting this together", 
    "I would recommend with a warning that the doors do not line up very well with pre drilled holes, and you may have to adjust before putting it all together. Also besure the shelf is in before you close the door as it will fall in. It is a nice looking cabinet and does have enough room inside.", 
    "i like how it looks not to big or to small perfect size for a smaller bathroom.", 
    "I purchased this beautiful cabinet for my renovated bathroom 3 years ago to have extra storage and I am very satisfied with the look and quality of this product. The deep rich color compliments the rest of the decor. For the look of this cabinet I'm surprised it is so reasonably priced...Thank you Overstock!", 
    "this is a very cheap piece of real junk. it is overpriced to boot. the latch broke within two weeks of use. it is also a nightmare to assemble. pay the extra and get a better model.", 
    "Such a wonderful product, I would recommend this to anyone who wants simple, durable, and timeless product in your home.", 
    "This meets my needs because I didn't want a medicine cabinet, I wanted it for jewelry. This was the perfect size so I just added hooks on the inside. This is considerably smaller than traditional medicine cabinets so I would have been disappointed if it was my intent to use as that.", 
    "So this petite little curio-ish cabinet is just what I needed for a tiny space in my micro bathroom (in my mini house.) Easy enough to put together, up to the point where I realized that it was completely not square, because the back panel -very thin paneling- was not cut square. I have a handy brother, who happened to be around, & he whacked a hunk of .25\" pressboard, perfectly sized, and it squared my cabinet off when we drilled the sucker to the wall. Looks great. But if you don't have a skill saw, spare pressboard, said brother to employ skill saw & then attach entire contraption to wall, maybe not your best bet if you like things entirely square. The off-set door would have driven me batty. But I love it, it was cheap, looks far more high-end than it cost.. and it is square. So I am happy.", 
    "This is a cute small medicine cabinet. It was east to put together, not flimsy. If you are looking for a large extremely sturdy cabinet, this is not for you. For the price I paid it serves it's purpose. I am an avid fan of Overstock, they stand behind their products.", 
    "This product is very poorly constructed. 2 of the cam locks broke immediately. The frame is very loose after assembly and there is no door stop so the door closes past the frame and only stops when it hits the shelf. If the return shipping wasn't so costly I would have returned it. Nowhere near worth the price.", 
    "Very happy with product. Was what was promised and looks exactly like the picture on line.", 
    "Small. Wobbly wood pieces after all put together, should probably be glued while assembling. Cheap and flimsy latch that only holds door if cabinet is level, no stop to keep door from swinging inside of cabinet. Do not buy this, go to a physical store so you can determine quality on site.", 
    "i am so pleased with my new medicine cabinet. it really looks great and the amount of storage is unbelieveable. it has really solved my storage problem. i would recommend it , it is small enough, not to take up too much space, but it holds a lot of things, i was really surprised. very happy with my purchase. thanks, Overstock!", 
    "The first cabinet we received had a broken mirror. When we called and told them, the phone call was quite confusing but they promptly sent us a new one. Which then had a large chip in the door. We ended up having to disassemble them and mix and match parts from both cabinets. A frustrating process but the finished product looks decent. It's pretty small!", 
    "Not really happy with this purchase. Not only is the mirror small, but flimsy, mounting brackets manufactured backwards, no back for mounting just two picture-style clips. If you are going to mount this, mount the door last. Recommendation: besides the two hooks, glue the frame to the wall as well with liquid nail. Its not real wood, nor particle board. Its made out of masonite which is not durable. It looks better than it is. Once hung it does look nice, great color match. Just worried about its long-lasting capabilities.", 
    "Not really thrilled about this - the price is ridiculous considering the poor quality and you have to put it together yourself. Should have been $30. It's pretty but just not the best quality.", 
    "I needed two bathroom cabinets (medicine with matching wall cabinet) fast and didn't want to break the bank. It was surprisingly difficult to find two matching cabinets, and these looked to be the best value for my dollar. I did not expect high quality, but I am pleased with what I got. Easy to put together, and relatively easy to install. Looks very nice with it's matching sister wall cabinet. Perfect size for my small bathroom and for the items I wanted to store in it.", 
    "Absolutely the worst piece of junk I have ever ordered. I am god at putting things together, but this was garbage, nothing fit. it will go into the thrash. If Overstock cant check the products before they sell them, I wont buy here again.", 
    "I really like this cabinet. It looks nice and is pretty good quality. I like the adjustable shelf so I can fit taller bottles. A good buy.", 
    "Perfect cabinet for small spaces. We have two, facing each other on opposite walls, flanking the vanity mirror. Perfect for my husband's and my toiletries. The one we ordered from Amazon arrived damaged. I called Amazon and spoke with a very professional customer service rep who saw to it that a replacement was shipped out immediately. Cabinet received and we are pleased with it. All-in-all, it was a pleasant and satisfactory transaction.", 
    "This is a sturdy little cabinet that is easy to put together. I had no issues with the template, the drill holes. It always amuses me that some people are too scatter-brained or too stupid to put it together (there I said it and I don't care either :-) The only problem I have with it is more my fault than the cabinet's. I think the door opens the wrong way and I wish it wasn't so dark, but I've used to the way it opens now and my little vase with flowers brightens it up a lot.", 
    "I wish i could have found a bigger one of these the same depth, but could not. The cabinet is nice looking and has an old house style charm. However, even with shimming out the hinge on the bottom some, the mirrored door is not quite plumb. Since this is more of a temporary cabinet until I found a bigger one that I liked, I did not return it. I probably should have because maybe it was just this one that the door was could not be hung plumb. But other than that it is nice.", 
    "I bought almost the entire collection and this was the best piece. There were a few dents and scratches however its a beaurtiful piece and it looks great! Not perfect but a had such issues with the other two pieces in the collection I have to say this one was the best.", 
    "I needed an affordable solution for bathroom storage in my vintage house, and was unable to find anything in local box stores. This product is made in China, so expect the usual amount of pressboard and flimsy parts, but they are in spots that don't matter. The color and finish match my needs perfectly, the chrome latch is very attractive and functions well, and the mirror (contrary to at least one review I read before purchase) is accurate - no wavy funhouse effect in mine. It went together in about 25 minutes, though in one instance the \"female end\" of one of the screws came unglued and recessed itself into the part, but I was able to make an adjustment so that everything turned out fine. Definitely worth the money.", 
    "Great value - love this cabinet! looks great up on the wall and plenty of space for a small cabinet with an adjustable shelf. - I little bit of difficulty putting it together, but not that bad - Love the template that is supplied for hanging it.", 
    "A great looking cabinet, easy to put together and hang.", 
    "Pay attention to the dimensions in the description. The medicine cabinet was much smaller than we expected, especially the mirror size. If small is what you need, it's nice enough, and the hardware was all well packaged and labeled. We are returning the item - in the end it was our mistake, but be warned - it's small.", 
    "My husband and I were very pleased with how closely the medicine cabinet matched the vanity that we had just bought.", 
    "this is a nice cabinet for our small bathroom, but don't let the size fool you, it's quite deep and holds things nicely.", 
    "The service is very good. And I will recommend family and friends to shop on overstock.Com.", 
    "Overall the product was as described. It was a good price and arrived quickly. It had a small chip in the finish on one of the corners. Also two brachets in the back used to hang it on the wall were installed upside down so I had to take it apart and fix it before I could hang it. Other than that is has been a good cabinet.", 
    "PRODUCT HAD BEEN OPENED AND A VITAL ASSEMBLY PIECE WAS MISSING, ALSO ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS. i MANAGED TO MAKE A SUBSTITUTE PIECE WITH A POOR RESULT.", 
    "It's as good as it looks. Very easy to assemble and install. It would have been better for me if the door had opened from the right.", 
    "Just right for the job .... small bathroom and small budget makes this a perfect purchase", 
    "I bought this for a small bathroom off my master bedroom and put it together myself, pretty amazing as I am not good at such things. It is lovely, and a terrific value.", 
    "Easy to put together, looks great. The magnet was way too strong so I left it off. The door shuts fine with just the latch.", 
    "I was looking for a cabinet to match a vanity I bought and to be the right dimension to cover the hole of an old medicine cabinet. This served both purposes. It matched perfectly. It's a real dark brown and the quality is great. When it arrived the mirror in the door was broken. We contacted Overstock and they sent a replacement door. We didn't need to do anything. We kept the old door and the new one arrived quickly and was in perfect condition. I would definitely use Overstock again!", 
    "I got this medicine cabinet as a steal for decor in my bathroom. It has served great utility, not only as a decor piece, but as an actual storage space. It's very sturdy and was easy to mount. If you want a good product for your money, I would definitely recommend this.", 
    "This is perfect for my guest bathroom. Easy to assemble, very good quality. It is not that big so it would not be suitable for a master bathroom. It is a dark dark brown color, practically black. Very happy with the purchase! I love overstock.com!", 
    "This cabinet is pretty good. It wasn't too hard to assemble according to my husband. It is more square than oblong so the picture is off. I wouldn't call it espresso, I'd call it black. The hardware works good on it and the one shelf inside is adjustable. I love most of my purchases from Overstock, but this one was just average to me.", 
    "a little bit of a project to put together, but well worth it. this looks clean and cute and fits perfectly in our guest bathroom. really happy with it!", 
    "For all intents and purposes, this great little cabinet is black. Sturdy; clasp is solid; instructions were clear; all parts included. Wish it matched my other items better, but it's worth it.", 
    "It went together pretty easy. It is small, but it is perfect size for our smaller 2nd bath. So if you are looking for a small medicine cabinet for a small bath this is it. The color is right on as pictured.", 
    "Bit smaller than I thought but....super cute. It had a LOT of parts and took a while to put together but....it looks great in our bathroom.", 
    "The cabinet itself is pretty well made and looks good. I found it difficult to put together. It comes in about 20 pieces and although each each was carefully labeled and identified. I don't have much experience in putting things together so you should keep that in mind. It has two shelves and is all wood and matches my expresso vanity very well. If you need a small compact medicine cabinet, this is definitely something to consider.", 
    "Despite seeing all the pieces that had to be assembled - FAR too many for the cost - we found that the shoddy craftsmanship made it impossible to assemble. Returning the product.", 
    "The fit and finish were very poor. The rear panel came in 2 pieces and the fit is flimsy. Holes for the screw in items were not drilled properly. The door latch barely hold the door closed.", 
    "I ordered 2 of these cabinets to install over double expresso vanity. One of the cabinets was missing a piece when I inspected the contents upon arrival. Still waiting for it to arrive from the manufacturer. Shipping package of the unassembled cabinet is larger than the assembled cabinet."
