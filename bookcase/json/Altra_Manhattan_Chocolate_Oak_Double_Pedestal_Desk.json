    "My wife needed a spacious desk to accommodate her computer, docking station and two large monitors for her home office. This desk does the job and more! And though it is large it has an open airy feel due to the metal legs that hold up the sturdy dark wood desk. The drawers are amply sized with two letter drawers, a file drawer and a center drawer that can fold open to use as a keyboard tray. The stylish cup handles give it the look of an old time school desk.And although self assembly may seem a daunting task to a novice, I was surprised and pleased to find many pieces are pre-assembled so if you are not an assembly wizard (like me) this won't have you cursing the furniture assembly gods!Many small parts: yes. But all are individually packaged and numbered for easy recognition and each desk part is alphabetically labeled.I recommend the use of an electric screw gun to avoid hand cramps.One point: On page 5 parts B and D are reversed on the illustration so take time to look them over and you should be able to figure it out (heck, if I can do it you can too!)I also recommend a helper to lift and attach the desk top.Also, measure the doors of the room you intend to place the desk. I assembled the wooden parts of the desk and moved it into the office and attached the metal legs in place.All in all, this was an excellent buy made even better when Overstock Customer Care helped issued in-store credit when I found that the price of the desk had dropped a few days after purchasing the desk.If you need a good looking sturdy desk, look no further.Buy it and get to work!", 
    "I got the desk and there was a giant hole punctured in the middle of the desk and all of the corners had been damaged showing the particle board. This was my first purchase from overstock and it will be my last. Very dissatisfied", 
    "I felt I needed to leave a review on this one. First of all, the desk is not real wood, so if you are expecting that, go somewhere else. But it is solid and a great deal for the price you pay here (right now***). The desk is HUGE. I work from home and go to nursing school full time, so it is nice to have room for my two laptops and monitor and books. My one complaint is that this desk is a beast to put together. I did most of it by myself, but needed someone to flip it to put the legs on so I would not tweak it. Go slow, don't drop any pieces, because, again, it is not real wood and you will chip it! Also, I have read some reviews on other sites selling this desk that the pieces do not fit together. HINT: If they do not fit together, you are not doing it right. Trust me, this happened to me 3 times. Once I figured it out and did it right, boom, easy. The book is easy to follow, but gets a little tricky sometimes. Overall, this desk is great, beautiful, exactly what I needed, but putting it together (for me) made *** furniture look like a 4 piece jigsaw puzzle. Not easy, but I feel it is worth it for what you get and what you pay for!", 
    "Nicely finished, plenty of room in drawers.", 
    "This desk was a great buy! Low price and great sturdy quality.", 
    "I use this desk in my medical office and I love it except foreign thing; in the picture it sits in the middle of the room so you would think the back side is an executive style but it is not. This desk is made to be put flush against a wall. Also, there should be a hole for the cords as well and there is not.", 
    "Comes in a million pieces, but the directions were easy to follow. It's quite heavy, so it would be easier for 2 people to do it. I love this piece. It looks expensive and is holding up really good. I've had it for about 6 months and still love it. The drawers are big and the top hasn't shown any scratches or wear. I'm looking into the other pieces I can get of this collection", 
    "When the unassembled desk was delivered by UPS it was literally destroyed. Fortunately the good folks at Overstock took care of things as it was not their doing that the distributor so poorly package the desk.", 
    "This desk is big and looks nice but is an absolute beast to put tigether", 
    "Once I got past the additional time and expense involved with assembling the desk I am happy with it. Good size and very comfortable to work at. Easy to clean under due to metal legs. Would recommend but I can not emphasize enough that assembly is not for the novice or anyone with out a lot of patience.", 
    "The desk arrived on time with some damage to the packaging but the true damage were to piece deep inside the box. Small scratches and a large chunk missing off the back of the drawer. I did not return the product because luckily the scratches were all interior parts. The desk took 2 hours to put together and I regularly put KD furniture together (average 1 large piece a month). It's very heavy but feels solid and looks good once put together.", 
    "Poor quality, this is not wood, is agglomerated. I am not happy with my purchase", 
    "disappointed in this desk. The color is not like the photo - very dark brown and glossier finish than shown. The edges are rough, the veneer is very thin and the edges are not properly glued or finished in many places. The desk is not sturdy - due primarily to the weak materials. Just by assembling this desk it is now scratched and dented and I assembled it on a a carpeted floor. The instructions have one error - if you follow the pictures you will have to disassemble the metal frames and reassemble once you see the mistake. The metal is very soft - do not tighten the bolts or the metal will give and collapse. Also the painted finish on the metal scratches very easily. There is one instruction that I looked at many times before I figured out what t meant. If you miss this little strange diagram you will have to disassemble the metal frames, increasing the chance of damaging them. I did not count the parts but first you need a LOT of room to assemble this desk. There are over 30 wooden parts and about 20 metal parts when you spread them all out it will occupy all the floorspace in a medium bedroom. Also during construction you need to flip the desk over more than once and because the veneer is so thin and the construction so cheap it will scratch even on clean carpet. Also when flipping the desk to build it you need to be very careful as the desk wants to come apart. This desk will not survive a move - wherever you first build it leave it there or you will damage it.I really wish I had spent more money and bought something that will last. This desk already looks like its been through the wringer and I just assembled it!!", 
    "I received this desk from UPS yesterday and it was noticeably damaged in transit. After a painful call to UPS customer service, I contacted Overstock to report the problem. The rep. was pleasant & accommodating and Overstock will be shipping me a new desk in 2 days. Their reputation of having excellent customer service is dead on, and their quick turnaround is going to save Christmas! Thanks Overstock!! :)", 
    "The desk is perfect for our needs! Arrived quickly and we are impressed with the quality. Easy to assemble. Another great purchase from Overstock."
