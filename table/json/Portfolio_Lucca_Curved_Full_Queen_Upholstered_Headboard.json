    "Overall the headboard is fine for the price. The fabric looks more like burlap than linen, so if you want the fine linen look, this isn't for you. The nail head look like \"pletal\" (a cross between plastic and metal). The metal tone look painted on. Again, though, for the price it isn't bad. My main complaint and reason I gave it 3 stars is the installation. I am a very handy, experienced do-it-yourself person and this would NOT work with our queen bed frame (just the standard metal kind you get at a mattress store) without buying an adapter bracket. Luckily, I was able to get it at a mattress store for only $10, so it was cheaper to do that than send the headboard back. Also require the drilling of additional holes and purchase of new bolts.", 
    "Overall, the headboard looks really nice and we are generally pleased. But, one major flaw is that the base part, which connects the headboard to your bedframe, is black cloth and pretty noticeable. I thought the sheets and comforter might cover it up, but unfortunately it still sticks out. It probably wouldn't be that noticeable if you put a nightstand next to it, but we can't do that because of the set up of the room. The other issue was that it did not come with instructions on how to attach the headboard to the frame, which isn't as simple as you might think.", 
    "Headboard fits great on our queen size bed. hard to attached to mattress frame, had to makeshift a piece to attached it with. Color was also darker in person than shown on the website. But good quality and looks very nice.", 
    "This headboard was one of the first purchases I made on Overstock and I could not be more happy about it!! It changed my whole room, looks beautiful and now all my friends want to copy me!! So happy with this.", 
    "And an excellent piece for the price.", 
    "Very well made! Looks just like the picture!", 
    "I love this headboard except for the fact that it looks hideously large on a full size bed. It bothers me so much I'll be exchanging the still-in-the-trial-period mattress for a queen size. The other problem is with the bolts. They are waaaaaay too long for attaching the frame to the headboard. You'll need shorter ones unless you don't mind poking holes into your wall. If I wasn't so sick of packing and unpacking because of a recent move, I'd be sending this back. Instead, it's just easier to let the mattress store come and get this one and bring a queen sized one instead.", 
    "shopped a long time.. this looks as good as ones twice it's price!!", 
    "Great headboard, fabric is a linen with silver studs", 
    "I really liked it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "Love it!! Looks great in my very contemporary bedroom", 
    "Fair price for a nice headboard.", 
    "Couldn't be happier with this purchase!", 
    "This headboard looks like it was custom made. The quality is top notch. The linen look fabric, the studs on the edges, and the padding are of the highest quality. It was easy for my husband to assemble. And you have options for making it the height that fits best with your mattress. A friend liked it so much she ordered a similar one for herself!", 
    "Solid, well-made, and beautiful! It was easy to install on our metal frame. It was a great price too. All in all very satisfied with this purchase", 
    "It's a great looking headboard, but a little flimsy. It still goes great in the guest bedroom so I am not completely disappointed by it.", 
    "Very good quality for the price. Fabric is not a 'fine' linen, more like flax but looks great. Sturdy piece and fit queen headboard perfectly. Only a few minutes for me to assemble. Have received many compliments on it!", 
    "It is for a college student and she loves it!!!", 
    "Beautiful headboard and easy to assemble and install!", 
    "I was very satisfied once I received one without a blemish, and the customer service I received when I notified them there was a problem was extremely efficient and receptive to my complaint. The representative took immediate action to replace it and see to my satisfaction.", 
    "The headboard is good looking however. the assemblage is not only poor it is entirely awful and the headboard fabric is not \"linen\" it is industrial outdoor material; and as far as the environmentally friendly representation is concerned. I don't believe it. The item is made in China, does not have any connection to be able to attach to a double/full size bed frame. The headboard is much larger than a full size bed. I could go on and on about how disappointed I am but I think you get the drift.", 
    "very nice quality and easy to install. definitely added a nice touch to the room.", 
    "Very nice fabric - love it!", 
    "I love it. I made a custom wood frame and it attached easily and tall enough for a box spring and a mattress. Very satisfied with this purchase!", 
    "Love the headboard, great quality", 
    "Loved this headboard! Just as pictured.", 
    "This product arrived promptly, was easy to assemble and install, and looks well made. However, I purchased the full / queen sized headboard for my full bed and the headboard and large black posts that attach to the bed frame were much too wide. The headboard is a full 12 inches too wide for the bed, sticking out 6 inches on either side. The resulting appearance, even with bedding on, simply looked wrong and unattractive. I'm sure the headboard is fine for a queen sized bed, but honestly should not be marketed toward full beds as well. I will be returning this piece.", 
    "Love this headboard. It looks amazing in our bedroom. It looks so expensive and really didn't break the bank purchasing it.", 
    "Would buy again and love the look", 
    "For clarity's sake, the review is poor, not because of the mfgs product or the fact it was the wrong color when it arrived to me. This is due to the customer support rep at Overstock being short in her assistance during the \"chat\".I would give the product 4 stars even though it was an olive green color headboard rather than the smoky charcoal gray I originally ordered. I was pretty happy with the fabric and overall design/quality of the headboard. The fact that it was the wrong color is just an unfortunate circumstance that happens on occasion and causes a bit of disappointment. I can live with that without being an online 'tard...However, what I don't accept by any vendor is poor customer service. Rep \"Nicole W.\" went from having a chat with a client that was merely wanting a replacement of the correct color product that I order to her being somewhat condescending. After verifying that I would like a replacement and I responded \"yes, of the correct color, which is smoky charcoal gray\". She proceeds to write \"Yes, that is the color that was shipped. Unfortunately the hue may be a little green.\" After a couple of confirming questions about the product to ensure I would receive gray she further returned with a few short responses that were less than what I would refer to as patient responses.Either way, I am trying the replacement because of the original mfg and what seems to be a quality product. Overstock and this particular customer service rep could do a bit better.", 
    "This headboard is nicely made and was easy to attached to bed frame. Has adjustable heights as well. Would purchase again", 
    "This is a quality, solid and sturdy headboard. Nice look, clean and simple finish. Very happy with this product.", 
    "Headboard was easy to attach to frame and looks great in a guest room. Looks more expensive than it was and I get lots of compliments on it.", 
    "Nice headboard, looks great", 
    "Perfect size for our queen bed. Had to find some nuts and bolts to attach it to the bed frame, but no big deal. Color is what you see on the description. Definitely a grey. And beautiful. I feel like a grown up now!", 
    "Exceeded expectations Great value for high quality.", 
    "I have actually assembled the bed yet but the headboard is beautiful. I love the push pins. Very classy looking. We are moving in a few weeks and then I will put together. Cant wait!!", 
    "Bought the headboard and the Linon Grey Carmen Shoe Storage Ottoman. Look great together in newly decorated room of black/gray/white. Arrived in perfect condition--had it placed in a few minutes time.", 
    "Very pleased with the fabric itself, the color of the fabric and the construction of this headboard. Would definitely recommend this headboard!"
