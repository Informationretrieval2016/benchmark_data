    "The packaging was exceptionally well done but the product has several serious flaws. First, one side panel was missing the supporting anchors for the screws. (I improvised by buying anchors and cutting them to size.) Second, the crosspiece under the table top comes with a magnetic strip attached. Unfortunately the doors do not have anything magnetic to hold them to the magnetic strip so the doors do not close properly. Third, the cabinet is very unstable, more unstable than my substitute anchors can explain. I was surprised that a cabinet so small would come with a strap to attach it to the wall, but after assembling the cabinet i understand why. Last, several additional pieces of hardware were included that had no apparent purpose and were not shown in the poorly illustrated assembly instructions.", 
    "Great product for the price! It's small, compact, and fits nicely in my house. I am really pleased I bought this cabinet and get compliments all the time when I have company over. It was packaged very nicely, and I had no problems assembling it. I did find that I was missing a piece of hardware (a bolt thing for the shelf) and I called CS and they got back to me ASAP and shipped out fast. Overall, good for the price", 
    "i NEEDED TO BRING SOME ORGANIZATION TO MY SMALL BATHROOM. THIS FIT THE BILL. EASY TO PUT TOGETHER,FIT NICELY IN THE CORNER.", 
    "Couldn't get anyone we know to assemble this thing, although the parts look good. So we've hired someone to come and do it. There goes our savings. Easy assembly, my Aunt Fanny ** and here are some gifted assembler in my family; they said it will take at least half a day.", 
    "easy to put together and just the right size for my bathroom.", 
    "As with cabinet, the product met my expectations and I am happy with it. Read and follow directions.", 
    "Easy assembly, love the extra storage space, blends well with other cabinetry.", 
    "Good product for the price.", 
    "We had been looking for something like this for quite some time. This works perfectly in our bathroom.", 
    "Good quality, perfect for my space.", 
    "Easy to put together. Attractive.", 
    "love this item, we now have storage and can use the top as a countertop, which we didn't have before. quite roomy for the the size.", 
    "Its a great little cabinet. I stuck it in my bathroom. Looks perfect and functions well.", 
    "Easy to assemble and perfectly sized for our small powder room. Has plenty of storage.", 
    "good quality, very sturdy, looks very good and easy to put together. I didn't had any problems .", 
    "The reviewer saying this has \"serious flaws\" must have gotten a defective product. Definetely not the same I received. I cannot see any of the \"flaws\" he points out. The doors hold on to the magnetic strip just fine and they remain closed and properly aligned. The unit is very stable and sturdy. The materials and screws are of superior quality comparing to similar furniture from other brands. They even send (clearly marked as such) spare screws just in case something is missing. So I really don't understand what this reviewer is talking about... I really like this cabinet, assembly was a breeze and I have received many compliments on it.", 
    "I bought this to store towels in for my bathroom. It's a tight fit for bath towels, I probably fit 3 on each self. For hand towels, wash cloths, toiletries, it would fit a lot more things. The cabinet is really cute and I put it together myself in an hour. The doors could probably use stronger magnetic closure tabs, the doors do pop open when you stuff it too full.", 
    "I bought this to store my towels in as I redid my whole bathroom and wanted no clutter. It matches great. Glad I purchased. I wish it was a little deeper since u have to kind of push the towel in. Overall happy", 
    "Nice cabinet. Great value", 
    "Added storage space and look of furniture to guest room. Did have a little difficulty in assembling.", 
    "This cabinet is perfect and just as I expected. Looks more expensive than it is.", 
    "nice! It worked perfect for my needs!", 
    "Using this in my guest BR with all white furniture. It comes in quite handy for guest towels etc and is nice to look at. Easy to put together", 
    "I've purchased several pieces of furniture off overstock, and this was one of the lesser quality items I've received- the back is just cardboard. It's not very stable unless attached to the wall (which was not stated in the description), and the parts already had cracks/stains when I took them out of the box. Would not recommend.", 
    "Not as nice as in the picture. Material is thin and cheap. Paint on doors looks hand painted and sort of clumpy from a rush paint job and hinges look like they will rust from the moisture in the bath room. I already have a thin scratch on top from setting a picture frame on top of it and sliding the picture across to where I wanted it. So if you place anything on top don't slide it, but pick up and move it. My husband put it together in about two hours (he likes to lay all pieces. out and match hardware before starting). He kept saying how much did we pay for this piece of....... We ordered other items which all come together so when I checked the price I was shocked at the quality. If I saw this item together in the store I would of only paid half of this price. It returns were easy as far as packing back up and shipping costs this would of gone back.", 
    "Quality is above average for similar items we've shopped for. Finish and alignment of parts gave us an exceptional piece if furniture.", 
    "Good looking cabinet, but cam locks did not fit well to secure structure, doors do not line up to magnet and back panels holes did not line up to pre drilled holes on back of cabinet.", 
    "Beautiful design, easy to put together and lots of storage inside", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks great...", 
    "This is a product that I would recommend to anyone needing an extra bathroom cabinet", 
    "We needed this chest for our bathroom at the office for items for employees to store out of sight. it is a quality piece of furniture for the price, nice hardware and was perfect for what we needed.", 
    "Cabinet arrived in rapid time. Packed very well. Pieces were in good condition. The directions were much lacking. It took us about 2 1/2 hours to assemble. The cabinet looks lovely and works well for the area and use that I had intended it for. The only negative I have (other than the poor directions) is it is a little on the flimsy side. It just isn't as sturdy as you would think a *** cabinet should be.", 
    "This is a great little cabinet for storage. Looks very nice. My only issue is that it's a little uneven and wobbly, but with things stored inside, it's not noticeable.", 
    "Very cute and exactly what I wanted but the quality is poor. Holes for shelf supports on one side drilled too large. I had to use a rubber band around the support so it wouldn't fall out. A little out of square so the doors don't close evenly. Paint was off in some places and it had nothing to do with the delivery. I am going to try to touch it up. All in all I can live with it. It looks nice just hope it doesn't fall apart when we move it from where I put it together to the bathroom. Some of the locking nuts didn't lock too well and keep loosening.", 
    "very nice cabinet, and the cabinet gives our beach home a very clean and fresh updated look, it took me a little time to assemble, just be patient, and the outcome will be worth the time.", 
    "This cabinet worked out perfectly for my bathroom which doesn't have any storage in it. The picture illustrated is exactly how it looks. It's a perfect shade of white for my bathroom. It perfectly stores all of your essentials like medicine bottles, lotion, toilet paper, etc. The shelves are a little too small to store towels though. But everything else fits perfectly.", 
    "bought the cabinet for the bathroom to match with bathroom sink arrived in good condition assembling was easy works well to store wash cloth and hand towels", 
    "Purchased this product for our bathroom towels. All the parts and pieces were included with the shipment and took less than an hour to assemble. We are really pleased with this cabinet.", 
    "This cabinet for our new bathroom arrived in just two days and looks great. Not difficult to put together, It is perfectfor our needs. The only problem is that Overstock.com is inundating me with ads to purchase more products, by email and other internet pages, even on my Facebook game pages. I don't know how to stop this, but I won't be buying from them again any time soon."
