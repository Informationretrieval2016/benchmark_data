    "This is a large piece of furniture. Materials are nice. I can't comment on assembly as I took my toddlers out of the house so my husband and a friend could get these done without little hands \"helping\"... A few things to note: there is a gap of maybe three inches between the wall and the mattress. Description says trundle can fit a mattress of 8\" depth HOWEVER - if the bed is on carpet, the frame will sink into the carpet more than the trundle - this means that I cannot slide the 8\" trundle in and out - I actually had to lift the bed frame. I am solving this problem by purchasing bed risers of just about two inches so the trundle can slide easily. In trying to get the trundle out from under the bed, I was pulling on the front piece - not sure how sturdy that is, so don't tug too hard! Overall a very attractive bed.", 
    "This bed looks like it could easily cost $1000 in a store. I was able to get the two boxes to a back bedroom and put together myself in about an hour and a half (carefully taking inventory before starting). The only thing I would note about putting together is that when you install the slats and inserts, don't pop down u til both sides of the slat are inserted. Much easier than popping one side like the instructions say, then trying to maneuver the other side in. We got an 8\" mattress for the top, and I plan on getting a 6\" for the bottom. Using a duvet cover is an easy way to decorate (I found a linen cover with a neat texture so it doesn't just look like a bed with sheets on it). I am extremely happy with this purchase, and so are my (drunk) friends!"
