    "The headboard itself is fine. It is substantial, well made and good quality. I was also able to put it together and set it up on my own. But if you are looking for a light gray as is pictured, this is not that headboard. This is a much darker blue-gray, heavy on the blue. It was not what I was expecting at all.", 
    "the headboard has a 2-3 inch pucker in the fabric in a strategic location on the headboard. It's not awful but not what I would consider great quality", 
    "The color in the picture is not the actual color that you will receive"
