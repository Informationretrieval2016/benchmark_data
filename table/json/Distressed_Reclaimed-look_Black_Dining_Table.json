    "Table is heavy and true to picture. Realize that legs assemble with 2 screws into table only. Thus weight is not supported by the legs underneath which hopefully will not be a problem. Not real wood but a composite overlay.", 
    "The table is beautiful, great quality and adds elegance to a room"
