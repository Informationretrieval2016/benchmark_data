    "I like it a lot because it fits perfectly in my small bathroom. I had been looking for small bathroom cabinets around and this one fits the requirement 100%.", 
    "These cabinets are top quality and added wonderful storage space to our bathroom!", 
    "Simple to put together and looks great in my bathroom for all my spa products. Just the right size.", 
    "I have this item for 2 weeks and the finish is already turning white. Very cheaply made, but I guess that's what you pay for.", 
    "Easy to install. Wish quality could be slightly improved.", 
    "Quality & Value in One Great ServiceRecommend to my family and friend !..", 
    "My daughter has so much make-up accessories so we bought her this cabinet to go over her vanity. The style is fair & would not use in home where guest frequent the area. Be forewarned the screws in the back of cabinet will scratch your walls. I placed \"blue\" tape over screws before mounting.", 
    "It's an okay cabinet for the purpose I intend to use it for. I just needed a dark cabinet (almost black) to mount above the toilet in the master toilet room. The only reason I'm not giving it three stars is because they have hooks on the back to hang it like you'd hang a picture. Really? It's a cabinet that you will be opening and closing. No way will those flimsy hooks hold the cabinet on the wall!! It should be mounted to the wall like any other wall cabinet and they should have designed it for that way. The back is pretty flimsy so I'm not entirely sure we'll be able to mount it to the wall and it will hold. There's really no way to mount it in a manner that will be solid. Hopefully we can figure something out. But I would caution anyone considering buying this cabinet to really think about what you will use it for and if you think two simple flimsy holders will keep the cabinet on the wall with opening and closing the doors.", 
    "Listed as 22\" x 22\" but my unit measure 20 1/8 \"W x 22 1/2\" L. Instructions acceptable but missing one pieces of hardware; fortunately they are standard DIY pieces and I used leftover Ikea parts. Dowel rods too small so used glue.", 
    "This was the worst cabinet ever. My husband was cursing and and about threw the cabinet. I actually just bout it 2 weeks ago and now it is sitting in my garage and I ened up buyin something different. So now I spent 2 x the money. It didnt stay together and it spilt down the back. Awful!", 
    "Very happy with the product..installation was easy, instructions clear and concise.", 
    "I have purchased 4 of these units. Easy to assemble, variety of uses. Use some as medicine cabinets, some as tool storage, and some as DVD cases. Cheap DVD and storage units. Nothing fancy about these ... just plain, well put together and easy to assemble.", 
    "Wshed they made one a couple inches wider for bath towels.", 
    "This cabinet is flimsy. We went to hang it on the wall and the whole that goes over the screw ripped out of the frame. That made it impossible to rehang using the predrilled holes. My husband had to build a frame out of plywood to hang the cabinet. Usually love the products from Overstock but this one is a dud.", 
    "This shelf is a pc of garbage! After mounting it on the wall which isn't the easiest thing. The brackets that are on the back of the unit that hook onto screw to hold it up just ripped off and the shelf fell to the ground. I had to find another way to mount it using a pc of wood and had to nail it to the cabinet. This is a very low quality item so if your looking for something half way decent you should look at a different product!", 
    "I would recommend this cabinet for any small space. I had been looking for a dark wood cabinet to match my vanity and this is it. Most of the cabinets I found in the stores and on line were just too big for my space. It was very easy to put together. Looks really nice in the space. I am totally satisfied with this item.", 
    "This is a very nice wall cabinet, used to put in the bathroom. Not to small and not that big. Perfect for the small bathroom. A little darker than pictured. Still worked out for me.", 
    "This cabinet was a joke. Instructions not clear / Difficult to Put Together and the edges of all press wood pieces crumbled and broke when screws were applied. Do Not Buy this unless you want frustration and anger to be a part of your life. Not worth the money and although we seriously considered returning it * we all know how much trouble that is * we ended up using it in our garage instead of our bathroom. It's hard to be appropriate about this item!", 
    "Great purchase, very happy with quality and color. Very rich expresso, just what I was looking for. Easy to put together. I put together in about 1 hour. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone.", 
    "I bought this cabinet to match my vanity . The color matched exactly. The same cabinet in the store were aleast $30 more and the quality was much better too.", 
    "Probably a decent cabinet once assembled. But the color did not work for me so I returned it.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for a temporary storage place in my bathroom for above my toilet and it worked out perfect. I was expecting it to be more deep brown but it appears more black which actually worked out well with my shower curtain.", 
    "I love the look of this product. Easy to assemble. Really fast shipping. I gave this item a 4 only because there were some minor imperfections in the finish. Some chipping. But overall love it and I am sure that it will provide the much needed storage in my small bathroom."
