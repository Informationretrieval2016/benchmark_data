    "I would cautiously recommend this. It is smaller than I thought, but cute. It is real copper, so it is heavy for it's size. The problem is since it's real copper it has to constantly be cleaned. The good news is ketchup will work as a cleaner. The bad news is it has to be done about every 2 or 3 days. It's too much work for me, but if you just want a gorgeous piece this is it.", 
    "item looks different color on website than out of the box. looked pink but turned out more copper", 
    "EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.. Black defects throughout tea pot, especially around handle and where it attaches. Returning as fast as I opened it. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS..", 
    "Really nice use it a lot", 
    "This item is poor quality. I used it once or twice and it looks years old. The paint is chipping and the metal looks like it is boiling off. This item is lovely and if bought solely for decorative purposes it is worth the money. If it is bought in order to be used as a tea kettle it will very quickly lose its beauty.", 
    "Very good quality solid. Great buy.", 
    "I am so happy with this beautiful and elegant copper tea kettle and for the price - it is one of the best buys that I have made in a very long time! I have always wanted a copper tea kettle they just add that special touch to any kitchen. Not only is it decorative but even the tea seems to taste better - or maybe it's just because I love it so much!!!", 
    "Wonderful tea kettle. Attractive looking. Would purchase again. Only issues: (1) Doesn't whistle when boiling; (2) Handle too hot to pour into cup when boiling; (3)don't fill too high, as it will pour out of teakettle.", 
    "I haven't used this little copper kettle for actual tea, but it does make a beautiful statement on my stove in my rustic Spanish kitchen! I love it and would definitely recommend for decorative purposes. I don't drink tea so I can't comment on that.", 
    "I couldn't be happier with this copper kettle. It is beautiful on my stovetop and seems to be very well constructed. The quality and design are comparable, if not better, than another I was considering at twice the price from a luxury home store. One thing to consider is that it doesn't seem to whistle when the water boils (although for us, this is a benefit.). I would definitely recommend purchasing this and would buy from this manufacturer, Old Dutch, again without hesitation.", 
    "This tea kettle looks nice sitting on stove top. It does not whistle so if you are busy, it is easy to forget that you have it on. The handle will get warm but not overly so. For the look alone it is worth it!"
