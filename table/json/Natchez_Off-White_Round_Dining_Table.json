    "I would have given this table 5 stars if the assembly process had been smoother. There a couple of things you should know about this table. First the table itself is gorgeous. It is somewhat rustic in nature though. The grain of the wood shows through the color and the texture is a little rough. I don't mind because I have very eclectic furniture and I love the texture. If you are looking for something very elegant, this is not the table for you. It comes in three pieces - top, pedestal and base. Overstock sent it by White Glove Delivery, but only so far as to have it delivered into the house, no assembly or unpacking. This is a very heavy piece of furniture. Thankfully, the freight company called Overstock and they upgraded the service once it was delivered so the freight company actually unpacked and assembled the table. The only problem encountered, as with a lot of furniture manufactured overseas, the assembly was a chore. It took over an hour and a half for two very experienced workers to put it together. My husband had to actually drill the bolt holes larger since none of them lined up. It is kind of ridiculous to pay this much money for something that is manufactured like this. I would give the assembly process a 2. That being said, I absolutely love the table. It looks gorgeous in my dining room. I have 8 parson chairs and they fit very comfortably around the table. If you order this table, make sure you have Overstock include assembly in the White Glove Delivery service."
