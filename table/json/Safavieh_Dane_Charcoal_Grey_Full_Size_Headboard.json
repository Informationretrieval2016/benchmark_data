    "We got this headboard for my almost 3 year olds bed, and it's a great size for a kids room. It's not rock hard sturdy, but it's plenty sturdy. I found the color in the picture to be really accurate. Grey is the dominate color with brown tones and the piping is taupe. The legs of the headboard are metal and it's about 23 3/4 inches from the floor to the bottom of the headboard.", 
    "I decided to put this headboard in the nursery and it's perfect!! Great quality, accurate color and well made."
