    "I like that you can have the shelves on either side depending on where you attach one bar - it looks nice and modern but I wish it had a drawer. It was very easy to put together and it is light so easily movable.", 
    "I love the look of this desk. I didn't look closely enough at the size listed online. I was shocked to see how narrow it is. This is a great desk for a laptop, but I was wanting to buy a new desktop, and the desk is just not deep enough to handle that! I'm going to find a way to make it work, because I really love the look of the desk, but my laptop is not going to last much longer.It's very sturdy, and the wood texture is really nice.", 
    "Perfect size for my son's small bedroom...looks very similar to an expensive desk I saw elsewhere. Sturdy and easy to assemble....I deducted one star bcz it had a chemical smell for a week or so.... probably from the stain", 
    "We needed a writing desk to complete our living room, and this fits beautifully! Our living room has the industrial look, with a lot of wood and metal and this desk complements our dark grey couch and dark brown wooden shelves. Worth the buy!! Sturdy, moderately heavy top and side shelves.", 
    "I needed a new, smaller desk for my bedroom. After some research, I landed on the Renate Writing Desk. I'm always a little hesitant when buying furniture without being able to see it in person, but the other user reviews and pictures gave me confidence to pull the trigger. I'm glad I did. This is a beautiful desk that looks much more expensive then it's price. Instructions and were easy to follow and assembly was easy as well. Total setup time = 45 minutes.", 
    "I love the renate writing desk! The rustic theme is exactly what I was looking for in a small space. And it is easy to put together.", 
    "Got this desk for my sons room. I needed something on the smaller side. It is perfect size for a student. Easy to put together, did it myself. Direction easy to follow. Has a nice industrial look to it, solid feel. You won't be disappointed.", 
    "Purchased this for my daughters apartment and its a beautiful accent. She doesnt use as much as she thought she would but is a multipurpose item. Quality for great and was easy to put together", 
    "Ecstatic with the assembled product in our home. The shelves are perfect for our printer and the worktop has a lot of space.", 
    "The desk came in perfect condition. It didn't take my husband long to put it together. It fits perfectly in the space. The weathered wood is pretty. The desk is functional. It is a good fit for us.", 
    "Easy assembly, nice rustic, industrial look and good wood.", 
    "Purchased as gift for my daughter who loves the desk. Beautiful simple piece of furniture. Was easy to assemble and great price.", 
    "I love this desk and was disappointed the larger one wouldn't ship to my area. It was easy to put to gether, very well made and works fine for my needs.", 
    "I live in an apartment just slightly larger than a shoe box, and this desk is just about perfect for it. Most of my work is done on a notebook computer, and a moleskin notebook, and this desk has enough room for that. It's also quite sturdy; it's a bit heaver than it looks, so I'm happy with that. The only drawback to having such a rugged styled desk is that the top isn't really smooth, so using an external computer mouse is much more pleasant with a mouse pad.", 
    "The desk is small for tight spaces, but is still very functional. We had to put it together, but it went pretty quickly, Thank God no missing pieces!", 
    "Given limited space in a city apartment, this desk was perfect, in that it gave me enough room to work (using a laptop & a separate monitor) comfortably, but also didn't take up too much space. I'm not one for putting things together, but this was very easy to put together. The adjustable extensions at the bottom of the legs are great for stabilizing the desk. Very solid product! My best buy on Overstock!", 
    "Loved the color of the wood. Loos very solid. Had to assemble but it is not hard. Had to balance it with some padding in some of the legs, but it worked fine.", 
    "Dual purpose desk/sofa table. Nice rustic design, which goes with mid-century modern and traditional furniture. Easy to assemble", 
    "We love this desk. We bought the bigger one and the smaller version for our home office. They coordinate beautifully with all of the rustic pieces in our home. The wood tone is a warmer brownish grey. These desks have survived several moves and held up perfectly.", 
    "This desk it awesome and unique. Best purchase ever!", 
    "I love the size of this desk and it looks great. I would have given it 5 stars but the color is little off. There was a bluish hue in the wood, it looks great but I was trying to match darker wood pieces in my den. I love the size and look. Perfect for a laptop. Wouldn't get it if you need a lot of desk space.", 
    "Super easy to build, and the quality of the wood feels heavy and nice. No off-gassing (though I've never experienced it with any product anyways).", 
    "Great quality for the price.", 
    "Nice, simple, smaller desk. Just how it was described.", 
    "The desk looks just like it does in the photos. I am quite happy with it.", 
    "Love this desk. Perfect size for where I need it. Sturdy.", 
    "This is the perfect desk for a compact area and if you sont need storage. It seems more of a decorative piece than a functional desk but it works in my area.", 
    "Overall, a nice looking desk and material with a sturdy build. The shape is a little odd, though. The width seems appropriate but the depth (front to back) seems a bit narrow to me, in my humble opinion", 
    "This desk is beautiful and incredibly sturdy.", 
    "Very nice quality, heavy and sturdy. Nice color. Will fit nice in the new computer area.", 
    "Love the Renate Writing Desk. My living room is finally clean of clutter and it makes for a great working space as well as a place to organize mail, etc.", 
    "What a great and sexy looking desk! It's exactly as on pictures, really great quality of material and easy to assemble. Really impressed with it and happy with my purchase", 
    "Perfect! Beautiful piece, great price", 
    "Perfect for small spaces. Very well made and looks expensive.", 
    "I love the look of the desk from afar, but the texture of the top looks and feels cheap, particularly on the greyish model. It wasn't expensive, so I can't expect much. I have the Renate console table with the darker finish, and it's much more attractive. All in all, I'm satisfied.", 
    "Beautiful and sturdy, easy to assemble. Looks much more expensive than it actually was. No complaints.", 
    "Needed a desk for a small room in a corner for not much use through out the year. Basically it's a desk for when my college age daughter visits home from school and for me to put my sewing machine.Pros: Easy to put together. Very sturdy/heavy/decent quality furniture for knockdown. Beautiful gray wash wood. Great size for small places. All wood surfaces which is very nice.Cons: Would have loved a drawer, but knew that before I purchased it. Thought it was a little pricey for the knockdown furniture that it is. Overall, I like the desk. looks great and fits well in the room.", 
    "The desk is sturdy once put together and looks great. The materials are of nice quality and wooden top looks elegant, not cheap. Good small desk.", 
    "Great look, sturdy, nice space. The bolts all fit perfectly, not so much the screws that add stability - much harder to install, and we skipped a few because the holes didn't line up. Definitely need two people for assembly and give yourself 45 minutes.", 
    "This product came super fast, was well packaged and the instructions were clear. The hardware was nicely organized. It took about an hour of my time to assemble. The product is heavy / sturdy and looks great! I would highly recommend this product!"
