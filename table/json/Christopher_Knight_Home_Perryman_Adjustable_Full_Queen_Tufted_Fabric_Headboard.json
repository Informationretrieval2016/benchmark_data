    "Arrived lightening fast. Directions were simple. Needs a little finessing, definitely want to get someone to help. I put it together alone, but would have preferred to have had help, especially when attaching it to the bed frame. Some of the tuftting was a little smashed but looks good with the pillows once the bed is made. Fabric is nice, less cream, more ecru--a nice neutral. The wings are not as deep as thought they would be, but its a unexpected accent. The legs that attach to the bed frame can be adjusted to make the headboard higher or lower, depending on mattress. I really was happy with it, it makes the room look so polished.", 
    "I had been eyeing this headboard for awhile and finally decided to get it. Shipping was insanely fast which made me very happy since I was very excited to get it. The headboard itself looks great. HOWEVER, putting it together is a whole different story. The instructions are absolutely horrible and I'm almost certain I got the wrong package of nails, bolts, etc. I love putting furniture together and I actually follow the manual 100%, but this was ridiculous and I can only assume I had the wrong pieces to put it together. I wanted to order a tufted club chair by the same maker, but after this experience- NO, THANK YOU. Anyway, right now it's just leaning against my bedroom wall. It's really too bad because I love their furniture, but the stress is not worth it.", 
    "If you want the look of a 5 star boutique hotel, buy this! Our bedroom went from drab to FAB!!! It took only an hour to assemble and our bedroom had an instant facelift!", 
    "I am a newby when it comes to putting furniture together - This headboard was a piece of cake! I was even able to attach it to a bed frame with no problems. Looks very elegant and expensive ... my daughter loved it the minute she walked in the room.", 
    "A little complicated to put together. I believe the headboard attaching to the frame is very difficult and I ended up not doing that part. Overall it's a nice inexpensive headboard", 
    "I have a gray quilt, and white furniture (gold accents) this headboard is amazing! You will need one other person to help you. My friend and I put it together in about 30 minutes! The color is an off white color, almost linen looking, and has so much dimension. It looks expensive. I have seen others and read poor reviews, but this was NOT a let down. I am so pleased with this purchase! I would TOTALLY recommend this headboard.", 
    "Fits very nicely for a queen size bed and was easy to put together. You must suppy your own mattress frame.", 
    "I bought this for my guest room. It's very beautiful- my guests said they felt as if they were on vacation in a resort! It ties the room together beautifully! The color is exactly what I was looking for, sort of an off white color (eggshell). It's made more for a queen size mattress, though. I could see how it would look too wide for a full size bed. It was fairly easy to put together and install to the bed frame. Really no complaints. Great deal, can't find these for under $300 in retail stores, at least the ones I've searched through. Thank you Overstock for providing such beautiful furniture at affordable prices.", 
    "Very happy with this item.", 
    "This headboard completed our master bedroom and gave it such a luxurious look. I ordered the beige, which came in a little lighter like a linen, which I actually prefer. It compliments our room beautifully, and looks way more expensive than it was. Highly recommend.", 
    "I love the look of this headboard, but I have a full size mattress. It shows a huge gap on both sides from the edge of the headboard over to the mattress. I wish I would've known...it would really look better with a queen size mattress!", 
    "the headboard came in very quickly very nice product color perfect with room", 
    "I have been searching for a tufted headboard to complete my new bedroom for quite a while. This was an excellent buy! Very well designed so assembly was fairly easy. I put it together myself (I'm recently divorced) even though the instructions says to use two people. It would have been even easier with two, lol. The quality is very nice and the color is true to the picture.", 
    "I love how it looks! Assembly was a pain but nothing too hard, I did it myself but I'm sure it'd be easier with a second pair of hands. Only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it doesn't work with all kinds of frames, didn't work with mine for example. I was upset about that so I just had to lean it against the wall and pray to God it wouldn't fall on my head. Other than that, great product for the price!", 
    "not really adjustable. The back of the frame adjusts to a full/double from a queen, but the wings on the sides do not, so there is about a 6\" gap on each side of the headboard. The fabric is very nice and the assembly was easy.", 
    "Love the headboard. Nice quality. I like that the wingback sides go all the way to the floor. I wish it came in king size!", 
    "Love this Headboard the color is perfect.", 
    "I love overstock it was delivered on time love the product thank you", 
    "Headboard is great and as described. Side panels of headboard used another diamond quilted fabric in smaller scale. We kept the headboard and it looks great but that was a surprise. Would have rather had same fabric for side panels.", 
    "I absolutely LOVE this Christopher Knight Home Perryman Adjustable Full/ Queen Tufted Fabric Headboard.", 
    "Looks nice! For the most part was what I was expecting. My only complaint is that my mattress isn't tall enough to fill the gap where the headboard starts so you can see the wall in the space between my mattress and the bottom of the headboard. Other than that, great headboard & easy to put together.", 
    "Looks pretty from the front, but a mess from behind the headboard. It was a pain to put together. Some of the holes were off, excess fabric were in the way couldn't line up holes. I was disappointed as the headboard did not go with my bedframe.", 
    "This headboard is beautiful. I ordered it in eggshell and it's an off-white linen type fabric that's simply beautiful. It was easy for my husband to put together and looks great in my daughter's room.", 
    "I can't say enough about how much I love this headboard! It is simply gorgeous! I was making my sons old bedroom over into a guest room. I saw this and thought it would fit the bill and it did! I did the room in a lovely light aqua and I found the perfect comforter set in a darker Aqua & White modern chic minimal floral. With the addition of this stunning headboard, the room was complete. We get so many compliments and have been told it looks the like a well appointed designer room from a B&B. I would highly recommend it!", 
    "ordered for full bed, but it was too wide even after adjustment.. so ended up using for queen bed, and it makes room very cosy", 
    "Very pretty - really dresses up room. More of a beige than the off-white I wanted. Couple of places where the tufts tore the material slightly, but overall very nice.", 
    "We wanted to update from a sleigh bed style headboard to an upholstered style. We couldn't be happier. We have a sleep number bed with an adjustable frame so I was a little concerned that would not work, but it's beautiful and everything went together perfectly. Great purchase!", 
    "We wanted something elegant for the quest suite, but didn't want to spend a lot. The bed looks great.", 
    "Looks great in my bedroom. Had it set up for about a year and it still looks brand new", 
    "I received this headboard promptly and it was easy to assemble.Great product, beautiful looking,perfect fit and I recommend it!", 
    "This headboard is exactly what I hoped it would be. Soft and cushy. It was easy to assemble - unpacked, assembled and attached to the bed frame in less than 15 minutes! I ordered the eggshell color which I would say is more like an \"oatmeal\" color. It's a perfect neutral. I loved it so much I'm ordering another one for my other guest room.", 
    "The head board was of exceptional quality. I am ver pleased with this item", 
    "Love the tufted headboard . The headboard was not as low behind the mattress as I had envisioned. However, it looks great with the mattress and foundation I ordered from overstock!", 
    "The headboard arrived in next day despite the holiday! It did require assembly and the directions were not very detailed/clear at all. But, my husband is handy and has a career in construction so he figured it out pretty easily. The headboard is great quality. We've had it up for a couple of months now and we absolutely love it. The cushion makes for nice back support when watching TV or eating in bed. My husband connected it to our platform bed frame with no problem. A perk is that the height is adjustable so you can have your headboard sit as high or low as you want.", 
    "Love this headboard ... The room looks warm and elegant.Easy to ensemble ! Couldn't be happier!!!! Highly recommend", 
    "I have a full bed vs a queen. The headboard is supposed to be adjustable to use with both. Perhaps it was user error, but the slats don't align properly. We literally had to bang it in place.Other than that, I love it!!!", 
    "Really a nice headboard at a very reasonable price", 
    "Didn't fit my queen sized mattress. I like it, just not connected to the bed frame.", 
    "Arrived lightening fast. Directions were simple, all the pieces and hardware were included. Assembly would have been easier with help,however, I put it together alone. A glamorous addition to a boring room.", 
    "Love it . Great quality for the price", 
    "Look good fit nice color great love it", 
    "I liked the style but the fabric is excess at the end near the floor so I had to fold it. I don't like the way that looks plus it's wobbly but it may been put together wrong by my friend because there are leftover screws. I plan on taking it apart and putting it back together to see if something was done wrong, if not I will have to return for a new one.", 
    "I haven't put this in our new home yet but so far it looks great. Good buy for the price.", 
    "Relatively easy to assemble and adjust. Nice details. Great item for the price! Makes the room!", 
    "Love! Makes the bedroom look so elegent! Best purchase ever! Worth the price!", 
    "Shipped quickly and arrived undamaged. The directions were a little confusing but common sense usually works wonders. Definitely recommend two people working on it together. Once up, looks beautiful! We did reuse old washers from previous headboard because it seemed like two more would work best with the small nuts that attach to the bed frame. Other than that, we love it!", 
    "The wings on the sides are underwhelming. They might as well not even be there. The bottom portion of the frame has entirely too much fabric and it just looks cheap.", 
    "I love this headboard. I originally wanted a velvet with nail heads type, but settled on this...and I love it..brings so much glamour to my room! Not hard to install at all..", 
    "I love the eggshell color. At first, i was skeptical about the height because i thought it wasnt that high but when my husband put it up i started to amaze how beautiful is this headboard. I love it. Thanks overstock", 
    "This headboard looks comfortable and chic. It came in good condition - there were some fly away strings that I cut off and one tufted button that was a little smashed, but aside from that it looks great in my bedroom and transforms the whole room. This item is definitely worth it for the price point and the quality. I was hoping it was a little more white that ivory/beige, but I guess it does look \"Eggshell\". All-in-all, I love my new headboard.", 
    "Lovely, classy looking headboard. Some techinical details: As stated in other reviews about this product, the screws sent with the product do not seem to fit the holes in the braces (except the fat screws do fit the middle hole--make sure to put the washer over the hole and then insert the screw...since the other post gets in the way of easily inserting the screw.)", 
    "LOVE THIS HEADBOARD!!!! Looks great! I highly recommend this headboard.", 
    "I really like the headboard! My husband however did not enjoy putting it together. The directions were hard to follow and it really takes two people. Afterwards I am happy though, especially for the price.", 
    "Easy to put together and looks great.", 
    "Bought for spare bedroom. Looks regal.", 
    "Great buy for the money. Looks great.", 
    "This added the perfect look to our bedroom. The color goes so nice with our nautical look.", 
    "I love my headboard. Exactly what I ordered!!!", 
    "Easy to put together. Looks great. Linen-look fabric is perfect neutral.", 
    "Beautiful, well made headboard changes the whole look of our bedroom. Husband put together by himself without any trouble. Color goes with gray or tan walls.", 
    "Headboard arrived without damage, very securely packaged. Was not difficult to put together and only took about an hour. Hardest part was fastening it to the bed frame. Made well and looks more expense.", 
    "Looks more expensive than what I paid, tufting nice and even", 
    "Exactly as described. Looks like it cost more than I paid. It really polishes off the room. I previously purchased another headboard on o.co for the guest room which doesn't come close to the quality of this piece.", 
    "Was very reluctant purchasing--but have bought several items from Overstock and so far have been extremely happy-including this purchase. Headboard arrived quickly-easy to assemble. Color was exactly as depicted. My bed is in front of a window, liked that this is adjustable so my window is not as covered as the higher ones. Tufting is done extremely nice.", 
    "I was going to be ambitious and make a headboard but then found this one on Overstock.com at a reasonable price. It is beautiful and was easy to put together. The eggshell color has hints of silver in it. I love it!", 
    "Nice color and I received it pretty fast", 
    "My husband and I were in the market for an upholstered headboard. We rarely agree on the same thing and to my surprise he agreed with me on this headboard. The great price helped too!We received the headboard within 2 days which was lightning fast. Instructions provided were easy to understand and assembly was painless. You do need two people, though. We love our new headboard!", 
    "It shipped supers fast. nothing wrong with it. Great price!!", 
    "Look is nice. Only reason it's not a 5, the holes for the screws did not line up on one side.", 
    "I ordered this for my guest bedroom and I love it. It looks beautiful in the room.", 
    "Beautiful piece to add to a master bedroom. It looks classy and elegant. It was pretty easy to put together, but didn't come with big enough bolts to fit my frame. The wings were a little confusing, as the fabric hangs lower than expected. Overall a great piece for a good value.", 
    "Satisfied with the quality of the headboard for the price. Not a difficult assembly and was the color I was hoping for. The eggwhite headboard is a dull, off white which is what I was hoping for, instead of a bright white. It has a tweed-ish pattern to it, so it's not just a solid color. Overall very satsified", 
    "It's perfect and well made. Put it in my guest room and it fit my old metal frame perfectly. It reminds me of burlap fabric in a way. Gorgeous!", 
    "I have a sleep number bed so I had to purchase the attachments which have the headboard a little taller than I wanted but overall I love the headboard. Super easy to assemble and it is sturdy. I have it up against the wall so it doesn't move at all. Great Purchase!", 
    "Easy to put together color just right. Love it", 
    "I'm very pleased with this head board it's very sturdy. It also has great material and the holes line up perfectly with my bed frame", 
    "Shipping was fast and it was exactly like the picture. I put it together by myself (laid it out exactly like the instructions show). Very happy.", 
    "Don't hesitate. Assembly not difficult, did it alone. Does not look cheap. Well priced. Would buy it again.", 
    "I love it...it lights my room up...everyone that comes to my wants to know where and how much", 
    "This headboard is really beautiful and can easily be assembled. It looks expensive and the color is great.", 
    "The headboard looks nice but I wasn't impressed with the fabric. Hoped it would have been better quality.", 
    "Screws didn't fit. Cheap looking. Not sturdy for a high bed and lacking place for some screws for a queen bed. Would have returned if not so large.", 
    "I was a little skeptical about buying such a piece on line without seeing the quality in person. I put trust in the reviews I read on this item and was not disappointed. Assembly was not difficult but takes two people about an hour. The fabric is nice quality and well put together. The hardward included is sturdy and well seperated into zip bags. I love the adjustable feature of the headboard. I recently looked at a similar headboard at a leading national import store where the price was $699. This is a very classy piece for a fraction of the cost! I highly recommend.", 
    "Well built, easy to set up, exactly what I wanted...", 
    "This was received 3 days after it was ordered. It looks great and was fairly easy to put together. The instructions were clear and the hardware were in 3 separate bags, all labeled. I would definitely recommend this item!", 
    "Lovely neutral color, glad I found it!", 
    "Received the first headboard and it was missing some of the holes to screw legs to headboard. Costumer service were wonderful!! Picked up the defective one next day and had a new one the day after!!The new one was perfect!!! It is well made and very easy to put together. I am only 5'2\" and was able to handle the job myself. A must have!!", 
    "I was pressed to furnish a guest bedroom in a short amount of time and discovered right away while shopping retail stores that headboards can be very expensive. Took a chance ordering this headboard online and was delighted to see it was exactly the style, color and fabric that I wanted and a great value. Classic details like the wings, tufting and quilting add a bit of elegance and texture and make the room feel special.", 
    "the head board is just what we wanted, looks great and I've had many compliments on it. It was easy to put together", 
    "This headboard was exactly what I was looking for. The image of the product is true. Great focal point to my master bedroom, love the color.", 
    "I ordered this headboard thinking that it looked high end and stylish. I had always wanted a tufted headboard and the wings complete the look. It showed up at my door a week later which was great however I could not use the headboard in the end. During assembly it was easy to add the wings and add the right leg however I noticed that the pre-drilled holes required for the other leg were missing so I had to return the product. In addition, one screw for the leg would not unscrew so Overstock is making a custom box for me so that I can return it and try another headboard. Yes, the headboard is very pretty however low manufactuaring quality is an issue here.", 
    "Headboard was easy to attach to the frame. It shipped securely and arrived on time. I've received so many compliments, and it looks expensive.", 
    "This headboard was very easy to put together and finishes our room perfectly."
