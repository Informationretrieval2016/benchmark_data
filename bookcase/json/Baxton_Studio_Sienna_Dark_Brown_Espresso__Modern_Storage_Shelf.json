    "I as looking for low shelving that would fit under a picture window and this was just the right height. The window is 9ft so I bought 2 and put together which looks great. The color is dark and not much grain to it so don't expect a real wood look. Assembly was easy.", 
    "Shelf looks nice, no broken pieces and went together easily. Looks good for such an inexpensive piece", 
    "I'm a girl and I was able to assemble this bookcase with almost no trouble at all. The parts were all included and easily to implement, Very stylish and in a good size. I dont think it's flimsy at all because it held just fine when i had to flip it around. Happy with this purchase.", 
    "The shelf is a little on the flimsy side. It wobbles easily when you move it, it's not very sturdy and for only being $$$I could have gotten something a little better built at ,,,,,,,,. I do like the way it looks, it's modern and stylish and I wanted something with the height that it has so that is why I bought it. It's good for a light weight flat screen for sure and if you have dvr and modems etc it has perfect structure.", 
    "It fit perfectly as expected", 
    "I like the design of this shelf, but I'm worried about the low quality of the \"wood\" and the finish. I think it scratches easily, so hopefully I can take good care of it. I wouldn't put anything like a cup that sweats on it. Otherwise, it's helping me stay organized with my records and record player.", 
    "A bit more narrow than expected. Should have read measures better!", 
    "Very cheap particle board. The paper topping ripped by just putting it together.", 
    "Daughter loves it, exactly what she was looking for", 
    "I was disappointed that the storage shelf was much smaller than the picture indicates. I wanted to use it as a room divider but it is much too small for that. I would probably be adequate in a small apartment.", 
    "This is okay for a children's room but definitely not for a family room. It is okay but it just seems a bit plain to me. But it will work for children.", 
    "This was fairly easy to put together and is really sturdy and looks great.", 
    "This fit exactly where I needed it to and is the right height to put a glass if you're on the lounger side of our large sectional - where you're reaching over the back of the sofa, not an armrest height section. It was easy to put together alone but does scratch quite easily.", 
    "Perfect divider for my daughter-in-law's office", 
    "Setup instructions were very easy to follow, though it still took me a while. It complements my small living room well. I thought it would be able to better handle the weight of my television, but it has begun to bow a bit on the top shelf. Not sure how much my TV weighs, but it's a 42\"."
