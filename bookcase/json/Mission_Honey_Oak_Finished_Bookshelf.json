    "Smaller than I expected, but works perfectly for extra toy/book storage in my daughter's playroom. Her 27\" smart tv is sitting on top of it, and it is more than sturdy enough to hold the tv and all her \"stuff\"! Great purchase!", 
    "This bookshelf arrived in 10 flats pieces. Easy to put together, easier with 2 people. Took me about 45 min.The actual color is much darker than shown in photo. I would call it more cherry stain color than oak. Not the highest quality, but good value and price.I use this in my son's bedroom for his school books, and organizing his magic card collection.He really likes the bookshelf."
