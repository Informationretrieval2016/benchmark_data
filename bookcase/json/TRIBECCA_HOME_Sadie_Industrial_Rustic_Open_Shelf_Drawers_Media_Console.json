    "It says wood & metal. It all looks and feels like plastic trying to look like metal and wood. Have yet to find any real wood. Hollow and cheap metal. Rather disappointed. I will use it until I replace it with something better that I actually see in person.", 
    "Straight forward assembly although there are a lot of parts. Good looking table, slightly lighter then pictured. The legs are tube steel, so they are not overly sturdy. The top comes fully assembled which saved time. It's also very heavy which makes me wonder how long it will last as the legs are not as sturdy. I wouldn't recommend placing anything to heavy on it. Otherwise it's a good looking piece.", 
    "This TV stand (which we use as more of a bookshelf) is gorgeous. It's not that difficult to put together, and it seems very sturdy. The color is a little more gray than I expected from the picture, but it's not a problem for me. Also, it doesn't feel much like real wood or reclaimed wood, but it looks like it from across the room. And it has a nice style all its own.", 
    "I have a couple of actual pieces of industrial furniture - French Industrial if you will... This looks good in the photo but it's made of plastic - the wood that is. It might be listed in the description but I missed it. Fairly heavy piece. I put it together myself - you also need a drill or phillips head. It ended up behind my sofa because it was big enough to handle the tv in the area I thought I would use it. Too big and heavy to return. Nonetheless it's attractive and functional.", 
    "The reviews on the fake wood almost made me not buy this but its gorgeous! It looks great and is very functional.", 
    "LOVE this piece--set it up in my home office as a printing station. There is nothing flimsy about this piece! Color is pretty true to the picture and the shelves are sturdy. Buy with confidence!", 
    "This console table is perfect for the area we wanted it for. Went together fairly easily and seems to be of decent quality. Overstock to the rescue once again.", 
    "Really cute and seems strong...was missing some pre-drilled holes to complete assembly. Drawers aren't all that smooth either.", 
    "I love this stand! I use it in my office and have all my printers on it! Perfect!", 
    "I have this console as a gift. The recipients said that it was easy to put together and they liked the sturdiness of the TV stand", 
    "I have no concerns with the quality and wood construction of this piece. It's what I expected, and very nice in my opinion for the price. However, I was extremely shocked that this is by all means a GREEN table. The pictures and description are nothing like the actual table in my opinion - - and I was particularly shocked that this is sold in a bundle with other further (which I also purchased) - - and they are not even close to similar pieces / drastically different in color and style.", 
    "Product is inferior in quality with the metal frame insufficient to hold the particle board top which is very heavy so had to reinforce. I should have returned the item but kept and using in a closet for extra storage. I do not recommend this product", 
    "It's missing a part and still haven't received it...", 
    "Love the unit! It is my den and fits perfectly in an odd angle wall.", 
    "I like the look of this unit and it matched my coffee table. I dreaded putting it together-but I did it all by myself! The only bad thing I have to say is it is not that sturdy. The wood is,but the grade of metal they used was not appropriate for the heavy wood. It looks nice-but feels wobbly.", 
    "It's made of some plastic with a picture of wood stamped on it, and the color is strangely green. But it's sturdy and it's the right size, I'm keeping it, I am definitely not in love with it.", 
    "Bought these with the standing open shelves about a month ago and couldn't be happier with them. They give a cool industrial/rustic vibe and they look much more expensive than what you pay for them, compared to similar styles at some big name furniture places. The drawer unit comes preassembled so assembly is largely just putting the frame together. Follow the detailed instructions and there shouldn't be a problem there. The shelves are the somewhat tricky part. If your unit comes with shelves that don't fit into the spaces, you may have to do what we did which is to bend the small metal tabs holding the metal bars in place backwards a smidge. We did this with some pliers, on the backside of the unit. That should give enough wiggle room to push the boards in place. Some loosening of screws may also be required. But once it comes together, it looks great.", 
    "This media console is fabricated from the cheapest possible materials one could use. The weathered wood look is literally a sticker, not even a real veneer. The only positive is being able to set cups on top without worry about leaving a ring, ruining the wood.", 
    "So perfect for our space, love, love, love it!", 
    "We ordered two of these consoles to place side by side as a long television console (and buying two was far less expensive than any other long console we found). The piece looks great, is very sturdy, and was easy to put together. The wood finish is a plastic veneer, but you absolutely cannot tell and makes it super easy to dust/clean. Though some have said the color is off, ours are a warm, grey-washed distressed wood color and was exactly what we were expecting. If you are going for a cool grey, it may not match, but it goes great with our mix of warm wood tones and greys. And they look great as a pair!", 
    "drawers are very shallow and some of the wood is fake. The paper that makes it look like wood was already peeling upon arrival. The piece however fits the style of my decor and I am happy with the overall purchase.", 
    "Easy to assemble and fits with almost any decor.", 
    "I love the look of this piece. It's assembly was a nightmare. After 4 hours and no success trying to beat the alignment of the bottom shelves holes to work, we gave up. The shelf now just rests on the poles and isn't sturdy at all. Pretty disappointed, but waited to long and worked to long on it to send back. Love the look and functionality it has with drawers and amount on space on shelves though. Overall,it will work and no one will notice the bottom shelf isn't attached. ......hopefully.", 
    "After reading the reviews from other customers i wasn't sure if i wanted to purchase this tv stand or not, but im so happy i did, this stand is beautiful the color and it is so well done! It looks great in my family room and i have received many compliments, i don't think it looks greenish like other people were saying not at all, its a great purchase im very happy!", 
    "This piece was easy to put together. It's perfect for small spaces. Lots of storage but doesn't take up a lot of room.", 
    "I bought this to use as a table in my entryway. It looks great! It states it is wood yet it is a look of reclaimed wood with some type of shiny but not real shiny gloss to it. Fortunately for me - this works as I have a plant on it and I am not afraid to spill water as it wipes right off. It only took about 25+ minutes to assemble and done with just me. The instructions are a bit lacking but once you review the picture of how to put it together it is non-stop go in getting it up. So no worries - if I can do it anyone can.", 
    "pieces of item did not fit that needed to be assembled. unuasable", 
    "This was fairly easy to put together, with the help of a trusty hammer to get some of the holes to line up properly. I'm by no means an expert at putting things like this together, but it worked out just fine. It looks lovely in my living room and I appreciate the vintage feel of it.", 
    "Table was not difficult to put together. Product looks good. The top is not real wood, but when you're sitting on the sofa or in a chair, you can not tell what the top looks like. Our 50\" tv is mounted above it and there's plenty of storage for knick-knacks, plus 2 drawers. Great price, good product. Quick shipping.(review by wife)", 
    "I like the simplicity of the console. Allows for media devices space and decorative items too. Perfect for the space beneath my wall mounted TV between the windows.", 
    "We love this piece, it looks beautiful! Couldn't beat the price when we compared other similar pieces with the same construction, components and materials!", 
    "While it's not real wood, it looks nice in the space. It was easy to assemble. I have no complaints.", 
    "made very nice and was very easy to put together. Nice look of rustic design.", 
    "Not the best piece of furniture I've owned. Be sure to check the dimensions, I made the mistake of not and my TV is too large for it. Also super flimsy", 
    "Love this console. Looks really nice and a great value. Definitely recommend.", 
    "This might be the worst purchase I have ever made on Overstock but I don't want to try to ship something this size back. It is cheap feeling and one of the pre-assembled drawers fell apart the 1st time i tried to open it. It is also a very odd color not as pictured. Would not recommend this under any circumstances.", 
    "Did not take long to put together and looks exactly as pictured and looks more expensive than it is.", 
    "The best part about this particular console is that the top piece (with the drawers) is already assembled--woo hoo!", 
    "Nice, sturdy media console with the rustic look I wanted. Putting it together wasn't bad either!", 
    "Love this piece, but it is smaller than I expected.", 
    "Love this piece & it looks really nice. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because we had a little bit of trouble assembling one of the shelves (it was too big for the space allotted for it, but we managed to finally shove it in place without breaking it. Overall, very pleased!", 
    "Great little table for a good price. Sturdy and works great for me", 
    "Goes well with the media towers. Sturdy and fairly easy to assemple", 
    "Good value for your money. Easy to assemble and looks just like the picture.", 
    "We bought this table to put it by our sofa for additional storage. It's not real wood, it doesn't look like real wood, it is a bit greenish like someone else said. If you are looking for a nice piece of furniture, look for something else. If all you need is just some extra storage in the corner of the room, go for it.", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks even better than photo - absolutely love the style and function.", 
    "Carefully packaged, quite easy to assemble, beautiful end look!", 
    "Love the tv stand. Very satisfied with materials used. Easy to put together.", 
    "It met my expectations, sturdy and looks good", 
    "Very nice console. At this price you can't go wrong. It was fairly easy to assemble and looks great", 
    "Very easy to put together", 
    "love love love...i feel good it only took a few minutes to screw together", 
    "Alright, I have woodworking experience, this is a pressboard with a paper veneer. You will need a phillips screwdriver or a power drill to attach the shelves. An allen wrench is included. The hardware on one drawer broke the first time I tried to pull the drawer open. of course this was after I got the unit put together. Debating on if I should take the whole thing apart and send it back I really hate thinking I'm getting a good deal on something only to find out it's China crap, yes, pressed board with a paper finish. The handle is not fixable. Good grief....what a hassle.", 
    "Super easy to assemble and it arrived to my doorstep in 5 days. That's a record in Maine!", 
    "This is definitely not a piece to be used for the focal point of a room. I use mine as a sofa table and love it. It does look a little cheap but fine for what I need.", 
    "We bought this table with hopes of using it as an entry way table; somewhere to put mail, keys, etc, and it works perfectly. It's not quite as big as I was anticipating but that's probably my fault considering the dimensions are listed. It's not very difficult to assemble but the top portion is pretty heavy so you may need two people. Overall this is a great table and I'd highly recommend it!", 
    "I was looking for a tv stand, one that was raised. This is great quality, easy to put together, light and fits well in tight spaces", 
    "Terrible quality. Sent back.", 
    "its a very simple piece and it looks beautiful. I have it in the entryway, and adding a basket or two on the down shelves it just makes this console look rich.And I love the mix of rustic and industrial, its a very modern vibe, yet cozy.", 
    "This TV stand fits perfect in our livingroom. It's very sturdy and has a great country look.", 
    "THIS PIECE OF FURNITURE IS REALLY NICE AND GOOD QUALITY.SOLID", 
    "I love its space and color. I use it in my kitchen for my microwave and coffee maker. I now have more counter space for my small kitchen.", 
    "This was \"ok\" to say the most. I thought it would be more real wood looking, but it ended up looking very cheap, and the particle board it was made of was obvious. Since it was going to a focal piece of the room people would look at while watching TV, I decided to return.", 
    "it looks really good, but the drawers are small !!!!!"
