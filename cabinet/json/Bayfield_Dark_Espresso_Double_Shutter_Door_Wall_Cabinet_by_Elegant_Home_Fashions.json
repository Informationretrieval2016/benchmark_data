    "Wall cabinet was easy to assemble. Looks great above toilet of small guest bathroom.", 
    "This cabinet comes in 11 pieces not including the hardware. Not difficult assembly but more time consuming than I expected and a couple of steps really need two sets of hands. The instructions are are fair to poor. One of the final steps is attaching the doors. Doors come with the hinges already attached. Someone at the factory drilled the hinge holes on the face of the door instead of the side. They caught their error and redrilled and installed them on the side BUT quality control still shipped it with holes on the front of one door. Grrr almost done and find it's defective!!!! Overstock is supposed to send a replacement door. I will update if necessary.", 
    "I was looking for just this size. I purchased a new vanity & wanted a small cabinet that complimented my vanity. This was just great! The one I could have bought that matched my vanity was way too big for the small room. The color is a nice dark color, true espresso. It's a little tricking putting it together. I held it in place while my husband glued each piece & assembled it. Over all very happy!", 
    "Holes don't line up exactly. You will need to improvise. Delivered in a small box. Many pieces. Instructions-good--WHATEVER YOU DO--don't forget Piece #9! In the interest of transporting in small pieces the back panel is split and there is a critical piece that goes in the center (#9). I like the finished product though.", 
    "We like this cabinet, the color is true espresso. It was easy to assemble and the parts were all there. The only problem I have are the doors are a little crooked.", 
    "Great product, super easy to assemble. I had it put together and on the wall in an hour's time.", 
    "Is real espresso / dark chocolate in color, not the reddish brown like some and went perfectly with my travertine and espresso vanity", 
    "Good quality. Looks just like the photo and as described. Perfect for my small bathroom.", 
    "Two front doors misaligned and not able to be fixed. Kept it anyway", 
    "Door didn't fit great but didn't spend a lot of time adjusting", 
    "First of all this thing came in a bazillion pieces and very poor quality! The left side sits lower then the right side and it just looks really cheap for the money I paid!", 
    "Another awesome addition to our bathroom, getting everything ready for the @Jagandco showroom", 
    "Looks amazing in my bathroom every loves it,they can not believe the deal that I got for it and fits perfect for my small bathroom liked a lot", 
    "Ours came with two right-hand doors. Of course, after gluing and screwing together the unit sans doors (per instructions), creating a bracket to mount it (because the hangers are not on 16\" centers, but something like 13 5/8\"), then adding the doors we noticed one had its louvers facing up and the other door had them facing down. The hinges are in machined recesses, and the handle hole is pre-drilled so you would either have to machine new hinge inserts and a new hole on the opposite door and refinish all the machined areas, or get the correct door sent to you from Overstock.com. We are trying that now. Other than that, it is a nicely constructed unit and looks very nice.", 
    "Love this cabinet..so easy to put together, very well made. It was shipped in excellent condition. Loks great in my new decorated bath. Also appreciated the template for hanging.", 
    "So handy to have in my tiny toilet area.", 
    "\"Love this cabinet. It adds a classy touch to the bathroom and has proven to be sturdy and holds alot of items. \"", 
    "I was a little nervous about this cabinet based on what the previous reviews said about putting it together. But all the holes lined up, and the instructions weren't too difficult to understand-you just have to be careful to do all the things in each step. The previous comment about not forgetting part #9 was helpful. It was easier to put together with my husband, so that one of us could hold pieces together while the other put in the screws. The wood looks great, and it looks great hanging over the toilet.", 
    "Size smaller than imagined", 
    "Quick glance, looks nice; closer look, not all pieces line up a as they should.", 
    "Very good for small bathroom. Lots of room for tall items to be stored."
