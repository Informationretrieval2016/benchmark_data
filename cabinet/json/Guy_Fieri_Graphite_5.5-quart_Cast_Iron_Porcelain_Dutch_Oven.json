    "This cast iron Dutch oven is easy to use and easy to clean. The interior enamel finish reduces sticking and makes cleanup easy. The little \"nubs\" in the interior of the lid help collect and condense vapors inside of the pot, thereby keeping everything moist. This Dutch oven easily outperforms a previous one that I owned.", 
    "This Dutch oven is a great addition for my cooking needs. Easy to clean and even temperature make this a must have tool for me in the kitchen. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is the weight. For some people it might be a little heavy to manage. It doesn't bother me but it may be to much for others.", 
    "I love my Dutch oven. It's easy to use and even easier to clean.", 
    "Great size and sharp looking too!", 
    "Well made and finish makes it easy to clean up. Ideal size for roast or main dish meal.", 
    "DO NOT BUY!!! I originally loved this product and was using it every so often for a few months. It seemed to hold up to the heat well and my food came out great! I especially loved the little dots on the lid to help retain moisture in the food. But after the latest use, while browning some chicken on the stovetop (over med-high heat), the dutch oven started making popping noises and sure enough the porcelain on the bottom of the pot started to strip away. I ended up with multiple cracks and even large portions of porcelain breaking off. This completely ruined the pot and I can no longer safely use it without risking additional chips of porcelain contaminating my food. Even worse, though I have only had it for a few short months, there is nothing Overstock or the Food Network will do to repair or replace it. (After multiple phone calls and attempts!) Don't waste your money....buy a dutch oven that is either cheap enough to replace if needed or go with one that has a longer track record of reviews!", 
    "Used the product a few days after delivery. Absolutely love it, beautiful appearance, great heat transfer and retention and easy to clean. What else can I ask for? This oven is substantially heavier than any other I have owned in the past. You won't be disappointed, Tommy", 
    "Its raining today, perfect day to make beef stew or chili in this pot, just got it. Came in great condition and with a recipe from Guy inside. Stove top to Oven NO PROBLEM. Try it you will enjoy it. Yes it's heavy but everything will cook evenly, fall of the bone tender and yummy.", 
    "Used it the day it arrived to make chicken chili. The chili turned out great. Clean up was a breeze. Be sure to ready the enclosed pamplet as you are not to use heat over Medium. Everything cooked perfect due to the conduction of the cast iron.", 
    "Nice color. Heavy duty. Good size.", 
    "The color was so nice compared to most other dutch ovens. I got it for my mother in law, she loves it", 
    "Great purchase. I have looked a long time and actually worn out one Dutch oven. This one is really good quality.", 
    "I really enjoy the even heat in this Dutch oven. I love cooking my stews and chili and not worrying about burning my food. There is something about a cast Iron Pot that makes everything better. Love it.", 
    "Purchased for my mom who was looking to buy another manufacturers product. This Dutch oven half price and works great. She loves it!", 
    "you can pan fry the meat with little oil.", 
    "....got a cast iron pan! Cooked some great things in it already and looks cool on top of that ;-)", 
    "This was a gift for my daughter. She loves it. It cooks well and saves times. I would recommend this product.", 
    "Porcelain chipped after second use .", 
    "Beautiful pot, but very heavy. Cast Iron is heavy of course, but it's almost un liftable for my 120 lb frame. Add a roast and potatoes and I almost tip over. I should have gotten the smaller version. The lid alone is weighty. Work out points for doing dishes."
