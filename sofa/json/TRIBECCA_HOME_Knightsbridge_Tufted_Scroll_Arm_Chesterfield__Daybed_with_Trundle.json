    "U want a 9 inch mattress if u want the decor of buttons to show up on the day bed. 10 inch mattress would partially hide bottom row of buttons. 11 inch would totally hide bottom row of buttons. Hope this is helpful!!!", 
    "The daybed looks nice in pictures but it was made of cheap materials. **** has better quality. I was concerned that someone heavier than me (I'm small) might break the bed. The fabric was not upholstery quality. Very thin. You could see the black felt that was used to covered the other areas when the mattress was in place (I used an 8 inch mattress). When I put the trundle together, it was defective and crooked (I'm pretty handy so it wasn't a problem with correct assembly). I ended up having to return it. I also bought two mattresses from the O to go with this. I opened one when I had the main part assembled. Overstock would not return th open mattress despite their defective product and I hadn't even had the mattress for 24 hours so be careful!", 
    "Easy to assemble however falls apart the screws keep coming out it pops out on one side at the slightest touch very over priced for the quality of both the daybed and trundle", 
    "The daybed looks really good. For the price the quality is just ok. The trundle came with a minor deformation in the part where it has upholstery. The daybed can use more re enforcement to make it solid. One leg is poorly attached.", 
    "A beautiful, sturdy, comfortable daybed. The price is great for the quality of the piece. When a part arrived damaged, arrangements were made to replace it at no cost to me.", 
    "I'm using this for my baby's nursery. It is a great idea for people to sleep in and use the trundle as storage. Then as the baby grows to a toddler I can put another mattress and use as a safety guard if the baby rollers over during the night.", 
    "The daybed was pretty straightforward to assemble. It's functional and comfortable, but the fabric looks stretched across the bed unevenly, making it look cheap. I have serious concerns about the durability of the upholstery. The trundle is functional but there is a gap between the trundle and bed frame, again making it look cheap and poorly constructed. There is a gap on all sides between the mattress and bedframe, despite using a standard twin mattress. If it wasn't so cumbersome to take it apart, I'd probably return it.", 
    "This bed exceeded my expectations for the price. Very easy to put together. We use it as a couch and a bed. Very comfortable and looks great. I use a trundle mattress and it leaves enough room to see the design. You don't want too thick of a mattress if you'd like to enjoy the design", 
    "This is the cheapest crap furniture I have ever seen. Overstock should be ashamed for selling this product. You can buy better quality at *******. The crap wood is so cheap it fell apart before we could even use it. Horrible horrible trash.", 
    "I purchased the grey daybed and absolutely love it! I was a little concerned about my purchase after reading some of the reviews, but could not be happier. For $$$ this is an amazing value. My husband put the day bed together with out any problems. The directions are not the most clear, but he had no issues. The daybed is sturdy and beautiful. I would highly recommend this purchase. A previous reviewer mentioned that the grey is more like a denim grey and is still beautiful.", 
    "easy to assemble, took about 1/2 hour. really beautiful in our guest room. Great value. very happy with this purchase. I personally like a little taller table or a very tall lamp next to this - the arms are high.", 
    "I had serious issue getting a daybed, fist one never shipped then overstock ran out of my original selection. I chose this daybed in linen and was sent the grey instead and it was damaged in transit. After all the trouble I must say the linen one was worth waiting for. It looks very nice in my den and with the striped daybed mattress and throw pillows I also ordered it pulls off the shabby-chic look very nicely. It's lower profile also looks more like a couch and does not overwhelm the room. All in all, my husband and I are very pleased.", 
    "very pleased with this day bed and the ease of assembly", 
    "I was hesitant about ordering this item but finally talked myself into it. I am glad I did. It is exactly what I needed. I needed a stylish couch that could be used as a bed when needed. I did have some problems because I entered the wrong shipping address by mistake but Overstock's customer service managed to help me cancel the order and do a new order to correct the address problem. Lovely item and great customer service.", 
    "My only 2 complaints are that I had to put it together myself (took about an hour with the help of one other person) and the mattresses are not included. Other than that, I love the look, get compliments all the time, have 2 extra sleeping places for guests to be comfortably, it looks like a sitting area by day, and goes with just about any color in the room (I ordered the grey). One of my friends is about to purchase one of his own.", 
    "better then I expected - beautiful and excellent quality! I love it!", 
    "Timely shipping. My son put the bed together.It was too heavy for me, but just fine for him to handle. All the parts were neatly in individual bags. The bed was easy to assemble. It is extremely sturdy and a pretty addition to my guest room. I bought mid grade twin bed mattresses and they fit perfectly. I plan to tuck a coverlet on the top and toss some colorful pillows. .", 
    "This is a gorgeous quality bed for a reasonable price. We bought this for our granddaughers/guest room and could not be happier with the quality!!!!", 
    "I am so happy with this daybed. It was relatively easy to put together but took about an hour but with help it was fine. Great quality and looks beautiful in my small guest bedroom although it is bigger than the picture makes it look! I like that the trundle allows for a nicer quality mattress, I was afraid that the height restriction would force me to get an uncomfortable mattress but it allows for a mattress that is 9 inches high. I am extremely glad I chose this daybed.", 
    "easy to install and great price", 
    "Beautiful. Looks great in my Den.", 
    "Fabric was a little different than the photo, but quality and ease of assembly was great!! Fits my tall tween perfectly! Trundle slides easily!!", 
    "Perfect Daybed, just make sure you buy a thin mattress for top otherwise you ruin look", 
    "We ordered this bed for the guestroom and we're surprised how quickly it came. However, it was delivered with those left arm handles. When I called to get the correct part, I once again received the left arm. Finally, after a month and, we had a whole new couch shipped to us with correct parts. Needless to say, we celebrated the RIGHT arm with dinner and drinks. The couch itself is not bad, comfortable and you do need to purchase two more mattresses to make it complete, so it comes out to be close to 900 bucks. But never again will I purchase furniture from overstock.", 
    "This serves its purpose, but not as comfortable as we had hoped it would be. And make note, it does not come with either mattress.", 
    "Vey Beautiful. Larger than expected. Very Nice piece for my Media Room.", 
    "I didn't realize that it didn't come with a mattress or cushions. I had to buy those in addition to the bed. Now that I do have a mattress, it looks great.", 
    "Not joking, my first review. I always joked that this how my review would start.Anyways, I got the couch, I have a tiny living room so this was not the most logical purchase at the time, however, it worked out perfectly as now my friends and family just like to curl up in the bed and lounge.Relatively easy to put it together, it took me about an hour of manual work.I like the colors.", 
    "Great for the money. Huge. If you're not ready for a twin bed in your space, beware. Easy to assemble. I'm 64 and it only took me about 2 hours to go thru all three boxes and complete assembly.", 
    "The fabric on one side got ripped a bit in shipping which stinks, over all really happy with the look.It gets 4 stars just because the back of the bed isn't reinforced well and so I worry it isn't a item I will have forever, but since the price is decent I guess it's a trade off.", 
    "I am very pleased with this day bed. It adds an elegant touch in my make shift home office. My husband jokes that it is my therapist couch. The price makes it an incredible steak!", 
    "Great Item fits perfect to my livingroom", 
    "I loved this day bed for our office room. It goes perfectly with the room and is very easy to assemble.", 
    "Gorgeous! Updating daughters room and she wanted a daybed, found this and couldn't be happier. She will be able to grow up with this bed.", 
    "I was hesitant to purchase this because of some sketchy reviews but I love it! Rave feedback from guests and my teens and friends are putting this to good use for sleepovers!", 
    "I absolutely love this trundle bed I was so disappointed when I ordered it from kohls and it was cancelled very nice. A must see item when set up.", 
    "Looks great and very easy to put together!", 
    "The items itself is amazing and it was really easy to put together. I did have to order pieces several times as they came either the wrong colors or holes necessary. It looks amazing in my baby's nursery.", 
    "Very nice color, could be more sturdy", 
    "It's VERY Large (requires XL Twin mattresses) and is best suited for an office as opposed to a bedroom. The color is similar to a pair grey jeans, masculine despite the feminine design. The quality is good for the price. I will be returning it due to the size.", 
    "We put together props and furniture for a living. We put it together and my 120 LB Mother sat and it broke. It's impossible to send back - feel totally ripped off.", 
    "I bought this day bed for my son and he love it it fit perfectly in the space", 
    "We had 2 people merely sit on this day bed (not overweight or even large people) and the front board broke. The ends of the daybed slats do not go to the edge, so you can fall down into the daybed on both ends. You also have to be careful because the 2 side panels can lean out at the bottom and in at the top. I wish I could return this.", 
    "This does NOT come with mattresses, as pictured online. I even asked the help desk if it did, and they told me that everything I saw was included. It is not. On the whole, if I had known what it did not have, I am not sure I would have purchased it. Oh, and be prepared, this puppy is HUGE. I am generally thrilled with purchases from Overstock, and this was an unfortunate single experience, although an expensive lesson."
