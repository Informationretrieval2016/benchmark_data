    "i love how it looks in the family room. It keeps everything organized and it has so much room for all my family stuff and mine. It was so easy to set up and the delivery was fast and it arrived in such perfect condition. I love it, so nice to look at and very study materials to create such master piece.", 
    "These shelves are very sturdy. Assembly was relatively easy. I always shy away from furniture that has to be assembled because so often holes to line up or parts are missing. This set of shelves was well thought out by the manufacturer. The holes lined up perfectly and there was more than enough hardware to get them assembled. After getting the shelves built, I was so pleased to see how beautiful this piece of furniture really is. I would recommend this product to anyone.", 
    "This bookshelf is beautiful. The only caveat it's a bear to put together. The directions were wonderful but it was a lengthly process. Once together it's very sturdy and looks great. No nicks or damage as it was packaged very well. Would I do it again yes.", 
    "We love the bookshelf. Fits great in our FL living room. Great look and value.", 
    "Very sturdy, looks good, and a great price.", 
    "Looks like Jonathan Adler. Amazing piece; people think its a designer item", 
    "great bookcase looks wonderful and better then expected, clean lines holds many books and decor : )", 
    "Easy to assemble. Only problem was when a screw head stripped when putting on with included allen wrench. Fortunately it only happened with one and I was able to force it to turn.", 
    "My husband and I love it. It holds so many books. It was very easy to assemble!", 
    "If you are looking for a bookshelf that looks a little different and it much more solid than IKEA and CB2 this is a wonderful choice. I only wish you had the option to adjust the shelves but that is not possible for this unit", 
    "This was a bit of a pain to put together but once it was together it was solid and holds more weight than most shelves.", 
    "This a great bookshelf that adorns my dining area with family pictures and a compact stereo system. Assembly was easy with clear instructions resulting in my husband putting the stand together quickly and easily.I would recommend this bookshelf to others as it is sturdy, decorative and great buy!!!", 
    "Got compliments, but from afar. The quality is not amazing, but gets the job done.", 
    "This was the perfect shelf for my home office. It is great quality and holds tons of books and knick knacks.", 
    "Ok. Looks nice. I'm not a fan of the color of the dark shelving- that part makes it look kind of cheap.... It is a good quality and value.", 
    "After a couple of months with this unit the shelves are bowing due to the weight of our books. Granted, we have a lot of heavy duty cookbooks. But overall the piece looks cheaper than it was. They don't eve bother covering the screws at the top of the shelf - the kind of detail that even Ikea takes into account. The proportions also seem out of whack in person. Look elsewhere.", 
    "This bookcase was just as expected! Clean and modern lines, easy assembly and perfectly displays all of my favorite books and pottery pieces. I am very pleased with yet another Overstock.com purchase!", 
    "Flimsy bookcases are worse than useless. This display or bookcase is solid and will hold many items or books. It 's a handsome addition to my living room. The directions were easy to follow.", 
    "a sleek modern looking shelf that fits perfectly with simple clean lines good quality for the low price assembly was easy but long - had to stack the shelves on top of each other to make sure everything that was glued was secure. could have used another bottle of glue.", 
    "Shipping was a nightmare -- the first package got lost and it took me nearly a month from the time of ordering to finally receive the shelves...not to mention unpleasant stares from UPS at my door questioning the disappearance of the package they supposedly delivered. Very unpleasant experience. Other than that, the shelves are very nice though still have that Ikea-esque feel. You get what you pay for. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. I just hope your package doesn't get lost like mine!", 
    "I use it for a cabinet in my room and it looks awesome! I can fit a lot of my jeans and shirts and my purses undrneath and it's great. Very sturdy shelves and the color is great and it's better than the drawer cabient that I have. The open space makes the room look nice. I like it so much, and it only took me less than 1 hour to assemble all the parts and shipping was fast with no additional cost. I higly recommend it, it can be useful for other things other than just a bookshelf.", 
    "It goes well in my livingroom and very stylish I must say. Easy assembly very sturdy shelfs for all my heavy weight decor. Just perfect and very modern. I highly recommend it.", 
    "This is probably the most disappointing piece of furniture I purchased from O.co, and I bought plenty. Pros: sturdy and stable, nice design and colors, quite large and tall Cons: this shelf does NOT have ANY solid wood nor MDF parts, it's 100% cheap particle board; it feels and looks cheap; I don't feel I got value for my $$ Alll in all, I wish I returned it before I assembled it - would NOT recommend this shelf", 
    "All of the pieces are made of particle board and you have to wood glue a bunch of dowels to the pieces to hold the unit together, together with locking screws. Overall, once completed, it still shifts around and I'm hoping will look ok from far enough away and hoping that it will support the handful of books I plan to place on it! Not a sturdy unit at all. One of my worst purchases from Overstock and it wasn't inexpensive either.", 
    "The design of this book shelf is excellent. My only gripe is the quality of the lamination material."
