    "This is a fantastic piece of furniture. The wood is especially well-constructed and of strong thickness. Also, the varnish is beautiful. Of all the furniture I've gotten from Overstock.com this one required the least construction. However, I do caution buyers to be careful of the instructions. In my first shipment, the main screw that holds the top of the table on screwed through the top of the table. This is due to the washer not being big enough to stop the screw from doing so. To remedy this in my second shipment, I used a larger washer than the materials provided and carefully measured the screw to be sure it would not go through the end tables top again. Overstock.com quickly remedied the problem - as they always do. Their customer service is spectacular and prompt. They sent me a replacement table promptly and paid to have the defective one shipped back. I highly recommend this piece of furniture and I love how it looks. Plus, the construction is very sturdy and makes a great end table / printer stand. Just be careful with the one screw that goes under the tabletop, and everything should be fine for your first (and hopefully only) attempt at assembling the table. I should also mention there was very little assembly involved.", 
    "Usually furniture that needs assembling is done so with cheap bolts and cogs but not this piece. It went together in under 5 minutes and it's rock solid construction! I was impressed with the simplicity of the assembly mechanism and how tight it held the joints together. I can tell this piece will last a lifetime and it looks great in our living room as a side table.", 
    "This is the ideal piece for an HP 6700 printer. It is classic, elegant, suitable for both home and office, great with antique and contemporary. I placed it beside my 40's-period roll-down desk and it looks just perfect. The extra storage space is a plus for keeping reams of paper or other. The crafting is excellent and the parts easy to assemble. Definitely a good choice, also for its price on Overstock.com. The same item is offered at a higher price on different prices.", 
    "This was absolutely the easiest piece of furniture we have ever put together and we had done quite a few. It maybe took 20 minutes, including the unpacking. The mission style went perfect with our existing entertainment cabinet. Would highly recommend this table.", 
    "Great product. Looks fabulous in my office. Very solid and incredibly reasonable price. Was able to put together in less than 5 minutes! I'd highly recommend it.", 
    "perfect match for the corner TV cabinet I purchased from Overstock. I'm very happy with both pieces", 
    "I purchased both the Print Stand/Cabinet end table and the matching Laptop desk. The product is good looking and well designed. The problem is the furniture give off a very strong toxic odor that has not disapated after more than three weeks. The furniture is made in China and with no real health regulation one has no idea what is in the plywood, glues or finishes. I do not recommend that you purchase this product. It now sits in my garage.", 
    "extremely easy to put together, just remember to use included washers to attach top, otherwise bolt will push through the top piece.", 
    "goes well with the matching desk", 
    "It nicely matches the mission laptop desk. It's a little small and has limited storage space, but does the job and looks attractive.", 
    "The end table is sturdy and quite attractive. Only drawback is having to construct the end tables yourself.", 
    "Nice, solid piece of furniture that's super-easy to assemble. My only complaint is that the door can't be switched to open with the hinges on the left.", 
    "Solid furniture is always best but for flat pack this is a well made piece.", 
    "BOUGHT THE MATCHING CABINET AFTER I SAW WHAT GREAT QUALITYTHE MISSION LAPTOP DESK IS", 
    "Color of wood is rich and lovely. Holds several reams of paper and other items. Is quite deep and narrow so items must be carefully placed to utilize the room inside. It was difficult to assemble--not quite lined up properly and took a lot of adjusting.", 
    "Item arrived very fast. Packaging was great, no damage. Was very easy to put together. Table was of good quality for the price, better than most tables for that price level. It was for my husband's media room and just needed something to fit in a small corner. It worked perfect, he liked it, so now everyone is a happy camper. If you want a decent looking little table, buy it, you\"ll like it too.", 
    "I was very pleased with the quality of this cabinet. It is very well made and easy to assemble. A great piece of furniture for the price.", 
    "I bought this as an end table and it is very well constructed and easy to assemble. There is ample storage space inside. It is all wood and has high quality hardware.", 
    "Easy to assemble and perfect for holding my printer and printer supplies (as well as a few office supplies) color blends nicely with existing furniture. I could not get one of the bolts connecting the top to the frame to actually connect. However, it makes no difference for my use since I just put the table it in place and put the printer on it. The single bolt holding the top on is more than sufficient. The printer stand is very substantial and well built.", 
    "This cabinet is high quality and matches the Mission desk I bought perfectly. It came without any scratches or dents or missing parts. It's easy to put together to a point. The bolts that secure the top to the stand are tiny and it's almost impossible to screw this bolt to the top. I could not do it the way the instructions read. I had to turn the whole cabinet over and try to secure it upside down. It would probably have been easier if I had a second person to help. However once everything was put together it is very nice looking and appears to be a piece of furniture rather than a box you put together. I would definitely recommend it.", 
    "Bought this piece to go with the matching mission desk. The two are a perfect match. The original piece came with all the pieces loosely packaged, and was ALL banged up and scratched! Overstock quickly rectified the issue by sending out another one. The new one came extremely well packaged and protected; making it obvious that the original order was a return. All that aside, this is one solid stand! It is ingeniously constructed, and a cinch to assemble. Provided it comes in its original package, you will not be disappointed!", 
    "really nive peice of furntuer, liked it very much.", 
    "It wasn't as easy to assemble as others had led me to believe. We had to do a little of bending the fasteners on one side to get it to fit properly. But it matches well with our othr mission piece and my husband is very happy with the quality.", 
    "I ordered one a month go to use for printer stand..I liked the style and color so ordered a second to use for an end table. The Mission look is perfect for my style and assembly was very easy. Only small complaint is the interior latch ..could be a bit better quality, it takes some pulling to open door. Nice interior shelf for storing a variety of items.", 
    "The end table was a nice addition to my den and compliments a Mission style side table that I also purchased through Overstock.com The end table was very easy to put together and took roughly 5 minutes to assemble."
