    "First table came with large scratches in top. After two weeks and many phone calls with emails, someone at Overstock got the ball rolling to replace the table. Poor service, I almost had to dispute it with my credit card company.", 
    "The Briggs Table is exactly the product desired. It is an extraordinarily handsome table with a beautiful appearance that rivals similar models costing two to three times as much. Assembly was not only quick and easy but convinced me that I had a product with high quality fabrication as well. - Supurb buy!.", 
    "A very sturdy made table with a great finish. You will not be disappointed.", 
    "Looks like it came from a very high end furniture store; love it!", 
    "gorgeous to look at and well made", 
    "The table was relatively easy to assemble, all parts were there. The table is very pretty and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a lovely small table."
