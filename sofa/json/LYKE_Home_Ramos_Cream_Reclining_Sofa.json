    "Not bad for the price, you get what you pay for. If I had to pay retail for this, I'd be pretty disappointed. Not very sturdy, when we try to move it, the top piece comes off sometimes, but it just clicks right back in. Only major complaint is the back of the couch looks cheap. We had to put a decorative chest behind it to hide the back. If you're using it up against a wall, then it's not a big deal. Comfortable. Color is a little darker than pictured, not nearly as bright/creamy, almost has more of a yellow tone to it, but this could vary depending on color of the room."
