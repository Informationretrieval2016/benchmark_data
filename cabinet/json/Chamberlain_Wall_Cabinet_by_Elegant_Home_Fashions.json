    "I brought the cabinet for my bathroom. It make my bathroom look very elegant. It has plenty of storage room and does not take up a lot of space. I have all my perfume bottles displayed in it and it looks so beautiful. it took the drab out of my bathroom. I also brought the chamberlain floor cabinet. I just love both of them. They were easy to assemble.", 
    "As this cabinet was advertised for the bathroom that is exactly where I was using them. I purchase 3 more from the same group. Were not hard to put together except if you loose or break one of the little silver circle locking pieces. You get exactly what you need no more. Looked great after assembly and fit just like I wanted them to. I did feel uncomfortable about the wall mounting system they had for this item so I was going to reinforce it with more screws. Really not sure I want to take the time now. The front of this cabinet is loosing it's finish. Even though I kept it cleaned and dusted with Old English. Now the dust cloths nags and pulls off more of the finish. Attempted to use a swifter but even that snags on the face of the wood doors. The lamination around the doors on the other three cabinets is bubbling and lifting off the face of the cabinet. Nice looking cabinets but after 3 months of use in bathroom not looking so good any more. Probably would hold up better if NOT used in bathroom. I should have stuck with Teak or Bamboo. No I do not recommend this item or any of the items in this group for use in bathroom.", 
    "Put this my new bathroom and get tons of compliments on it - Purchased it with a matching tower shelving unit after changing out our old bathroom vanity for pedestal sink. It looks updated but goes really well with vintage style accessories and bronze faucet and mirror. It has a really nice wood grain on all visual sides. It was a little smaller than I anticipated because I didn't read the dimensions before I ordered, but leaves plenty of room for necessities, face creams, perfumes, q-tips, cotton balls, etc. Easy to put together and comes with built in hangers but I screwed it to the studs just in case. Only complaint is the pegs the adjustable shelves sit on tend to fall out easily, going to swap those out at the hardware store for a type that stays put.", 
    "it was easy to put together, nice quality. good instructions", 
    "we have been looking for a piece like this for our powder room. We received the product promptly and are satisfied with the purchase", 
    "It is easy to put together. Looks decent but I don't know how long it will last. Make with very! very inexpensive materials but for the money....it's ok.", 
    "This was a gift for someone and they love it.", 
    "Love this little cabinet for displaying knick knacks. We'll made and attractive. Great value for the price.", 
    "I bought this for my bathroom to display antique apothecary jars,and a collection of antique potty figurines. It is sturdy, great looking and easy to clean. It is a heavy, well built cabinet and my collection looks wonderful in it!", 
    "The cabinet comes well packaged and the instructions are well done, the woods is nice and of good quality. I'm Happy.", 
    "Very nice for the price. It went together pretty well except for the round thingys that hook on to these rod things. It took about 11/2 hours. When we went to hang it on the wall the the plastic screw anchors went right through the wall and fell down behind the wallboard because they had no lip to hold against the wall. We went to Walmart and got new screws and anchors and hung it up. Looks good in a spare bedroom to hold little knick knacks.", 
    "came as shown with easy installation", 
    "The plastic cams do not hold this piece together properly. One night...a couple months after installing the cabinet (as directed) adding only a minimal amount of items (under recommended weight) ...we heard a loud crash. It had fallen apart. Part of the cabinet hung on the wall, and the rest lay on the floor. It's nice to look at. Looked great on the wall. Poorly constructed. I recommend reinforcing it with wood screws or something. Those cams are not safe!", 
    "Easy to install. One nit is that the back panel divider seam was omitted from mine so I had to use tape on the back and glue. Also the stickers peel off and bring the finish with them. But nice looking and solid enough.", 
    "exactly as pictured on site and was not too difficult to assemble using picture guide, and was very pleased with amount of storage it provided - easy to hang on wall", 
    "nice style, dimensions were off, very short, but verall it comes in hand y for extra storage space, its very pricey, should be lower", 
    "This cabinet is exactly what I had been looking for and I am completely happy with the construction and it cost less than half of what I found locally. It was delivered promptly and assembling was easy. Very happy overall.", 
    "We are very happy with this cabinet, it is good quality, the color is a darker oak rather than the usual light oak.", 
    "Very nice sturdy cabinet that matched the tall linen tower nicely.", 
    "This was EXACTLY what I had been searching for. Assembly was quick and easy. I'm completely pleased with this purchase for my needs. This is my third time to buy \"furniture\" type items from Overstock...I've always been completely satisfied.", 
    "Good quality. Exactly what needed. Would buy from Overstock again in the future.", 
    "This is another product, better than expected from the description. It was easy to assemble. Putting up on the wall was a bit to challenge as it is WOOD plus GLASSES. Once it is one the wall, I come to like it much more than just looking at the single product on line.", 
    "Took more time than expected to assemble. The door alignment was perfect, with even gaps all around and only a narrow one between doors. At this price/quality you would not expect it to be so true.", 
    "I was looking for something like this to put on our guest bathroom. The color matches our vanity perfectly and is roomy enough for all the nicknacks that usually goes in a guest bathroom. Happy with this purchase.", 
    "That the received order was not the completed item but an unassembled box of parts was a bad surprise for me. It is recommended that Overstock emblazon on the picture in red letters the notice. UNASSEMBLED. Then provide an estimate of the number of hours required for the average person with no particular skills to assemble.",
