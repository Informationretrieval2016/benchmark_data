    "I needed this to fill in a blank space in my kitchen. It looks very nice although the quality is not great. The panels on the back are flimsy, but luckily once they are put on you don't bother with them. It fit my needs.", 
    "This product looks bigger in the product image - hard to get a feel for its actual size... Upon assembly, realized it's fairly small. Also - one of the doors won't stay closed because the shelf is a hair too long, and there is no adjustment in the magnetic catch.", 
    "Looks super nice and it added tons of storage added to my bathroom!", 
    "Very cute and stylish. Gave me extra space needed and went with bathroom vanity", 
    "This item is very good for my needs, but the quality is not the best I found in Overstock.com.", 
    "Really like the Bayfield Floor Cabinet. It fit just where I wanted it in my guest bathroom to hold cleaning supplies, etc. It was easy to assemble and the finish matched the existing cabinetry in the room really well. Very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "This was exactly what I wanted. My husband commented on how easy it was to put together and well packaged for shipment.", 
    "Nice except one of the magnetic closures doesn't catch.", 
    "I had finally got my husband to put it together and the holes were to large for the screws on the right side at the bottom a lock nut was suppose to meet a screw and the hole was to large to hold the screw!", 
    "Item smaller than imagined", 
    "This cabinet fits perfectly in my small bathroom. It looks great and storage capacity for towels and other bathroom items that can be hidden away. The directions are tricky though.", 
    "I needed a medium size hanging towel cabinet out by the pool....and thinking outside the box....we removed the 3\" legs and now have the hanging cabinet we couldn't quite find anywhere.", 
    "I like this cabinet. The color and size is good for our bathroom. The sticker covers for the screw holes are not awesome. But other than that it looks nice and is functional.", 
    "This cabinet came in pieces so it needed to be put together, it was pretty straight forward..I didn't run into any trouble. I've put other furniture together and have had some issues but this piece was easy. Once it was together I really liked it, not cheap looking, sturdy and fit my space that I had purchased it for. I would have given it 5 stars except I think there should have been clue included. I like the extra strength of glue.", 
    "I am so happy with this purchase, it fits in to hold additional items in a guest bedroom. Nice construction, I like the espresso color. I can use it in other areas as needed.", 
    "I am actually using this as a media stand in my small condo. Looks very nice and the depth is just write for my modem. I feel like the quality is good. There were A LOT of pieces to put together so I paid someone to do it.", 
    "Poor quality, workmanship, rickety . Reticent to buy related items."
