    "The first order had a board with the screws for the feet that would not fits. We ordered a second board and asked for the screws. They sent the board and it was still off. We even went to Lowes to try to find a screw that would work. No luck. We are going to have to figure a way to drill our own hole because I'm not sending that big sucker back, and I don't want another defective board. Something is wrong with quality control. I will say that Overstock is refunding us 20%, but I don't think I will order again.", 
    "I was initially skeptical about the quality of this shoe closet. I searched for many days for one that was sturdy, looked good and had enough space for our shoes. The clean lines and modern look makes our foyer look more updated. The adjustable shelves allow us to make room for our booties. and we were able to fit about 23 pairs of shoes, sneakers and sandals (shoes size:9 women and 9 men) My partner had the patience to \"read\" the instructions (all diagrams) and put it together with some help from me."
