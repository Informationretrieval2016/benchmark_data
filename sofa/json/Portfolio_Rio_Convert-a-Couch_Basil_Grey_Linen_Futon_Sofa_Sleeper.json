    "After looking for inexpensive sofas for our basement, I found this one and am happy I bought it. The frame is steel, not wood and the length is nice and long for my hubby and others to stretch out on without their feet hitting the arm. My husband is 6 ft. The cushion is not too soft or too firm, and can be pulled out for sleeping. We love the color (dark charcoal) so it won't show dirt. We did not want to spend a lot on a basement sofa, and this fit the bill for length and construction. Bonus was two toss pillows with zippers that can come off to wash. Would have given a 5 star if the cover for the actual seat part could come off to wash. Also, wish they would sell replacement sofa covers in case needed in the future. Overall, worth it, stylish and fits right in.", 
    "Easy to assemble, great support, nice extra bed. IF you make the mistake I did and mistakenly click the SEAT where the BACK should have been (DUH!), there is a release pin on the inside of the lever. Pry the lever open with a knife, and that releases the \"click\" and you can swap out the seat and back to their proper position.", 
    "We needed a sleeper couch to put in our small office for holiday visitors. I really liked the look of this on online, and because this came in a box, I knew we could get it up our narrow stairs to the office. It was easy to assemble and looks great. I like the texture on the gray linen. It does not look like a traditional, dorm-room type futon, and works as a stylish couch in our office when we don't have guests. While my guest stated that she slept very comfortably, there was a small gap in the center where the two cushions should meet when used as a bed. This is the only flaw with this futon, and I'm not sure how to solve it. I might try to use a mattress cover under the sheets the next time we have guests.", 
    "It was easy to put together. I did it by myself in about 20 minutes. The directions are a little hard to read, but if you take a minute to think about how a couch is supposed to look it's simple. It has two \"sit up\" settings which is nice. One is a little reclined and the other just like a normal couch, vertical. The pillows are really nice as well. The color is pretty accurate; I like it better in person. It looks nice with lighter greens and blues, or darker blacks and grays. Definitely a great \"futon\".", 
    "We liked the color of charcoal gray better in person than the picture on line. We have to disagree about the 30 minute time frame in putting the couch together. The first few directions and pictures were clear. But when it came to \"clicking\" the bottom piece of the frame to each side, it wasn't clear where to \"click it\". The mechanism moves in different directions. There was no picture showing where to \"click it\" in the mechanism. That added 20-30 minutes trying to interpret what we were suppose to do. The couch is comfortable to sit on. I haven't slept on it yet but I assume it will be comfortable", 
    "Overall a nice sleeper sofa. Took less than an hour to put together by myself. it is easy to make into sleeper. Still have some wrinkles in the material from the box.", 
    "Instructions were easy interpret. Very comfortable to sit on and lay on.", 
    "Ordered this for a rental unit and it is just perfect Surprisingly comfortable", 
    "Very satisfied with quality of this piece. Little difficult to assemble but all in all a great buy.", 
    "I never buy these type of items on-line because I'm always afraid that they will not be comfortable. To my surprise, I love this couch!!! It is very comfortable because it adjusts. It's also very easy to convert for the couch to the bed. It's a so easy, my children can do it. I would highly recommend this product and would buy another one if I ever needed a second one.", 
    "I ordered this as a spare bed for guests (when our guest room is already occupied). It's in a room I use as an office and craft room and I keep it as a couch when nobody needs it. It came in a very heavy box that I cut apart and brought in the pieces one at a time. I was able to put the whole thing together all by myself with no troubles in about an hour. It's firm, easy to convert from couch to sleeper, and good-looking. And all for a great price! Very happy with my decision to purchase this and my brother likes it much more than the air mattress he used to sleep on!!", 
    "This sofa is very comfortable. Assembly did not take too long. I was amazed how a box of parts could look so good when all was said and done. We did have to use a rubber mallet to correctly secure one side of the locking hinges. No problem though. For the price this is a wonderful sofa and will be using it soon as a bed for a visitor. Another factor is that I have bad knees and the height of this sofa is just right for getting up and down. Overstock has never let me down on. Now looking forward to receiving an area rug I purchased.", 
    "We bought this sofa for our basement to fold down when my parents come to visit. For the price we weren't expecting a piece of furniture to last 10 years with regular use. We use is sparingly and have told our kids that this is a couch we do not jump on. The assembly was fairly easy with the exception that on of the side rail pieces (the back one's) hardware was bent. I was able to bang it into place. It occasionally slips out of place when the sofa is in the upright position. The couch as a bed is decently comfortable. We put a memory foam topper on it when my parents visit because my mom is picky but I've napped on it as is and have had some good solid slumbers. I wouldn't recommend this as a full time sofa or bed (especially if you have children), but if it's going to see sporadic usage it should hold up just fine.", 
    "easy to assemble-arrived on time-the color is slightly more green than i expected-very comfortable both as a sofa and a bed", 
    "It's very comfortable and it looks great. It really doesn't look like a futon couch at all and I'm happy about that. Much better than I expected. However, the instructions could use some instructions. In fairness there is a help line but I don't seem to assemble furniture during their work hours ( M-F 8am -4:30pm CST). Many nice line drawings but they aren't helping me figure out why the left side of part D keeps disconnecting. When that gets solved I'll be a very happy customer.", 
    "This couch is so bad I would be lucky to sell it a yard sale for $50.00 ! I will never purchase from this company again. Very disappointed", 
    "This couch is ok. I was in need a quick fix to add extra sleeping spots. I won't order a large piece of furniture sight unseen again. The tracks don't want to stay in place and if it wasn't such a hassle to return it, I would.", 
    "Easy assembly and nice color", 
    "I decided to purchase this futon for our family game room. It looks great and is very comfortable.", 
    "We love this, super easy to put together, was bought for a guest house. Comfortable and will be ordering 2 more for play room", 
    "I spent a lot of time online looking for a sleeper. My wife is a huge Overstock fan, so I spent a lot of time on Overstock rummaging through their HUGE selection and settled on this sleeper. Delivery was quick and assembly was surprizingly easy. Design is good, sofa is sturdy, covering is nice, and it is very comfortable. I always have low expectations, so I'm more than pleased that this sleeper is just plain excellent.", 
    "the sofa was delivered by one UPS deliverer and the box arrived all broken apart, I haven't checked the contents yet, I might have to return it"
