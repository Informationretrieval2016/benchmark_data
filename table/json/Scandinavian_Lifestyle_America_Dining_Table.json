    "This poor table traveled from Scandinavia to Utah to Connecticut in a thin cardboard flat box with hardly any protection for the table edges. The box had completely been taped back together with small clear strips of tape before it was sent to me - and not by UPS. Not sure it the re-taping happened enroute to Overstock, or at the Overstock warehouse. I presumed the inside of the box would have had sufficient support for the table, otherwise why would Overstock send it on to me? Sad to say, when I opened the box I found many indentations along the edges of the table, and one corner was fully smashed. Overstock did not name the wood species - it is solid wood, no veneer, but is a very soft wood with knots resembling pine. Shame on Overstock for sending out a box in that condition!"
