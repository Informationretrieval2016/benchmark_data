    "I've been using these for about 6 weeks, and they really are a great value. Conduct heat well, don't feel flimsy or cheap, and they look great. I just use some Bar Keeper's Friend on them when I wash, and they've stayed shiny and new-looking so far.", 
    "After one use, the cookware had heat stains on the inside. These are definately not non-stick pans and they require a lot of special care. Bar Keeper's Friend will take off the stains...so far. Read up on stainless steel cookware before making the commitment to taking care of them.", 
    "love the way they look over my stove and the way they clean up and not sticking or having something else with your food Teflon is good but it comes off after a while and gets in your food", 
    "This a best set I ever had I love cooking in my new set and most of all my food doesn't stick at the bottom. And the price for this product was very good!", 
    "I like the look of this cookware, however, food really seems to stick to it when cooking. I have tried using more ollive oil, and it helps a little, but there is alot more food stuck to the pan than with my previous cookware. I am still getting used to it, tho.", 
    "KOHLS PRICE MUCH HIGHER FOR THE SAME SET!!! STOCK POT NOT INCLUDED BUT I KNOW IT WON'T BE 100'00 , Thank you overstock!!!", 
    "As a person who is becoming more and more health conscious, it was very important to change my cookware from nonstick products to stainless steel. The stainless steal cookware was not only pleasing on the eyes but very worthy of the meals I prepare for my family. In addition, the cleanup wasn't bad. I'm still patting myself on the back for making such a wise decision.", 
    "I am an old lady but this is my first matched set of pans. The pans don't clean up as easily as some of the coated ones do but give a better sear on meats. They cook evenly and I would buy them again as I love the weight of them. Excellent buy in my estimation.", 
    "Arrived just fine. Quality product", 
    "You cannot go wrong with this set.", 
    "Cheap looking. Sent them back.", 
    "My mother has been wanting a stainless steel pot set for ever so for Christmas I got her this and she loves it it's well worth the Money cooks great cleans up well and is just as good as other pricey ones", 
    "The Christmas gift to my Son and his family was the biggest hit!!! Beautiful and top quality.", 
    "For the price is ok!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "sturdy and cleans up so nice it was just as I wanted", 
    "Christmas gift to my Son and his Family", 
    "This set is heavy gauge and heats very quickly and evenly. My old set of cookware did not make proper contact with the flat surface of my stove top and therefore heated very inefficiently. These pots and pans conduct heat quickly and my cook times have decreased. Water boils in half the time it took before. The handles and lids are very well made. I'm very pleased with this purchase. They are also an attractive addition to my kitchen.", 
    "Very happy with the quality of these pans.", 
    "I have loved this set of cookware. I have followed the suggestions of cooking on lower heat with them and nothing burns! So happy I bought this set.", 
    "My son in law will love it", 
    "This is a great set of stainless pots & pans for the price. The steel feels a little thin, but they do a fantastic job cooking my food. They heat up evenly and the handles don't get too hot. I really enjoy cooking with these.", 
    "Now that I know how to cook with stainless cookware. I am so excited to have this set.", 
    "my granddaughter loved it!", 
    "This is a really nice of pots w/lids. Heavy and easy to clean!", 
    "This cookware is beautiful, it is heavy duty. Make sure to follow the directions and cook only on medium heat, it will cook everything beautifully. It also cleans up well.", 
    "Good value for the price.", 
    "Gave this to my son for a gift. He uses it and seems to be pleased with it.", 
    "I bought this for my daughter. She was blown away by this nice cookware, and I didn't spend a ton.", 
    "Bought this for the household for a Christmas present for the house last year . . . LOVE it, AND, the price is right! Win-Win! :)", 
    "Purchased for my son. I've had this set for 10 years. Cooks evenly, cleans easily. Sane purchase for everyday cooks who should get away from non stick cookware. A great buy at this price.", 
    "VERY nice set of pots and pans.", 
    "Just the best pans. Clean up beautifully. I love that you can stick them in the oven without worrying about handles or knobs getting ruined.", 
    "Still have three years later and in great condition!", 
    "I've been using these for a couple of weeks and I am very impressed. At first when I unpacked the box I was expecting heavier, thicker metal. They are excellent and I would buy them again. I don't agree with other reviews stating they are hard to clean, they are very easy to clean, surprisingly easy.", 
    "Who knew that Cuisinart cookware would be as great as their other products? I bought this set for my son when he moved into an apartment and I am sorry that I didn't keep these for myself and give him my old cookware set!", 
    "A great set of pots and pans. Look great cook well; clean easily.", 
    "Very nice. Good purchase.", 
    "Beautiful set, high performing pots. Be sure to use medium heat and no higher, otherwise the pot gets too hot and food will stick.", 
    "They were just what I was looking for at a great price.", 
    "These were all part of her Christmas present, they were perfect!", 
    "I love this cookware...excellent price and very good quality. Follow instructions (and advice of other reviewers) and start with LOW heat. Cooking with stainless steel takes a little more time but is well worth it!", 
    "Just received them and so far very happy", 
    "I bought this as a starter set for my daughter as she sets out on her married life!She raves about the set every time she talks to me. I think this will serve her well for many years.It's not AllClad (!), but it is a nice starter set!!!!!!", 
    "This cookware is the best value for the money and well-worth the investment. The well-crafted pots and pans allow for even cooking and the food retains its flavor. In fact, this set was so nice, we bought another just like it for my mom.", 
    "water stains the inside of the pots...they are serviceable pots, but not the kind of quality you've come to expect from Cuisinart", 
    "Great for cooking on gas. And has been easy to clean and maintain.", 
    "Love them! I cook a lot , easy to keep looking like new. Lid top you have to use a hot pad, handle stays cool. Really happy", 
    "This is the best online purchase I've made... I bought this set for my father, and he said the quality is better than sets he has bought in the past. He has always purchased top quality and higher price mark. I will definitely purchase from Overstock again..", 
    "If you're looking for a cheaper hut good quality set, this is it. I have only been using it for a week but it seems to hold up. It feels thin and cheap but it is not. It cooks evenly and heats up very well if you're boiling water. The handles and lids seem to be holding up well. The stainless is very pretty in my kitchen.", 
    "it's just what I was expecting...................................................................................", 
    "I read reviews on this product from all sources. It is a great set and can be added to. Overstocked had this at my door in just a few days. It made it so easy to purchase for Christmas.", 
    "After using this cookware for 3 months now, I can honestly say I DON'T LIKE IT. There. Everything sticks, and it's a pain to clean. PROS: It looked great out of the box, it's sturdy, and should last a long time. CONS: Stains easily, will not come clean unless you use a scrubby soap pad, and even then it takes a lot of elbow grease. I seasoned these prior to the first use, and I still have issues with food sticking. If I could return these, I would.", 
    "It's a complete set of Cuisinart cookware that should sum it up.", 
    "This cookware is an excellent value. My daughter needed cookware starter kit for her new apartment, this set everything one would need to set up a new kitchen and more.", 
    "Bought these for my daughter who is just starting out on her own and wanted to get something nice that would last. These look expensive and the quality is great.", 
    "I bought this set of cookware for my daughter. She is very pleased wit the quality. She says that the food cooks more quickly than her old pans due to more effective hit distribution. She also says that clean up is a breeze and overall, she is thrilled with the cookware.", 
    "Although I have not yet used this cookware a lot, I am pleased with it so far. Soaking in hot soapy water for 5 minutes seems to do the job for an easy clean up. I did season the skillets and eggs cooked fine. Love the 8 qt pot for pasta. Overstock shipped my order with lightening speed!", 
    "The cookware heats evenly and cleans up like a charm. Just soak soiled pans with a little detergent and hot water. Easy!", 
    "I have tried everything to get this set of pots and pans to Not stick. I treat them as per the instructions, but everything still sticks. I end up using vinegar to clean them every time because nothing else will get the cooked on food off of it. Well, baring using a scouring pad which I do not want to use. I would not recommend this product to anyone. They do look pretty, but that's useless if you can't use them."
