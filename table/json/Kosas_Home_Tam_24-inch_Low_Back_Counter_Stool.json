    "I was expecting a higher quality product than what I received based on the previous reviews, images of the stool and the price paid..The four legs may be solid wood but the seat itself appears to be a veneer of some type. It looks just like something you can get at a big warehouse store (particleboard with a veneer slapped on top) for a whole lot less money.Many reviewers were impressed with the quality of the packaging. I am assuming that it is so well packaged so that it doesn't break apart into a bunch of particleboard chunks during transport. While not shown anywhere in the packaging, I can only believe this is something that was made in China. It looks rather cheap.I will be returning it.I am very disappointed with my very first purchase experience at Overstock.com", 
    "When I unpacked the chairs, I noticed the looked smaller than expected.....but when I sat in the chair, I felt extremely cramped. Needless to say, I am definitely a small person. I checked the advertised sizes and confirmed the chairs are listed at 19 inches wide. I took out my tape measure and the seat came out at just under 13.5 inches wide. With that, you have just over 11 inches in width to place your feet on the iron bar to rest your. They very small, feel smaller......because they are literally tiny.", 
    "Chair packaged VERY poorly. Back of chair was in multiple pieces. Nearly $XXX - The wood quality is very poor as well based on the grain and texture and since in multiple pieces I was able to see the wood within as well. I would have expected it to be more dense instead very light and brittle. Scuffs on the legs as well. I wanted this chair to work out but it was very cheaply made. Would MAYBE pay $XX-XX- MAX.", 
    "the chairs arrived relatively quickly & just in time for thanksgiving. two out of three were, however, broken in similar ways. both had chunks of the seat back cracked off. i didn't even pull the last one out of the box, as i could feel that the piece had broken off. visual inspection of the interior of the product let me to believe that the wood was not so great & that there was really just glue holding them together. attractive, but not such great quality, especially for the price. customer service was great & handled the return for me at no cost, since most of the chairs were broken.", 
    "The stool was nice but the 24\" description was to the edge of the backrest not the bottom of the seat. The seat was too low for our purposes.", 
    "LIKE THE PICTURE BUT BETTER!!!", 
    "I love these stools - we purchased 4. BUT... the construction has a flaw - the seats are made up of linear pieces of wood that run front to back. They are clearly glued together. The glue used is not perfect - we've had two that started to delaminate - one within the first week. So the seats have split apart. Thankfully Overstock replaced it without question - simply sent us a new one. Now we're starting to see a slight split on the back of another - not a deal breaker but we'll keep an eye on it.Otherwise these are unique and very well made - incredibly sturdy.", 
    "Good, solid counter stools. Like the rod iron look foot rests.", 
    "I love my new stools! They are beautiful and very heavy/sturdy. Worth every penny! No assembly required, which was a huge perk", 
    "This stool is perfect for at-the-counter sitting. It is exactly as described with distressed legs and a nice wide seat. I ordered one because I was concerned about the quality/durability based on some other reviews, but will now order the remaining two for my kitchen. It is extremely sturdy and comfortable for sitting even for several hours. The low-rise back is perfect for support without blocking the view to the counter when tucked under. I highly recommend this item, especially for an industrial-look kitchen.", 
    "This stool was just what I was looking for, sturdy, comfortable, rustic and it looks great.", 
    "Love these! Urban Farm feel.", 
    "Love it. Solid heavy in a good way I get a lot of compliments", 
    "These are wonderful. I have not seen anything like them around on the market. They are the perfect fit for our kitchen updates. And the price is definitely right. Thanks!", 
    "Just received my bar stools and LOVE them!! I have a thick Artisian Granite oversized island in the kitchen and the bar stools look perfect !! Very rustic and sturdy ! Love the natural dark wood and black distressed legs!! Love , Love , Love!!!", 
    "This was a replacement chair for one that came damaged earlier.", 
    "Chair look great and they came pre-assembled so no hassle putting them together. Not the absolute most comfortable things but serves our purpose at our bar. Sturdy and heavy construction so they seem good quality.", 
    "Love these stools. Arrived quickly and were well packaged. Goes great with our modern rustic design of our kitchen. These stools are very sturdy and well made. My husband is 250Lbs+ and he loves them too.", 
    "If you don't want the back of a counter stool protruding up above the counter, then these are the perfect stools. The wood and iron acts are made of heavy duty materials.", 
    "We ordered these stools in the lighter color. When they came in we realized we had gotten the darker ones with the black legs. However we decided to keep them because we liked them. We've used them for over a month now and they are sturdy and look good. We get great compliments on them.", 
    "Natural look with nice grain. Finish is not completely smooth and there is no lacquer applied. Chairs are nice and heavy", 
    "I was extremely happy with this purchase. The counter stools are a beautiful color wood, solid, heavy and look much more expensive than their actual cost. A fabulous buy!", 
    "Hesitated ordering after reading others reviews, but the stools are very sturdy and well built.", 
    "The size is a little smaller than I expected but it worked out really well. The legs came in a weathered black color that I wasn't expecting. :( I would have liked them to come all as the wood look I saw pictured. Over all though, everyone loves them. They glide well on the floor as well.", 
    "We bought these stools for our new kitchen remodel. Our style is rustic industrial and they coordinate perfectly. Friends and family gush over them as they look cool but are also very comfortable. As a bonus, we can also still strap in our daughter's high chair seat.", 
    "Excellent stool, looks old world, comfortable, lots of compliments", 
    "These chairs are great. They are heavy and sturdy. Have a great worn look for a farm house look.", 
    "The stools are absolutely awesome and are a great addition to our lake home.", 
    "I Bought these spur of the moment late at night after we moved into our new home. Definitely one of the best products we have purchased from overstock and coolest bar stools we have looked at in person or online. I purchased the black and natural Tam counter stool and it fits in perfectly with the black island and brown stained counter/cabinets in our kitchen. Initially bought 4 and then ordered the 5th because of the quality and with the low back they have an uncluttered look and allowed me to add more seating around the area without it looking busy. Nice look along the curved counter and look like they cost much more. Extremely sturdy.... my toddler aged grandkids sit in them well and these do not topple forward or sideways like some bar/counter stools do. Pretty comfortable for wood though the wood is not varnished or slick rustic look and feel. The designers who are helping me with some areas in the mew house asked me specifically where I got them and what they were called. Everyone who has come into our new house has complimented them. Very happy!", 
    "Loved the look. Excellently packaged for safe shipping. Ultimately decided to return it because it was a bit too large, front to back, for my space between the fridge and island, and because it was pretty heavy. I was disappointed that I had to let it go. Luckily, I had unpacked it carefully and saved all of the packing material. Returning it was really easy.", 
    "This stool does not provide any sort of back support. It looks like the back curves up a bit, but it is tilted so far back that if you wanted to have your lower back against the backrest, you'd have to lean way back. It looks nice, but the reason I am on the site is because my son knocked one over and the back cracked off of it. Not sturdy enough to withstand a fall!", 
    "Heavier than expected. Very cool and unique chairs.", 
    "the stools everyone runs to use when in the kitchen", 
    "These (4) chairs have been great. We get tons of compliments on them and people sit there while we make dinner. Perfect. They are sturdy and attractive against our white center island counter. Other reviews said the seat looked like laminate. The pictures are accurate. Someone said that they arrived with dings in the legs - um, yes. Distressed. I definitely recommend.", 
    "sturdy and comfortable and very unique", 
    "The stools were fantastic. Solid wood and very sturdy. Extremely happy with them.", 
    "Purchased 3 of these for my condo. Looked great in my newly remodeled \"french-industrial\" kitchen. I've gotten a lot of compliments on them. Then I moved to New Mexico, and moved these guys with me. I'm now using 2 of them in our Santa Fe style home. These barstools work great in the new setting too. We only have room for 2, so I am using the third one as a night stand, which actually works out great and gave our bedroom a unique look. Only thing is that the metal stretchers need to be hand tightened from time to time to keep the legs from being flayed out.", 
    "These are the exact bar stools that I saw featured in a downtown restaurant from West Elm. The only difference is I bought mine for half the price and the product is identical. Beautiful in my daughter's new home!!!!", 
    "The stools look amazing! I'm actually ordering another one because I like them so much. They have great detail and look very different then a normal stool. Was excited about the price too because I found these at a high end furniture store for $240. LOVE LOVE LOVE!", 
    "Saw this on another site and ordered two from each place because of a mix up. O's was less than half the price and I'm certain they were manufactured at the same shop. The 2 from overstock are looking great. one of the two from a competitor arrived with the back rest snapped off. The height is perfect for a kitchen counter/breakfast bar and the seat is quite comfortable. Very solid. No complaints, and given the price, it's 5 stars for me.", 
    "I love this stool! I have had designers come to my house and they always ask where I got the wonderful bar stools, rustic and different. They are very heavy, solid.", 
    "These stools are very sturdy and awesome! They have the perfect rustic/industrial feel. They are quite narrow. I ended up returning them because I really needed a higher back to be substantial for my vaulted ceilings/lodge look. BUT, I really wanted to like them in my space, because they are so cool!", 
    "Beautiful heavy duty chair!", 
    "Beautiful and heavy barstools", 
    "A perfect fit, size and style. Turned sideways they fit under the counter top and out of the way. The iron detail adds to the rustic charm.", 
    "These stools are terrific. They go perfectly in my home, are sturdy and get so many compliments. They are comfortable too!", 
    "Solid, exceptional stools. We entertain allot, and nothing but raves for these. Would hold up in a commercial kitchen atmosphere. Love them.", 
    "These stools are great! Very solid. The same chair is sold at **** *** at a much higher price. I was so excited to find them here. So happy with this purchase. Work in our new home perfectly.", 
    "Saw them in a furniture store, could not afford. Looked them up on overstock and was excited to buy 3 for the price of one in the store! Very sturdy, and beautiful! Everyone who sees them, loves them.", 
    "Some of the reviews here made me hesitant to purchase these stools, but I couldn't be happier that I did! The quality exceeded my expectations. These are HEAVY, well-made stools that couldn't look any cooler. Exactly what I needed for my new all white, modern rustic kitchen!", 
    "We love the rustic look of these chairs. We've got 3 kids and feel like they are very sturdy and will last a long time in our home. We even had one show up broken during the shipping but they sent a replacement right away. We are very happy customers!", 
    "We LOVE these stools! They are high quality and look very high end. We ordered 3 and one came damaged. I emailed o.co and they sent a replacement stool immediately. I have had quite a few compliments on these stools! They are perfect for COUNTER height, if you have a bar height counter or bar you will need to get the taller stools.", 
    "I have had these since May. They have been in box until today, due to kitchen remodel.I left unopened in box til now to keep from being damaged.Should have checked them out when first came. For the money, I was expecting excellent quality.They seem well made to an extent....but....they have chips & gouges all over them. I know it didn't happen during shipping...they were double boxed & the boxes were not damaged.Soooo.....very unhappy since way to late to return.", 
    "Was a bit concerned after seeing other reviews about damage during shipping, but I loved the rustic look so took a chance. My stool shipped quickly and was very well packed with no issues at all. Adds great character to my tack room.", 
    "Amazing. Very beautiful wood grain shows, sturdy, finished well. A real conversation piece.", 
    "high quality counter stool. very stylish and surprised to find it very comfortable as wellAdults and kids both love to sit on themI find my kids sit at counter more often than table now bc they love the stoolsSturdy, great color and love the metal accent", 
    "These stools arrived pre-assembled. We ordered 3 but one of them was damaged. Customer service was very helpful. UPS picked up the damaged chair and Overstock sent a replacement. The chairs are heavy which hopefully means they will continue to hold up well. We've had them for about 2 months and so far so good! Our kitchen has lot of windows so the low back does not distract from the view. As these chairs are not cushioned, they are not as comfortable as some other options, but they work. I expect them to be with us for a long time.", 
    "I get great compliments on these chairs. Because of the wood pattern, one of them cracked but Overstock has great customer service and they exchanged them quickly. I ordered 4 of them and loved it so much that I ordered more.", 
    "These stools are just plain awesome! Shipping weight was 33 pounds each. I'm super impressed. Arrived in perfect condition, double boxed with extra padding. I ordered 4 and couldn't be happier. Found on another website for almost twice as much. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "These stools are so heavy, solid and well made. I want two more so I hope they become available soon!!!! They were packaged perfectly and we couldn't be happier with this purchase!", 
    "They arrived very well packaged once I opened them they were everything I expected and more. Well made product out of heavy materials. I like the distressing on the wood and the hammer narks on the iron supports.", 
    "Rustic, solid, and well made. I ordered these for my kitchen island and was very pleased when they arrived. All in one piece - just unpack and set into place!", 
    "I really liked how these chairs looked online. I read the other reviews to see what others thought of them. I ordered two and they arrived within days. I could not be more pleased - they are sturdy and very well made. Outstanding value for the price. Everyone who sees them says they look fabulous!", 
    "I TOTALLY LOVED this product but could not keep them because there was NO TABLE for them. The table that seemed to go with them was 23inches wide!!! So sad I couldn't keep them. They are truly Rustic Vintage looking and Heavy Duty!!!! Very well made!!!! :(", 
    "We love these counter stools for our new kitchen island. We have big boys in our family and many stools looked too flimsy. Loved the rustic design of these stools and the fact that they were *** less each than the other source I found. Arrived right away, flawless condition and every one remarks about how great they look!", 
    "The barstools arrived timely, packed well and already assembled!!! They will fit in my Texas d\u00e9cor perfectly. I have them at the kitchen island. Only wish they made the same design but taller for my bar. Has anyone seen them taller? Love them!"
