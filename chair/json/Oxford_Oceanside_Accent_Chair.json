    "Color in photo is more vibrant...color is actually more dull than I expected. Still very good quality,", 
    "Happy with everything about this chair, will place another order for the chair.", 
    "These chairs are very well made and elegant, with modern lines and a comfortable cushion. I was nervous ordering them without sitting in them first, but was pleasantly surprised! I ended up buying a 2nd chair for a matching set.", 
    "Nice line and navy blue color. Highly recommend!", 
    "I was looking for a mid-century-inspired design and this chair fit the bill. I bought 2 for my family room and put a gold table with white top between them. They look awesome together. The color of this chair is a navy, but a little more toward royal. You can tell the chair is blue (which is what I wanted; I didn't want the blue so dark it looked black). The chair is sturdy and comfortable. My only complaint is that the break is quite large. I am 5'6\" and my feet do not totally touch the ground if I sit all the way back. However, this is nothing that a decorate pillow can't solve, which I intend to purchase to make these chairs pop.", 
    "At 5'4\" my feet barely skim the ground when I sit in this chair and it is sort of comfortable but not great. My husband stands 6' and finds this chair more comfortable. The fabric is a woven fabric. Pros: very easy to assemble, color true to picture, and the cushion can be removed.", 
    "This chair ended up looking great in my living room. It goes great with my white leather couches and red rug! The back is a little uncomfortable but this really isn't meant to be one of those comfy chairs you have to hang out in. Its meant to look nice and accommodate occasional visitors so its great for this purpose!", 
    "I ordered this chair for a guest bedroom and the color and style are perfect for my decor.", 
    "I bought this chair for our family room which has a big grey sectional and navy rug and pillows. The chair is not dark navy enough to fit but it is very comfortable and was a great deal so I decided to keep it and put in our white/grey bedroom and it looks great there.", 
    "My fianc\u00e9 and I bought these chairs for our new apartment and thought they were on sale and a great price. Turns out they weren't only a great price but they are very comfortable. We purchased two chairs and we love them. Super easy to assemble the legs and they don't look like any chair you can order online.", 
    "I love these chairs! Although I was hoping for a little bit darker blue, they still go very well with everything! They are low profile like I wanted, sturdy (legs and chair construction) and super easy to put together. I would highly recommended!", 
    "Looks great. Love this chair.",
