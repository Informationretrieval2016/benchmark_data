    "Didn't realize the door wasn't drawers and European to boot .... we have it between recliners with a much larger glass top.", 
    "I needed a small table to fit between two swival rocker recliners. This end table is perfect. It took about 10 minutes to assemble and everything fit perfectly together. It's a lovely little table with lots of room inside on the two shelves.", 
    "This was just perfect next to my recliner where I spend a good portion of my day because of back issues. It has two shelves for storage and a adequate surface to hold my computer and drinks. Nice color-goes well with my living room decor.", 
    "We bought two of these tables. We really like them.the only problems were, one other tables had the wrong hardware packed with it. It created problems. Because I was able to find usable screws bolts and shelf brackets in our garage I was able to assemble the table.", 
    "As described, fits our purpose and was not hard to assemble.", 
    "This is a great end table especially to be used with a sofa that has high arm sides. This table is taller than my previous end tables and fits the space so well. It was very easy to assemble, less than 10 minutes. Well constructed and the finish is very even and pleasant to look at. I am thinking of buying another to use in my beach rental property because of the size and functionality.", 
    "I had one door that was cracked once assembled the cabinet, but customer service resolved this problem very quickly. The only reason that I gave it a 4 rating was that the bottom shelf is only held by shelf tabs instead of being screwed into the sides. I hope it holds up to having something placed on the shelves.", 
    "Extraordinarily well fabricated. Assembly method and hardware could not be quicker, easier or more sturdy. Very impressed with structural quality."
