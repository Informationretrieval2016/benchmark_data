    "Absolutely incredible. This headboard is so well made and sturdy. We are using it in my daughter's dorm room and it works perfectly! The grey fabric is heathered-which is a nice touch!", 
    "We bought this for our daughter's twin bed. It is beautiful and looks great in her room! What a good value.", 
    "The material is smooth and sturdy. The back padding is firm and perfect for reading in bed. Our guest has loved it. Well worth the money!", 
    "My daughter purchased this for my Mom who we recently moved to an assisted living facility. Giving up her home and her queen bed was disappointing, but we decorated her new studio apartment with beautiful furnishings inspired from her favorite show, Downton Abbey...this headboard is BEAUTIFUL, and is perfect for our mother, er..excuse me, our Mum, the queen. Very quick delivery and easy to install.", 
    "I ordered this in the Ivory and was happy that the color was a perfect match for the Belgium cream nursery furniture. There were some noticeable marks/stains on the headboard so it was slightly dirty. Spot cleaning will work just fine but it was not enough to return the item. It greatly enhances the nursery and I am pleased with the purchase. I took one star off because of the marks.", 
    "The headboard is very well made. It is a little more of a tweed fabric than a solid but will look great in my guest room."
