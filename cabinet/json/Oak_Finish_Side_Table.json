    "I always count on the reviews people submit as I make decisions on purchases. This product had none, so I knew I was taking a chance. This time I was disappointed. Honestly, you get what you pay for. These tables aren't as expensive as some, and I was just hoping they were a good deal. But even at this price, they are not worth the cost. Several disappointing issues with these tables: one arrived, damaged (but not really an issue because Overstock always honors returns or exchanges) but it was an indication of quality; lightweight, not very study; unlevel, wobble, no levelers on the bottom; NOT REAL WOOD so the color is painted on; there is not 4 drawers, there is one drawer and then there is a door (with a fake 3 drawer appearance) that swings open; and lastly there is a sticker on the back that states \"Warning: this product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects\". I don't have small children who might eat the paint, but these tables due seem to have a smell of bad paint fumes or something. Overall, just not the typical quality of an item from Overstock. These are going back.", 
    "Poor quality. Fake in every way. The color is painted on with some type of toxic chemical.....and had several chips. Get what you pay for as it is at least decent looking.", 
    "Great value, solid piece, goes with all types of wood tones from oak to cherry", 
    "From reading the reviews I had mixed emotions on ordering this. Glad I decided to. Beautiful addition to our living room. It came fully assembled and without any damage. Solid piece of furniture. The back is stained so it being visible to our doorway doesn't matter. Would order again.", 
    "I was very dissapointed in this table. It is not the quality I had expected. It is mostly plastic with a poor finish. The base was cracked almost all the way around with the paint chipping.", 
    "This is a very nice, heavy side table. Have gotten several compliments on it.", 
    "Table's ok. I thought it had 4 drawers but is actually one with a cabinet space which I have no use for. I don't like it in my room but it would cost too much to ship back so I'm stuck with it. Tried to sell online myself no one wants it. I'll never buy furniture online again.", 
    "Solid, Perfect hideaway for remotes and reading glasses", 
    "Like the quality. Looks great.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised at the great quality of this side table. Although it was a little smaller than what I thought it would be, it is a great addition to our living room and the added storage it provides is welcome.", 
    "The piece was a good piece of furniture but the wrong color. It said oak finish and it was so dark it looked like mahagony. It did not go with anything in the home. Had to return it.", 
    "We are very pleased with the quality of this piece a d use it at the end of the sofa and sometimes between living room chairs. This has two nice drawers and a \"cubby hole\" space for use.", 
    "Nice finish. Well constructed. Needed no assembly", 
    "These tables look better online than they do in person. They are a darker, duller finish than I expected. I guess I should have looked more carefully at the dimensions, too. They are smaller than I thought they would be. We will keep them because I do like the drawer and storage underneath, but if I had seen them in person first I probably would not have purchased them.", 
    "Bought two to flank my sofa. Very nice table, looks good in our Moroccan themed living room. Top surface looks a tiny bit cheap, like a thin veneer, but just a tiny bit.", 
    "Perfect next to each side of the kingsize bed! they are very attractive.Nothing to put together - a bonus!", 
    "recently got new living area furniture with the nail heads on it and this small end table goes well with that, and gives me some extra storage as well without taking up a lot of space."
