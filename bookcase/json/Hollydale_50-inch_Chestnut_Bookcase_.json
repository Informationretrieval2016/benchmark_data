    "It's a very attractive piece. It fits perfectly in the space I wanted it for. Unfortunately...The quality of the materials is poor. Most of the holes are drilled too wide for the part they're meant to contain, so things fall out or shift in strange ways if you're not careful during assembly. I managed to script a little bit of the finish off while assembling it as well.The quality of the assembly instructions is poor. The assembly instructions have that feeling like they were written by the same person who designed the piece. What I mean by this is that they're very minimal... correct, but lacking many of the niceties that one might see in higher quality instructions, like breaking down the assembly into a few more steps, and calling out important potential gotchas in the construction.This product is dramatically over-priced. I would have been satisfied with it at half or a third of its actual cost.", 
    "Great addition to my bedroom. I'm using it to put my sweaters and it looks great.", 
    "This is a fairly solid bookcase that's easy to assemble. For what you get (particle board), it's a bit overpriced though. That having been said, the color is nice and it is an attractive addition to my teenage daughter's bedroom. She has put quite a number of books on the shelves but they seem to be holding up to the weight.", 
    "The bookcase is really nice looking, seems sturdy, and was easy to assemble. The color is much darker than what it looks like on the website. It looks like a honey oak in the photo, but in reality it is closer to cherry.", 
    "Looks really nice for the money. Easily assemblies", 
    "The color says \"chestnut\" and is a little darker than the picture shows. I took a chance that it would go with my chestnut bedroom furniture. It's perfect in color and style and size. Not too hard to put together with a little help. Just what I needed.", 
    "Takes a little while to put together and a little complicated but sturdy and good looking.", 
    "It is not an elegant piece of furniture, and not very heavy, but I like it and am glad I have it. It goes well in my office.", 
    "Easy to put together. Looks very nice. I needed somewhere to sort paperwork, but due to its placement in my house, it had to look good. This fits the bill."
