    "I already had one of these for my living room that I use on its side as a room divider. Ordered this one to stand upright in my bedroom. Love the shapes of the shelves. It's not the best setup for actually holding books, but perfect if (like me) you have books of many different sizes and you also want to use it to display pretty things. Took me 1.5 hours to assemble, not including unpacking and cleanup. I forgot to use the glue on the dowels until the last few steps; hope it holds up. Assembly might be difficult for anyone who 1) doesn't like to follow instruction manuals; 2) is easily irritated; and/or 3) is trying to rush.", 
    ". I purchased the Mandy bookcase to go with two of the Verena bookcases to display artwork. The three look great together. I think the Verena's cubicles are a little more usable for art display. The instructions that came with the bookcases were excellent. I had no trouble putting them together by myself. Once put together, I did not like the way the wall showed through the back of the bookcases, so I lined the back with some pretty off-white rice paper. It actually made the bookcases more elegant and enhanced the art display.", 
    "Good bookcase for the price, though there were some small defects. Assembly instructions could have been clearer.", 
    "I'm using this for easily accessible storage in my craft room. It's very sturdy and looks wonderful! Plus, putting it together wasn't bad at all; the pieces are all labeled and the directions are very clear and easy to follow!", 
    "Need to spend some time to assemble but then you will not be sorry", 
    "This is a gorgeous piece that I use in my entryway to display items I have purchased in my travels throughout Europe. High quality and the piece is so sturdy that I never have to worry about my items getting knocked over and breaking! It looks great across from the 3 Regent Dreamscape Wall Panels I purchased on Overstock, too!", 
    "Arrived in great condition. Put together easily and looks great.", 
    "Got this at a great price. Fits perfectly.", 
    "Looks exactly as pictured. Substantial and very functional. While it took a while to assemble (LOTS of screws) it wasn't difficult and the directions were very clear. Took me about 90 minutes to complete by myself.", 
    "This shelf looks so good in our contemporary home. I am using it as a room divider and to hide my messy desk area. I can still see out and I love the shapes in this piece.", 
    "One shelf was damaged in shipping but it was replaced promptly. Overall good solid quality for the value.", 
    "The finished product is really a 5, but the difficulty in deciphering the picture instructions for assembly made my grade a 4. After several starts and a couple of steps of deconstruction, we finally have a beautiful, contemporary, interesting display piece.", 
    "I LOVE this shelving unit!! Very sturdy and versatile since you can set it any direction. 3 senior women put it together in 1 1/2 hours. Definitely recommend it!", 
    "It's a heavy piece -- it took me a few hours to put together -- the key is the first set of instructions. However I love it, and it was worth the time!", 
    "I like the thickness and how sturdy the book case is. One of the stickers to cover the screws often falls off but otherwise looks good. Not fun assembling but its doable.", 
    "This shelf was very easy to put together. The color was good and it has a wood texture that looks nice.", 
    "Stacked 2 horizontally and they make a dramatic statement in my home library. Secured them to the wall. Looks amazing.", 
    "This was the first project for me and the new bf. We didn't kill each other but that was no thanx to the directions. LOL It's a great piece. We LOVE it. And it looks great I in the living room.", 
    "I love this piece, it is just as beautiful in person as on the website. It was a challenge to assemble, but I was well pleased once we got it together.", 
    "needed a narrow shelf and this fit well. I like the option of standing it vertically or horizontally. Directions not great, but simple enough to figure out yourself.", 
    "The shelf looks great. Took me and my husband about an hour to assemble.", 
    "Love this bookcase. Fits our home perfectly and was a breeze to assemble.", 
    "I love it. I get so many compliments on this book case. It is gorgeous."
