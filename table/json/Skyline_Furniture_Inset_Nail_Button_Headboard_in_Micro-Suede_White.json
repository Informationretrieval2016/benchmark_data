    "The headboard itself was a nice color white with silver nailheads. The pieces supplied to attach the headboard to a bedframe did not work well. It was fortunate that the headboard arrived undamaged because the packaging was horrible. The box was opened when I received it and there was nothing protecting the headboard except thin plastic.", 
    "This headboard arrived packaged well, with all parts included. Easy installation. The white microfiber fabric is beautiful in my light grey room and the nail heads are perfectly placed. Very happy customer!", 
    "We bought this headboard because the curves matched the pattern in our bedroom wallpaper and we have an all white bedroom. The fabric feels soft and the frame feels secure. It really pulled our whole room together. We were pleased with the quality and the time it took to receive this item (about 4 weeks).", 
    "Just what we were looking for. Beautiful suede-like covering. I didn't notice how long it would take to ship this \"overstocked item.\" I discovered that this item is made to order; it actually took about six weeks! The box came terribly damaged, but the headboard fortunately was not affected. Love my purchase!"
