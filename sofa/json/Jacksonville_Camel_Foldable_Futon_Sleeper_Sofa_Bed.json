    "Definitely deserve full marks for everything this sofa bed futon has to offer. From the material use to the assembly process (just attach the legs), everything was great. My girlfriend was very pleased when she sees it and wanted me to get her one for her birthday. Both of us loves the rich \"camel\" color, very very very attractive and beautiful, never seen this type of color before! Slick design and very contemporary. Could not ask for more.", 
    "I looked over many sofas on the website and chose this one based on all the other reviews. It was the only one that came up with positive comments every time. I definitely made a good choice because it's just what I was looking for. It was easy to set up, and ready to go! I love the color, the style, the material, and the price. I ordered on a Tuesday and it arrived by Friday. My mother in law arrives tonight and she may be the first to sleep on it!", 
    "I brought this sofa bed and has been using it for months now. I like the young, bright color it offers. It is very comfortable to sit or sleep on. The microsuede fabric used is strong and does not really get dirty at all. the workmanship is great for the price I pay for. I use it in our game room which we use it alot, very often I felt asleep on it and I really like it. I would definitely order this sofe bed again when I get a chance. Awesome!", 
    "I NEEDED A SMALLER FUTON - BUT DIDN'T WANT TO PAY A HUGE PRICE. THIS FUTON IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. COLOR IS PERFECT FAUX LEATHER IS BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE IT", 
    "This is exactly what I looked for, a modern look with unique colors. We love the rich beautiful color and have already gotten good comments on it. It's small and fits comfortably in my living room with limited spaces. My guest slept on it for a few nights and slept well with no complaint. I've taken naps on it and I find it a little hard but still pretty comfy. A tall person might not fit well due to the length of the sofa bed but that was expected as the dimensions were given already. Very pleased with this purchase!.", 
    "I generally dislike it when consumers who purchase items use the product review page to rant against poor customer service from the vendor that sells a product. HOWEVER, I'm about to do the same, except it's the opposite. I bought this couch just over a month ago, and when I received it, there was a stain dead center between the two seating areas, it looked like it had been damaged and someone had try to re-stain it, but had done a rotten job doing so. I contacted Overstock's online support, and they took care of it via a small settlement which I was glad to accept since the thought of repacking it and sending it back was too bothersome. I figured I'd just slap a pillow on it or a throw and I wouldn't care. I was right, I didn't care, and the couch has worked out great. It's modern, it's comfortable, and it's just the right height/size. Tonight, I sat down like I normally do, and found myself close to the floor. The leg on one end had snapped off. I looked and the plate onto which the legs are screwed completely fell off. One screw had remained stuck on the bottom of the couch, and I looked at the leg and the wood had splintered. I was bummed. As my boyfriend is telling me to email their customer service tomorrow since it was already past midnight, I scoffed and logged onto Overstock and within 15 seconds was talking to another gracious customer service rep. Within 2 minutes I've secured an exchange. Long story short. I think this is a good couch and I may just have had bad luck. For the price, it can't be beat. As for buying it from Overstock.com, I just consider myself lucky. As a former customer service rep (which is why I use the words consumers/vendors, etc.), I am more than impressed by their level of service and the expediency of their responses. Bravo Overstock! Good job getting me to spend money I really ought not to be spending ;)", 
    "Very fast shipping and so simply to attach the legs. Loves the modern look and the camel color is beautiful, just what you see in the pictures. Its well worth it. Multifunctional as a guest bed. The quality of the fabric is very good. The only thing is that its not long enough for the very tall people when it comes to use as a bed, so make sure the length is good for you.", 
    "Love the color and quality of this sofa bed, very nice indeed. Soft PU fabric feels very close to real leather, but centainly easier to maintain. The cushion is a little hard at the begining, but became softer over time. This is an awsome sofa bed, I would expect to pay much more in the reatil stores.", 
    "We really like the color and look of this futon sofa. It give an impression of a high-end sofa, but I only paid a fraction of the cost to it. It's can be easily convert into a recliner or a decent size bed. The faux leather used for this product is soft, without any pleather type smell or stickiness (and the great news is you don't have to hurt any animals to make your house look stylish). The sofa does sit a bit lower on the ground, so may be a little uneasy for the very tall people. I'm very satisfied with this product and the service received.", 
    "I ordered this sofa to put in our den which is a high traffic area with our two pugs and my four year old daughter. When the sofa arrived I was thrilled with the ease of assembly as I dragged it in from the door step and put it together all by myself. When I first sat down on it, I noticed it was pretty narrow in the \"sofa\" position. I am six feet tall so the width wasn't nessecarily ideal for me but I wasn't the primary user so it didn't matter much. Within 3 weeks of having the sofa however the material ripped at the seams exposing the white poly fill stuffing underneath. Now, 3 months later the stuffing has shifted and become highly uneven leaving the seating extremely lumpy. While I was at first fairly satisfied with the product.. after use I would not recommend it unless you are just putting it in a room where it will get very little daily use.", 
    "The item was delivered to us before we know it, it was even quicker than other items we ordered for our new apartment. Also very pleased with the quality and look of the sofa. We love the clean look and rich color. I slept on it a few nights before our new bed was delivered, and it was nice. I would not say this is the best comfortable bed I have ever had, but it certainly good for temporary use. Besides, it is designed for temp. and not intended to replace a real bed. So I am very happy with the comfort level. Its was a little firm to sit on initially, but it gotten softer after some use. The price is very good for what I received, so money well spent.", 
    "Thumbs up for this quality sofa bed. Ideal size to fit into my small den. I enjoy the comfort and obsessed with the nice camel finish and the chrome legs. Both the color and the fabric character make this sofa bed easy to maintain and doesn't dirty easily. Super happy!", 
    "Very easy assembly. Sturdy. Stylish. Suits me perfectly as a guest bed for a friend (who isn't too tall). And works well for lounging in the den. Highly recommended for the affordable price.", 
    "Quick and easy to assemble. Color good and matched picture, but there were some imperfections that are pretty easy to see. I thought I was getting a killer deal, and it turned out that I got a pretty good piece of furniture for less than I would have paid in a furniture store (but then again, I probably wouldn't have shopped in person in a store that sold such low quality.", 
    "this couch is poorly made. The materials split in several parts on the seat after about 3 months of use, and the seams are too thin for repair. The couch is also supremely uncomfortable as a futon because the crease (which is in the middle of the bed) is hard and you can feel the metal joints under your back. Finally, it's tiny so only our really short visitors can actually sleep comfortably on this futon. As a couch, it's actually quite comfortable and attractive.", 
    "This product's quality is terrible. After just a few months we noticed that cushions became lower, with a pit in the middle of them. Another month went and there is a clicking sound emerged when someone's sitting. Now, after 8 months, the middle support of the futon has broke - it just bent over to a side, so the futon now has a U shape and it slides to the right every time when people sit on it.Overall, it is not worth its low price at all. Just a waste of money.... Shame on the manufacturer, really.", 
    "I've had this for a week, but haven't used it much, as I avoid it, because it is too uncomfortable. You have to sit in the exact center of each cushion to get any padding. But, even then, I sink through to the frame. I am six feet, 240, so maybe that has something to do with it. The cushioning does not extend out to my knee, but reaches only mid-thigh. It is low rise, so my knees are higher than my hips. which is a very bad seating posture for the back. It looks great tho!! Nice color..sleek design. However, the material doesn't feel very strong. It feels like with a little effort, I could tear it. Way too much trouble to return, plus I would have to pay shipping. I'll try to put cushions on it or buy another one.It's really tough to buy furniture online. I went by the reviews...and I chatted with an Overstock.Com sales representative who said she owned this and it's very \"comfy\". What's the expression...\"There's a sucker born every minute\". ? Looks like I took care of everyone else born during my minute.", 
    "We LOVE this sofa bed! Good modern look and simple design than fits into almost every room. Great quality fabric with nice rich camel color that is pretty and fun. It is really nice to have a sofa bed with great quality at a very affordable price!", 
    "I bought this for my spare bedroom and wanted something that would POP a little. I love the color, it's beautiful and doesn't look like any other futon that I've seen. I didn't give it 5 stars because I had a problem with one of the rear legs. No one has used it yet... Stayed tuned.", 
    "I like this very much. It looks great in my office. It's not as cushy as what I'm used to, and I think most people would find it too hard to sleep on for very long, but it suits my purpose well.", 
    "This product was easy to assemble and looks great. However, after a few weeks I noticed a slight tearing near the seam on one of the seats. I am a single, older woman so only a few visitors had sat on this sofa. I was able to fix it with super glue, but dsappointed to have to deal with this. If you're anticipating using this sofa often, you might not want this one!", 
    "Bought 2 of these for our basement. They are great for extra sleeping space for company.", 
    "This is definitely a solid piece, easy to assemble. It is also relatively comfortable. What was disappointing was the workmanship. The underlay had already started to come off, the staples were not secure. And the stitching on the right back cushion was totally not centered vertically, so the seam going across is not contiguous from one cushion to the other and is off by a whole inch. In addition, the stitching of the upholstery is half-*. It bunched up in a couple spots and they just kept on stitching, so it's not uniformly smooth at all. And it's significant. I couldn't be bothered to return, but wanted to put this out there for the manufacturer.", 
    "We bought this couch for our teen room. Our college son came home for Christmas and his feet hung over the edge, he is 5' 11 \". It wasn't very comfortable so I added a foam pad and mattress cover which helped. Then while the boys were playing video games on it, one of the legs broke. It looks great and I like that the back can recline in different positions.", 
    "delivered right on time! Comes in one piece and soooooo easy to ensemble...you only need to attach the legs. Very nice camel colour without eliminating the decor to pure futuristic touch. Adjustable to all tastes!!", 
    "I purchased this futon as a substitution for a bed and I am very disappointed in the comfort it offers. It is very firm and uncomfortable, I am going to look into purchasing a mattress pad, because have no other choice.", 
    "Unique color and modern look is what attract my attention to this sofa bed. Of course, affordable price is also one of the fact that makes my decision. The sofa bed was delivered 4 days after order, that is super quick. The quality is what I was looking for, but more importantly, the look and color is as good as I can ever imagined. It's good for person average height person like me, but may be a little too short for very tall people. After all, this has to be the best by for me in a long time.", 
    "Thank goodness for Overstock's unflagging excellent customer service. The futon color was perfect but the back had an unexpected black shelf so I couldn't use it (it was for the middle of a room). Wish that had been shown, it would have saved time and money. Also, the seat on one side pulled at the split, and one side of the back was about an inch higher than the other. After I opened it, I called Overstock to see if the other Ethan mini futon had the shelf. It did so the agent stopped it before delivery. She was so nice! Where does Overstock find so many nice agents? Next time I will call before I place my order to make sure there is nothing I have overlooked when it comes to a piece of furniture, but I will definitely buy from them again.", 
    "The leather-like fabric is very thin. And the futon sits very low to the ground. It is very sleek looking. It does not take up too much space. I don't think it would be very comfortable to sleep on, because of the fold. I just received my futon yesterday. And it was easy enough to get out of the shipping box; I just had to attach the six legs. As I said the futon is very firm. It might soften with use.", 
    "There is very flimsy 2x4 wood holding the couch together. If you have young children do not buy this as you have to be very careful as to how you use the futon to be sure it doesn't break. The clors are true to pictures.", 
    "As a sofa it did what I expected. As a sleeper I would recommend a thick pad on top because it's more comfortable with additional padding.", 
    "I TAKE A NAP AND PUT MY FEET UP AND NO PROBLEM WITH DIRT OR ALLERGIES. I LIVE IN RURAL OKLAHOMA WITH DOGS AND HORSES AND IT IS ALWAYS CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE. GREAT CARMEL COLOR NOT CAMEL", 
    "My step daughter was coming to stay with us for months for school and she slept on this . Comfortable except for the crease where the couch folds.", 
    "Perfect for additional seating and sleeping in small apartment but too short for a person over 6 feet tall.", 
    "we love the look - sleek and elegant. plus it is functional - great that it is also a futon!", 
    "It is ok for college room", 
    "Smaller than it looks. Its a bit shorter than a standard single bed and not quite as wide as a double. Good for small children.", 
    "This is a nice looking piece, very contemporary and comfortable for sitting however this is horrible for sleeping. I have used this 3 times for company and each time I have heard big complaints even from a 13 year old. Very hard and uncomfortable!", 
    "Good quality and my son loves it - enough said!", 
    "Looks great in our small guest room. Easy to put together.", 
    "I love this futon. It is easy to put the legs on, and it is easy to wipe clean. It also has a thick mattress, so it is comfortable.", 
    "Thought it was bigger - color is great, easy to maneuver.", 
    "Love it. It is very comfortable and was easy to assemble.", 
    "I wanted a sleek futon or couch to put in my sunroom and this has done the trick. It's perfect for friends that decide to spend the night. My recommendation is to put a comforter over it so the seams/folds are less obtrusive. The color is true to the picture and the material is extremely easy to clean.", 
    "We purchased this for our son's first apartment with a small living area and it was perfect. We were impressed with the quality and ease of assembly - essentially, only had to install the legs. The camel color is a nice change from black and coordinates well with his other black furniture. For a futon, it is quite comfortable and a really good looking piece of furniture!", 
    "Reviewed previously. Handsome ,economical, functions as it should. Expect to have this for quite a while.", 
    "Medium quality, but definitely cheap, so gets 3 stars for me", 
    "If you actually use it, it will kill your back/butt. Airline seats are more comfortable. The color is a fake tan beige. Invest in something better.", 
    "The actual color is less vibrant than the picture showed it to be, but it doesn't matter for me as it still matched my room very well. This is a pretty comfortable sleeper sofa. It can actually sleep two smaller statued peopled, albeit they do have to get cozy.The assembly was easy enough. The quality reflects its price tag, but overall, I am satisfied with it.", 
    "We were amazed at the color and quality of the bed. It is so beautiful and very comfortable. I would highly recommend it. Just love it.!!!", 
    "I had to return this item, I'm only 90 lbs and I can't imagine any one heavier using it. It's aesthetically pleasing for sure. It goes great in a small living room and bc you can turn it into a sleeper sofa easily it makes it practical. I just did not find it very comfortable. At some point during the first month that I had it a part in the middle of the sofa dented in. And it caused a decline when you sat on it, very uncomfortable.", 
    "This futon is strong and looks just like the photo. I love the size and how comfortable it is. It was so very simple to put the legs on....Anyone would be thrilled to own this gorgeous futon...", 
    "Easy assembly. All you need to do is to put the 6 legs on. Took me 2 min to read the instructions and 10 min to complete assembly. I don't have a lot of strength. The most I can do is to lift a weekend travel suitcase up in the overhead cabin. I have no problem putting the sofa together and put it in place all by myself. The sofa is quite solid. Color is full and beautiful. Had it for a week now. Love it.", 
    "I bought this futon for a small hobby/guest room in my home. It is a handsome piece of furniture. I wanted extra guest sleeping space and this futon looked just right. I have to measure it and get a sleep topper for it because it would be too hard and uncomfortable for sleeping. I gave it four stars because of this. It is good for seating. I am happy with it and would recommend this futon. the color, a carmel color is great!", 
    "this is by far, the worst piece of crap i've ever purchased. bar none. within the first 2 weeks of ownership, the cheap 'leatherette' split right at the seam on the back rest. it measures a whopping 10 inches. now, the cushions are drooping, and uncomfortable. recently, this piece of s*** has begun to spit out its bolts. think long and hard before considering a purchase. you get what you pay for. caveat emptor...", 
    "It is a little uncomfortable as a primary couch, but great for secondary seating and the foldout bed. Assembly was a breeze!", 
    "my son has it up in his game room and the color is good. He finds it comfortable and it provides room for a guest to sleep over.", 
    "easy to set up took about 30 min ...my wife was happy with the bed .. grandchildren came over they got her bed she got the jacksonville ..said she \"slept like a baby\"", 
    "I bought this based on good reviews published. People must have gotten something else as what I received was a chintzy piece of crap that should be selling for nearly nothing as a mistake piece at ***. Cushions are rock hard, the cover feels like feel like cheap vinyl, the folding mechanism is chintzy at best. The back is extremely ugly with black felt. They should show the back on the website pictures. Save your money and go to ***, they have something similar with cloth that is much larger and much higher quality for cheaper. As a futon, it is ridiculously short and the seam where it folds is right where you would lay.Be forewarned, the positive reviews are bogus.", 
    "Perfect for my office. Love the color", 
    "It would be considered firm for sleeping purposes, and to sit on it fulfills that need perfectly. The color I like and that is personal taste. It was priced right and our Westie Quincy seems to like it so who really cares about anyone else. His paw nails destroyed the last one and we are hoping the blanket on it will offer some protection, but who is really top dog in our household, we all know the answer to that.", 
    "I bought this futon because it has tons of reviews, none off which were negative. I haven't had any sleepers on it, but it is very comfortable to sit on, with adjustable back settings. The color is gorgeous! The material is soft. My guest room is my favorite space because of this piece and how I was able to design the room around it.", 
    "I love the color! Its was easy to assemble by myself and easy to change to the sleeper position. Good value for price.", 
    "Love it for an small room we use it in our T V room", 
    "This is a great piece, exceeded my expectations. It looks very nice, not like a typical futon. This piece of furniture is very functional as well. Prompt delivery and easy to assemble. Great for extra guests overnight and functions nicely as a seating option too while looking stylish.", 
    "This futon was a wonderful surprise. It looks better than the pictures and the textures and firmness are great. Time will tell durability but this attractive modern addition updates my loft plays well off a chaise lounge. So glad I didnt go for day bed. Tall family (6'5\") curls up and makes it work when visiting.", 
    "All of the excellent reviews posted swayed my decision to buy this futon -- what a great little sofa/futon! As many reviewers noted, I love the color and style -- it looks so nice in our office/den -- and it snaps quickly into a bed -- a nice extra sleeping space (for someone on the smaller side). We bought the Sage Oriental Rug and they look great together! Comfortable and stylish at such a great price!", 
    "For the price, I am very happy with the quality and look. The camel fabric is rich and attractive, this color may not work for every one, but it certainly look great in my modern apartment. Besides, the modern look is the best choice for a sofa beds. After all, I don't think you can get any thing better at this price.", 
    "Clean style and a practical design ideal for small spaces. Amazingly, it was cleverly packaged into unexpectedly small box. Fabric seems high end, color is wonderful. The price is very reasonable.", 
    "A comfortable and stylish sofa. More of a loveseat actually, just the right size for a sofa bed. Comfy to both sit or sleep on. Certainly looks better than a mattress futon. Also has better value than most others I found. The fabric is rich camel finish, more like a deep orange, very attractive. I am very pleased.", 
    "Brought this sofa bed for our toddlers playroom. Needed something that looked good (has rich color) at the same time needed to be durable. It was easy to put together and looks great. Low profile seating also helps with safety for the kids. And when other kids comes stay over night, this become the perfect extra bed. I love it and truly great value", 
    "I got this sofa bed in the awesome camel color. It looks really nice, and the faux leather is good quality. Sofa feels sturdy and is super easy to assemble. Love it.", 
    "I bought this for the English basement apartment in my house. My 22 year old son lives in the basement and when my 20 year old son comes home for visits - the intent was for him to sleep on this futon. Both of my sons say it is so uncomfortable to sleep on that they pulled out sleeping bags and slept on the floor again. it looks nice and is okay as a sofa - but since I paid and expected it to be multifunctional I am very disappointed in this. The middle has a very uncomfortable bar and it makes it impossible for adults to sleep well on this when it is set up as a bed.", 
    "This is a very modern-looking futon--color is exactly as pictured. I have a pretty small place, and it fits really well in my living area. It's a decent size, without taking up much room. The leatherette is soft, while the actual couch itself is firm, which I think is great for keeping the upholstery from being damaged and worn out with use over time. (Firm without being hard and uncomfortable) Love it, although I'm now second-guessing my decision to get a leatherette sofa, but only for the sheer reason of my dog and 2 cats.", 
    "I've had this in my office waiting room for several months now, and I'm still pleased with it. It looks modern but the color is warm and homey. It has held up well to quite a bit of use, including lots of kids climbing around on it. One thing to be aware of is that the seat is fairly low to the ground, and I've seen a few older folks struggle a bit to stand up from sitting on it. It's not the most comfortable sofa ever, but it's functional and looks nice. Assembly was easy, and it's very easy to move the back from a couch position to completely flat. A great value for the price.", 
    "As all previous reviews state, this is a great sleeper sofa. It's super stylish, hardly no assembly, and is multi functional. I love it!", 
    "The futon sofa bed is sturdy and nice looking. I purchase an egg crate for my guest for added comfort and keep clean. I love that it reclines. Other than it being a little low, it is a good looking and quality piece of furniture. Very easy to put together. One note, don't use box cutter or knife to open the package, or you risk damaging the sofa inside.", 
    "It's a super deal. Great look and quality for the price. It comes in one box and goes together in a snap. The legs were stored in the hidden compartment underneath the sofa to save the spaces during transit. One can use the same packing method for the legs should you wish to transport it in the future. You can simply remove the legs and the structure of the sofa folds up into a cube. Smart design and very convenient.", 
    "I got this sofa bed in camel PU leather. The fabric is soft and good quality. It looks good, feels sturdy and is super easy to assemble the legs. Great price and great sofa bed.", 
    "Strongly recommended! I love the modern look, the nice color, and the chrome legs. The size is just right for a sofa bed futon, and its enough for an average adult to sleep well on it. Cushion is firm but not hard, which I think is good for a sofa bed. I also like the idea of being able to fold the sofa bed into half and transport it easily. Best of all, the price is great for what was received. Could not be more happier!", 
    "We have limited space and needed a futon for the guest room and this was just what we needed. The color is amazing and better than the picture! Comfortable and modern.", 
    "Owned less than year. multiple issues, center part not comfortable.", 
    "This is an excellent product and is worth every penny. It looks very nice and is very comforting.", 
    "Perfect fit (small space). This looks stylish, comfortable and sleek. Good mechanism for lowering down to bed status. Camel color is a good neutral. Soft feel to leather-like material. Easy clean-up. Back side is unfinished. Fine if backed up to a wall, but keep in mind in case the futon will be back facing open. This was a great buy. Great value and will be functional for the small space. Probably good for one person to sleep on (not a tall person), or 2 children comfortably.", 
    "Just moved to a new apartment and this sofa bed is a great helper! Besides it's functionality, it's relatively comfort and looks chic. I have an overnight guests the other day, and it took me two seconds to turn this into a temp bed and it works perfect, my guest loves it. It's beautiful, compact, yet very functional. So I highly recommend it.", 
    "The price was great, and the color is wonderful - it can blend however you need it to blend. A multifunctional piece of furniture that is great for an apartment. I'd recommend it!", 
    "Like the leather feel and contemporary style. It's more of a orange camel rather than a brown camel. This is some thing different and looks good. I like the firm support to my bad back, and can't complain about the low price. Good deal it is!", 
    "Every thing about this sofa bed is great! I could not be more happier. What I liked about? Firm but comfortable seating, nice modern look, rich color finish, and easy to move around. I would recommend to any one who is looking for a bargain!", 
    "Rich color, nicely made sofa, some thing modern and unique. Overall feels high end. The fabric is not real leather, but it is soft and in good quality. I am giving it a top rating!", 
    "Very pleased with the whole buying experience.. The package arrived in a timelymanner, easy to set up and it looked good. Very good value.", 
    "Product was ordered for sitting and sleeping in upstairs loft area when needed. Much too firm for sleeping....we added a foam overlay which helps to soften for comfort.", 
    "Just unfold this and get the legs out of the hidden flap under the lining and put them on. So easy and it looks so much more expensive than it is. Perfect for the shore home living room for extra guests.", 
    "A god quality furniture with visual pleasure. Works for occasional sleeping. Very easy to assemble and adjust positions. The camel pu leather is great and durable. It certainly has the look and is chic. I am very pleased.", 
    "This is a wonderful futon sofa bed that meet my expectations. Compact but good size for an average or smaller room. I didn't want it to take up all the space in my home office, and I still want some thing with multi-purpose and not just for show. I chose this couch mainly because of the sleek modern look and the nice color. The actual sofa look exactly the same as shown in the pictures, no surprises. Again, wonderful sofa bed.", 
    "Beautiful sofa, the color is rich and unique. And it looks high end. The fabric is not real leather, but is soft and good quality, and I like the feel of it. The delivery was super fast, and moving it is a breeze as the sofa was folded into half and packagined in a very strong box. I am giving it a thumbs up!", 
    "This sofa bed gives great value. After all, what can you get for $XXX plus these days? So I am very happy with this sofa bed. This sofa bed is compact and doesn't work well for very tall or very big people. Otherwise, the quality, look, built, and design are all good! Again, for the price, this sofa bed is definitely worth a try.", 
    "I consider myself a good bargain hunter, and this sofa bed is one of the best bargain I found up to date this year. Love the colour, fabric, and style. For the low price we paid for, the quality and built is just awesome. Very happy!", 
    "Nice leather feel, good looking, not so good for tall person to sleep, overall it is a good buy.", 
    "Stylish and contemporary. I wish it was more of a rust orange than a soft orange but it still looks good", 
    "This is a great product and great bargain, best value for money, period! The material is soft but durable, so I am very happy with it. Love the color and chrome legs, vey chic. I would recommend every body to get it, no doubt!", 
    "This is a great piece of furniture. Sleek look with rich color. Quality is really good and comfortable. It goes perfectly in my new apartment home. Just need to be aware that this sofa bed is more of a loveseat than a conventional full size sofa. It just fits us perfectly. Would definitely purchase again.", 
    "Got this sofa bed few months back and we all love it. We use this sofa as an addition couch/bed for our guest room. It looks great and guests loves the rich color. For a sofa bed of this quality, we would expect to pay much more! Believe me, there is no better choice.", 
    "A perfect mid-size couch for me. It meets all my expectations. Good looking and useful. Great value.", 
    "Love the style of this sofa and it has great quality. The color is not easy to find, it's rich and fun. Just love it!", 
    "I am very pleased with the quality and look of this sofa sleeper. This should be one of the best value furniture money can buy for the price range. We've had couple of sofa beds in the past, and they were soso and were pricy. It is firm but in a comfortable way, which I like very much. Guest had no problem slept on it the other night. Great choice after all.", 
    "I live in apartment home, so doesn't have the luxury of having lots of space. I wanted to have a good solution for additional sleeping without a bed or big sleeper. And this sofa bed is a great resolution. Perfect for a single overnight guest. Upholstery PU is of high quality, with rich color that is attractive and fun.", 
    "I really like this sofa bed. We bought it to use in my studio, and I love the style and feel. Also very happy with the ability to easily convert into a bed, we don't really use is as a bed, but I just think it also look nice as in bed position. I will also use it for some photo shoots a well.", 
    "Perfect looking and easy to put together. Shipping was right on. Fits perfect in a small room and for occasional bed.", 
    "I LOVE the CAMEL finish leatherette! It's a fun and great looking color! It's no where to be seen so I am glad I happened to spot it. Good sofa bed at this low price range. Also love the fact it very movable and flexible. Thumbs up!", 
    "considering the price, I guess this is a good value. It is soft enough, but I do find the material to look like the price point.. I had read reviews where some customers found the material to look like real leather - I do not agree. overall, its' not bad, but I would not have purchased, had I seen it in person.. the comfort level is ok, it is soft enough , but very low to the floor..", 
    "I live in NYC, so space is limited. I wanted to have a quest option without a traditional bed, or futon. This was a great compromise. Use deep pock/long twin sheet & it fits the bed well. Perfect for a single guest. And the aesthetic of the sofa is nice. The \"leatherette\" doesn't look cheap and the color is very rich.", 
    "For a couch, and only a couch, this is a nice item. It is atrocious for a bed for anything over one night, and I like a firm bed. It is very short. Maybe for visiting children? Also, you have to avoid sitting at the middle, where the seam is. My husband sits there to read stories to our girls and he is very quickly making a center divot along the seam. The sides are holding up much better. Stitching is really nice, very nice fabric quality, looks great. Perfect small, occasional use sofa, but not for much more.", 
    "This sofa bed become my favorite as soon as it arrived. It has very attractive color and good quality leatherette. I need some thing that looks good and is flexible, and this sofa bed works the best. Everything is so good and beyond my expectations. Definitely worth consider!", 
    "This is best sofa bed ever! From the style to the color, and top to bottom, I am completely happy with every thing this sofa bed offers!", 
    "Brought this sofa sleeper few months ago, I was attracted by the trendy color and modern design. Everything went great, from delivery to set it up (do notes that the legs box was stored underneath the sofa cover at the bottom). I am very happy with this sofa and have nothing to complain about! Highly recommend!", 
    "This attractive futon sofa comes in on rectangular box. Assembly is simple, just cut the box off, unfold it flat, and screw on the legs. It's a bit firm to start, but laying on it, it is fairly comfortable. I feel asleep on it one weekend afternoon. For sitting and watching TV, I put a folded fleece blanket on the bottom as add cushioning. The two position back is handy, although, one half of mine won't latch at the mid-point between up and down, although I haven't really needed it at the mid-point. They offered to replace it, but shipping it back is a bigger pain and cost than trying to fix the latching mechanism myself.", 
    "Great modern style and beautiful color! Love it the moment we see it and still love it after months of using. It sits a little low for me, but I am a tall person. For the price, this for sure is the best value you can get.", 
    "I liked the look of the product, and was quite happy with it when i first received it. However, after moving (military, used to moving, not careless with what i have or how i pack it) the center leg essentially fell off. and over the past few months ive noticed holes wearing in the pleather. Do yourself a favor, buy right or buy twice, get the nicer sofa youre looking at anyway and skip this one, its cheaper in the long run.", 
    "We brought this futon sofa bed after some research, it appears to offer the best look and value for the price. And in fact, it is! We are very happy with the purchase. Right size for our apartment home, color is attractive, very simple and stylish. Nothing to complaint about.", 
    "This is one of the best furniture purchase I have ever made online. This futon sofa bed offers great price and meet all my expectations. I love the fact it simple in design and with clean style, and of course the fun camel color. The price is almost too good to be true, so I am very satisfied.", 
    "I like a firm place to sit and relax. This would be an excellent bed. It didn't take too long to setup and it is just the right size for my studio apartment. Delivery was great and only took four business days. I am sitting on it now and I love it. Will definitely recommend to others to buy.", 
    "Got this sofa sleeper before holiday season for the additional sleep over needs. We use this sofa as an addition to our guest room where we already have a full bed in the room. So we end up using this sofa bed as a bed for the children and works perfectly. We love the camel color and so does our guests. For a sofa sleeper that cost under $500, I guarantee you this has to be the best one can find, period.", 
    "The quality and style of this sofa bed is better than I expected. I am overwhelmed to receive a sofa bed this good at such cheap price. This type of quality and look should cost much more in the store. Love the rich fun color with durable upholstery, very easy to clean. It folds into a bed with one click. When there is a visitor, we do use a mattress topper to make sure the comfort and to protect the sofa itself. Again, I am overwhelmed and very happy.", 
    "This is a great sofa bed! Impressive quality and good modern look. Its firm but with comfort. Convenient for living quarters and very sturdy. My favorite thing is the nice looking style with fun color that modernize my apartment. Very impressed!", 
    "We were initially excited by the design and look of the futon. Color is nice and it's a good looking piece. Unfortunately, there was a defect in the pine frame. There was a knot in the wood which caused the frame to fail and break when a full-sized man sat on it. We opened it up; found the defect and realized the essential design was probably doomed to fail regardless of the defect. Our solution was to add internal corner trusses and short braces across the middle frame sections. If anyone feels really ambitious. you may want to add slats along the base but I'm sure that would make it less comfy. I notified Overstock and they gave me a credit since we did not want to return the piece. Lesson learned - expect mediocre quality equal to the relative cheap price.", 
    "I love the color. I purchased it because it met my need for the width. Anything wider wouldn't fit. This sits very low to the ground. Great for little kids, which thankfully is who I got it for. Certainly not long enough for the average adult. Love how easy it is to drop down as a bed. Hard as a rock. Now I'm looking for a pad to make it more comfortable for the kids to sleep on. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "We bought some thing similar in style from a retail store and then we took that back because the quality was really a disaster. And then for a cheaper price we brought this item from Overstock.com and its turned out perfect and amazing. I wish we didn't have to go though all the trouble to get to this point, but at least we end up with a great deal. This item has the perfect look and amazing color, so beautiful! Material is very soft. Don't miss out on this one, so you might have to go through all the trouble and still end up getting this great deal.", 
    "This convertible sofa is a beautiful piece of furniture. The chic style with rich camel color soft leather make this sofa worth every penny we spent. The silver legs added quality and value to the look. I like the cushion, they are supple and sustainable. The sofa come packaged in a box that is much smaller than expected, due to the fact the base could be fold into half, and this give me the ability to move the sofa on my own with out needing other people's help. This sofa is great for people who are looking for quality and value.", 
    "Incredibly easy to assemble. Very decent quality and at the right price, that is what gives this a 5 star. Very comfortable and the color is very nice as well. More of a nice tan really and will blend easily with other furniture. Comfortable and folds down very easily into a nice bed. Can't beat it for the price and ease of putting it together. Great quick service from Overstock as well. First time buyer so skeptical, but a great transaction to date. Highly recommend.", 
    "Definitely deserve full marks for everything this sofa sleeper has to offer. From the material use to the assembly process (just attach the legs), everything is well designed and with good quality. All my friends loves it when they came to my place. Slick design and very contemporary. It's the best deal!", 
    "We are totally in love with this contemporary sofa bed / futon. Its perfect for our small apartment, we are able to move this sofa bed around without much effort, great when we have guests around. The simple lines with a touch of uniqueness makes it stylish yet easy to fit with my other funiture. Very comfortable when use as a sofa or a bed, some reviews complaint about its being firm, I think its just personal preference. I like the sofa being firm, so it provides good support and usually last longer. Also, all genuine sofa beds are firm in my opinion, due to its multipurpose design. I would just get an air mattress or some thing else if I care so much about the softness. At least we know for a fact the upholstery material is soft and good quality.The fabric is strong and practical for pets and kids, becuase its very easy to clean and leaves no stain on it. Great value overall.", 
    "First the good it LOOKS great VERY stylish and like it should cost a LOT more money looks like leather . It i is Camel there is NO green in this at all .i don't care what light its in. But i wanted Camel and it is striking. I have 2 left thumbs and installed it in 10 min properly i might add. Do NOT panic when you open the box and see no hardware It is all in a hidden velcro pouch under one of the seats. Could come in handy for a secret stash place actually, I put the allen wrench back in there so I wouldn't lose it. Follow directions make sure you put the slanted legs where they belong and then your all set .You dont need ANY tools they provide you with an Allen wrench.The seats incline individually at different angles making it great to put your feet up on a table or futon ( a must for comfort) This is what saves this futon.Watching tv with it tlled back is very comfy I never would have bought one but i had NO choice a couch would NOT fit either in the door or on the wall space allotted It just made it as it is . I really miss having arms to lay my head on even watching tv lying down. I fell asleep on my cozy couch EVERY night then went to bed. befoe i moved and got stuck with a love seat which was impossible to ay down on Im 5;11\" This is fine. Well i purposely slept on it 2 nights in a row now and woke up feeling like i slept on the floor. iIts is VERY stiff and uncomfortable to lay on over night. Both nights i ended up back in my bed . and let out a sigh of relief when i got there. .And you do feel the gap . Now granted i have been sleeping on a 2500 Tempurpedic for the last 12 years so i am very spoiled but this is just not comfortable at all . My back still hurts and it 12 noon . If i had a guest id give them my bed and sleep on the futon )unless i didn't want them to stay :) ) So if you want something that looks fantastic and seems well built which is great for TV you will be fine, but If you plan on sleeping on it every night STOP & look elsewhere . I read some people say it will soften up ? I dont see how but i sure hope it does I bought this based on the reviews and it was on sale Im happy with what I got I just wish it was a little softer. I guess I could get a foam top for guests. I couldn't tell you if i would recommend otr not it depends on what you want to use if for so thats why i put no but this is my firsrt futon maybe they are all like this", 
    "I just moved into a new studio apartment and was in need of smaller furniture. This sofa looked like it could kill two birds with one stone. I had hoped to find a sofa and a bed for guests. The idea behind this cool looking sofa is great. However, it does not deliver as well. For the first day, it was comfortable to sit on. Afterwards, I feel like the cushion wasn't soft or firm. Rather, it seemed like it was sinking in and I could feel the metal below the cushion. To say that it's uncomfortable is an understatement. However, when it's down like a bed, it's not as bad (not good but not as bad). For the money, I'd get a real sofa or at least one from XXXX.", 
    "This sofa bed is good for all purpose and we love it. Whether you want to use it mainly for decoration of your room or really use it as a sofa bed, it does all the trick. The camel color is some thing different and looks great! Material used are very good for the price. Also the ability to move around the house or packaged in half and transport by the car are all bonuses other sofa bed could not match! Can't get any better!", 
    "The sofa folds and extends easily. But after using for a while, the cushion in the sofa sinks and doesn't feel as comfortable as before.", 
    "The item was delivered to us the same week wee order it, as fast as our other orders for the small items, very surprised and very pleased! Love the modern impression and rich color. I tried to sleep on it the other night, and it very nice and comfy. The cushion hold up very well, just a little firm, so I would recommend to put a soft mattress topper to add more comfort to it. The price is very good, my money was well spent. You can not find this type of sofa bed at this quality at this price, period.", 
    "This sofa bed is super nice and we love it! The color is amazingly beautiful! The overall quality is great and the price is a steal for me. Again, we were attracted by the color and look of this sofa bed, and really there is no better looking sofa bed out there, thumbs up!", 
    "Received this as a present from my mom recently. The leatherette color is the most exciting and beautiful I can ever imagined. Very functional and great as a bed for my visitors. The size is a little compact, but is perfect for my apartment. Great quality all the way.", 
    "This sofa bed is placed in our play room for the kids. I choose this sofa is because it offers good value at affordable price and its has rich color that is exciting for the kids. Good thing is, although colorful, it still look good and does not appear cheap at all. It took only 5 minutes to set up, just unpack the box and attach the legs. It folds into a bed with just one click, how convenient. I will use a mattress topper to make it more comfortable for the sleep overs. Really appreciate this sofa bed.", 
    "We love the look and color. It unique and does not look cheap at all. It's easy to put together and takes just seconds to folds back into either a reclined or bed. The fabric is soft and seems high end. The sofa sits a bit lower to the ground for me. Otherwise, this sofa is perfect and offers fantastic value.", 
    "This was a simple yet unique compact sofa bed. It required just little assembly (put on the legs with hardware that comes with it). It looks expensive and sleek. It's good enough for my vistors to slept on a coupkle of nights, they told me its a little firm but comfortable enough for a temporary bed. As some of the reviews suggested, I should add some soft padding on top to make it perfect. Personally, I enjoy the fabric, color, and style combination this sofa bed offers, and I received many compliment already since I got it.", 
    "This sofa bed is crazy nice, I am obsessed with the color! The quality is great as well as the price, really cost effecive. And the look is no doubt the better ones out there 9if not the best). Again, the color is just amazing, especially when I see it in person, its a pleasure just to look at it!", 
    "Received the sofa bed within three days after placed my order. The design and color is amazingly good, even better than I expected. It is fairly comfortable as well. This sofa bed appears to offers good value and quality, and the unique camel color combine with modern style has absolutely hit the jackpot!", 
    "I bought this sofa bed for our playroom, which mostly used by our two kids. I wanted something that looks good but because its for kids, so didn't want to over spent, and this sofa bed turn out to be the perfect choice. This sofa come with bright color that is attractive and at the same time not overwhelmed. Its durable and easy to clean character makes our life much easier. It was very easy to put together and move around. I love this functional sofa bed and so glad I found it.", 
    "Great futon sofa bed. Cushions are sofa and thick for comfortable use. I tossed few small pillows on it to make it look even more fun and also more comfortable to sit on. The recline position is nice and useful as well. The assembly was easy, just attach the legs. Everything works well as it should. This sofa bed is fun to look at and is a good choice for homes with kids/pets, since the fabric is easy to maintain and clean with leather cleaner. Highly recommended.", 
    "We really like the look of this futon sofa. It does not look cheap at all (although it is cheap in price), and it feels like a high-end sofa. It's easy to put together and folds back into either a reclined or bed in just one click. The faux leather feels high end and soft, and it does not have any pleather smell or stickiness. Even better is you don't have to hurt any animals to make your house look stylish. The sofa sits a bit lower to the ground for me, so if you plan to use it with other funiture in your home, you'll pronbably need a lower coffee table and/or side tables to go with it. Otherwise, this sofa really is perfect and offers great value!", 
    "I bought this sofa bed for our game room. I wanted something that looks good and has more unique and rich fun color, and this was it! Its the perfect sofa that catch the eyes but not overwhelming. This sofa seems durable and easy to clean. It was very easy to put together and to be move around the game room when needed. I love this functional sofa bed mainly due to its unbeatable value, its almost too good to be truer sure. When a visitor comes, we use a mattress topper to make it even more comfortable for sleeping, and it works well. Again, this is a great value, no doubt.", 
    "This was a great found. It required very little assembly; just put on the legs and thats it. It looks much more expensive than it actually is and this moden piece makes a lovely addition to our home office. However, it's only for the occasional guest and not intended for for frequent overnights use, because all sofa bed are hard and are not replacement of proper bed, and this one is no exception. With all that said, this sofa is relatiively soft and confortable. We put a memory foam topper on which makes iit more comfortable to sleep on. I am very happy overall and would purchase this item aagin for sure!", 
    "Received the sofa bed within three days after purchase. I love the modern looks and nice color, and it is fairly comfy. The cushion hold up very well compare to the ones I had before. All sofa beds will deflats over time, but this one seems to be very durable, so it should last a long time. The built quality is very good. The price is even better. I don't believe you can get any better at this price range. The bottom line is, you will not find this unique color modern style sofa bed any where else!", 
    "This sofa bed is exactly what I was looking for, great looking and soft feel fabrics. We love the rich but mature camel color finish, and we received plenty of good comments from our visitors. It's relatively small than your usual sofa, but that's exactly what a sofa bed is. It fits comfortably in our den. My guest slept on it for a few nights and he slept well. I did add a thin pad on top of it to prevent stain and provide more comfort. A tall person might not feel comfortably due to the length of the sofa bed but that was expected when I read the dimensions. Super easy to set upby just attaching the legs with the screws provided. I am very pleased with this purchase!.", 
    "Received the sofa bed within two days. I love the looks and color, it is fairly comfortable as well. The cushion hold up very well compare to the ones I had before. But my advice to every body is ALL sofa beds will deflats over time, that's from my past experience. So I don't belive this one will be any different, therefore with good quality like this one, I would be happy if this one last me longer than a year. All that said, I have very high expectation towards this sofa bed, because it seems to be very well built, and the quality is very good compare to others I had before. Again, this sofa bed offers good value and quality, and the unique camel color with modern style that is hard to find!", 
    "The sofa looks beautiful and very contemporary. The leatherette is soft, beautiful, and rich. And also looks and feels like real leather. The color is just unique and perfect. The sofa is a liitle firm, but still within comfortable range. I gues this should enhance the durability of this sofa. Overall speaking, this is very very good value sofa.", 
    "I ordered this couch sofa bed because I had just moved into a new apartment with no furniture, and my family were coming to visit. I figured that I would use this sofa bed for the time being because this was the best price I willing to spent at the moment and pretty sure I would up grade to some thing else if I could in the future. But now I have decided i am definitely going to kee this sofa as long as possible. It's comfortable, good looking, and had no problem sleeping on it. It was very easy to assemble, What a great deal.", 
    "Great sofa bed for the money, well designed. Love the rich camel color, natural and not fake at all. Could not ask for more.", 
    "The product arrived quickly. I put it together in ten minutes. It looks great in our guest room. It's comfortable to sit on. We haven't had anyone sleep on it yet. And we really aren't in that room very much. But it looks great. We are very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I am very pleased with the quality of the product for the price paid. The material is very soft and the color is even prettier than I expected. It is not a huge futon but is a fine size for a small room.", 
    "I bought a similar style sofa bed from a retail chain stores. And then we took that back because the quality was really just unacceptable. For about the same price we brought this sofa bed and this time its spot on and we are very happy with the quality. This sofa bed has the perfect look combined with fashionable colors, so nice! The material is very soft. I would say if your looking for a sofa bed that looks expensive but is actually not, this is the one to go.", 
    "I bought this sofa bed for my kids playroon. I wanted something that is colorful but does not look cheap. This sofa bed fit the bill perfectly, its modern style looked good and fabric used is very durable. It was super easy to put together, just unpack the box and attach the legs. I love it and the value can't be beat. It folds into a bed with just one click away. I will use a mattress topper to make it more comfortable for sleeping. Home run with this purchase.", 
    "This sofa bed futon is a great product from every aspect! Its great looking with unique color finish. And funtional while still managed to keep its in good size so its not overwelmingly big. The quality is all the way up there, could not aks for better at this price range. One need to realise that No sofa bed I is really soft, when they soft, they become clumsy, and you don't want that. So the sofa bed is at the firm side, but not bad at all. The material is a really nice PU, which has the look of leather but much easier to manage. These days, all you want is a sofa bed with good PU, and luckily this one does come with a good quality PU that is softer, tougher and better looking. The material used for this sofa bed felt so wonderful and expensive. I am very happy.", 
    "We brought two units of this futon sofa bed, and are very happy with the purchase. Good size for apartment home, color is amazingly nice and rich, simple lines but stylish. just can't copmplain any thing about this sofa. What a great buy!", 
    "We've had this sofa for few weeks now and we enjoy it so much. It's as good as we would like it to be and the price for this sofa bed is just such a steal. It looks as good as in the photos, need I say more? The sofa bed is really sturdy and I like the fact it has center support legs where some of the others sofas does not have. The material quality is good and very durable. Love it.", 
    "very soft material and quite comfortable. I haven't have someone sleep on it yet. only used as a sofa. although it looks very nice, I am not if it will last. after a month of using it, I can see the gap in the middle became wider and I'm a tiny person. But considering the price I paid, it's a good sofa.", 
    "Great futon. Cushions are thick enough for comfortable use as a sofa. I just threw several decorator pillows on it to soften the lines and make it more comfortable to slouch on. The recline position is nice. The assembly was easy and everything popped into position as it should. A good choice for homes with young kids and or pets, since the surface cleans easily.", 
    "I bought this sofa bed for my kids playroom. I wanted something that looked good with bright fun color but also durable and easy to clean. It was very easy to put together and move around. I love this functional sofa bed and the value can't be beat, that is for sure. It folds into a bed with one click. When there is a visitor, we do use a mattress topper to make it even more comfortable for sleeping. Absolutely delighted with this purchase.", 
    "This sofa bed is a super comfortable in both sofa or bed position. The design is very good with clean lines and modern feel. The base is very very stable with 6 legs to provide plenty of support. The modern look and nice color provides plenty of style. Great value for money.", 
    "For the price, this was the perfect choice for my new apatment. May apatment is small but has open spaces that goes with contemporary style. This camlel color fits the bill perfectly, I love the unique color and still look great with other furniture i have. The style is contemporary, but without a cold feeling. I couldn't find anything contemporary that looked comfortable, until I found this futon.Couldn't be happier.", 
    "The sofa bed is very well made and good looking. The sofa bed has a very good value when considering the price it cost. My previous sofa bed was not this good, infact, its not even close, and its cost twice the pricel. This sofa bed provides firm support to both back and the sitting area, they are firm but they are comfortable to sit on. I would like the cushion to be a little softer, but I know for a fact firmmer seating will last longer and provide good support. The special (secret) feature I love about this sofa bed is you can take the legs off, and actually fold it into a relatively small rectangular cube and use it as a big ottoman. Or you can also make it an ottoma first and then flip one of the back up to form a single seat chair (provided you take the legs off). In other words, this sofa can be transformed into a sofa, chair or ottoman. What a clever design! This also made moving very easy. I feel so lucky to made the righ choice.", 
    "I love the color of this sofa bed. Unique and rich but not overwhelmed. I really think the actual sofa look better than in the pictures. Great price, could not find any better at this price. Gorr quality and comfortable, a tad firmer at the begining. Contemporaty style is the best, yet does not look cheap.", 
    "This was a great purchase. It required very little easy assembly; just put on the legs. It looks much more expensive than the purchase price and makes a lovely addition to our library corner. However, it's only for the occasional guest and not for many multiple nights for sleeping as it it hard. We put a memory foam topper on which makes it a bit more bearable for those relegated to sofabed for the night. It's still a lot cheaper than a hotel!", 
    "We love our futon sofa bed. We purchased the unique Camel pu-leather and its great. Easy to maintain and high quality feel. Priced very well... Nice design and perfect sofa for our modern guestroom. I am a happy customer!", 
    "i was looking for a quick delivery and inexpensive convertible for a home office. i did lots of research on 2 major websites and the reviews were all horrendous on other products. this one happened to be a favorable review so i tried my luck. it was packaged so well it took a longer time to unpack (carefully! DO NOT USE SHARP ITEM AS YOU MAY TEAR LEATHERETTE AS STATED ON PACKAGE! which i luckily saw) than it did to put together...seriously a half an hour at best and very easy! 2 people to unwrap 1 to assemble :) the chrome legs are a nice design and the overall contemporary look and color is wonderful. sitting is comfortable, not hard as other styles were reviewed. here come the howevers.... i am petite and i just fit laying down...not for a tall person to sleep on, their legs will hang off the edge... and i had to open windows for days to air out the fake leather chemical smell (alarming to me) and the leatherette is kinda stretchy hahaha maybe that's why it's comfotable. also i wish overstock would post the list of origin on their products this one is made in CHINA. overall though i am happy with the product for the need i had to fill.", 
    "This is a great sofa bed! Impressive quality and good comfort. Convenient for living quarters. Very sturdy. My favorite thing is the nice looking style with fun color that modernize my apartment. Again, I am very impressed!", 
    "As a designer, I choose this futon sofa bed for a model home I worked on. It is work out to be perfect! We have received many inquiries as to where to purchase this sofa bed. I will definitely use this sofa bed again for the future project.", 
    "Received the sofa bed within no time after ordered. I love how it looks and it is fairly comfy, the cushion hold up very well compare to the ones I had before. But I have to warn you, from my past experience, ALL sofa beds will deflats over time, and I don't belive this one will be any different, so I would be happy if this one last me longer than a year. All that said, I have high expectation towards this sofa bed, because it seems to be very well built, and the quality is very good. The price is great, when you compare this sofa bed with others, and this one comes with unique color and modern style that I could not find else where!", 
    "Delivery came right on expected ship date, came in perfect condition...I was surprised by how relatively small the box was, this sofa folds in half for easy moving/shipping which is great for when we have to move. Love it perfect for small narrow room. Use to sleep our son when he visits, but certainly could be used in a Living Room as great decor.", 
    "This sofa bed is exactly what I was looking for, a beautiful look and feel. We love the rich and unique color and have already gotten good comments on it. It's small and fits comfortably in my relatively small living room. My brother slept on it for a few nights and slept well, I've taken naps on it and I find it a little hard but still pretty comfy. A tall person might not fit on it comfortably due to the length of the sofa bed but that was expected when I read the dimensions. Super easy to set upby just attaching the legs with the screws provided....I am very pleased with this purchase!.", 
    "Bought this as a sleeper sofa for our living room- looks really great and happy about that but seat is really hard and almost unbearable to sleep on. Also one of our front corner and one middle leg cracked out of the frame and the whole thing collapsed- we have it sitting on 2 piles of books in those locations now until I have time to go buy some 3rd party sofa legs and replace them all. And this is only after 4 months and we don't use it very hard at all. Just one skinny couple and 2 cats. The frame is particle board and the screws holding the legs just shredded out of it. I would put this in a room that gets little use for looks but its not an every day comfy sofa and I'd only have people sleep on it if you don't want them to stick around too long ;)", 
    "LOVE the color and quality of the sofa bed, very beautiful. Soft PU fabric almost like real leather, but much easier to maintain. A little hard at the begining, but breaks in and became soft nicely. Overall quality and look is awsome, I would expect to pay much more if I gets to see this sofa in person before purchase.", 
    "The sofa looks beautiful--very contemporary. The leatherette is soft, beautiful, and looks and feels like real leather. The color is perfect. The sofa, though is very hard and I always get a shock when first sitting on it. A softer, fuller-filled futon would have been better.", 
    "Very fast shipping. Very easy to put together. Looks very modern and the color is beautiful, just what you see in the showcases. Is well worth it. Multifunctional as a guest bed or futon/sofa. The only thing is that it is not long enough so do make sure of the desirable length.", 
    "When I received this there was a tear in the front, unfortunately they were out of stock so I glued it and it stayed fine. It is pretty comfortable. Haven't had anyone sleep on it yet. The carmel color is very nice.", 
    "Easy to assemble, looks good, very happy with purchase!", 
    "I love this modern look sofa bed. It been a while since we received it, it look as good as when it first arrived, very durable and easy to maintain. The modern design and the material it used makes this sofa bed look even more attractive in person, just love the rich \"Camel\" color. The fact this ofe baed can be converted into a low profile bed is great, guest won't be worried from falling off the bed and gets injured. It can also be converted into a much smaller cube and stored some where else in our play room is great. Very clever design and confortable seating. Very happy!", 
    "Horrible Quality....the color is very pretty and the look of the futon is too. However quality is very very poor! Don't waste your money"
