    "Very happy with this purchase. Also bought the love seat. Yes, this is a bit firm but a comfortable firm. Easy to get out of rather than sinking into a sofa that someone has to help you off. Nicely constructed, very easy to put together. All pieces matched perfectly in color which concerned me. Would recommend for a room that is used less often. Not a sink into, fall asleep on style. Rather a sit and visit type of furniture. Again, very happy for what we are using it for.", 
    "Easy to put together, simple look but a little stiff when you first buy it", 
    "I love my living room ..this the perfect pieces for my space ...", 
    "I bought this chair as a corner reading chair for my son's room. It arrived in good condition and was very easy to put together. It looks nice and the ivory color is beautiful. I only give the product an average rating despite it's other fine points because it is truly an uncomfortable chair so I would not recommend it for an area where longer term sitting is planned such as a tv room. I think the cushion quality is not unexpected for the low price point.", 
    "So comfortable and looks great! Fits well in a smaller room. It has a low profile so it's perfect in a great room where you look from the kitchen into the living room.", 
    "Purchased this chair in September of 2015. Delivery was great came earlier than anticipated. Chair was a breeze to put together, the pieces just lock together. Loved the look, it is a very stylish piece of furniture. does not look cheap. The cushion was a little firm, but that's okay, I just figured it would hold it's shape longer. BOY WAS I WRONG. I work over 10 hours a day, So I don't get to enjoy my furniture much. The seat cushion started to lose it's shape within the first 3 months. I was very disappointed when I tried to flip the cushion and discovered, that would not be an option.. the cushion is not reversible. I Really love this chair. I may have to find a way to replace the insert on the seat cushion, if I'm going to continue to sit in this chair.", 
    "The chair looks great in my new livingroom however it is VERY firm. Luckily it's more for looks than for sitting on. Very easy to put together", 
    "Arrived in time for Thanksgiving company. People have written that it is hard to sit on but I like the firmness. It looks quite tailored. It was so easy to put together, I'm delighted with it. I got the color ... that looks like wheat. My chair matches this picture exactly.", 
    "This is a great chair for the price. It wasn't as soft initially but is more comfortable now. The color is a little different than what is pictured but matches well.", 
    "Looks good but not the most comfortable chair. The cushion is very firm.", 
    "We purchased the chair just over a month ago. The chair arrived on time and was easy to put together. The color the shape was exactly as it shows on the picture. I am writing this because, sometimes when you buy a product online, the product on the picture and in reality do not much. I would give 5 stars, but the cushion is already having the shape of someone sitting on. I would have liked a little better quality. Still like it though and would recommend it.", 
    "The chair arrived before the estimated date. Assembly took all of three minutes after unpacking, very simple procedure...the color is perfect, and fits in perfectly in our family room...we are so pleased with this purchase. The seat is very firm, but seems to relax after use...just turn pouncing children, or grandchildren upon them, and they do take upon the proper feel of comfort...we are so pleased, and have ordered an additional chair and sofa...indeed, the family room in the rectory is most comfortable and conducive to wonderful fellowship...we highly recommend Overstock.com!", 
    "Beautiful color (white linen) and decent quality for the price. Goes with everything. I bought the sofa too and might get the loveseat.", 
    "I love this chair & so do my guest. It was delivered & I had no problem assembling it. Goes very well with my decor in my living room. Thinking of purchasing another for my bedroom.", 
    "stiff, not as pictures, but easy to assemble", 
    "It's a bit firm, but I'm hoping it will soften up in time. The color is not white, however. It's more of an eggshell color.", 
    "Asthetically, this is a nice chair. The cushion is a bit firm and it is a modular piece of furniture but what do you expect for the price? If you're looking for a nice looking piece of furniture that won't break the bank, this arm chair will do the job.", 
    "We purchased this chair mainly because of the look and the price. It was really easy to assemble as it uses sliding metal brackets instead of screws. Only take a few minutes. It looks just like the picture. The only downside is that it's rather hard so sitting isn't the most comfortable. We will rarely use it so that's not an issue for us.", 
    "It looks good - not the best quality but I wan't looking for that. If this is your everyday furniture i would skip it and spend a little more. For me this sits in a sitting area in my front room and works perfect for occasional use. Pretty lines and color is true to picture.", 
    "Bought two of them. I like these chairs.", 
    "not big enough...but it's good.", 
    "Ive had this chair for about a month now, it a nice addition to my living room. It is pretty and is what I expected from the picture. I read other reviews before i purchased that warned me the seat cushion was a little firm but that it holds up well. I agree it is a firm seat, but still comfortable to sit in. As far as price I believe it is as good as chairs in furniture stores that would cost $$$ dollars more", 
    "Nice, but quite firm. A bit modular.", 
    "Great chair\u2026 Great Shape and color\u2026 Great Value", 
    "Color: perfect, design: perfect, linen fabric: perfect. It is a bit firmer than I anticipated, but still a very useful piece at the right price.", 
    "Lower quality, but great buy", 
    "one chair is fine- 2nd chair missing the bracket required to assemble. I am still waiting to see if anyone at overstock is going to do anything about it or if I'm stuck with a chair no one can sit in. Also - clearly a fastener has come off the back bracket - it rattles. I really don't want furniture that rattles! Looks good though! It appears I'll just have to take it up with my bank.", 
    "I needed chairs for my family room. Had to be compact but nice looking. They fit the bill. Took back another set from other store as they looked cheep. These look more expensive than they were. Again overstock comes through.", 
    "Needed a neutruel color for my living room. Very nice material. Linen blend is classy looking. Ordered one for myself then my husband wanted one too! Got an excellent deal on both. Very easy to put together. Sturdy construction. Shipping was really quick. Would recommend.", 
    "This chair looks very nice and was easy to put together but the back of the chair is short and it is not very uncomfortable to sit on. The cushion was firm, but has loosened up some. I've had it for about 2 months. I would love it if the back was a little taller. I am 5'4 and it just does not work for me."
