    "This is my 2nd purchase of the same bookcase. I wanted two. The 2nd purchase came with both side panels cracked; but replacement of the pieces was simple enough. Customer representative was helpful and efficient. I did not have to wait long for the replacement pieces to arrive. The bookcase looks really nice and can be easily incorporated into any room. I purchased them for my library and it made the room look organized. There's enough shelf space (depending on how you arrange the height of the shelves) for a good size amount of books. I had a lot of books and they all fit.", 
    "These bookshelves are wonderful. Very classy. Lots of room. I love the drawer at the bottom. Some people complained that the back panel is too flimsy but it is undetectable really. The only problem with the flimsy back is that it doesn't add to the bookcase stability. This may become troublesome as it ages. But all in all...a fabulous bookcase at a fabulous price!", 
    "My husband and I are very pleased with this bookcase - it looks great and holds a ton of books. Also it comes included with the no tip strap for those of you with little ones at home (we have a two year old, so this was definitely a positive for us). I would definitely recommend this to someone if you're looking for a nice bookcase to add to your house.", 
    "This is a stylish book case and looks very nice for the price! I did want black but this dark color matches fine. We thought it was of average time and difficulty to put together. The adjustable shelves make it very functional.", 
    "Easy to assemble, looks amazing in my husband's new home office. He likes it so much we ordered another one!", 
    "This bookshelf appears more expensive than it actually cost. The back appeared somewhat flimsy so decided not to attach it. I love seeing the paint color now through the back opening. Very happy with this piece.", 
    "The product its self is convenient to what I am using for , but I received damaged and, with some missing parts such as screws.", 
    "Purchased this for my home office. As a tech professional I have several reference books and items of geekdom, the books occupy all but the top shelf which displays my office accents....", 
    "Looks good after you put together. It wasn't easy and I did not know I would have to put it together. It would be helpful if it stated next to an item that it has to be put together n", 
    "Great bookcase easy to put together. Door for the drawer came all scratched up. I contacted the original manufacture and they sent me a new drawer face no problem.", 
    "I was expecting this bookcase to be better quality after I read the reviews. I am currently using it in my living room, but intend to replace it with something more substantial. The drawer does not fit tightly so there is a space at the top edge where light shines through. It would be fine for office or family room storage.", 
    "Bought this item for my 26 year old daughter and she loves it!", 
    "Don't waste your time and money. Took a while to assemble and the quality is poor. The backing is very thin and it had scratches on it from shipping.", 
    "This is a lovely bookcase. Strong plus a deep rich color. I would recommend this.", 
    "love these bookcases. nice quality.", 
    "It was easy to make. Took about an hour. Look really great and would totally buy it again.", 
    "I was so excited to receive these for my office, but such a disappointment!! One of the shelves on this came damaged. The directions are incredibly difficult to understand. After hours of trying, we could not get the pieces to tighten. Its really not a very good piece of furniture, I am sending it back.", 
    "Very happy with the bookcases (ordered two!). Only issue was left side panel on both arrived damaged. Replacement parts were sent immediately.", 
    "Very nice bookcase. I put it together myself in under an hour and it looks great (true white) and is really solid. The drawer at the bottom is a nice touch. A about Overstock - the item arrived with a damaged shelf. One five minute call to Overstock customer service to explain and they quickly sent me a replacement shelf. Really outstanding customer service.", 
    "Perfect color matches my bedroom perfectly. Easy to put together. Very pleased.", 
    "Items are damage. Unsure how to get some parts replaced as they are damaged.", 
    "I ordered two of these for my dining room, and I love them! I may order a third.", 
    "This set is exactly what I needed", 
    "It was not difficult to put together but it does require patience. It was not a problem for me but my fiance gave up after 40 mins of trying to figure this out. The instructions were not extremely easy. If you're handy with putting furniture together....this is not a challenge. If you're not, you'll need help.", 
    "Solid, heavy piece of furniture - deep \"espresso\" color, convenient drawer. Back is a thin piece of wood but looks like the rest and probably saves on weight of the overall bookcase. Works great so far.", 
    "Nice piece of furniture. Easy to put together. Solid, well built. Highly recommend.", 
    "Would buy again; Nice looking and sturdy; I did have a few left over pieces of hardware, but overall, I'm happy with this piece of furniture. I like the back pieces that a few people remarked about in their review as being flimsy. These add greatly to the piece and are well secured to the bookcase so seem sturdy enough to me. Great buy for just over $200.", 
    "Very functional. Wish the back was solid wood as well. Drawer is a nice feature.", 
    "I have now purchased four, yes four of these and love them! They look just as shown, not as heavy as I would've liked but still sturdy. I use three of them in my closet, and one in my son's room to replace one of his dressers so to organize clothes, etc. They are easy to put together and quick, worth it! Tried to post a pic but it wouldn't allow. Enjoy! \ud83d\udc4c", 
    "The product was ordered and came within a couple of days. It even looks better after assembled. I would most definitely recommend this item for home or office. The brown color is a deep chocolate.", 
    "This is one of two I purchased and the black color, along with the height and sturdiness makes for a perfect room. I'll buy another for my office later.", 
    "This book case was easy to assemble. All parts were in the box and it was delivered timely. I thought it was dark brown but the black is OK. It worked well in my basement.", 
    "I purchased 3 of these bookshelves to use in my spa to display product on. One of the bookshelves came with a huge gouge taken out of the shelf. They chip VERY easily. They wood is several different colors in obvious places. I will be lucky if these shelves last me 6 months. Do NOT buy.", 
    "This is a heavy bookcase and was easy to put together. Loved the end product but was missing the side pieces to the drawer...called the factory and 2 weeks later have the pieces. Was just disappointed the factory did not do a thorough inspection before packaging.", 
    "it's made quite well, it's sturdy so you can fill it up with books. Good for a student's room or a small library.", 
    "I would give it 5 stars as I really like the unit. I bought it for my daughter's room and I love that the shelves are adjustable to accommodate larger books. Two of the adjustable shelves were cracked on one side. Overstock was able to send replacement shelves so it all worked out in the end. Other than the damaged shelves, there was nothing else to criticize. It was easy to assemble.", 
    "Our granddaughter loves her new book shelf. My husband put it together with no problem at all. The only part which needs improvement is the back. It's just not good quality, and in order to not see the seams from the front he used black magic marker to cover the seams.", 
    "Very sturdy materials and construction. Nice looking and as described. Fairly easy to assemble.", 
    "very nice piece of furniture, my husband loves it it is very heavy so will need few people to bring in the house , true to color and was great price", 
    "Da Vinci book case is very deep and has wider shelves. We love the color black furniture. It can hold a lot of stuff. It has a bigger space and has a drawer at the bottom. I purchased this product for my son not for books but for all of his assembled Legos, infinity electronic games and what not. My son used the drawers to put all his TV remote, Wii stuff and Pokemon cards. I would highly recommend this product to other customers and buyers.", 
    "Extremely well built and sturdy. Good looking. Relatively easy to assemble.", 
    "Nice sized bookcase with drawer. Fairly solid in build. I am satisfied.", 
    "we bought two of these and they look grand.......the finish is very nice", 
    "Great quality. I marked it down a bit on quality only because one of the side panels came in slightly cracked. But I called the company and they send one out so I received it within a week or so. Very sophisticated look!", 
    "this was exactly what I was looking for. I like that it has a drawer on the bottom. it looks great in my son's room.", 
    "Nice bookcase. The packaging was great, especially for a product with this much weight and size. There were no damage pieces. I didn't receive the package on schedule but that was due to inclement weather during the week of its arrival. There was one sour note i had concerning this product. The instructions that came with it are really confusing, especially if you are not adept at putting this type of product together.", 
    "Sturdy construction and easy to assemble. I agree with others who have stated the 'backing is flimsy\" so I decided not to use it. The two fixed shelves and the top provide enough stability the backing is not really required. Other than that I'm impressed with the quality.... a true value for my money. Although my bookcase arrived unscathed I thought the packaging was poor. The ends were well protected but there was very little protection from damage to the sides and a reasonable potential for arriving damaged.", 
    "I have not begun using it yet. It's just that I keep getting these pesky emails from overstock that I still need to write a review. It was easy enough to put together with two people. I wouldn't recommend someone trying it alone. The color and finish is good. It is heavy. I hope it holds up better than the pressed board ones I had before. When I've been using them for a month or so, then I'll be able to say.", 
    "I really liked the look of this bookcase and didn't care that it was part of a baby collection. It was easy to assemble and didn't have any damage, For a couple of steps I had a little help but it wasn't totally necessary. I am thinking of buying a second one.", 
    "We are happy with the finished product. We really didn't realize we had to assemble all of it, but it worked out pretty well.", 
    "It is good quality, easy to assemble and is currently holding plenty of weight. The bookcase shipped promptly and arrived in good condition. The only improvement would be a piece of wood for the back instead of composite cardboard.", 
    "the assembly was good but each piece was not labeled, therefore took longer to put together and had to work backwards, meaning I had to put the drawers in last instead of first.", 
    "Looking for a nice solid bookshelf for daughter in college and this fit the bill. Very sturdy and nicely finished. Directions simple to follow and this was easy to put together requiring only a Phillips head screwdriver. My only complaint is the heavy cardboard back. I wish something more like wood would have been used instead of the cardboard. Especially since the quality of the bookshelf was so good. Overall I would buy again!", 
    "We are retired with some physical disabilities but we were able to put this bookcase together. Directions were easy to understand, minimal mechanical ability required (use screwdriver). Quality of \"wood\" better than most we have seen.", 
    "Relatively easy to put together, sturdy materials, and beautiful design.", 
    "This is a great bookshelf and looks nice in my daughters room. however, now that she is a toddler and into everything, i wish it had come with extra parts to help secure the shelves. My near two year old climbed on the bottom and managed to pull a shelf down. It was an easy fix so I still give the shelpf good ratingings. its heavy and doesnt seem like particle board thrown together to \"look nice\" then fall apart a few weeks later. Highly suggest...just keep curious toddlers away.", 
    "Beautiful addition to my kitchen. Great workmanship and easy to assemble. Thank you Overstock for supplying such quality products at a reasonable price.", 
    "This is very sturdy, and looks 3 or 4 times more expensive. If I needed another, I would buy this again.", 
    "Very heavy and sturdy. Love the added storage the drawer provides. Arrived quickly and undamaged.", 
    "I expected a scuff or a scratch or something....NOTHING. This bookcase arrived in perfect condition.", 
    "What a surprise. I did research online and local furniture stores, and found this bookcase met my expectation. Beautiful color and good quality, easy assemble, great price. Just love it.", 
    "This is a solid piece. Nice finish and very easy to put together. Customer Service is outstanding too. when my shipment arrived, there were two pieces that were damaged. I notified Customer Service through the online chat and replacement parts were shipped out in two days. I am very happy with the quality of the bookcase and even happier with the service.", 
    "The bookcase arrived after about week, the directions were fairly simple for me to decipher. The case holds lots of books ect. I am pondering getting another one for more additional space. Just like any boxed items these days though, you open the box up inside, expect to be cleaning up lots of little white styrofoam pieces. My unit had a few dings in the wood as well. Nice but a shade high on the pricing in my opinion.", 
    "I'm a 24 your old female and this took me about 2 hours to put together by myself. Directions are good, And it's the most beautiful, and sturdy book case I've ever owned. Very happy with this purchase! Thanks Overstock!", 
    "The bookcase arrived in good shape and was received before the expected date. The instructions should be clearer, but I was able to figure everything out on my own. As someone in their mid-sixties who had never put together furniture, I was amazed that I was able to put it together all by myself. I was not familiar with the bolt locks but once I figured how they worked, they were very easy to install. The bookcase is of high quality. I am happy with how it looks. My only negative comment is in regard to the backing section; the quality doesn't match the bookcase. I plan to glue some type of covering on the backing and I think it will look better. Overstock.com is great."
