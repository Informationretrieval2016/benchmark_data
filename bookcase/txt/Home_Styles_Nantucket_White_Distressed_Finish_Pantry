the Nantucket collection. A lightly sanded and distressed white
finish creates a charming ambiance, while a combination of six
shelves and one drawer provide ample storage space. Though

sight in any room of your home.Materials: Hardwood solids, engineered woodsFinish: Sanded and distressed whiteStorage drawerAntique brushed nickel hardwareDimensions: 71.5 inches high x 30 inches wide x 16 inches
