    "The style of these chairs are classy but the manufacturing is very poor. They are made in China and the workmanship is horrible. I ordered 6 chairs and the finish on 3 of the wooden seats is damaged. It appears they may have been packaged before the top coat finish dried and the top coat is rubbed off in several spots. Not afraid to assemble furniture but good luck lining up pilot holes. The back metal support holes do not line up and it required drilling a larger hole to match up to the chair leg. The pilot holes for the wooden seats to attach to the metal frame were non-existent or drilled in the incorrect location. There are suppose to be 2 pilot holes in the back and one in the front of the seat - holes were reversed. My husband was able to drill proper holes for assembly but the wooden seats are unacceptable. Working with Overstock to remedy but I can not get just the wooden seats so I am stuck refinishing the ones I have or receiving new chairs to scavenge parts. There is no guarantee the new seats won't have the same problem. If you do not have the ability or interest in fixing these chairs do NOT purchase them. And, if you are willing to take the chance, best of luck to you.", 
    "Purchased these for our new kitchen table and was pleasantlysurprised with the great style of these chairs. Theywere very easy to assemble, I do not understandsome of the reviews about miss drilled holes. Theseat bases come with no holes so that the suppliedscrews bite into the wood base. I screwed the screwsright into the base with no problem and no pilot hole.Highly recommend them for great on a budget.I have received many compliments on them already.", 
    "was missing 1 bolt but not major, look very modern", 
    "I didn't notice at first, but the arched metal that connects the back legs to the seat is missing. I sure wish I had noticed in time to do something about it. They are nice chairs, I still use them.", 
    "I was worried when reading the other reviews. But once the chairs were put together, we love them! They go great with our farmhouse table. We ordered one set and once they were put together, we went ahead and ordered a second set. The assembly was easy. We had only one screw that was misaligned, fortunately it is in a non-required area.", 
    "These chairs don't assemble well and weren't even with the floor when assembled. Low quality and poor craftsmanship.", 
    "Very poor quality. Returning. Not cheap, either!", 
    "I love these chairs. This is the look and style I was looking for. They are sturdy, comfortable and make a nice statement. Lots of compliments too!Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "They are good, average quality. we kept them but they were not quite what I was expecting .", 
    "They were exactly what I was looking for. They don't match the other chairs, but the seats match and that was what I was looking for. I've had so many compliments on them already. May end up with 2 more!", 
    "These chairs are really nice and I love them! The distressing on a few was a little weird, but not totally noticeable. Still really love them!", 
    "Ordered a total of 4 chairs. These went together easily and look terrific with my industrial vintage decor.", 
    "Quality and stylish for a good price.", 
    "Sturdy and easy to clean.", 
    "Looks just like some a friend bought at a high end retailer for 5x the price! Sturdy and stylish!", 
    "I bought these chairs before reading the other reviews. I was worried because several reviews stated how hard they were to assemble. My husband and I put them together with no issues. The chairs matched my table and have been a great addition to our kitchen. I would recommend them. The wooden base is nice and sturdy.", 
    "I paired these chairs with an industrial looking round table that was black-iron legged and these look wonderful. Sturdy and industrial yet comfortable.", 
    "I was hesitant to order these because of the mixed reviews regarding assembly and construction. I warned my husband about this before the shipment arrived (I ordered 2 sets). Well, he took that as a challenge and made me time him for each chair. He averaged 11 minutes per chair for assembly and they are perfect! No issues at all. There is a precise way the parts fit, but if you have put together IKEA furniture in the past, you'll do fine. They are sturdy, have a wide seat, and are good looking.", 
    "Looks just like the picture! They are very sturdy...they don't rock when you sit in them. An update for a great PRICE! Easy to put together. I would purchase again.", 
    "Very sturdy, well made, a little tricky to assemble, they are as pictured , better actually!", 
    "Very happy with style and appearance of these chairs. Bought them for my sons first apartment but I would use them in our home too.", 
    "Love them. I bought them to have additional chairs for the coming holidays and I am glad with my purchase, they are sturdy and are a great addition to my original set of chairs.", 
    "I would have given a 5 star review, but the packaging was a little confusing. They went together pretty easily once we put one together. They are just what I wanted as extra seating for my dining room and side chairs.", 
    "The chairs are worth the money!!! They are sturdy and level. The color is rich and beautiful. I've gotten a ton on complements on them.", 
    "Assembly was straight-forward BUT several screw holes stripped way too easy and not ONE of the six chairs I assembled sat flat on the floor - they all wobbled.", 
    "High Quality and a great value", 
    "Now that these chairs are put together, they are wonderful. Expect to spend a few hours putting them together: Screw holes not properly aligned when putting the legs together - challenging to make the chairs level. The pre-drilled holes in the bottom of the seats were not in the proper location. You will need a power drill to drill into the seats for the guides for the screws. My little brother put these together for me. He's a mechanical engineering student and he was incredibly frustrated. I had two separate sets of two, and one set was definitely easier to put together than the other due to screw hole alignment etc. They are worth it - they are perfect for my dining room table, very sturdy, and they look like they will last for years.", 
    "I put these chairs together yesterday. They quality is not bad, but the frame piping is a little inexpensive looking to be polite. They look great on the picture on the website. Overall, the chair is sturdy, not too difficult to put together, just a little underwhelming style wise.", 
    "I bought 4 of these chairs to go with an antique dining table. They look great and are more comfy than they appear.", 
    "I am so angry....None of the chair supporters fit the chair frame holes....NONE!!! i cannot send it back since I have half the chair together....Do not buy this chair......", 
    "Beautiful chairs. The only problem I had with putting them together was the small arch between the legs would not allow the screws to fit in both ends. It does not affect the stability or appearance.", 
    "I love these chairs. easy to assemble and comfortable to sit in. Very nice in color too!", 
    "These chairs were easy to assemble. My 10 year old son helped me. They are a beautiful around our round oak table.", 
    "First off I never write reviews but these were so frustrating, be warned. I bought a total of 4 chairs and they all have one leg thats an inch off the ground. I had to put cardboard under the seat to try and make it better. And the decorative arches' holes didn't line up with the screws. They are beautiful and usually I'm one to figure it out and not return stuff but these were disappointing", 
    "PRO - Looks nice, extremely sturdy, and wide seats (if you're looking for that)CON - Easily put together.. it does require a good chunk of time, but I did not encounter issues. Also, fairly heavy for chairs.. again depends on your preference. Overall I'm very happy!", 
    "Love these chairs. Easy to put together, look great. Very sturdy . Beautiful. Great buy overall!", 
    "Great look, reasonably comfortable to eat a meal or do homework but not a chair you would lounge in. For color we placed a pillow on the back and that makes them more comfortable when Im sitting and doing bills at the table. Easy to assemble. Sturdy once built. They are keepers.", 
    "We were going to order 12 chairs, but decided to try only two of them first. So what else can you expect from products which are made in China, wrong side of chair legs i.e. two right sides for one of the chairs, holes not in the right place for screws to go into, we didn't even try to assemble the other one.I, and many others, would pay more for U.S. made again. Sent them back a while ago, and still have not been credited for the return.", 
    "Chairs are great! Easy and quick to put together. Would definitely recommend them.", 
    "The chairs were exactly as shown on the website - color was perfect. Chairs are pretty sturdy and look modern and rustic at same time. One chair was incorrectly drilled for attaching back/legs and we needed to drill new holes.", 
    "I love the styling and fit of these new chairs. We took a chance on purchasing them without \"sitting\" first, but they are comfortable and substantial. We updated a traditional pedestal dining table with 2 sets of these chairs. The metal/rustic wood combination is modern industrial with a touch of traditional. They were not hard to put together. The criss-cross back stands straight up for a smaller space and gives a nice see-through, uncluttered look. I'm very pleased with the quality and value of this product.", 
    "I was very happy with the way the chairs looked, however when it came time to put the chairs together the holes for the seat were drill in the wrong spots and four of the main screws were missing.", 
    "While these chairs are stylish, they are also not comfortable. The \"x\" back digs into your back. So if you are looking for comfort, these are not for you."
