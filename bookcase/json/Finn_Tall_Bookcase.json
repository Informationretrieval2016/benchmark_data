    "i don't actually store any books in this case but i love it as a side table for my bed. i am short on storage space so this takes care of that issue as well as being very stylish. easy to put together, as described and the wood has a nice finish and grain to it.", 
    "The bookcase is very nice looking, it has a rustic/industrial look to it.However, some of the wood shelves were warped and scratched. We did not mind as it made the bookcase look more rustic. However, since you need to screw into the planks, having a warped one makes it a bit of a challenge. Also, because the planks and framing is very thin, the bookcase is a bit wobbly and unstable when compared to our other book cases."
