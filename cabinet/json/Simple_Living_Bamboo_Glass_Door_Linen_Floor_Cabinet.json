    "Be careful! The dimensions on the details page is not correct. It is actually 14.57 inches DEEP x 17.72 inches WIDE. We couldn't fit it into the place where we intended to put it and have to order another matching bamboo linen tower. Other than that, it's not bad for the price.", 
    "wood was cracked on the rail that holds middle shelf. But did not want to go through the trouble of returning it so i fixed it myself.", 
    "The bamboo cabinet has a nice appearance and was fairly easy to assemble with two people - it took us about an hour and half. The back of unit was supposed to have holes for the back panel but it did not have them. Luckily the wood is fairly soft so it was easy to screw the back panel onto the back.", 
    "Bought two for my bathroom-thought it looked great and I was having trouble finding cabinets in oak color. The cabinets will not stay together! A few of the screws are way too short to work. Thought it was just me but had a handiman come over to put together-he was ready to throw them out. Will have to nail them to have them not fall about. Think twice about ordering these!", 
    "I have bought 2 items that needed assembly from Overstock. This was so easy to put together - all pieces were perfectly aligned. It looks very good, is made from a sustainable source and is very sturdy.A great buy", 
    "this item is cardboard with a maybe bamboo looking finish not easy to put together some parts not right", 
    "It looks great in my bathroom. Needed extra cabinet space for personal items. Can not see through glass door. Matches my sink vanity perfect.", 
    "Good quality piece for price", 
    "This cabinet fit nicely in the spot that I needed it for", 
    "I guess I wasn't paying attention when I purchased this item but no matter. It required assembly, and thankfully my husband was willing to assist me with this task. Two hours later it was together and in place in my kitchen. It's very nice piece, and happy I got it!", 
    "Easy to put together. Good value. Looks like the picture", 
    "Hard to put together, if you get any drop of water on it at all, imediately dry it or it leaves a water mark very quickly", 
    "Easy to put together, solid construction, and very nice looking. Great piece for the price.", 
    "Easy to put together, and it is a great cabinet for the bathroom or hall way", 
    "This cabinet has a lot of room for a bathroom cabinet. Usually they are very tiny inside. I can store a lot in this bamboo cabinet. I like that it is made out of a natural material--bamboo. There was no outgassing or glue smell when it arrived. I found it simple to put together and enjoyed the process. The drawer works well. I would highly recommend this cabinet. The price was good too.", 
    "I love the style, size and quality of the phone stand, however, would have liked a better style and quality for the pull handles. But, otherwise, I loved I loved this!", 
    "We are pleased with this cabinet in every way. It is just as pictured and arrived with all parts in place and with fairly clear directions. Very easy to assemble (I'm 75 and did it by myself in less than an hour) and looks great in our guest bathroom.", 
    "Nice piece of wood for the money. Not difficult to assemble. Looks nice in the room.", 
    "Arrived in a flat pack requiring assembly. I had no difficulty putting this product together despite the stilted English directions. It looks great and seems very sold.", 
    "One of the back rails did not have the groove cut into it for the back panel. I had to saw the slot into the rail with a circular saw. After assembly the cabinet was \"wobbly\" --- had to add screws to stop \"wracking\" of cabinet from side to side", 
    "Nice little cabinet for my master bath. Easy to put together alone. nice wood, will splinter if screws are not positioned exactly. I messed up on one, wasn't paying attention. It works very well and does not look cheap.", 
    "Nice little cabinet that I use in my kitchen, although it would be ideal in a small bathroom also. Good quality for the price and relatively easy to assemble. The glass front is a nice touch and the drawer holds a decent amount of kitchen utensils. I'd buy it again. My neighbor complimented it and plans to buy one for herself.", 
    "As previous reviewers mentioned, the assembly leaves something to be desired. I put it together in 45 minutes, and it was straightforward; however, at the end, the back did not fit on even close to flush. Also, contrary to the picture, even after tightening all the screws fully, there are gaps between the frame and door, door and drawer, etc. The description states 2 drawers; the specs state 1. There is 1 drawer, as per the picture. It fits 6 normal sized bath towels folded in thirds, but JUST fits them. It will be a challenge to fold a stack of towels and put them in there all at once - they have to be put in one by one to fit. If this were $30-40, I'd give it a higher review, but for *** steer clear. Poor quality."
