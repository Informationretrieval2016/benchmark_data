    "This table is absolutely perfect in my small dining area. The colors are beautiful, and the top is much nicer quality than I expected.", 
    "Looks just like the picture online. One leg was bent but we were still able to assemble it. The top is quite textured. The edges have a burnt finish.", 
    "Sturdy and easy to assemble but buyers should be aware top is plastic. Not a good value", 
    "I ordered this for a desk for my home office. Haven't been using it long. So far its been great!"
