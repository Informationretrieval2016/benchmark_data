    "I am so mad at myself for ordering this table. At the time I did, there was one positive review, so I thought \"why not?\" I am of the belief \"you get what you pay for\" and the table was cheap, but we only needed a longer table to use a couple of times per year when we have family visitng (we have a smaller dining set we use regularly) so I thought, ok, even if it's ugly or cheap looking, we will just leave the leaf in, cover it with a table cloth and call it a day. What could go wrong? Well, the table arrived and the moment my husband took it out of the box we could tell it was defective. Why? Well, the entire section built in under the table surface was installed off-center and completely crooked. One side of the table has a lip over the legs, the other side had the \"underpart\" sticking out from under it. And because it's at an angle, one edge was sticking out pretty far so you could see the untreated particle board that is meant to be attached to the underside of the table. Still, we thought \"let's install the legs, extend it, put the leaf up and see.\" We thought as long as it feels sturdy, when extended, the difference between the two ends won't be visible. Well, guess what - because of the horrible manufacturing which somehow (how???) let this table go out with such an obvious QC issue, the leaf won't open. That's right, you CANNOT use the leaf. We extended the two sides and because the underside is installed off-center and at an angle, there is no possible way for the leaf to flip up - it needs about another 1-2 inches to clear the table surface and it can't. I am returning this piece of junk. I have ordered numerous pieces of furniture from Overstock in the last few years and I always felt like I scored a great deal and we've never had issues with quality. This is the first time I am leaving a negative review, but I hope this helps other people not buy this horrible piece of garbage. Returning this giant box will not be fun. I am now going to spend more money to get a quality table. I was trying to be savvy and economical but I paid the price. Awful piece of furniture, please don't buy.", 
    "My wife and I ordered this table with enthusiasm...we quickly removed the table and components from the packaging and in doing so the box and Styrofoam were damaged and broken; we started to assemble the table and found one of the legs to not fit as the other three; it stuck out a 1/4 inch on both edges; the two edges that the leg rested against flush did not measure any differently than the other 3 legs, but it would have to be cut a 1/4 inch on each to make it work. After staring at it for an hour in disbelief, we realized that it wound not be an issue for us because the middle leaflet would always be in use and all four legs would be underneath the table and not hang off the edge as it would if the leaflet is not in use. So we extended the table, mind you we bought the table for its longer length, and we find the table unable to close on one side up against the leaflet because of one of the hinges or bracket being in the way...I went underneath to see if the bracket could be removed or moved, luckily I was able to remove the 3 screws and once the leaflet was closed from above and locked into place from underneath, I was able to screw in the bracket making 3 new screw holes. For the cherry on top, two little edge scuffs occurred on the leaflet while opening it that required a little marker touch up and as my wife intended to have a cloth runner on the table, it would not have been seen. Overstock did provide a partial refund that we appreciated for the extra work required to enjoy this table. As far as the look, it is quite contemporary and it does help define the dining area that we created for our basement.", 
    "Very good quality, beautifully crafted, very sturdy and pretty", 
    "Awesome table with very cool expansion qualities, the best price anywhere!", 
    "The packaging looked perfectly intact on delivery, but upon opening the box, the thing that lets you store the leaf under the table was splintered into pieces, and I had to uninstall it before I could put the table together. The leaf itself has a few dings and chipped finish, and the whole underside of the table looks like a dirty old stage prop- flithy to the touch, screws and tacks and nails hanging out of it everywhere. I had to put serious time into cleaning this thing up before I could imagine letting my toddler anywhere near the underside. From the outside everything looks fine, and I don't mind storing the leaf in the closet, so I kept it, but mostly because it was pretty cheap and I couldn't imagine trying to box it back up and return it. It's...adequate, I guess? Like I said, we have a toddler, so we're going to tear this thing up pretty good over the next couple of years. Hopefully it holds up until shes old enough to be trusted with something nicer.", 
    "The kids have scratched up the finish on top but this is solid construction and it expands so easily!!", 
    "Love this table. It had a couple of cracks but Overstock gave us some ****** credit so we could do the repair so I'm a happy camper. Love the color", 
    "Easy to assemble, very nice looking table. Very pleased with my purchase!", 
    "This dining table is so beautiful! It arrived quickly and looked great right out of the box. I knew the price was great but I couldn\u2019t imagine that it would be such terrific quality too! The high-gloss finish on the tabletop is amazing, beautiful color and not a single mark. We especially love the ease of extending the table; all you do is unlock the butterfly leaf extension under the table and pull the table apart and it automatically opens and fills the space to make the table full length \u2013 Incredible! This saves storage space in my home and we can quickly be ready when we have guests for dinner.", 
    "Well, I was very surprised at how great this table is. Very, very sturdy. Exceptionally easy assembly. Ithe finish is excellent. Easy peasy butterfly mechanism hat requires no additional assembly. Great value.", 
    "This table is the best table ever.Better than the picture,very good quality,love the color and it match perfect with my red leather chairs.Am surprise that i paid so litlle for it."
