  "reviews": [
    "particle board that can barely hold its own weight", 
    "All pieces have to be assembled however easy to do nice piece of furniture for the price.", 
    "Excellent in look and quality. What would have made this piece perfect is if the back was solid wood as opposed to I believe a cardboard of some sort.", 
    "Nice idea for a pc of furniture, finish is dull and looks on the cheap side up close. Assembly pretty straightforward if you take your time, took me about 3 hours. Back was cheap cardboard in two pcs, taped together. One folded pc would have been better.", 
    "Even though this cabinet is not top quality wood I love the look of it, my DVD player and dish box fit in perfect, and for the price I can't complain.", 
    "I bought this to hide my husbands gutars and cords. It is perfect.", 
    "Needed an extra cabinet to put towels in and personal item and it worked out great", 
    "Love the cabinet. Fits perfectly. Well made. Love the vintage wheels. Very sharp.", 
    "We like the fact the cabinet is on rollers so it can be moved easily to clean underneath. Quite sturdy for the price.", 
    "Cons - it's composite wood - does smell a little bit for a week or two. Shelves are fixed height - once it is in - it's in. PROS - It is great it is on wheels - make moving it around to get to wall plugs a gem and cleaning underneath. Instructions are clear - be sure to use a good screwdriver. makes a big difference. My 8 y.o. helped me put it together.Unless you get close - can't tell it is composite wood.", 
    "This piece is quite dark in color and is very heavy, just the way I wanted it to be for my books and for some short sleeved shirts I placed into it. I had no major problems putting it together. I did this myself and it wasn\u2019t difficult at all, but you do need patience and you must follow directions to the letter. The wheels roll very easily and everything I placed into the cabinet was just right.", 
    "Although it took 2 guys 1.5 hours to assemble, this cabinet looks beautiful and fits my space perfectly.", 
    "My husband and I purchased 2 of these cabinets for use in our master bedroom. Very easy to put together and a solid cabinet not cheap in any way. Will be putting fabric behind the wire mesh for privacy but absolutely love them.", 
    "The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the back of the cabinet made from a flimsy cardboard like material. Everything else is great: metal wheels, easy to follow instructions and overall quality. Love the wire in the door so I don't have to deal with cleaning the glass! I'm using it for my son toys with 4 matching baskets:)"
