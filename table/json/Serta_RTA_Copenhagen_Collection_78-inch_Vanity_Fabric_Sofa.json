    "For two weeks the strong odor from this sofa made it impossible for my students with asthma to come for their lessons. I had to put a stack go pillows on it along with a whole box of baking soda sprinkled all over to absorb the odor. When this did not work, I used fabric softener sheets. It is almost a month and I have not sat on the sofa for longer than a minute. I would have returned it but it was too difficult for me to do so. I will go to a nearby furniture store for a sofa in the future. I have been buying from Overstock since 1999 and right now, I am not sure I will remain loyal. Someone should have come to smell what I was smelling. The odor has dissipated, but I can still smell it when I am close to it.", 
    "For the price, this sofa is perfect for a small apartment. It's VERY easy to put together. The hardest part was getting it out of the box! The rest only took about 10-15 minutes. No tools required.", 
    "I love it. It's exactly what i wanted. I have a horrible back and it just doesnt hurt as much on this couch. Can't wait for the love seat to come today", 
    "Was not prepared to put a sofa together, very nice.", 
    "This sofa is made cheap and will never hold up with daily use.", 
    "I liked the look of this couch in the picture. I read all the other reviews to help in my consideration. It came early; it was easy to assemble, and I love the look. I would buy it again, as well.", 
    "A week after I put it in my living room the middle leg broke. I'm not overweight and don't jump on it so I have to say it isn't made very well!"
