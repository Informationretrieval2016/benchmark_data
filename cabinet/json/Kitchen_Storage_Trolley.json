    "This kitchen trolley was easy to put together by myself. Quality is good, directions were (pictures only) easy to follow. The piece is holding our heavy microwave and can still roll around on the casters easily. The size was exactly as stated. The color is a very slight off white - not a pure cool white. The butcher block top is just laminate not an actual butcher block - though under a microwave it looks nice. The bottom storage section is large enough to store a 6 pack of paper towels and the doors have a magnetic closure. Overall very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Hi purchsed this for my mother and it's a good little cabinet, perfect for her microwave. Sides are a bit flimsy but it works for her. Fairly easy to put together, just takes a bit of time. I would buy another one if needed for myself or a gift", 
    "The wheels are nice for easy move. The wood parts of the cart is constructed of plywood - not very durable stuff but it's holding up well so far. The handles however scratch pretty easily on the wood surfaces so be careful while assembling! Trolley was sturdy after proper assembling.For what we needed it for - it did the job.", 
    "A bit more complicated to put together and having a power screwdriver will certainly speed things up rather than relying on the allen wrench provided. Remember to slide in the base of the drawer before you put on the front piece. bottom shelf, inside cabinet, won't hold real heavy itmes. Overall, very pleased with this nice looking trolley.", 
    "This cabinet is lovely. Matched my kitchen beautifully. The wheels lock. Put my micro on top. My son was able to put it together very quickly.", 
    "I got this for kitchen office, but the moment I opened the box I could see the poor quality of the materials. Also, it didn't arive with the necessary tools and the instructions are a pain. It was hard to put together, and the finish product is not very sturdy.", 
    "We had a little problem with the wood top it seemed to be wapped a little, loosened up on the screws a little so the drawer would work and it was ok. Great Microwave stand and storage space.", 
    "The box came fairly beaten and there was a heavy impact point, which made me worried to open the box. Fortunately, the wood took the hit (mostly). There was a one inch impact but nothing worth returning the piece over... it is going to be loved fairly hard in my kitchen anyway, right? This and finding the alignment of the doors a little wonky to set up are my only complaints. I love this little trolley and use it every day now... in a very tight Manhattan kitchen.Note, at least on mine, the top doesn't secure into place... maybe I did something wrong. There are two pegs but they are very loose so the top can just come right off.Not a big issue, but something to think about.", 
    "I love my Kitchen Storage Trolley. It was very well packaged and arrived even earlier than promised. There are tons of pieces, so i'd highly suggest an electric screwdriver to put it together. I accidentally stepped on on the pieces of the door and cracked it slightly, but that was my fault. It holds my microwave wonderfully and freed up the counter space I was hoping to gain back. I enjoy the extra drawer which I put all of my spatulas and cooking tools in and I can use the shelf and bottom cabinet for a variety of things. Very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend to a friend.", 
    "Perfect size, color and design. This was very easy to put together. I am thrilled how functional it is, as well as, fitting into my decor.", 
    "I love it in my kitchen and it holds every thing I want it to hold. Vary easy to put to geather.", 
    "worth the money and just what I needed for my small kitchen", 
    "This storage trolley came in lots and lots of pieces/parts. I knew I was in for a challenge when I saw the size of the box. I am not that mechanically inclined, but I stuck to it, and after 3 hours had it assembled by myself. This piece of furniture could have easliy been sub-assembled to a certain extent, with the remaining parts/pieces to be assembled tucked inside the assembled part, thus saving a lot of time and frustration for the purchaser. It would not have required all that much of a larger shipping box to do so.For the price, it is a nice addition to my kitchen. a good size, with good storage features -- top surface, center shelf, and bottom closed cabinet, and a center drawer to boot. I would recommend this, but beware of the assembly time and effort. Really takes two people to do this, but can be done by one person.", 
    "But the drawer isn't moving in and out very well ... on the whole, a good buy for the money.", 
    "This cart had easy instruction to follow.....All pieces were packed well. Just a minor hitch, but overstock will take care of it.. Thanks Overstock", 
    "Just like the picture and all the good reviews. Quite happy with this.", 
    "The unit is good to hold the microwave. The bottom and back are a little flimsy for storing anything too heavy. I did not put a crockpot in the bottom.", 
    "I assembled this in under an hour. This is perfect for the kitchen, rolls, stores baking supplies and houses our juicer on top. The small drawer offers extra storage.", 
    "This is a good product. Stronger then I expected for the price! Easy to set up", 
    "Like the look but drawer is fit poorly - need better design.", 
    "This cabinet turned out very well. I needed help to assemble it but all the parts were included and it lined up very nicely. I am using it on my lanai and it is very durable in inclement weather. Definitely recommend this product.", 
    "This was an impulse buy. So glad I purchased it. Great looking piece of furniture with great storage.", 
    "The cart was assembled quickly and looks as described. There is no stop for the drawer and it actually seems to be short in the width so it falls out if it shifts to one side or the other. So it is pretty much useless. The rest of the cart is sturdy and holds the microwave nicely", 
    "This unit was pretty easy to assemble. The drawer is a little wobbly and doesn't always like to close straight but all in all works very well. I got it to free up counter space which it did. So far I'm very happy with this cart.", 
    "I put this together in about an hour or so while watching tv. It was not too difficult. The drawer does not work very well. It falls off the track almost every time we pull it out. It is easy to put back on, but it is just a little annoying. Works for what we needed it for. We keep our microwave on top to free up counter space.", 
    "This cart is nice looking and a good place to store extra stuff in my small kitchen. I keep my Kitchen Aid mixer on top and recipe box and several cook books on the shelf. It took my husband just a little more than 1 1/2 hours to assemble. There was one screw cover that he couldn't inserted but it is against a cupboard and doesn't show. The drawer sticks about every other time I close. I did soap the track but still not so great. I store all my smaller sharp knives in the drawer. I did line the drawer and placed some dividers inside. The top is not an actual cutting board just looks like one. Overall I really like it with my white cupboards.", 
    "I have had this item for several months. I purchased it to hold a microwave and I needed extra storage space. My husband had no problem putting it together. I was out of town when it arrived and he called excited telling me how nice it was, and attached a photo. He was amazed at the quality without a much higher price. We had been out looking for something like this for a while, therfore he was well aware of prices. It is well made, very sturdy, and looks nice. The butcher box top is exactly that, solid wood. The color is antique white. I highly recommend this.", 
    "easy to assemble but the drawer has issues I cannot figure out. Will not open & close without a lot of help from me", 
    "The price was reasonable but the assembly was a little much. When I got done, the cutting board was rickety. Needed to put some rubber under it so it did not remind me of a 3 legged chair", 
    "First, the drawer component. There is no stopper, so inevitably that drawer will be pulled out, scattered all the contents to the floor on multiple occasions. This is for a vacation rental, so we'll try to jerry-rig it somehow, but it's a design flaw for sure. Two, only the front wheels can lock. So when they are locked, the unit can still roll. It will be useless to try to use the surface area to cut anything (with a cutting board, of course). I would have returned it but the thing was already built by my husband (two hours of labor) when we noticed the two things that make this a relatively poor product. I don't recall ever ordering any products from Overstock (not that there have been many), that I've been delighted with. You get what you pay for.", 
    "Looks great, nice quality. Only concern is the bottom shelf in cabinet is fairly flimsy, will most likely need to install an extra support underneath in the future due to the weight of my cookbooks.", 
    "I do not like to have to assemble items like this one.But I have to admit that the instructions were clear and easy to follow. It is exactly what we wanted. I searched other stores.They did not have what we needed. We are using it for a microwave oven.There is a handy drawer and ample storage space below. Very happy with purchase.Price and delivery super.", 
    "This kitchen trolley is wonderful and exactly what I saw in the picture. It fits in perfectly in my kitchen and was easy to assemble (or so my nephew told me). There is a lot of space under the top to fit my canned goods that I use often, the drawer houses my trash bags and other smaller things, and the cabinet keeps my crock pot and smaller appliances handy. I love this addition to my kitchen.", 
    "The size is perfect, it has a drawer (I wish it had a stop - the only draw back is the drawer can pull right out), it was easy to assemble and it moves so easily. I didn't like the white so I painted it and it looks great. Love it.", 
    "Decent storage trolley. It's fairly small but works well for me. It had a really strong chemical smell when it arrived but was relatively easy to put together.", 
    "I would definately recommend this product - it is easy to assemble and is the perfect size for a smaller kitchen", 
    "I keep my makeup organizer on top of this unit --towels in the open space --- hair products, curling iron, blow dryer, and personal items below. It looks great in my bathroom!If I should happen to spill anything on the top cleanup is easy. Couldn't be better!", 
    "I had a handyman assemble this trolley and he did it in no time. I am very pleased with this product.", 
    "I AM PLEASED WITH THE KITCHEN TROLLEY. iT WAS NOT HARD TO ASSEMBLE AND IS JUST WHAT I NEEDED SINCE SPACE WAS LIMITED IN MY KITCHEN. I REALLY LIKE THE BUTCHER BLOCK TOP AND THE DRAWER IS GREAT FOR UTENSILS, THE CABINET SPACE ACCOMODATES MY BOWLS, AND POTS THAT I USE FREQUENTLY. ALSO , THE PRICE WAS REASONABLE.. Very Satisfied.", 
    "This product is about what I expected for the value, though it was time consuming (and a bit confusing) to assemble. The only real complaint I have right now is that the top drawer does not have any sort of stopping mechanism to prevent the drawer from pulling/falling out when pulled out.", 
    "Very nice kitchen storage. Very sturdy construction. I'm good at it, so assembly was very easy. Like most furniture I buy online, smaller than expected. I wish the lower shelf was a little taller. I have sacrificed the drawer so I could put my microwave down there. But overall a great, moderately priced kitchen storage product.", 
    "this is a great product which looks very nice in my kitchen. we use it to put our microwave on it. it takes sometime to put all the pieces together but as long as you follow the instructions you should not have any problems. also the size of it its perfect for small kitchens.", 
    "Loved it. Not to hard to assemble and fit my needs perfectly.", 
    "This kitchen server is near our table and works wonderfully for the toaster, salt and pepper, napkins, etc. The finish is good, the middle shelf is sturdy as is the lovely top. It is a two person assembly, I think, but not too bad. The only problem I have with it is that the drawer is a little out of square, and the bottom shelf is not thick enough, not sturdy. It would not hold heavy items like dishes. A second shelf inside would have been nice, too, to take some weight off the bottom shelf.. Of course that would have required more side reinforcement and a higher cost. Great service for the cost!", 
    "I purchased this cart to hold my microwave which it does beautifully. I use the generous sized drawer to hold my place mats and kitchen towels, potholders,etc. The closed storage area is great. I am able to store my oversized cereal boxes, large pack of extra bathroom tissue and paper towels easily in the cabinet. The cart looks like an expensive piece of furniture thanks to the beautiful moulding and handles. The antique white finish and butcher block top complete the look. I am thrilled with this purchase. Delivery was swift and arrived in perfect condition. It only took about an hour to assemble. I spent a lot of time looking for a cart and have not seen one as nice as this one even at a higher price. As a matter of fact I have not seen this exact cart anywhere besides Overstock.", 
    "Requires quite a bit of time to assemble. Has many parts.. Looks very nice and seems sturdy after full assembly. Only thing is the drawer doesn't always pull out and push in evenly.", 
    "Great look. Since it is self-assembly, it is not a perfect fit but instructions were easy to follow and assemble. For the price, it is an excellent value!", 
    "This cart was easy to assemble, however once it was completely put together the drawer simply would not work. The sides of the cart were too far apart to allow the drawer runners to adequately support the drawer. This meant that the drawer did not slide in properly and had to be cajoled into place each time, which is very inefficient. I had to rig it on one side by finding a small piece of wood to get the drawer runner piece to jut out enough to support the drawer. Now I have longer screws sticking out of one side, which I had to use to get the wedge in place. Ultimately I can use this cart, but now it has a Frankenstein feel to it and its overall disappointing.", 
    "i ordered 4 pieces of furnitures this time in overstock.com, and this is the only one make me feel like i am happy i made the purchase! is is every beautiful and easy assembling. the top have a good quanlity of wood the rest part is light weight. and it saved so much space in kitchen, my small kitchen looks so neat now.i will recommend this to my friend for sure !", 
    "I love this storage trolley. It went together easily, and looks great in my kitchen. My microwave sits on the top, and the storage area underneath holds all the pots and pans that I need. I would definitely recommend this product, and would buy it again.", 
    "This cart is beautiful and high quality. I needed a small cart to hold my ice machine and this was perfect and it has some storage areas that were needed. I would recommend this product to anyone who needed it.", 
    "Sorry, I cannot comment since the product was returned in its original box (unopenend).", 
    "Very sturdy & easy to assemble. item looks a lot more expensive then actual price paid, great value. only problem is the sliding drawer is a little sloppy & hard to close sometimes. great purchase otherwise", 
    "Very happy with my cabinet and would recommend for a small space. Not extremely high quality but with what I paid, I am very happy with it.", 
    "I'm very happy with my purchase. It arrived very quickly and I spent about 2 hours putting it together. It's perfect for my microwave and fits neatly in a corner of my kitchen. It seems sturdy and looks expensive. I am very happy with it!", 
    "This was a perfect choice to put my food slicer on and be able to roll it out when I wanted to use it. Thank goodness for the locking wheels. I love it!", 
    "Very satisfied with this cart. It matches another cart that I had ordered previously from Overstock. My daughter put it together for me and had no trouble doing it. Very good quality and attractive as well. Makes for useful storage space in kitchen and I placed my Microwave on top which fits fine. Butcher block top is very attractive.", 
    "We just put granite counter tops in our kitchen and did not want the coffee maker at the former location. Bought this cart to hold toaster, coffee maker,panini make and supplies. There is room in the storage area for other items if not too large. It is perfect for our purpose and frees up a lot of counter space. Highly recommend but is not for heavy items, in my opinion.", 
    "This cart stayed in the box in the middle of my living room for a week before I summoned up the courage to begin the dreaded process of assembling? Boy. Was I surprised!! This cart came with the best ILLUSTRATED instructions ever!! I put it together in one hour. This is great engineering and superior craftsmanship at the factory. All parts lined up and fit together perfectly. .... and all parts were clearly marked and included. Great product! Thanks!", 
    "For the price, this is a pretty great product. NYC apartments have notoriously small kitchens, and ours is no exception. We were looking for something that could both extend our limited counter space and provide us with more storage. This trolley works perfectly. As mentioned above, the walls, doors and floor of the cabinet are kinda flimsy and won't hold up to much abuse, but if you don't have small children running around and kicking or throwing things it's not a problem. We're quite satisfied and would definitely buy it again.", 
    "The cart works well for what I am using it for, just to keep a TV on and use for some extra kitchen storage. The directions are easy to follow for assembly. The side panels are a little on the flimsy side and the drawer isn't on a track so it doesn't guide in and out very smoothly, but it's really not a big deal. It's a functional piece, but if it weren't on sale, I wouldn't say it was worth the price. However it works just fine for a temporary unit.", 
    "The drawer doesn't fit in the slot and it can't take any weight. Wheels also don't fully lock.", 
    "We figured out that the reason the drawer wasn't opening smoothly was because it's not a good fit for the slots. The drawer is just a little too small for the slides on each side. If you slide it all the way over to the left, then it falls out on the right. We made some minor adjustments with some scrap wood we had that helped. Now that we fixed that problem, we love it. It's a good bargain for the money. Just be prepared to do a little more work than what the directions say.", 
    "I actually bought this trolly to use in my laundry room as a table for folding clothes as they come out of the dryer; plus, for the storage underneath. This trolly has worked out perfectly, just the right size for the area. I would highly reccomend this trolly if you need it for a smaller kitchen.", 
    "The trolley is great! It was easy to put together. Directions were easy to follow. The trolley fits in the kitchen great and is so useful. Even the kids are moving it to were they need it and using it.", 
    "This kitchen cart is functional and attractive. I was initially overwhelmed by the number of pieces/screws/etc. when I opened the box, but assembly could not have been easier. The instructions are the most clear I have had for any product, ever. The pieces are numbered to correspond with the pictures in the instruction manual. It took me roughly an hour to assemble, and I am thrilled! Great quality, functionality, and aesthetic appeal for the price. Highly recommend.", 
    "Good for the price. Assembly was relatively easy. The white part of the cart is cheap, but looks nice once put together. Very functional. Offers some additional storage and prep space for a small kitchen.", 
    "I have been using this for nearly four years. I do no use it regularly but I have had no issues and it is still in great condition.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for my pantry as extra storage for baking bowls and place mats. It is the perfect size and I was pleased with how easy it was to put together. I would have preferred more words in the directions as opposed to just pictures, but the pictures were easy to follow and every single piece of hardware was there! I am not sure how well the cabinet would hold up in a high traffic situation with kids slamming the doors or sitting on it, but for a household of adults it's a perfect fit for our needs. It looks nice, is a good height, and I expect to be using it for years. I would recommend it.", 
    "My only problem with this is the drawer. It works fine, but if you pull it out too far it falls out. Its works great for the space i have and would probably buy it again.", 
    "I received my order very quickly from overstock, and the product was not damaged and all pieces for assembly were present. Feels like a solid kitchen cart, my only con is that the drawer doesn't use slides or wheels, it doesn't pull out smoothly.", 
    "I have visited seven stores looking for a basic but sturdy kitchen cart. All the carts were either too flimsy or way too expensive. This cart is right in the middle. The wheels are sturdy but not bulky. I roll the cart from carpet to wood easily. I have my huge and heavy kitchen aid mixer on top and it holds fine. The drawer is meant for lighter objects like pot holders or aprons. The bottom of the cart is not made of as strong of wood as the top of the cart is. Hence why I chose to put my mixer on top rather than the bottom. Assembly was done by my husband and he has his own set of tools. It took him maybe an hour. I'm that is because he didn't have to use the little allen wrench that came with it. I would recommend borrowing someone else's tools if you don't have your own. Arrived a day earlier than expected. Over all great purchase.", 
    "Bought this for my Mom and Dad.. she needed additional work/storage space in the kitchen. It's perfect. A little difficult for them to put together. Good value.", 
    "Everything was great - item, delivery... But, I would prefer more conversation telling me when the item was shipped, where it is on the way, and what day/time to expect delivery. Too much \"space\" with information.", 
    "Lots of pieces to put together but instructions were helpful, if you're good at that kind of thing. Once together, it's beautiful. Gave only 4 stars because some of the screws were missing. We had to improvise with leftover screws we had on-hand from another project.", 
    "great product.....very sturdy after assembly, everything fit together well, no problems....instructions were just pictures, but were easy to follow.....took about an hour to assemble, but worth it in the end", 
    "very solid and sturdy. easy to put together. just what I wanted Perfect fit", 
    "This is an excellent product, I love it for the storage, extra counter space and it looks great. I will be happy to recommend this product to my friends and family.", 
    "Purchased kitchen storage unit for our camper. It fit perfectly, gives extra work area and storage. Love it. It was delivered promptly and I put it together myself. Thank you for a great product.", 
    "Great little trolley, just right for holding my popcorn machine. Goes together quite easily, but if one has a better allen wrench than the one provided it will be MUCH easier. All parts are numbered so anyone can assemble this with no problem. Fitment of parts was very good as well.", 
    "Everything from ease of ordering to arrival to assembly and most of all a good product was perrfect.", 
    "Recieved in three days. Trolley went together very easliy until I got to the drawer .The two blocks that hold the front of the drawer to the sides were drilled wrong.With a little time you can fix this if your are handy and it does not effect the look of the trolley at all.. The cabinet doors on the bottom went together without a problem and looks OK.It has a nice butcher block like top which looks sealed and another shelf underneath. The cabinet underneath would not stand alot of weight but would hold small light objects. Instructions are only pictures but well done easy to understand. No hadware missing .", 
    "Great price, ease of assembly, and just what we needed in our small kitchen for storage. Our kitchen trolley was shipped in less than two days. All the materials were accounted for and not damaged or scratched. It took less than an hour to put together. It was helpful that we used our own set of Allen wrenches to save time instead of using the one included in the box. Even though the directions were only illustrations with numbered materials it was not very difficult to understand. Check all materials first and put in piles to help identify when assembling. The only problem with assembly was the drawer. The two wooden blocks that are screwed into the corners of the drawer had holes that did not line up. We made our own new holes and the drawer turned out great. I read where some customers had doors that did not meet correctly or that their drawers did not slide smoothly. Our doors hang correctly and the drawer slides out with ease. Our microwave sits on the top, our toaster oven sits in the middle shelf, our lighter pots are in the storage area with doors and our potholders are in the drawers. What a great addition to our kitchen! Love the wheels for easy cleaning, too.", 
    "There was some assembly required, but I did it by myself in less than an hour. All the hardware was included and the instructions were easy to understand. There was some very minor damage to a couple of pieces, but they didn't show when put together and/or were easy to cover with a small amount of white paint. The put-together cart is attractive and seems pretty sturdy. It's perfect for smaller kitchens that need a bit more storage space and working surface.", 
    "This kitchen storage trolley works great for needed extra space. I would highly recommend this product to others. It was pretty easy to put together and you don't have to use the wheels if you don't want to or need them.", 
    "Really easy to put together. Looks GREAT in my small kitchen.", 
    "It took some effort and time to put it together, the end result was well worth it. The chopping board and the wheels are of good quality. It was well packaged and received in perfect condition.", 
    "This works great as a microwave cart. I have a fairly large convection microwave oven and was concerned about the weight but this cart is very sturdy; it was easy to put together and worked perfect in my kitchen. It had a scratch on the back which is not noticeable at all, was very well packaged. It also has a nice covered storage area and a shelf where I placed my cookbooks. Overall this is a great buy; would highly recommend.", 
    "My husband put this together in no time, with little effort. It's attractive and functional. The only drawback I can find to it is that you wouldn't want to put any heavy cutlery in the top drawer since it isn't that strong. Overall, very worth the money", 
    "Great kitchen cart. I've been looking for a year to find a small enough cart that looks good. Very good price too. Easy to put together. Very attractive with a good finish and chopping board and wheels are very good quality. Two pieces were a little thin but after you put it together it is sturdy. It looks just like the photo. I love my cart and highly recommend it!", 
    "Excellent cart. Arrived promptly and with no damage. Not that difficult to put together. Very high quality for the price. Would highly recommend!", 
    "This kitchen cart is great! It was very easy to put together (Idid it with no help from my husband!). It is excellent quality and looks great in my kitchen. The price was fair and the cart looks as though it cost more than I paid for it! I love shopping with Overstock.com....for great quality, selection and price!", 
    "It took some effort to put together, but it looks nice.", 
    "This is a perfect microwave cart. It was fairly easy to put together. It was nicely priced andlooks great in my kitchen.", 
    "The box arrived at my door UNSEALED. I inspected contains, everything was there, but a few pieces were scratched, not PACKED well. There are no written directions to assemble the cart, just drawings, and the pieces are not identified. Made for an interesting afternoon trying to assembly the cart. Once I FINALLY got it together.,the drawer was not cut right so it does not work. i now have to find someone to cut the drawer to be able to use it. Thankfully, the scratched pieces were in the back of the cart. I will be able to use it, but all in all was disappointed in the product.", 
    "We found the kitchen trolley to be exactly what we were looking for to hold our microwave on the top, love the butcher block top, we have the toaster oven in the middle and lighter weight stuff in the bottom cabinet. Was fairly easy to put together.The only thing that could have been better was the drawer, we wanted it for our utensils and it does not have a stop on it and does not open and close smoothly. Other than that we love it, fits perfect in our cabin at the river where we needed it to go.", 
    "I was impressed with the quality of this cart. It took me approximately 90 minutes to construct the cart with no real issues. The cart is sturdy and offers enclosed storage as well as a open area that is extremely usable. The casters are heavy duty and lockable. Highly recommend this kitchen cart!", 
    "I love this island! It's the perfect size. We wheel it around on our tile floors and it takes the beating. We've been using it with no issues for durability. Our cat has actually found the shelf space a nice napping place- so you know it can hold something heavy.It was easy to put together- although I did need a hand flipping it up on its legs after the wheels went on. Buy this item, it will be worth it.", 
    "This was as good or better than I was expecting. The quality is excellent. The timing of the shipment was very good. I could not have asked for anything better. I was especially pleased with the price and cost of shipping.", 
    "Easy to put together (my 8-year old son & I assembled) and good quality for an inexpensive cart. The pieces fit together nicely and it looks great in our apartment's white kitchen.", 
    "I am very satisfied with this product. I was pleasantly surprised when it was assembled because it looks so nice. It's solid wood and went together very easily. For the price and the amount of cupboard space it frees up for me, I couldn't ask for more. It was exactly as I hoped it would be. I shopped around quite a bit before I decided to purchase at Overstock.com. I'm so glad I decided on Overstock.com. I will purchase other products in the future.", 
    "I will be using this cart in the classroom and find the coasters are of high value to move each day. Great value.", 
    "Great cart. Looks very nice, not cheesy like some ready to assemble pieces. The assembly was pretty easy. My only issue was getting the top piece screwed on, but that was just a minor hiccup. I would definitely recommend this item.", 
    "This trolley provides a large work surface, excellent for making pasta or rolling dough. The storage drawer is handy and it looks great too while only taking up a small space in the kitchen. Highly recommend.", 
    "The cart was not difficult to assemble. It looks just like pictured. Perfect for the corner of my kitchen... my KitchenAid stand mixer on top and crock pot in the cabinet below. I am pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I ordered this cart and received it within record time.. two days. I put most of it together by myself. The only thing I needed my fiance for was drilling in the wood nails to secure the top. The holes that were there were not in the right place for the size of wood screw we were given. Otherwise it was very easy to put together and seems to be a very sturdy piece. I love the way it looks in our kitchen!", 
    "Like other reviewers stated, the bottom of the cabinet portion feels flimsy, so don't put your Kitchen Aid stand mixer in there. The wood is a bit soft and the whole thing is somewhat tricky to assemble, and this is from a guy (me) that had built carts and trolleys out of sheets of plywood. At one point, while trying to hold the pieces together so I could line the screw up with the holes, one of the panels tipped over and smashed my foot. In other words, it's more of a two-person job. I didn't really care for the flat/matt paint finish as it is easily scuffed, but it would be quite easy to paint over it with the color of your choice, which is what I'm thinking about doing. One of the vertical pieces cracked during shipping, but I was able to repair it with my woodworking tools. The whole thing is sturdy enough to hold a large microwave oven, although I don't recommend wheeling it around too much as it may fall apart. I don't regret the purchase as I don't see anything else out there (on the web) that has the same layout (a drawer, open shelf, and a cabinet) and with similar dimensions, although I think it should be priced below $100 base on the quality of the material.", 
    "I looked for months before I saw this cart on Overstock. I have seen similar carts at several other major retail stores, but at twice the price! My husband assembled the cart while I was at work, and he said it was pretty tough to put together because the only instructions you get are pictures, but he finished it in an afternoon and I Love it!! It is certainly solid, and even my picky husband said the wood was very good quality. I love being able to move it from spot to spot and I love the fact that it provides space for my cookbooks on the open shelf while still holding appliances in the cabinet section. The butcher block top is perfect for my needs since my counter space is very limited in our little kitchen! I highly recommend this product, just make sure either you, or someone else, can assemble without step by step instructions!", 
    "The cart looks great and is easy to assemble. The wooden pieces sent by the manufacturer had to be replaced a few times because the pieces they sent had cracked paint or other structural damage. But, once the new pieces were used it looks great. There is no interior shelf, which would be nice.", 
    "I was very pleased with the quality of this cart and the ease with which it went together. Unlike some others, the cart I received was all there and undamaged. The wood on the shelf was sort of flimsy, but for my use, it will be just fine. I love the appearance.", 
    "I am very pleased with this product, it was easy to install. It fits perfectly in my kitchen, and it holds my microvae perfectly.", 
    "But I was really disappointed. It took forever to assemble because some of the holes in the (tiny!) drawer were not drilled correctly. Had to do a lot of extra work on something that would probably take about half an hour to assemble. The top shelf (wood) and the middle open shelf are built to actually take a little weight. But the bottom of the drawer and the inside shelf are very thin, and more like hard cardboard. There were also some gauges on one leg, but not enough to call it \"damaged\". Why am I keeping this cart instead of returning it? First, I hate the return/exchange process; secondly It is the exact size I need. I've ordered a lot of things from Overstock.com and am rarely disappointed. As I said, for the price, it looks great.", 
    "this is a trolley, which if the back and sides and bottom corners were slotted right for the thin boards or whatever 1/8 in slats were made of would have been nice if they went into the groves of the boards. I didnt like the allen wrenching, thing but it holds together better than others, probably, the top is very sturdy and pretty, and the shelf above doors was sturdy except was damaged on a corner. One of the drawer corners fell apart, was fixed by using a longer screw. the bottom of drawer didnt fit correctly and has a space at bottom front of drawer", 
    "Overall, the product is what I wanted and is serving it's purpose well in my kitchen. My only real problem was that a piece was broken upon arrival and my boyfriend (who kindly assembled this item for me) had be crafty in order to compensate for the broken piece. However, once fully assembled, the broken piece is not visible and the cart works great.", 
    "The kitchen trolley is just what I was looking for in a microwave cart. It is small but has ample storage and especially a shelf for cookbooks. It is perfect for the space provided.One small problem one of the pieces was not drilled with a screw set. We solved the problem by using wood filler and gorilla glue for that piece.", 
    "I saw this trolley online but was leery only because the picture looked kinda off white or antique white however I purchased it anyways and its true white so I was relieved. It was very easy to put together, it's sturdy & looks great! Would recommend to anyone who's looking for a microwave cart .", 
    "solid wood on top, the space between the cabinet wasn't quite large enough for my microwave, the floor of the cabinet is a little weak- i put wine bottles in there and it bowed a little, but doesn't seem to be causing a problem.", 
    "I needed a microwave cart that didn't take up too much space. This was a great buy. Simple and quick to assemble. I didn't use the wheels and it didn't make a difference. Overstock hasn't disappointed me yet.", 
    "One side of the drawer does not fit well, otherwise it is well made. The bottom floor of the cabinet could be made of thicker, stronger materials."
