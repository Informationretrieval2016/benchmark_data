    "Seems like quality product, easily assembled & looks good on the wall.", 
    "This is a pretty solid and nice looking cabinet. It's not difficult to put together, but it does require a bit of patience. On assembly projects like this, I always separate and organize the hardware that comes with them before doing anything. I find it helps eliminate confusion about what's what and what goes where. Oh, and I also put a dab of glue on all the wooden dowels, just for good measure.", 
    "I just love it. It came in good condition and It looks great in my bathroom."
