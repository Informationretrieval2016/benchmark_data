    "It's hard to say about the assembly, because I was not there, but just keep in mind when ordering one of these, if it sits in the middle of a room, this one is perfect. looks good from front and back. some need to go against a wall. Delievery, was spot on time.", 
    "Perfect for my needs. Well made. Great price too!", 
    "I was concerned because the packaging was so damaged but internal re-packaging was secure. You will need an empty room to lay out the dozens of parts.", 
    "Product surprised us in quality of materials, ease of assembly, and appearance once assembled.", 
    "Instruction where good. Easy to put together. Love the top contrast with the black base. The cart is sturdy and the fold up leaf is handy when you need more space.", 
    "well built, cam locks were an issue. I had to buy new Ones, other ise worked well.", 
    "this wasn't too difficult to assemble and it looks great in our new kitchen!", 
    "Shipping was fast, it actually arrived a day early, and it was packaged well. I'll warn you this review will probably be more about putting it together than looks/functionality because taking latter into consideration, its a 5 star product. The one star deduction comes from the fact that the instructions are a bit vague in places and it is tricky to do with one person.I will agree with other reviews that it is complicated to assemble in the early stages. once you get things rolling, it comes together quickly. If I had it to do over again, that wouldn't deter me from purchasing this cart. That being said, don't let that intimidate you and miss out on a great piece of furniture. I had just a regular screwdriver and it took me about 2.5 hours from start to finish.I recommend taking inventory and counting everything before getting started. Do take care with some of the thinner pieces as I can see how they could be damaged while putting this together. You'll need a lot of floor space to lay everything out and it would be wise to put down a towel or blanket to avoid scratching the wood pieces.The cam lock screws are tricky to tighten and I have had a few fall out when moving the cart after I put it together. My dad helped me better secure them. As far as the wine rack shelves go, I would recommend having a second set of hands to get all of the pieces aligned and, as other reviewers mentioned, glue them for additional stability.Overall, those were the main issues I had. When its all said and done, I'm very happy with the finished product and have gotten many compliments on it in the short time I've had it. Mine was also perfect front and back and sits in the middle of my kitchen to break up the open concept kitchen/dining room.", 
    "I received my cart and the main side piece was damaged as well at 2 of the wine shelves. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me replacement pieces. The cam screws are a nightmare to put in. The allen wrench wouldn't fit in all the tight places making it impossible to tighten all of them. Some of them wouldn't tighten at all. If not for the assembly and the screws the cart itself is very nice. I just don't know how long it will stay sturdy for. If it weren't such a pain to ship back, I would just return it.", 
    "This cart looks great when put together. The drawer glides open and closed as if it is floating on air, and the bottom cabinet opens and closes perfectly and sits squarely. The item weighs a TON, and comes completely in pieces...many, many, many pieces. If you, or someone you know, are not well equipped when it comes to do-it-yourself projects or in putting RTA furniture together, I would recommend purchasing another cart. I am lucky in that I am capable of such things and put the entire thing together alone in just under 2 hours. The directions are not completely clear, so it took a bit of finesse and brain power to determine which direction the wine shelves should go. That said, the ridge/bottle stopper on each shelf should face upwards and be closest to the floor when it is laying on its back and being put together. If you are not familiar with Cam Locks, back away from this purchase because, in addition to a ton of screws, there are very many of them. The \"wood\" is more of a laminated product, and the side of the adjustable shelf chipped when I was standing the cart up to put the top on when my fingernail scraped it. So...I am very careful not to be too rough around the cart, and basically use \"kid gloves\" when working on or around it. As I said, it looks great when put together and looks more expensive than it was, but it's definitely a project on arrival and the wood isn't as durable as I'd like for it to be. If I had more funds available for such a purchase I would have gone with a solid wood product, like a butcher block, but this will do for now. Instead of using it for a spare counter that I can use for preparing food, I decided to use it as a rolling bar. It seems to be a great use for it, and exactly what I would recommend it for.", 
    "Lots of small pieces and parts to put together. End reult is good and perfect for all kitchens. Nice to have dropped side table to use as needed.", 
    "This thing took hours to assemble. There were only two of us, but we probably needed 8 to hold the damn wine rack shelves in place\u2014and we are both fairly handy and have a lot of flat-pack experience. The cam screws do not tighten properly, so in a lot of places, they fell out *after* we assembled everything. Another reviewer mentioned that if you follow the directions in order, which we did, it's impossible to tighten two of the cam screws holding the wine shelves together, which is true. The other cam screws just fall out on their own.Now that it's put together, it's a fairly sturdy and nice extra bit of counter and storage space, but not for the feint of heart.", 
    "We just love it. It's amazing new piece of furniture in our home,", 
    "holy smokes there is a lot of parts... when I was putting it together with pretty decent instructions I also glued with Elmer's wood glue for long term durability ...just recommended but not required ... my wife loves it as it does look very nice once assembled ...very handy to have a mobile cart in the kitchen when entertaining ...", 
    "very difficult to put together but very attractive", 
    "Great materials and design. Assembling instructions could use some improvement (it is better to start from the right of the cart and build toward the left than the other way around. I learned it the hard way!). Overall excellent product for a good price. Love it.", 
    "I love this cart! It was exactly as pictured and easy to put together with a little help from hubby ;)", 
    "Great cart. we use it all the time. Easy to put together.", 
    "Nice cabinet, solid. A lot of piece to put together but good directions."
