    "I ordered two of these cabinets. Upon assembling them I was unable to finish cause the top nor the bottom pieces aligned with they body of the cabinet. Very disappointed.", 
    "Great cabinet for the price~", 
    "Must be assembled. Seemed overwhelming...but wasn't. Love this cabinet, would recommend.", 
    "Very nice quality and makes great use of our lost corner space in a bath room!", 
    "Easy to put together, good solid construction, nice finish and nice hardware. I didn't wall mount mine, just set it into a deep corner on my bathroom counter which would have been otherwise pretty useless. Looks great!", 
    "This cabinet is ok, and works well for the space we have. The door seems flimsy and the knob is cheap looking. I will probably buy a new knob. It was relatively easy to hang, although I bought more substantial drywall anchors. What was included does not seem enough to hold the cabinet when full.", 
    "I bought this to store modems and such in our office/guest room. It houses them perfectly and is well made and sturdy. I did not hang it; just have it right on the floor as a floor cabinet. Works well for this.", 
    "Looking for a cute corner cabinet for the bathroom remodel and of course I find it at Overstock! Just the right touch to finish the vintage style bathroom and provide well needed storage.", 
    "Great corner wall cabinet! Just what I wanted. The directions are pretty poor, but luckily I can put things together regardless. I really like this corner set!", 
    "Nice shelf for the value. Somewhat easy it put together. Haven't hung yet but it should fit my needs perfectly.", 
    "Nice cabinet for the value. Looks great in the laundry room and will hold more than I thought it would. Had to caulk one area on the door where there was a gap in a seam but now it looks great. Good weight to it and seems sturdy. Happy with the purchase.", 
    "So very pleased with this cabinet - it is exactly what I was hopping it would be. Putting it together was easy with the directions which were very clear. Thank you!!!!", 
    "My husband put it together in what it seemed reasonable amount of time. It's great to have it right above the toilet, in the corner, so that the toilet paper is easily reachable if it runs out. One word of caution: it fits best if the corners are straight, rather than rounded like in the Spanish style houses. There's a way to get it into those as well, but not as easy. Overall, I am pleased with the cabinet. It looks nice and unassuming, and holds tons of toilet paper.", 
    "Great cabinet. Arrived fast and in perfect shape. It was exactly what we were looking for. Looks awesome in our bathroom. Only problem we had was, two of the holes were not drilled correctly so they didn't line up right. My husband was able to make them work and everything turned out great.", 
    "I done originally intended to use this as the main home for Cocky my rooster. But dagnabbit, the advertissment done said it would fit both my roosters for breeding and stuff. Well this cabinet doesn't have a vibe that's condolutin' to rooster matin'. So I done used it as a storage cabinet in my house. Worked great."
