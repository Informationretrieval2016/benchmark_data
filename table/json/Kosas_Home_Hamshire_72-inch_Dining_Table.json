    "The table arrived yesterday - and I knew immediately upon opening it that I was not as pictured. The table is in long planks - kind of like a picnic type table - I was expecting it to be weathered and distressed looking but the planks are all different colors - one plank is very light wood - the next is medium wood and the next to dark wood - I did not like the striped looking effect. *** beware if you don't like it - it will cost you big bucks to send it back - there was nothing in the fine print that I saw about the me having to pay a return shipping charge - I did think it would be easy to return something I didn't like but not the case. I do want to add - the table is very heavy and well made - I gave it high points for that - it's just the top construction that is strange to me - why they would use different colors of wood on the top instead of distressing one kind of wood - I don't like the look at all. I've seen similar distressed tables and none of them had the different color planks - so take that into consideration and also the cost and hassle to return.", 
    "Within 4 months of owning the product, the wood started splitting and a plank popped up. Pretty at first but it just isn't holding up", 
    "I ordered the medium brown finish. At the time of ordering up to the time I am posting this review, the photo shown that is clearly labeled medium brown is not at all what I received. I expected a medium brown wood with a distressed, whitewashed type of finish, as shown. I received a dark brown, shiny table with zero wash or distressing. Clearly based on the pictures provided by overstock, it appears the lime wash table is a lighter, blonde wood with a whitewash and the medium brown is a darker wood with a different albeit distressed wash. I contacted overstock, explained the problem and sent pictures at their request of what they sent me. They did arrange pickup of the table at their expense and shipped me a limewash table instead. That table is darker than the blonde one in the photos but lighter than the medium brown shown in the pics. Despite asking multiple times, overstock never clarified if they did send the wrong table or if their photos are wrong. To be safe, if you want a distressed look as I did, get the limewash. The medium brown one was pristine and dark and shiny...not good if you're running a household with active children, where cottage and industrial chic is a decorators best friend. Both tables are very sturdy and a good value....and despite the lengthy delay in finally getting the right table, customer service was helpful and respectful and I am glad I made this purchase.", 
    "I looked for a long time for a table & was very worried about ordering online. The table is very heavy & sturdy. The color is beautiful. The only assembly required is bolting the legs to the table. I ran into missing piece for one of the legs & had to call overstock customer service. They offered to send a replacement table but that would take another week to arrive. I was having a dinner party that evening so I needed a functioning table. I was then advised to go to a hardware store & find the proper size washer & bolt as they could not ship the missing miss. I was able to find the piece I needed for the table. The table is very heavy & you need at least 2 people to lift once the legs are on. If you don't like rustic then this is not the table for you.", 
    "First of all, it arrived very quickly. Less than a week to travel by freight across country. The delivery company scheduled a window to deliver and were on time and stuck around to let me open the box to make sure there was no hidden damage. Assembly was a snap \u0096 just bolt on the legs. One side rail of the table was a little out of line. Most people probably wouldn't even notice, but I'm pretty particular. I removed a couple of brackets on the bottom, pushed the rail into line to my satisfaction and re-attached the brackets. Perfect. A little bit of wonkiness is part of the charm of the table, but I'm happier with it now. As far as the look of it, it's great. It has some alternating darker and lighter planks with not too over-the-top distressing and sanded white and (much less) lime green finish. The top has some subtle wavy-ness, but is still mostly flat and smooth. The construction is very solid. It's really heavy. I needed help to flip it after attaching the legs. Overall, a great purchase. Love this table.", 
    "Please listen to the other 2 reviews that warn about the medium brown color. I made the same mistake. The picture labeled as medium brown is actually lime wash. The medium brown is a polished dark wood finish. Look up other Hamshire furniture pieces and you will be able to see what the medium brown color looks like. I just contacted Overstock today to get it exchanged, they said they would contact the warehouse to have the picture updated. Love the table, but it is just not the color pictured. If you are looking for a rustic/distressed wood finish, get the lime wash.", 
    "The table arrived yesterday and exceeded my expectations. I wrestled between the lime wash and the darker one - but the lime wash is perfect. Just a hint of lime in the distressed finish.", 
    "Ok, first off I wanted a real solid wood table to meet the demands of my two boys, none of this veneer furniture that is sold in the local furniture stores would do because they would soon be marred by scratches. I wanted something that would last and if scratched, would add to the character of the piece. When I received my table the corner support was unfortunately broken and it did take another 3 weeks to get a replacement but the end result is a heavy solid table that doesn't scratch like the others . Since I saw two of the tables I can say that no two are alike , the first was more lime washed and perhaps had a more level surface. It is a unique tough table that should stand the test of time.", 
    "The 72\" Hamshire lime wash table is great! The only problem was that it took weeks to get the table from somewhere in California. This could be improved Overstock! Once again the packaging was excellent. It took more time to unpack this extremely heavy table than to put it the legs on. The table meets all my requirements. It is lime washed white rustic Accia (sp) wood with a slight hint of green. This is one of the best quality buys that I got from Overstock. Oh, put the table is now on sale.", 
    "I am so happy with this table. It is exactly like the picture, and very heavy. I love it. Bought the Hampton chairs to match & got just the look I wanted. Packed very well...", 
    "Although it arrived with a scratch on the corner, overstock was quick to offer me solutions that were fair. I absolutely love this table. It's REAL wood and it's gorgeous!!!! Love looking at this masterpiece every day. Thank you overstock for being a HUGE PART of our remodel. My house is being transformed into the house of my dreams \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f", 
    "We always get tons of compliments on this table - it looks great in our dining room.", 
    "I got the table in white wash and 4 chairs. It was my firs time ordering such big items online....I was so worried. No need to be. The table is lovely, very well made, so heavy! They brought it upstairs for me (4th floor). The finish is exactly what I was looking for. Well worth the money.", 
    "Great buy for the price! Solid wood, beautiful grain, sturdy...dinning table for years to come. Very simple design but makes a statement. We have used it with 8 chairs. Since it does not have cross bars or ornaments under, works great. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Very nice table. Expected the wash to have more white, but happy still the same.", 
    "When this table arrived, it had a few dark/walnut stained stripes running down the length of the table. I didn't expect that the wood planks wouldn't match each other, now I have a striped table. It is heavy and sturdy but the surface is wavy and not good for resting wine glasses on.", 
    "Table is solid and heavy, could do jumping jacks on it no problem. Only flaw is the table top has large spot that is not flat and dips in slightly. Guess that helps gives it the rustic look?", 
    "Everyone that comes over comments on how much they love this table!!! It is a solid heavy nicely made table! I love it!!!", 
    "Absolutely love this table! Exactly like the picture and I've received so many compliments!", 
    "Beautiful!!!! WOW! A weathered piece that is a stunner!! Very stable and sturdy. This piece is heavy and super well-built!! Love it!!", 
    "This is a beautiful table! My family loves it. It is sturdy and beautiful to look at. I purchased the white washed color.", 
    "I owned this table for a few years, but when i sold my last house, the buyers wanted it. So glad to know it was still available. Very, very heavy but easy to attch the legs. We can put our drinks on it without coasters and is already distressed, so scratches do not show.", 
    "This table is so beautiful!!! I get so many compliments on it!!! I love the lime wash it is so pretty. It's beachy and rustic all at once. It's such a nice size table too!! Plenty of room for everyone.", 
    "This table is extremely beautiful but very very heavy! you will need help carrying this. it was also very easy to put the legs onto the table. exactly as pictured! we love it!", 
    "This table is gorgeous and exactly what I wanted. It's super heavy, really well made, has the perfect amount of \"shabby chic\" for my beach house, beautiful coloring, and I've gotten a ton of compliments on it. I got the white washed color and it's perfect. It will arrive double boxed and extremely heavy to carry. It took 2 big guys to bring it upstairs to my dining room. The legs were easy to install but I wasn't able to flip the table upright because it's so heavy (had to wait for my boyfriend to get home and help me). The quality of the wood is great -- it's reclaimed acacia wood.", 
    "Very sturdy, give a great look to my apartment. Matched it up with white leather chairs for modern+rustic look! Have recieved many compliments. Good size for 6 adults hosting.", 
    "We were worried about buying online, but the reviews on customer service were solid, so we went with it.Pros: Solid table, easy/fast to put together, Smooth finish with no seams/gaps in between \"boards\" of table top, NOT at all picnic table like, delivery was 2 wks to CA, and very easy.Cons: As others said, quality control issues - All the legs had some battle damage, 2/4 were quite scratched at the bottom. BUT, went on overstock chat, told them about it, and BAM, new legs mailed out. Done. Super easy! Can just swap 1 at a time without flipping the table back over. Notes: Need two small to medium men or moderately strong women to flip after assembly. Also, get a 13/16\" deep socket wrench and ratchet, makes putting together super fast/easy.", 
    "I love everything about this table! The distressed look was perfect for my decor. I would have rated it five stars but one of the supporting beams under the table was broken. The table was so heavy and it was such a pain getting out of it's packaging; I didn't bother stressing to call Overstock. I had waited so long to get the table I didn't want them to tell me I had to return the table. Other than that this table is worth every penny!", 
    "This table is a tank and it looks incredible. We ordered the white wash model. It's a little darker than what is shown in this picture. The surface of the table has small waves due to the imperfect nature of the planks but that is by design. If you're looking for a rustic like kitchen table then I highly recommend.", 
    "So I meant to buy the hamshire white wash table 72\" but I ordered the wrong one. MAKE SURE TO SELECT RIGHT COLOR! Regardless, I fell in love with the dark brown and kept it. It's a nice table but I wouldn't say there is anything particularly special about it. Looks a lot like some tables you can find at world market, for example, and work market is significantly cheaper (I wish I had gotten my table there). I kept it because it cost a lot to ship back and it looks good. I wouldn't buy this again though. It also came with a giant scratch on one of the legs."
