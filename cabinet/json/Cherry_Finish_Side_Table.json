    "We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of this side table. It is exactly as pictured and described. Great value for the price!", 
    "I've had this for at least two years and it's holding up well. The drawer is big enough for odds and ends like a scissors, letter opener, remote and various other small items. The cabinet part is very roomy. I've got my tall vases in mine.", 
    "sturdy table, no shelf inside...color looks great.", 
    "The end table is nice, but the color isn't cherry. I got it for my office so it's great to store office supplies, but it's not the least bit cherry.", 
    "The perfect size small table goes great next to a chair. Itvitvisbsturdyband a good quality for the money.", 
    "We had a small space needing small tables and found them at Overstock. They arrived undamaged and are exactly what we needed with plenty of storage for remotes, books, etc.", 
    "This is value furniture with some fit and finish flaws but overall a good value for the price paid. I used scratch cover on a few areas and that pretty much took care of a few concerns. These are a great size for smaller spaces and provides much needed additional storage space. I purchased two and was very pleased that they arrived fully assembled.", 
    "Well, the first two we bought had small problems. One was not leveled and the second one had a small dent/split of the wood on the corner. They said the \"dent\" was UPS's fault, filed a claim and sent me a new one. The \"not leveled\" one is a product default and they wanted me to pack it up and send it pack. HA! Not a chance I was doing all that work. I just added felt pads to the bottom of the table and that fixed that. The new one they sent me has a small part on the bottom unfinished... and UPS never picked up the dented one. So now I have three \"slightly imperfect\" end tables.", 
    "I purchased this table to squeeze between two recliners. It suits that purpose very well. It arrived faster than the stated delivery time, there was no damage and it did not need assembly. The color is what I was hoping for and overall I am very pleased with my purchase. BUT, this is NOT a high dollar piece of furniture and I was not expecting it to be. There are some joints which do not meet exactly right, and the cabinet/drawer hardware is very inexpensive. Thankfully Overstock provides budget-conscious consumers with furniture options like the Cherry Finish Side Table."
