    "I was really suprised at the quality and style of this futon. It fits so well in my living room and with the other furniture pieces. For one, the process taking it out of the box was great. It didn't take too long to assemble. It super comfortable, chic and versatile. I even slept on it just to make sure that is was alright as a futon. My roommates love it and so do I. This is a great product for the price!", 
    "This futon has two flaws that I discovered after building it. First, the two halves are uneven, and there is no way to fix it because they are attached and there is no way to raise or lower one side. So the futon looks lopsided in person (the left side is a few inches higher than the right side).The second (and most disappointing) thing is that we found an area on one of the seats where the leather had clearly been cut open (about 2-3 inches long), and someone had obviously glued it back together and painted over it. It is quite obvious, and it really makes me wonder who did this tear and repair job. This item is supposed to be new, but I am a bit doubtful.Sadly, I saw a similar futon at another store the other day that looked better than this one for a fraction of the price. I regret purchasing this futon.", 
    "I enjoy this futon and it looks great in my home office. Easy to setup. My only issue is the height; the legs are only 8 inches tall. The futon sits too low to the floor. This might not be a problem for people who are of a shorter stature. I wish the legs were at least 16 inches. I'm 6'1\"", 
    "My son needed a space saving futon that can become a sleeper in his small apt in Brooklyn. It's stylish, comfortable and works out nicely in his small living room. Thank you.", 
    "Moderately pleased w/ my purchase, hence my 4/5 stars; however, it is a tad low and the lack of armrests is a bit annoying. Not a plop down instantly comfortable couch. For the price point, style, and overall purpose it's pretty great.", 
    "This was so easy to put together! I was sitting on it in a matter of minutes. Looks very modern and fits our space perfectly. Only dowside is that when folded like a couch, the cheap-ish upholstery shows in the back, and we have it floating in the room so it's noticeable. For the price, you can't complain though! And not so bad that I couldn't give 5 stars. Highly recommend."
