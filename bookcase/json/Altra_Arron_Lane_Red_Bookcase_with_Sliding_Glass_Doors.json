    "This is an adorable item,I love the color .It has a lot of different parts that need to be assembled and my husband, who is very handy, said it was complicated... but well worth the effort He also used wood glue to add to its stability. It looks much more expensive than its price and I am using it as a curio cabinet not a bookcase,looks great .Do not be afraid of this red color its a great shade that blends in so well with my eclectic decor .I spent weeks looking online for the one that I wanted and I am delighted !", 
    "I am using this bookcase to display a collection of piggy banks. It is exactly what I had hoped it would be. I had a friend put it together for me and he finished in less then a hour. No complaints from this shopper. Thanks again Overstock", 
    "My wife and I love it. Very nice quality", 
    "Received the corners pretty damaged. Depth is not enough if you are planning to store big books.", 
    "Its too small from the picture i cant put any books only kids ones.", 
    "The doors don't shut flush to the side--other than that I love it.", 
    "I love this bookcase. It is not very deep, but it is the perfect size for what I needed. Very modern look. Easy to put together....I did it by myself quickly with just a few tools.", 
    "a little smaller than expected, yet the product is wonderful _ the color is Crimson, which is perfect ...take yr time putting it together and it will be ok", 
    "I really wish I could upload photos. The stock images must be manipulated and not to scale because, because my dining table chair was almost as tall as this cabinet. In person, this cabinet looks like it belongs in a kid's room. It's small and rickety to say the least.Quality is very poor, 5 panels arrived damaged.After initiating return, I then noticed red streaks and stains on our rug.Now it will not come out. What a fail.", 
    "I love this, just wish it were bigger. I can hardly fit anything in it", 
    "perfect bright red color and size, nice quality, easy to assemble! I needed some storage in a small bathroom and this was an ideal choice.", 
    "It`s a bit smaller than it appears in the picture. Looks so nice, I love it. Great pice for my leaving room."
