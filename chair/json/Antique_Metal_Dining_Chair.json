    "These chairs look great for the price! They are cery sturdy and a fairly comfortable. The curve on the top of the back takes a little getting used to but overall for what I paid I am super happy!", 
    "Dark brown with gold accents...nice.", 
    "I bought this chair to use in my office and I love it! The color is great, black with the perfect amount of bronze/gold for an amazing antiqued look! The chair is great quality as well. I would definitely recommend this product!", 
    "All the reviews look great but they have been out of stock for a while. I hope they can make them available soon, I need 6!", 
    "This is a great chair for the price", 
    "I wasn't expecting much, but these chairs are great. Well constructed and also well designed to stack without damage to the lower chairs in the stack. Nicely braced underneath, very substantial, and the finish is durable, well-applied and OK for most purposes. I wanted a more \"antique\" patina and know how to achieve that, so the existing finish served as a good base for my touches. Bottom line: way better than you would expect from \"just another product made in China.\"", 
    "Love it, vintage , industrial, style well made", 
    "Bought 6 to go with a dark wood farmhouse table and these are perfect! Sturdy, well-made and the color is perfect. A great price too! Would definitely recommend!", 
    "So awedome! Sturdy and comfortable", 
    "This trendy style works for my decor. The chair will only fit slim / small people. It worked for my space because I didn't have room for an average size bulky dining room chair. It's solid & looks nicer than the picture. The size is really the only issue so beware if you're above average.", 
    "Was very happy with slightly weathered finish and quality. Looks great", 
    "Nice chairs and color is antique dark brown. Chairs are comfortable and feel solid. No assembly needed. Great value, thank you Overstock!And it was nice to be able to buy 3. (instead of buying in pairs)", 
    "Beautiful and well made chairs add an industrial look to our shabby chic beach house. Solid steel construction are surprisingly comfortable. Love the antique finish...goes perfect with our rubbed bronze fixtures. Can't be beat...especially for the price."
