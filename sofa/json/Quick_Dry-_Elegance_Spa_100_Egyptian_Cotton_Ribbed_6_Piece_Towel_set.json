    "I was excited to order these because the pics appeared to be thick and fluffy, and I like the ribbed effect. However, when I received them, I found them to be very very thin, some of the loops seemed like they were either frayed or beginning to fray, and the seams had threads sticking out, like the end of an area rug, shorter, of course, but I was not confident that the seams would hold after washing. The color is exactly as pictured, and since I am having trouble finding this exact color Silver in the stores I was disappointed the product was deficient in all other areas. I see why these were so inexpensive, since the quality is so low. I will be returning them, even though they did not cost much - I will sacrifice the shipping, but at least I'll get most of my money back. They are not worth keeping at any cost.Fortunately, kudos to Overstock, returns are easy and I greatly appreciate that kind of service!", 
    "Nothing like the photos .. Sending them all back.", 
    "I really like the colors I chose. They are not as fluffy as I hoped but that was just me looking at them in the packaging. Perhaps when I finally take them out and use them, they will surprise me. All in all, a great buy.", 
    "Nice towels. Color perfect. Plan to order another set in a different color later.",

    "Wish they were a little thicker but other love them!", 
    "I purchased the \"Spa Blue\" towels and they are a beautiful shade of light blue. After the initial wash and dry (using liquid fabric softener and dryer sheets), they towels are still soft. They are not a plush as the photograph makes them appear, but they are still very nice! Just wish they were a little more \"fluffy.\"",

    "The best towels to dry a sexy body", 
    "I purchase many items through this website and am rarely disappointed. These towels are by far the most disappointing purchase ever. They were nice right out of the packaging but after one or two washings, they look as though we've had them for years!! I would say the review on this website are all relative. If you're used to Frette (like I am) don't buy these!!!", 
    "These are not thick towels but they do the job. I find thinner towels best for drying off, especially with my arthritic thumbs. I have washed them and they turned out soft and nice. I would buy them again.",

    "These towels look great in my bathroom ans are super soft. they hold up great after washing.Great value.",

    "I love the color (brick) of these towels. They are absorbent, nice design and good weight.....not too heavy. The only problem is that they have a STRONG odd smell even after washing and hanging up in the bathroom. Next wash I will throw a dryer sheet in with the towels and hopefully this will get rid of the odor. Other than the smell, these towels are beautiful. I have been looking for this color as it is not too red or too orange.", 
    "The ribbing of the towels is not as rich as appears in the photos but not terrible either. The thickness is not is heavy as expected either. Other than that, I think these towels are great so far \u2014 especially for the price. Love the color!", 
    "We like the texture, softness and color of these towels. Would buy again!", 
    "There should be some standardization of towel industry terms. Elegance is not what I would have used. They look fluffy in the picture which they are not. I imagine I would have paid half of this price if I saw them at Home Goods...but with coupon and Gold Member points I guess it comes close. Overall not the quality I want for my home/body.",
