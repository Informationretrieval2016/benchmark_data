    "perfect... good quality... holds about 20+ pairs of women's flat shoes....no more clutter! and nice bottom shelf", 
    "True to the picture, very cute and sturdy. Assembly was a little complicated for me by myself, and luckily I have put together lots of furniture, so would suggest 2 people if possible for assembly.", 
    "I bought this to corral shoes in my foyer. It is attractive and well made. Some of my husband and son's bulkier shoes do not fit lengthwise but are fine sideways. The shelf on the bottom is a nice feature as well. Happy with this purchase.", 
    "I would have given this 5 stars instead of 4 if this cabinet was made of wood instead of man made materials, and the back panel had been pre-marked so I knew where to hammer in the nails (I kept missing and leaving holes where I had to pry out nails). On the plus side, when assembled, it looks like an expensive vintage wood piece. It is taller than I envisioned. By putting the top shelf in the highest position, it serves as a good place to stash keys, coins, and other small items in our entryway to reduce clutter. It is made to store shoes, but it could be used for many other small or narrow items."
