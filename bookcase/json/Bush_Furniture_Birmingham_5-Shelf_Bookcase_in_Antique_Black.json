    "Gorgeous black bookcase. Looks way more expensive in person. It's not a solid black, it's an antique black. East assemble, looks great in my home office.", 
    "This bookcase is a good deal for the price. It is sturdy, solid and I love the accents. It went together very easily and took about 2 hours. A corner of one piece was slightly damaged, but once it was put together the damage was hidden. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable bookcase that is not cheaply made.", 
    "For the price the bookcases (bought two) are sturdy and attractive. They were a bit complicate to assemble but perhaps that was just me. I highly recommend them compared to others I've seen at a higher price."
