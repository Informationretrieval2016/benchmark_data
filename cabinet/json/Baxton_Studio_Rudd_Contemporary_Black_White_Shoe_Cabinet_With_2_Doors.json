    "Holds plenty of shoes and looks great too!", 
    "The dimensions of this cabinet work well for men's size 13 shoes, which is why we bought it. The construction is what you would expect for the price. I put all of it together by myself until the last step where the doors attach to the cabinet. My husband had to help with that step because you really need more than 2 hands to hang the doors. There was one hinge that was in pieces when I took it out of the box, which caused some extra time and confusion to figure out. I wouldn't use this as \"furniture\" in a high traffic area, but it looks nice and functions well in our entry room off the garage."
