    "The grandson loves his new airplane bed and bookcase. Would purchase again.", 
    "Easy to assemble and holds a lot of books and toys. Our sons loves to spin the propeller. Taller books will not fit on the shelves, though.", 
    "It looks just like the picture! !", 
    "The bookshelf was easy to assemble and it's sturdy. My son loves it, but it's a bit small.", 
    "This shelf is the perfect height for a toddler to put books on and toys. My son loves to spin the propeller as well (It does spin). I would suggest a drill with a small bit to add a few of your own pilot (no pun intended haha) holes in case they don't line up exactly right. All in all a cute bookshelf, lightweight and very accessible to a small child, but don't even attempt assembly without at least a little bit of handy skills and patience.", 
    "My 4 year old son loves it. Came with a few scratches/dents-but mostly on the backside. The screw on the propeller keeps falling off.", 
    "Sturdy, well made, looks great in 2 year olds bedroom and holds his books and some toys. He loves it!"
