    "The pros: (1) it's really easy to assemble (just attach the legs!); (2) it's sturdy; (3) it's comfortable.The only con for me is the color. The fabric is a much darker tan than the light cream, and the legs are lighter than what looks like an espresso stain in the pictures.I am going to keep the chair because it's a hassle to return, and while it may not match the scheme to the living room for which it was intended, it matches other rooms in my house well enough for me to find it a home.", 
    "I've only had the chairs for ~3 weeks and they seem very sturdy. Putting the legs on was simple. No complaints so far.", 
    "It is perfect for a sitting chair in my bedroom. Cute & comfy.", 
    "It's a beautiful slipper chair. Great quality, beautiful fabric, and was perfect for the space. I recommend it.", 
    "The legs to do not assemble properly. I am beyond frustrated with the construction of this item. The legs have a 2 inch spot to connect to the body of the chair. It is so small that the allen wrench it came with doesn't fit in the space. I have been working on this for hours. I'm going to let someone else try this evening. If that doesn't work, I will have to return them.", 
    "I absolutely love this chair! The quality of the piece is great, especially considering the cheap price!! It was easy to assemble (just attach the legs)."
