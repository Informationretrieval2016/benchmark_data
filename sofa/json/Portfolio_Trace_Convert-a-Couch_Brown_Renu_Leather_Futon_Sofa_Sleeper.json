    "this is not a top of the line sofa/sleeper. it is, however, nicer than anything you will get at ikea and far more affordable + just as nice as something you will get a fancier furniture store. I'm very pleased with the value of the purchase - i didn't expect top quality, didn't get top quality, but am pleased to \"rent\" this furniture for the next 3 years for $500. I have a studio NYC apartment and it fits comfortably and is large enough to sleep a grown *** adult. the night i sliced my hand on a bottle of wine, i got stitches, and no less than 30 minutes later i was assembling this one handed. if i can assemble this one handed, after 2 glasses of wine, and in under 2 hours, you sure as hell can do it with 2 hands sober in under 60 minutes. if other people say it takes longer, my guess is that life is very hard for them every day. if you're looking to furnish your dream home, skip this. if you have need for a rarely used or not important couch / sleeper that won't embarrass you in front of discerning friends with taste, look no further. they will be impressed with your shopping savvy.", 
    "BOUGHT THIS FOR \"JUST-GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE\" DAUGHTER FOR APARTMENT ABOVE THE GARAGE. SHE LOVED IT. SHE SAYS IT IS COMFORTABLE TO SLEEP ON AND SHE LIKES THAT IT IS \"LEATHER\" RATHER THAN MATERIAL (THAT COULD STAIN EASILY). I WAS SURPRISED THAT IT HAD SPRINGS RATHER THAN A CHEAP FOAM FOR THE INSIDES. ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT TELL THAT IT CAN BE CONVERTED INTO A BED (VERY EASILYL BY THE WAY) WHEN IT IS SET UP AS A COUCH. MY 11 YR OLD DAUGHTER AND I CARRIED IT UPSTAIRS (IN PIECES) AND PUT IT TOGETHER EASILY BY OURSELVES IN A COUPLE OF HOURS FOLLOWING THE SIMPLE ENCLOSED DIRECTIONS.", 
    "We wanted a sofabed for our guest room/den, and this immediately caught my eye as a great alternative to a heavy sofabed or a frumpy futon. This little hybrid sofa is perfect--well constructed and quite a bit more sturdy than we had expected. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the futon cover velcro detaches when converting, and the cushions don't puff up quite as much as would be expected to fill the cover out and fill the frame gaps out. This sofa is a bargain for any small space that you need to put guests up in, or for sleepovers and such. I probably wouldn't purchase it for my main livingroom or family room, however.", 
    "I ordered this for my den for my out-of-town guests to sleep on. I used it about 5-10 times in the course of 10 or 11 months. When I went to fold it back up again the entire couch would not snap back into place. The mechanics on it had completely broken. To fold it back up now you need to have two people at either side push it back together. I also need to make sure that it is always wedged against a wall so that if you even sit on it like a couch it doesn't slide/fold out to bed size. It looks great and is very comfortable to sleep on but in the end I should have bought something that would have at least lasted more than a year.", 
    "This is basically a nice futon, and it looks just like the pictures suggest. Very comfortable to sit and sleep on, and of a nice distressed brown color. I had no idea what the \"renu leather\" is going to look or feel like, but it really is very similar to leather (except for the smell), very soft to the touch. Whether it is durable and easily cleanable is to be seen. The assembly was an interesting adventure, and it certainly takes two people and more than an hour to unpack and put together. It would be really nice if the arms reached further back, as there is a good gap between the wall and the end of the arms. All in all, I would say it is a great buy for the price, and serves the purpose we bought it for.", 
    "I'd been searching for months for a futon sofa bed. I wanted one that was at least a full size bed, comforatble (which most are not) and one that would actually look like a living room sofa. THIS IS IT !! I am so happy with it & it's very comfortable. No one has slept on it yet but I sit (lay) on it every evening & it's wonderful. I highly recommend it...Oh & it wasn't hard to put together- although nmy nephew did it- he said it was easy. It's very sturdy. It is light however, so it's best against a wall. Sitting independently it would move around a bit.", 
    "This is a great sleeper sofa/futon. It looks less like a futon and more like a regular sofa. I bought it for an office that can sleep relatives when they come to visit. I personally am going to buy a feather topper for it as full size sheets want to slide right off. It looks like leather but that part of it is really thin and doesn't feel like leather. It feels more like plastic. However, I knew this from reading the many reviews so I didn't expect a quality leather sofa for this cheap price. This same sofa with high quality leather would be 3 times this price or more so those that are giving poor reviews because of the leather quality really have unrealistic expectations of this sofa for the price. The construction is excellent as was the packaging. It was vacuum sealed so don't expect to send it back the way it came as that would is impossible. I can't imagine anyone would want to send it back though. Contrary to was others said on the reviews, it is SIMPLE to put together. Honestly, I don't understand how anyone could give poor reviews based on the assembly. It is not complicated to assemble. It took about an hour because there are several steps and parts but simply follow the directions and there will be no problems. It is medium (not soft, not firm) and comfy as a sofa. It has a nice mechanism that is easy to fold down. Finally, I was pleasantly surprised that you can put it within about 2 or 3 inches of the wall behind it when used as a sofa and yet you do NOT need to pull it out to fold it down.", 
    "High quality, comfortable, and very attractive. Unbelieveable value for the price!", 
    "After a lot of searching and indecisiveness, I decide to try this sofa because it addressed all of my needs, looked great online, and got some very favorable reviews. Also, my son will soon be needing something just like this for his college apartment. I was very hesitant, because I had a sleeper sofa once before, and thought I would never get one again. It arrived promptly, and although the box was in pretty bad shape, the sofa was luckinly undamaged in any way, and was assembled easily by my son, who is 6'2\". We are both thrilled by its looks and comfort. It is only enough space for one person to sleep, but is perfect for a small room, and looks great. Very glad I made this purchase! Thanks Overstock!", 
    "I have looked & looked for a decent futon that wasnt hard as a rock. I CANNOT tell you how THRILLED i am with this one! It took about 90 min to put together, & it is stunning. Seems made well. & SO comfortable. The width & height of the springs in the cushions, when we were putting it together, shocked me. I couldnt wait to try it! & i promise you, it is THE absolute most comfortable thing to sleep on! In fact, I had guests & since its tight for 2 adults - DO-able, but still, its a little smaller than a double - I offered them my Master bedroom instead of guest room futon. Well ... my guests stayed 8 nites, & they have been gone 4 nites, & I STILL havent moved back to my own bedroom b/c i just love it. & the price was 1/2 of the ones at higher end stores I was looking at. Im almost tempted to buy a 2nd one & store it, in case they stop making them! lol", 
    "My dog and I are perfectly happy with the sofa. I am short and find that some products are not comfortable for shorties. I studied the reviews and available info carefully, so I got what I expected.Assembly was not a problem.", 
    "Super easy to put together, looks very sharp, highly recommend", 
    "Love Love Love This couch was easy for my husband to build and very nice to sit on as well as sleep on One of the bset purchases made on overstock to date We are very happy with it so far.", 
    "Very Comfortable Futon/Couch with nice pillows. Good Value. Wish leather was a bit softer.", 
    "Very hard to put together. Takes way to much time, closer to 3 hours. The back of the fulton is not good, its just a flap. Alot of money for what I received, Not happy at all.", 
    "I ordered the couch last week and received it this morning. (About 5 to 6 days after placing order.) In about an hour or so we had it all put together. It comes nicely packed with just a handful of screws to place in. Nothing too overwhelming at all. It seems like it has good construction and a really decent leather fabric. It is bigger than I expected... which is a good thing. I thought it might look a bit dinky just considering the price and that it is a basic sofa bed. But definitely not. It is a great size and comfortably fits two adults when in the bed position. It is very comfortable to sit on and lay on. The fact that the cushions are built with springs is a great thing and seems like it will help it last much longer than if it just had foam cushions. We love that it has three positions... full upright for sitting, a lounge position and then the complete down position for the bed. Very easy to move back and forth from. We love it so far! Considering we bought a basic microsuede couch a couple of years ago from a large furniture chain store for $599 and then had to pay $185 for delivery, getting this for $$$ shipped directly to our door (bought when Overstock was having a sale) is fantastic. Couldn't be happier so far!", 
    "Very affordable and confy!", 
    "This couch is very comfortable. Extremely easy to put together and very neat looking. I bought two. Definitely worth the money", 
    "Easy to put together, comfortable, open bed great.", 
    "This was an excellent choice for the grandkids hangout and the occasional overnight guest! Probably wouldn't hold up with constant use but exactly what was needed!", 
    "this couch is very comfortable but it is really much more of a futon than a couch. and it reclines opening into a bed if you lean back too much. it wasn't hard to assemble however it was made trickier by the fact that parts of the metal were bent and needed hammering back into place. i don't except it to last too long, but for now it does the job. also it arrives in one huge box, so be prepared if you have stairs to deal with", 
    "This sofa was fairly easy to put together. I am a 65 year old woman and I did it myself. It does smell pretty bad, so I've been keeping the window open for a few weeks now, to try to get the smell out....I think it's coming from the two mattresses. The zipper broke on one of the covers, so sure hope I never need to pull the mattress out. The pillows are the worst. They should just omit them from the order. The springs are just below the cover and I can picture them popping thru in no time at all. The other reviews, regarding springs and smell are accurate. I would suggest placing a 1 inch piece of foam on top of the mattresses below inserting them into the covers, to help with comfort and longevity. You get what you pay for.", 
    "It is very narrow, looks cheap and is hard as a rock.I read the reviews and most were positive, but this couch is awful!Might be ok for teenage rec room or dorm", 
    "Firstly, the design and looks nice and these are 5 stars for a year. However, this couch is not durable especially for heavy person. I have been using for a year and no problem. It is broken by my husband was sitting the same spot (he is heavy..more than 200 pound) and now it has big dent....the warranty is only one year so probably I can not repair or it cost a lot...", 
    "I love this futon! We bought it for guests but thought we should test it out first. Incredibly comfortable and very stylish.", 
    "We needed a sofa sleeper for our main level as we have older parents that cannot climb stairs when they visit. I wanted something that was esthetically pleasing as a sofa as well. This is a nice combo. It was easy to assemble. Quality seems to be good. The one complaint I have is that the side arms are a bit wrinkled still after being assembled for 3 weeks. Hoping those will work their way out yet.", 
    "Purchased this item in 2012. Put it in a sun / childs play room. Works great for overnite guest. It is showing signs of wear but was an excellent purchase for what i use it for. It is strong and sturdy and holding up well for every dad kids use.", 
    "Vary nice, sofa looks very expensive. I have used it as a bed also comfortable.", 
    "I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of this convert-a-couch. I turn it into a bed every night without fail, the material easily wipes away my dog's shed hair, the cushioning is excellent and the width suits me perfectly (I'm 6'2\"). By myself, the mattress took less than an hour to assemble.I spent weeks searching for an ideal futon frame and mattress. I'm so thankful I found this far-superior alternative. Even the backing looks like that of a leather couch.", 
    "This review should be taken with a grain of salt because I've only had the product for a couple of weeks. That said, I can comment on the delivery, ease of assembly, and initial comfort. I think it looks more stylish than several of the alternatives that I looked at prior to buying this one. The package was a gigantic box (7 ft tall, 150 lb) that arrived on-time and without issue. The instructions were buried in the box, so you just have to unpack everything and start unwrapping the pieces - you'll find it. The instructions themselves were minimal - mostly pictures on how to assemble it. This did lead to one problem that took some troubleshooting to resolve. When assembling the back and seat it shows the pieces \"clicking\" into place and appears that you just have to firmly shove the pieces together. However, there is a small latch that you have to lock into place after having shoved the pieces together. If you don't do this, it will fall apart when you sit on it and you'll have to start over. The comfort is pretty good - not too firm and not too soft. You can't feel the springs of the cushion through the seat material and padding. Hopefully this holds up relatively well. Overall, for the price this is a very good couch/futon.", 
    "I love this futon! My husband and I sleep on this together, every night. We have a relatively small apartment with a 20 month old. We gave her the large room, use our small room as a walk in closet and sleep on the futon in the living room where the big tv is. It works for us. It's very comfortable to sleep on, and the leather is surprisingly breathable. We thought we would be sweating under the comforter because of all the heat trapped by the leather cover, but it's fine! You know those times when you search for the cold spot on the bed with your feet? Well the leather cold spot is much better :) This is the most comfortable futon I've ever sleep on. The mattress is a legit spring mattress. I love that no one can tell this is really a futon. It looks just like a normal sofa when converted. My only qualm, is that I believe it's smaller than the listed dimensions. I haven't measured it, but our full size bed was 53\" wide. This claims to be 51\" wide, and I just don't see it. It's a little snug for my husband and I, but so far no one has rolled off yet. The width is my only complaint.", 
    "It doesn't look cheap, in fact I have it against the wall and it doesn't even look at all like a futon. Now the material is very comfortable and I've even slept on it once. Also not hard to put together. My only complaint is that when it was humid, the back of the couch was against my beige walls and the color bled onto the walls a little but for me that washed right off, and it wasn't noticeable until I had moved it. It never made any marks on my throw blankets and they were light colored, or any clothing so far. For the price, this is a good couch", 
    "I purchased two of these futons based on the look and the high ratings they have received. I have only had them for a month, so I can not rate their durability, but I am very happy so far. They are stylish, comfortable (for a futon), and were easy to assemble. They look nice in our playroom. They are comfortable enough for the adults to use as sofas, and were able to fit all four of our young grandchildren (ages 5-8) on them as beds for their weekend visit. They were a bit more expensive then some of the other futon choices, but I believe their quality was worth the extra cost.", 
    "The product looks nice in the room but it not very comfortable. Also it the first sofa I've sit in the squeak so much. The foam that's use for the cushion is not good. I don't like this product at all. The only reason I kept this product it's too much trouble to return.", 
    "it fell apart only after two years...I should have bought the warrenty.", 
    "Not comfortable to sleep OR sit. It is going in the junk because I wouldn't give it to a friend...that is how awful it is.", 
    "We were looking for a sleeper sofa for our living room that is easy to move/put together, where our occasional guests could sleep in addition to our guest room, and most importantly - is pet proof. At the time we purchased this (a year ago) we had a new puppy who was still learning to go outside to potty, so for the occasional 'accident' this couch was perfect. Easy to clean, as if it repels liquids. We haven't had any instances of our dog trying to chew the furniture, so I can't tell you if it would hold up to a dog that chews or cat scratches. It's not the most comfortable couch though and we didn't care for the pillows that came with it (and apparently neither did our puppy who chewed them up the first chance he got), but with the right throw pillows and blankets its comfortable enough to sleep on in my opinion. Appearances are just as shown online. If there's anything I'd improve about this couch is that it would be made of softer material with more comfortable cushioning that you sink into. As it is now, it's very firm but it is functional and easy to clean and the price was right for us. Now that our 'puppy' is grown and accident-free we might upgrade to a more comfortable sofa and will keep this around in our finished basement (and thankful this is easy to move around).", 
    "Not bad for the price. Color matches exactly to the picture.", 
    "Great sofa convertible, but instructions were poor. Makes for a very comfortable bed!", 
    "This sofa converts easily into a bed by just lifting the bed cushion. Sleeps quite well, not too soft, not too firm. Looks nice, sits well.", 
    "Pros: - Really cushy and provides comfortable seating. - Comfortable and stable when sleeping in the reclined position. - There are two upright positions; one is fully upright, and the second is a deep tilt that's great for leaning back and watching a large screen. - The instructions for assembly were clear. Definitely a two-person job. - The couch did not have an unpleasant smell when it arrived. Cons: - The fake leather material is obviously fake leather. That said, it is (so far) durable and easy to clean. It's not unattractive, just clearly not genuine leather. - The arms are harder than I imagined, and not at all suitable for reclining on. The couch needs a few large throw pillows to make leaning on the arms comfortable. - Lifting it between positions takes more effort than a normal futon; however, it is doable for one (sufficiently fit) person. - The small throw pillows it comes with are hideous. We donated ours.", 
    "We love this couch. It is an excellent choice for the price and it make a more comfortable bed than most futons. We had a little trouble getting the cover on correctly, because the instructions weren't clear, but one we got it on right, it looks very nice. The cover looks and feels very soft and leather-like.", 
    "I was told overstock should have double boxed the packaging because I had to send it back the first time because it was damaged during shippIng. There were minor damages to the second shipment, but they were not worth sending it back again. It only took me an hour to put together by myself. It is very comfy and we love the easy fold down feature. My only concern is that the folding hardware holds up over the long haul, time will only tell...", 
    "The couch is very nice and comfortable and the color is similar to that of the picture. The pillows add an extra touch thought their covers are made of not so great material. The back side of the couch is well covered and it is hard to tell that it can be converted. Overall like this product.", 
    "I bought this convertable futon/sleeper a couple of months ago as a couch for our enclosed porch, just in case guests needed a place to stay. After a freak storm blew a large tree branch through our roof and into the bedroom, with water damage to our matress, we needed to sleep elsewhere for a few days. Futon to the rescue! My husband and I have found it to be not only an attractive couch for our sunroom, but it's quite comfortable to sleep on. It's a bit tight for two average-sized people, but not bad. The dogs have had to resign themselves to sleeping on the floor for a while -- definitely not enough room for them too. I've found the futon easy to convert into a bed and vice versa. A very versatile piece of furniture that I'd recommend to a friend.", 
    "Nice material, easy to assemble (per my husband), sturdy and comfortable. A bargain at this price that is the centerpiece of a grouping in a new room addition. Really like this piece; size is perfect for a smaller space and yet wide and long enough for a real grownup to sleep on without feeling like a 'guest'. Full size is really small for two, unless you're small people, but it's still a good buy.", 
    "Bought this product as a temporary sofa/bed and so far it has served its purpose well. Its fairly comfortable as a sofa or a bed. Fits both my husband and myself, not ideal for long term but we're not piled on top of each other (we are both thin). It is firm which my husband and I both prefer, but we still throw a feather top on at night for a little extra \"bed\" like feel. Already has a couple scratches, nothing terrible and we do have a cat with back claws and a ten month old baby that crawls all over it.", 
    "Putting it together was not difficult - we did it with 2 people and it took just over an hour. One problem with the instructions was that they didn't indicate which was the top and bottom for the seat deck and the back deck. One side has indented metal where the screws go and should be facing up (this makes the rails flush with each other where the mattress sits). Other than that the instructions were very good. I would give it 4 1/2 stars. I like it MUCH better than my old standard futon.", 
    "I bought this futon for my office because I couldn't get a traditional sofa through the small doorways. I love it and so does everyone else! They can't believe it is a futon. It is very comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone.", 
    "All around great value & great product. Took me about 2 hours to put together. Pretty comfortable, a bit lower to the ground compared to a regular couch but not abnormally low. It gaps a little near the arms but a pillow there fixes any issue. It is definitely a small full-size but it works great for what we need. We have 2 large black labs who like to jump on furniture & in the month we've had it it's held up great. I really love it!", 
    "Got just what I expected, no issues. This is a nice futon sofa sleeper at a reasonable price.", 
    "This sofa is in the man cave of our home and my husband loves it.", 
    "I live in Philadelphia where there are many cheap furniture stores. So I bought a futon for my recording studio. It was extremely cheap and hard. I bought another futon from Sears, wich was better, but still cheap cushioning and wood. This convert-a-couch is the most comfortable sofa I've purchased so far. The cushions are actually springs, instead of that cheap padding that wear out over time. It also took no time to put it together and I did it by myself. I highly doubt that there is any futon that can match the comfort of this couch.", 
    "It is OK and serves its purpose in the den, should we have overnightguests. Not as comfortable as I would like but for the price it's OK", 
    "Box was damaged when delivered and so was a piece of the couch. Called customer service right away and they sent us replacement part very quickly. Overstock customer service was great to work with and very responsive. The couch is nice and fits my needs for extra setting and sleeping. I'd recommend it.", 
    "I was very excited about this sleeper sofa after reading most of the reviews but I ended up having the same experience as one of the bad ones. Except our sofa stopped snapping into place after the 2nd time we used it. Now it has to be pushed up against a wall so you can sit on it (which really doesn't work in the space we bought it for) and it sits so straight up its extremely uncomfortable. I should have pursued sending it back after we used it the second time. I would definitely consider purchasing a different couch other than this one", 
    "This sofa was delivered damaged. It also was disappointing to see the material (imitation leather) looked and felt cheaper than the web photo portrayed.", 
    "This is the second futon we've purchased from Overstock. Good quality and quite comfortable. Overstock Customer Support successfully helped me right the situation when I ordered the wrong color mattress. Much appreciated!", 
    "I wish the sofa came with better directions but overall I'm happy with the setup. The couch is firm and converts easily into a bed. This will be perfect for overnight guests.", 
    "Not the most comfortable. I wouldn't recommend", 
    "So comfy and easy to put together , comes with the two pillows", 
    "Since I got this sofa it has come in great handy and is really comfortable to sleep on. Kids love it!", 
    "Got this for my daughter and her family.They only have a one bedroom apartment and this is perfect.we got to use it ,while visiting,very comfortable", 
    "Pleasantly surprised it is a comfortable bed. It is a full size, my sister slept on it and she did mention that she slept on one side or the other decade of the crack in the middle. All things considered we are satisfied. The back is attached by Velcro, it has been fine but I don't think I'd be satisfied if this were my only couch or in a high traffic area of the home.", 
    "I love this leather futon sofa sleeper it is prefect.", 
    "Easily assembled. Good support. Smells delucious.", 
    "I live in an attic apartment and unfortunately could not buy a sofa that would fit up my steps. This is a great alternative. Very quick and easy to put together. Only problem I have is the springs are very firm and the zippers on the pillows that came with it broke.", 
    "Nice and comfy couch. Easy to carry upstairs. My husband has slept on it and said it was suprising how comfortable it was as a bed. Love the pillows that come with it.", 
    "The couch is not worth $** you could find something at ******* for way less. This couch is all wrinkled they said it would go away in 47 hours. Always comes if track.", 
    "Great support and wonderful faux fabric. My grandchildren give it a two thumbs up.", 
    "Does not look as good as the picture, and is more comfortable as a bed than a couch. The \"leather\" is subpar and doesn't feel anything like real leather. Save your money for a better couch or just use this in the kids play room or something.", 
    "Hardly do any sitting on the sofa and is already sloping inwards---sort of not happy.", 
    "Cumbersome to assemble, instructions are poor. Pillows zipper broken, cheap, futon mattress cover flimsy, zipper broke as soon as it was zipped up. The back of bed lays too low, giving an uneven bed..not very happy with it. Because I had already paid to assembly I couldn't return. I died get a credit for zipper.", 
    "We have had this couch for 2 years now. I have slept on it many times. Very comfortable. Best futon/Hidabed i have ever used. The seam at the hinge has started to rip but you cant tell unless its flat.", 
    "This couch was very comfortable for the price it looks good and allows me to take naps in the middle of the day.", 
    "Just what we needed for guests. Super easy setup, took about 10 minutes. Simple to convert from couch to sleeper. Looks good in the office/guest room. We have had it for 6 months and could not be happier. Exceptional value.", 
    "Is beautiful. Size is perfect, is also very comfortable", 
    "Woeks and looks great! Family and i love it", 
    "I was impressed with the shipping arrangements of this product. It came a couple of days ahead of time. My wife and I sold our house to simplify our living arrangements and this sofa fit the description. The only thing I didn't like is the driver wouldn't help me bring it into the basement. The futon looked like the picture and to my surprise is very comfortable. It was easy to put together. I assembled it by myself in under an hour. Over all we love the futon, it is a good value for what it cost. I would recommend it to my friends.", 
    "After one month the back settled down to below the frame which left the top bar exposed. The seat cushions drift out constantly so that the back pillows fall in to the crack and further expose the top bar. Finally, after one month or so the left side of the frame comes undone causing the cushion to drop to the floor. I had to pay to have the township haul this away.", 
    "The couch does not look as pictured. I still have it, didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it. It's stunning but will work perfectly in a bonus/game room.", 
    "worst quality and it is ugly , returning", 
    "I needed a small sofa for the mini den (15'x18') and this sofa/futon fit the bill. If you've a large living room for the main quarters of the house; I would suggest something else. Assembly by one person is arduous but do-able, I really recommend you and a partner coordinate though, on this project. I truly intend to keep it as a sofa & a place to catnap. I would NOT recommend that you keep folding it flat, then upright very much. The attaching mechanisms on both sides of the futon were rather cheesy in my opinion. Overall, for the little I paid, I cannot complain. The two paisley pillows (included) do compliment the futon very well. I've already broken in the futon several times (not for what you might be thinking...*grin*) but for catnaps, and I must report it is most comfortable & lumbar supportive. Assembly time for me, singularly, was 1 hour & 20 minutes. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase from O. Peace", 
    "I didn't pay a fortune for this sofa, so I had realistic expectations. I like the color, the size, the fabric is fine. Initially, looked like someone let the air out of it.....somewhat wrinkly. But it is growing on me. I wasn't thrilled that it was left in an unlocked foyer....and no one texted or cslled or even RANG MY BELL to say it was there. I psid someone $$ to help me hsul it upstsirs. Really weighs! If I get two years out of this, I'm happy. AAUnion City, NJ", 
    "It looks cheap after it is put together and it keeps coming apart", 
    "This couch does come in quite a few pieces and the instructions are not that clear. The pieces don't match the instructions and nothing is numbered. The instructions are all pictures and there are no words explaining the pictures. Also, once you do put it together when you fold out the couch to make it in to a bed, you must do it slowly or the pieces will come apart and you will have to put the couch back together again! i definitely would not recommend this product to anyone.", 
    "Wanted a futon that didn't look like a futon and more like a couch. Looks great in the guest room and the in-laws said it was comfy too!", 
    "Sturdy & comfortable. The faux leather does not look like leather. Good value to the price.", 
    "Was sent with an important piece missing :( While Overstoctk was unsuccessful in their efforts to find us that piece their customer service staff worked hard in resolving the issue. We couldn't be happier now with the couch/futon. It is rich looking and more comfortable than you would ever expect.", 
    "great couch. makes a great fold down futon. i bought for my newphew in his new apartment out of college. he loves it!", 
    "A bitch to assemble but overall a great buy", 
    "It was a little tedious to put together but once complete it looks awesome.", 
    "Pretty easy to assemble. Looks terrific. Comfortable to sit on or sleep in. Doesn't stain.", 
    "Looks great! Easy to change into bed. Mattress is thick.", 
    "Nice sofa, but had some damaged product not caused by shipping appeared to be delivered like that.", 
    "This doesn't look like a futon, which is a big plus. It was easy to put together, is comfy (so far), and looks pretty good! I shopped for months for a couch, and I'm glad I finally decided on this one. It's perfect for company, and it's not too big or too small. It's just right!!", 
    "Arrived when expected, easy to assemble and unbelievably comfortable. Well worth the price!!!", 
    "Looks good and serves the purpose... quite good for the price.", 
    "I'll start by saying that I'm 25, have only had a couple places of my own so far -- I like to think I have good taste, but affordability has to be my main priority. That said, this is a GREAT main living room couch for my two roommates and me. It is the right firmness -- not too cushy, not too firm (there are springs in the cushions, but you can't feel them). The cushions seem like they might eventually get kind of saggy, but again, I paid $430 for this. Lovely color, it's definitely not real leather but not in a bad way. I am sensitive to smell and I didn't notice any odor once we'd had the couch up and running for a day. I grew up with futon-futons but wanted something more couch-like. However, I also wanted something that would accommodate guests. This really does feel like a couch. But it's also a very serviceable guest bed -- when laid out flat, the bed is surprisingly comfortable and large enough for two mid-sized adults to sleep with decent wiggle room. It's long enough for both me at 5'4\" and my boyfriend at 6'0\" to stretch out comfortably in couch position/when watching TV. Also, the paisley pillows that were included were a nice touch. Basically, so far I like everything about this couch -- glad I went with this option! OH, and it was very quick to put together with 3 people. With 2 people, it would be a little klutzier because of the way the parts fit together, but still totally doable.", 
    "Perfect addition to my son's first apartment. I have slept on it twice while visiting and it is surprisingly comfortable. Looks good and comfortable to sit on. Took 2 of us to put together and directions were a little confusing but didn't take too long as long as you go step by step. Bed is easy to set up and close down.", 
    "Unfortunately, after one year, this would not go back into Futon mode and the couch mode wasn't clicking right. Had to get someone to haul away. For the money, I guess it served it's purpose.", 
    "The mattresses for the sofa are very comfortable spring mattresses. It wasn't too difficult to put together (probably an hour total), but it took some stretching, adjusting, and a little arm strength to get the faux leather mattress cover over the mattresses and secured in place.", 
    "I should have known better. I would return it, however shipping it back is going to cost 1/4 of what I paid for it. Just save the $ and buy a nice one. Trust me.", 
    "I bought this couch for my brother who lives in NY. He has many visitors throughout the year. This couch is perfect for that reason. He tells me it is sturdy, looks good, and it is easy to convert into a bed. Great price as well. Thank you overstock !", 
    "We are getting ready to throw this sofa away. it is sagging all over after short time in my son bedroom.", 
    "This futon does not look like the image online and has a very strong polyurethane smell. The smell is overwhelming and i had to return it right away. The renu leather is not something i would ever purchase again!", 
    "Assembly was very easy. It is decent and serviceable.", 
    "purchased this for my daughter-several years post purchase and no issues reported with daily use", 
    "Looks nice. Comfortable as a couch. Big enough for two people t sleep on.", 
    "Comfortable and Gorgeous!", 
    "I have not sleep I my futon just yet but my son say is comfortable. He love to sleep there, better that his own bed.", 
    "it smelled nasty, looked cheap, and had a broken leg. Didn't go well with the other stuff we bought.", 
    "I bought this for an apartment in the city I use during the week, along with a 3 inch foam topper, but I can still feel the dip where the seat meats the back of the sofa when used as a bed. It's more comfortable to lean the back to its second position and sleep on it in sofa position that it is to use it as a bed. It looks nice and was easy to put together, but when I offered it to my 26 year old son, who needed a sofa for his apartment, he took my old *** sofa over this nicer looking leather futon sofa. It might be OK for occasional use, but I'll likely donate it soon.", 
    "This looks great as a simple spare room couch but I wouldn't want it as my every day couch for comfort. We have guests sleep on it once converted but we do need to add a blanket to fill in the gap in the middle and we add foam covers to add comfort for the sleeper. We're still very happy with our purchase.", 
    "Super comfortable. Easy to keep clean.", 
    "All three of my children have visited and slept on this sleeper sofa. It is very easy to use and compact for the small room. No complaints so far.", 
    "Meets the need for a decently comfortable couch and extra sleeping when needed.", 
    "The reason I bought this couch is because I wanted my brothers sofa sectional so I had him look for a couch he wanted and this is the one he wanted. He loves his new couch. I was very happy with this transaction because it arrived when it said it would. I can not believe how fast we received it. It only took 4 days. That was awesome. Lori s", 
    "A good value for the price. Easy to assemble. Comfortable. A tight fit to sleep two.", 
    "easy to set up, nice. looks great in my room", 
    "Extremely easy to assemble! So far, it's quite comfortable, after 3 weeks of ownership.", 
    "Both couch and bed are great for a guest room.", 
    "Very fast delivery. Upon arrival the product was in a very heavy large ball product was not damage and very good quality it took me about a half an hour to put together very satisfied with this product my only complaint is the leather is a little slippery", 
    "Just received the sofa. Looks and feels great. Very comfortable and sturdy.", 
    "This couch is nice looking initially albeit hard to assemble. The foam is wearing out quickly despite the fact that the couch is less than 6 months old.", 
    "We are quite pleased with the sofa sleeper- it was easy to assemble, arrived quickly and a much higher quality than we expected.Perfect for our guest room- my husband was so impressed by the \"NO TOOLS' assembly & my granddaughter said it was much more comfortable than the old bed we used to have in the room.Overall we are all happy with the purchase.", 
    "Not worth it. Having seen the futon, I wouldn't pay over $50 for it. Cheap fabric, poor assembly instructions, very uncomfortable, and many scratches on the fabric before taking it out of the box.", 
    "This couch is a great buy! I loved the style when I saw it online, and it met my expectations when I got it. It's large and incredibly comfortable, and I've already fallen asleep on it several times, without pulling out the full bed. It took me about an hour and a half to assemble it, but it looks great and is definitely worth the price. Also, to my surprise, it came with the pillows that are seen in the picture.", 
    "our package was missing the center support bar, but we are hopeful we can call the manufacturer and have one shipped. We love the futon, very nice quality and comfort, easy to set up and easy to use", 
    "This couch is quite comfy, however the leather sags and looks so terrible in my livingroom. I am trying to return it. i will see how costumer service helps.", 
    "This Sofa arrived on time and the material and color is exactly as shown. No disappointed at all. Great Value for money The only disappointing thing was it didnt come with Instructions but that seems to be a pattern with Overstock. But except for that, product itself is pretty good and came in well packed. Took me couple hours to assemble Would recommend it for the Value Ramit", 
    "We assembled the couch and I wish that I had not thrown out the shipping box, as I am now unable to return it. It is the most uncomfortable couch that we have ever owned, and we will be throwing it out, which is unfortunately a huge waste of money. The couch is flimsy, the cushions are uncomfortable, and the faux leather seat cushion covers keep slippnig and will not assemble properly. It is pretty impossible to sit on this couch comfortably. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed with this purchase.", 
    "Put it together by myself. Looks amazingly good in our den. Very comfortable as a couch. We haven't used it for guests but I do know that it is very easy to open. I am in my 70's so you don't have to be a body builder to deal with this product. What a terrific deal!", 
    "It was functional for a year but now it collapsed in the mid section and looks terrible. It has a great style and the material held up..but only buy for short term use.:(", 
    "This sofa is fantastic. It was exactly what I wanted.", 
    "Looks very much like leather, comfortable to sit on, as pictured", 
    "We were looking for a couch that would go into our den/office and would look great there and that could turn into a comfortable bed when we needed extra sleeping place for guests. We had enough with futons and were looking for something better. This couch was a great find! It is looking great and is perfect for our office! It is also very comfortable to sleep on! It arrived very quickly! We had to assemble it but the instructions were very clear and my husband and I had a job done in about 30 minutes. We just love our couch and we love it as a bed too!", 
    "This couch had good reviews so we took a chance and bought it. In less than a month, one side had a horrible sag. This couch has little padding and is very uncomfortable. You can feel the metal/wood under you. This product was bad from the first day. I contacted Overstock and they helped me return the couch for an exchange for a better product. I was very disappointed in the quality. But very happy with the Customer Service.", 
    "Very pleased with my purchase. Comfortable both as a couch and as a bed. A bit tricky to close it back to a couch but not so bad!", 
    "I am very happy with my purchase. It looks better than I expected and the assembly wasn\u0092t terrible either. I don\u0092t think I got the right instructions for the sofa I purchased, but I was able to figure it out my self. It really is a two-person assembly job. It works perfectly so far and it\u0092s comfortable as well. Although I have not tried sleeping on it all night; therefore, I don\u0092t know how I might feel after sleeping on it overnight. Over all a very good purchase from Over stock.com and I have recommended this site to all my friends and family. Moreover, the bill me later options is a plus. I have been very happy with all my purchases from this site; I will definitely buy more from her in the future.", 
    "Once assembled, we were very satisfied. Maybe I am lame at reading diagrams/instructions, but I could not finish the assembly and had to csll a handyman.", 
    "great couch easy to put together.great quality! easy to convert to bed.", 
    "This couch is so comfortable and sleeps well. After purchasing this couch and seeing the exception quality and comfort and I could not wait to purchase another household item. I would have paid more at the store and delivery charge. Thank Overstock for sell great products.", 
    "This sofa is beautiful but for the price listed it is not of good quality. After turning the sofa into a bed a second time, the sofa does not turn into a bed anymore. One side doesn't click all the way down. I'm so disappointed. Even though the shipping was fast it was horrible. The shipper left the huge box on the first floor of a six story walk up instead of delivering it right to my door. I'm just so disappointed all around :0(", 
    "We bought this to replace a sleeper in our boat. The old sleeper was a single, but the new futon is a double for about the same space. Like the leather-type material. Very soft and comfortable.", 
    "I don't think this is a bad product for the price. However it all depends on your needs. I have three small kids in the house, I would never buy an expensive sofa with them being so little still. Now, after nine months with this sofa I have to tell you that the color has faded and, the back of the sofa is not as straight anymore. At the beginning I was able to get the back very straight or a little recline, but now it only stays reclining. But one I have to say also, that I haven't contact customer service about it. I'm pretty sure that they would help me with the matter since I bought insurance for it. Overall, buying it will depend on your needs.", 
    "I received the package and had to put the couch together, not hard. But not work the money. I wasnt please with the quality. I think for the money it could have came together and been a little more sturdy", 
    "Amazing value for the cost. Assembly was fairly easy, I did it all myself. I had one defective piece, but went to Home Depot and for six cents got everything I needed. I am so excited to have this, it's a huge step up from the futon my husband and I had in our early years. It will be a comfortable guest sleeper, and when not used for that makes an attractive spare couch. Very happy with our purchase!", 
    "I bought this sofa thinking it was leather since it said so at least a couple of times in the description and title. After arriving it was quite clear that this material is some kind of shiny substitute, and it would be very expensive and cumbersome to return. I was not pleased. But given the non-leather covering, it is still a pretty good sofa and probably one of the most comfortable futons I've ever tested. Usually futons are terrible for actual sleeping, but this one has a mattress-like set of coils inside, like a real bed - nice! It won't be mistaken for a room&board variety, but consider the price. I'm not sure how this would hold up long term, but for occasional use it works for me. And it comes apart if you need to transport it later or sell it to someone who will. The one big disappointment is that even after I let Overstock know the material was not leather, and they refunded me a *small* portion of the price based on this discrepancy, the description right now STILL says that it is made of leather. IT IS NOT! Please change this at once, Overstock!", 
    "This was bought for our daughter and son - in - law when they came to visit us. I was told at Christmas that it was \"comfy, cozy.\" I have not slept on it so I can only say that I found the couch comfortable to sit on. It is, for the price, I believe, to be a good deal. I would recommend this to a friend.", 
    "I HAVE PERSONALLY SLEPT ON THE MATTRESS; AND I CAN ASSURE YOU IT IS AS COMFORTABLE AS MY MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS, WHICH WAS HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE, BUT TRUE! I AM VERY GLAD I ORDERED IT AS AN EXTRA PLACE FOR COMPANY. THE BED SIZE IS FULL AND 2-PEOPLE CAN SLEEP IN IT UNLESS ONE OF THEM IS 6'5\" - NOT SO MUCH, WHICH IS WHY I GAVE UP MY BED, BUT WASN'T SORRY. I SLEPT ON IT FOR 4-DAYS AND WAS INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE!", 
    "Well, let's begin by saying I'm not a small woman and at first was cautious about sitting on this couch. Once I did though, I realized it was fine and it's comfortable. Actually fell asleep on it and slept through the night once already. Not a something I'm in the habit of doing, but it certainly was comfortable. It really wasn't difficult to assemble. Will be great to have a comfortable guest bed for those who visit.", 
    "Cant beat $2 shipping. This product was plush and came with two decorative pillows and was great for the first few months- after that the same thing happens as to all futons- they start bending in weird spots and are unstable. For the price I suggest you go out and get a sturdy couch from a furniture warehouse!", 
    "I've had this couch for 6 months, it's very comfortable to sit on, I just slept on it last weekend for the first time and it has to be the most comfortable futon I have ever slept on. The \"leather\" doesn't seem very thick so I'm not sure how it will hold up over time but so far so good. It took some time to put it together but it wasn't too hard to do.", 
    "We needed a coach for our studio that would also be a bed. We did not want to sleeper sofa but futons seem like a college dorm and aren't that comfortable. This futon sofa is perfect, and we love it. It is very comfortable both to sit on and sleep on. The only issue we have is that the renu leather is shinier than we expected and the back flap doesn't quite cover everything--but you have to be looking to see this. We are very, very, happy.", 
    "We purchased this couch for our cabin. It is an extra place for people to sleep and a place to watch TV. We got exactly what we paid for and we are very happy. It look great and seems quite sturdy. My only complaint is the armrests are very hard and uncomfortable to lean on.", 
    "Free delivery and the item arived sooner than expected in good condition. It only took my husband about an hour or so to put it together while he watched TV. Very simple instructions and all pieces fit together easily. The upholstery was a bit of a disappointment but it is made so cleverly that making a new cover for it would be quite simple, so if the pleather doesn't hold up well I can always re-cover it. Nice little couch/futon for our small condo. We are in a transition phase but needed an inexpensive sofa with a place to host overnight guests. This sofa is quite comfortable for sitting and also for sleeping. The seat and back are actually small spring mattresses and the cover has padding to make this softer. To sleep on, only one adult person can fit diagonally, but this is an ideal sleeper for children or pre-teens. I am a small woman, 5 feet tall and trim, and when my husband snores I now have a place to go sleep LOL! When we finish re-habbing we plan to move this into our home office. If it lasts for 3 years we will feel that we got our money's worth.", 
    "I've been eyeing this futon for months and have had it saved it my cart just as long. We were looking for a sofa bed to put in our office/tv cave so I wanted it to be comfortable both lounging around and to sleep on as well as looking polished enough for a classy office. When I finally took the plunge and bought it, I couldnt be more excited to get it in the mail. It arrived safe and hole and was very easy to put together. I did it myself in under an hour. It looks so much more expensive than a futon bed which is what it essentially is. Our office looks like a million bucks but clearly we spent very little in getting it done. So glad I made this purchase!", 
    "There were a couple of construction details which caused a problem with assembly but customer service was very helpfull and these were fixed with only the minor delay of shipping the replacement parts. Assembly instructions and video needs an update and just a little work for clarity. The sofa converts to a bed very easily and is extreemly comfortable. Price point is fair to just a little high but value will based on haow well the product lasts. Over all very pleased with purchase.", 
    "The box came a bit battered but everything was in tact. Husband took his time 2 days to put it together. He first assembled the arms after work and on his day off put the rest of the couch together with just a little help from me holding the frame and arms up while he attached all the parts. I was amazed he was able to tighten every thing with the little ratchet, I think you call it, that came with the sofa. The faux leather can get hot in the warm weather. The springs are holding up beautifully. My last sofa the springs gave way in a month. Very comfortable to stretch out on. It is great for apartment living, we would not be able to get such a long sofa otherwise. My husband thinks this is one of my better buys. Wants to get his father one.", 
    "Most impressed by comfort in sitting. Label says 40% leather and it does feel great to the touch. Easily converts to bed.", 
    "This is a good bargain for this futon/couch. I love it, very comfortable and yet stylish/modern. Everybody compliments my taste very often when they see it. Coupe things that prevent me from giving this 5 star: Shipping - I live on second floor, but the package (145lbs) got dropped outside by the stairs of the first floor's hall way, it took me forever to haul it upstairs. By the way somebody could have taken it if I didn't get home on my lunch break to take care of it. Second thing is the smell: the assemble was okay with 2 or 3 people, but the smell of the like leather seats was so bad. It's hard to get rid of it although I've tried so many ways. Anyway, after a month or so of airing it out, it's getting better now. I'm very pleased with the purchase over all. Overstock is great!!!", 
    "This is an excellent alternative to the traditional sleeper sofa. Not only does it look like a regular leather sofa, but the cushions are innerspring, not just just a padded insert...makes for a very comfortable seat and bed!", 
    "I would buy this product again Excellent.my grandson love it", 
    "Large, more comfortable than one would think, and the covering seems durable", 
    "A solid and sturdy frame. The leather does feel a little cheap but it looks good and feels durable. The cushions that come with the sofa are ok but could feel more plush. I am thinking of buying additional cushions to stuff into the seat to make it feel like the way it looks. Th pillows provided were a real nice touch and provided a nice accent. The instructions were ok but could have been more descriptive especially when it comes to putting the hinges on. All in all it should take you about 2.5 to assemble the sofa. As a sleeper the sofa is great. It's easy to pullout and very comfortable, I often sleep on it instead of my bed. For the price this is a great buy!", 
    "This is definitely a must have! From the very first moment I laid on the convert a couch I was in disbelief at how comfortable it was. Sometimes I don't make it back to my bedroom at night because the couch is so comfortable haha.", 
    "Some assembly required, but good quality. Looks great. Very comfortable, and I'm very happy with my purchase.", 
    "The sofa shipped very fast. It come in a box about half size of the sofa after assembled. The size of box make its easy to move around my house. The package come with 2 tools needed to assemble, its took me 2 hrs to put together. Overall, a good sofa for the money.", 
    "I ordered this futon for my daughter's bedroom for lounging and extra sleeping space for sleepovers. When it arrived in one seemingly too small box, I worried that it was going to be much smaller than I had hoped. But, after my daughter and I carried the pieces down to her room and assembled the futon (with ease), this futon is a nice size, and the quality is much nicer than others I've looked at. I think it's going to work just fine for her needs. I would definitely recommend.", 
    "This futon sofa sleeper looks like a real couch. It's very high quality and so now I'm updating everything in my living room to match it! It does not look like cheap vinyl or fake leather. I love the back because it looks like a real couch and you can walk around it. It offers great support and doesn't \"give\" an inch. When it's used as a bed, it doesn't dip in the middle. The coil mattresses are awesome!! I bought the couch so my mom would have something nice to sleep on while visiting me over the holidays. I feel like I got great \"bang\" for my buck.", 
    "I am pleased with the couch, but it isn't something that I would put in a room where I entertain. It took a few hours to put together, but was not hard to do. It is visibly a sofa sleeper, albeit a nice one. It is comfortable to sit on and to sleep on. Converting from sitting to sleeping and vice-versa takes about 5 seconds... very easy :-)", 
    "I live in a small studio , condo. It is a great looking sofa, and no one knows it opens to a futon until I tell them. I have lots more space now. I might even have room for a recliner.", 
    "I purchased the sofa for my office due to the fact that there are certain times of the year when I'm working late and those afternoon naps the next day come in handy. I am very pleased with the look and feel of the sofa. It looks great in my executive office and If you didn't know it was a futon you'd have no idea from the way that it appears. I purchased this sofa based on the comments of others and now want to share my own. I'm glad I made this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "I am really happy with this futon. None of my visitors realize that it is a futon, and the fabric is very nice - not cheap looking at all. It is very comforable to sit on as a sofa, which was a wonderful surprise since most futons are not. When opened and used as a bed, it makes for a restful night of sleep. The mattress is thick and the coils give it good support so that it does not feel at all like a futon. I also purchased a feather bed-type of mattress pad and a thick mattress cover, both from this site, which made it even MORE comfortable, and now it is better to sleep on than most beds! It also comes with two very nice pillows, which I had not recalled seeing in the product description.", 
    "I was looking for a leather couch that was comfy and practical and not too pricey. when I saw this one and it was also considered a \"futon\" I was skeptical. After reading the review, I took a chance and so cglad I did. not only is the couch comfortable, when it is in the bed position, it is really comfortable! Upright, you would not even guess it ratched down into a bed. Wonderful looking and now I have room for more folks to spend the night.", 
    "I purchased this futon after looking at many others both in stores and online. I am very happy with it. It is so well made and comfortable that no one is even aware it is a futon. A very good price for the quality.", 
    "I recently moved and was unable to fit my Neman-Marcus Queen size sleeper sofa thru the door so I purchased this fulton sleep sofa for replacement. Easily assembled and in use same day received, the very next day I purchased another to complete my living room furnishings. I am completely satisfied with both purchases and now have two sleepers for my grand childrens visits.", 
    "Awesome quality. Easy to assemble. I did it myself. Took about an hour. Great buy.", 
    "So pleased with this purchase! I was able to assemble this by myself when I was 9 months pregnant. It converts from bed to sofa and back again with EASE!! Perfect size for our office/guest room. Really looks nice and is comfortable as well. I do put a mattress topper on it when guests sleep on it for extra cushion but it's really fine without it too.", 
    "I would not use this as a primary sofa in my main living room, but for my husbands office in the basement -- it is abolutely perfect. The fact that it easily opens to a comfortable sleeper is one of the main reasons we chose this sofa. It isn't leather and I don't think it looks or feels like leather, but it's a very nice soft leatherlike fabric that is just fine with me - but don't expect to fool your friends. Overall I would recommend it for the right use and I would buy it again. One thing worth mentioning is that even though it is returnable -- the way they package it for shipping could not possibly be duplicated by a consumer --- it's obviously professionally shrimk wrapped in an industrial setting -- so you will NOT be able to package it for return shipment once you open it. Was a good purchase for us!", 
    "Designed with assembly and shipping in mind. Arrived in one (large) box that was small enough to come by UPS so it arrived in about a week rather than the slower version of freight overstockuses. Simple to assemble, took maybe an hour while I watched tv. Probably 2/3 of that if I had been concentrating. Beautiful and comfortalbe to sit on. Easy to clean, I have two slobbery dogs. Wipes off easily. If you didn't read in the description, it does not have foam or other-type cushions. It has springs with a pillow topping of some sort on top. I've had two guests sleep on it already and they slept like babies.", 
    "As others have posted, this is a good deal for the price. It's a large sofa and it looks and feels very luxurious once it is assembled. It took me a couple of hours to assemble, but it would have gone faster if the instruction booklet was not generically made for several different models. Here are things I learned through trial and error that could save you some time, although overall the assembly is pretty simple. 1. Forget the tool box-all needed tools are provided in the box, but you'll want scissors to cut the cushion straps , parts bag, etc. 1. The parts list mentions 24 short bolts-this is not true. The bolts they are referring to are not in the parts bag (and there is just one red parts bag). the bolts are already completely fastened to the couch parts themselves. You'll get to them as you assemble the furniture pieces. 2. The covering for the seat cushions has two zippers. You need to put the seat cushions inside the zippered covering before putting on the couch. It doesn't matter which cushion goes as the seat or the back-they are identical cushions. 3. Once the cushions are zippered into the covering, you need to make sure the covering itself is stretched to completely cover the back frame of the couch and completely stretches over the bottom edge of the couch, with the velcro straps stretched down and just over the bottom of the cushion on the back side of the couch's black fabric bottom. The easiest way to pull the back cushion covering over the frame is to have the couch in couch position and just keep stretching the material until you get it over. It won't tear, don't worry. As for getting the covering on over the bottom of the sofa frame, this is trickier and works best if you pull the bottom up like you're turning it into the sleep function and keep the bottom up in front of you (the edge up towards your head) and pull the cover down and over from there, fastening the velcro straps by just pulling down and attaching on the other side of the bottom edge of the cushion cover. In the instructions, there's mention of a \"hook\" on the back of the couch cover, which does not exist and if I missed it, it wasn't obvious enough to make any of this go more smoothly. The good news is, the couch was so comfy when I got it together that within 15 minutes of laying on it I was asleep! Enjoy.", 
    "Excellent little sofa that turns easily into a futon. Bought it for a small office - needed a place to sit and an extra space for guests... good buy.. definitely recommend.", 
    "I got this early in August. Had to leave it in the box, but when I was finally able to take it out... I was so happy. Its so beautiful, and really frees up space in my spare room. Everyone wants to sleep on it...", 
    "my family absolutely loves this couch. it is super sized for all of us. we really love this couch.", 
    "I ordered this futon for an apartment I'm living in temporarily. I was very satisfied with the color and quality. In fact it was better than I expected. It took a couple of hours to assemble just because I was taking my time but it went together very easily, I had no issues. To look at it, you would not guess it's a futon. I use it as a couch and for extra sleeping room and it is a very comfortable piece of furniture. I am completely satified with the function and quality of this futon.", 
    "It looks simple and well made. If you need a futon/extra sleeper, this is a very nice sofa for the price.", 
    "We bought this to replace an uncomfortable futon in our guest room. This one really does look like a couch and is actually comfortable (unlike our old futon). I would say it took my husband about 2 hours to put it together. The piece of fabric that goes over the back of the futon is kind of just a big flap of leather hanging, so you may not want to buy this if it's going to go in the center of a room where the back of the futon will be showing. This is easy to convert to a bed. I will say that the actual futon in person is more rounded on the edges of the cushions than squared off, like the picture shows. And I worried that the divisions between the cushions would be uncomfortable to sleep on, but they're not because it's just one continuous piece of fabric with seaming to simulate cushions. There are two mattresses that go in the top half and the bottom half of the futon, respectively. Each mattress has coils, which was impressive. This makes it comfortable to sit on. The cover seems to be durable. All in all, a good value for the money.", 
    "This is a comfortable piece but unfortunately there is a defect in the left-hand side. The top is hollow so when you put your arm on it, it stretches inside. It will wear out soon if it is not replaced. I am going to contact Overstock.com about this defect. Hope for the best...", 
    "Needed a fancy futon for a pied a terre...and this one is perfect! Bed is super comfy, couch is loungable and attractive, and renu \"leather\" was better than expected. We had no installation problems and are satisfied customers.", 
    "I wanted a leather couch, that is comfortable, cute and could turn into a bed. I found one at O.com wow very pleased. It only took me 2 hours to put it together. It is just like the add, very strong, very easy to change into a bed, and put it back. I wasn't so sure about a futon, but this does not look like one, doesn't feel like one! its great! and it was delivered to my front door. thanks Valerye", 
    "If you have a small space and want to provide your guests with a comfortable sleep, this sofa is perfect. I was looking for leather upholstery because I have a dog that sheds a lot and I feel that leather would require less maintenance. I also wanted something that can become a sleeper without pulling out into a bed because I have a small space and the pull out beds are less comfortable. This is the only sofa I could find that fits these requirements without costing too much. The fold out hinge mechanism is very user friendly and does not take more much more space when opened. The Renu leather cover looks good enough but when you put it on your couch, it looks a lot looser than it does in the photo. I wouldn't really say it has a distressed leather look but it looks like a decent quality leather and is good enough for the price. One piece of advice I would give is to not fret if it appears that you are missing some screws and pieces in the package. Some of the screws you need are already screwed into couch. You will need to unscrew before using it.", 
    "They forgot the instructions but called and they were very helpful..I did not want to wait so they suggested the online tutorial..perfect! Love the look and quality! Not bulky. Comfortable, can not beat the price!", 
    "The only problem was the one of the screws was jammed in the anchor and I had to replace both screw and anchor at the hardware store. Otherwise, it was easy to assemble by myself and it is very comfortable.", 
    "It took me awhile to put the sofa together but once I did I sunk right in. For the price this is a great product. It doesnt even look or feel like a futon...it feels like a sofa. I am very pleased and hope it holds up well.", 
    "I love this couch for the price. It is great for having visitors too because it easily converts into a bed. I've gotten many compliments on it. I would definitely recommend it if you have limited space in your living room like I do also.", 
    "The sofa looks good, though It needs a cover, because I am afraid the renu leather is going to get worn out fast.", 
    "I bought two of these sofa/futons and I am fairly content with them. I wish a light color was an option. These are medium brown color. This is comfortable and long enough for a tall person to lay down on, which is good. I had planned to add a microsuede cover on the futons to get the look I wanted. BUT that is NOT possible with this couch. So, now I will attempt to create a slipcover instead. There is a flimsy fabric part on the bottom that I believe its primary purpose is something for the velcro to attach to --- it doesn't show which is good, because one of mine was torn and had cardboard pieces stuck to it for the glue holding the box together. The glue also go on the interior pillows and tore those; again this does not show as the pillow goes into the zipped pillow covers. The back side does not sit up flush so that it looks like a normal couch. It comes close, but the fabric gaps and on one couch was not big enough to completely cover leaving about .25 to .50 inch on both sides. This arrived quickly and well packaged. It went together easily with real tools -- you'll want more than what comes in the box - a metric socket wrench and long handle hex screwdriver.", 
    "It's an inexpensive made in China sofa. The parts all work just fine. The seat and back are made of a spring mattress type filler, which is great for the sleep option. The cover is more like a soft, but thin vinyl; I'm affraid it may wear and/or tear easily. I wouldn't recommend this for heavy everyday use. Oh and the pillows have a paisley pattern.", 
    "I am very impressed with this leather futon sofa. I personally assembled it with minimal assistance from my spouse. The cushion has internal coils which provide a true sofa feel rather than a cheap futon feel. The covering is very attractive and has withstood one spill of water already. The back of the sofa velcros underneath to create a smooth look which allows it to look nice when placed in the middle of a room. This product is perfect for my small den. The delivery was directly to my door in a large box. I just carried the unassembled pieces up two flights of stairs and then assembled in the den. Great value for the money.", 
    "This sofa sleeper looks very nice and is comfortable. The seat cushions offer firm support when used as a bed and it is extremely easy to convert from sofa to sleeper. I am completely satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "The sofa came quickly, was easy to put together and looks nice. It is comfortable to sit on. We haven't slept on it yet, but I think it would be hard to fit two people comfortably since it is a little lower in the middle than at the edges, and it is a little smaller than a standard size double mattress. It is very easy to recline and doesn't have to be moved away from the wall to do so. A great purchase.", 
    "I have been very reluctant about ordering furniture like this on line. By reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. It took a little longer to assemble than we anticipated because the hinges being out of shape. We contacted customer service on spot and the replacement was on its way the next day, followed up with a phone call from Overstock. Very impressed with the efficiency of their customer service. Most importantly, the sofa is stylish, comfortable as expected. I am in the corporate housing business and shop furniture all the time, I've never seen anything so nice but priced as Overstock. I will order a few more myself and will definitely recommend to others.", 
    "I've wanted a great -- and, great looking -- leather sofa for some time. The catch was that I needed it to have \"sleeper\" functionality. I was concerned that I'd never find a piece that had both structural durability and wonderful style and comfort. The Trace Leather Futon gave me EVERYTHING I wanted! The assembly was very easy. The look and feel of the leather is excellent. The frame and mechanisms are very solid and well-made. Already, guests have commented on how beautiful the piece is. I love this sofa, and I'm so glad I made this purchase! My living room is now complete. Thank you!!", 
    "I ordered this sofa sleeper on 12/02/10 and it arrived in exactly one week so I'm very pleased about the shipping even though it's the Christmas season. I was hesitant to buy this sofa since no one else had reviewed it yet, but I'm happy to say that it was everything I expected..extremely comfortable, very easy on the eyes, and can easily fit three people. When rolled out as a bed, it can definitely fit one person comfortably, but might be tight for two larger people. Assembly was difficult though.. it took me almost two hours, mostly because one of the metal components that should've been fitted at a 90 degree angle was bent when it arrived and I had to hammer in the metal part so that it made a right angle with the attaching sofa component. Once that was fixed though, I cannot complain any longer.. in terms of how this'll last in the long term, I'll write a follow up eventually...", 
    "The pillows are very poor quality and the having difficulty staying in upright position", 
    "It wasn't too hard to put together but it falls apart pretty quickly. I used it as the main couch in my living room and that was a mistake. This isn't made for daily use.", 
    "This is a very comfortable couch. However, it is just okay looking considering the price. I would probably be much happier with it if it was priced in the 300's rather than the XXX+ we paid. You can get definitely get futon for a better price locally. That's another thing: this is not a couch as is stated in the product name, it is more accurately a well disguised futon. It was also a hassle to put together, as ours did not come with instructions. We had to call customer service and wait a day (with all the parts unpacked all over our living room) for the warehouse to forward instructions."
