    "This chair is NOT \"anti-brown.\" It is simple matte brown, very lack luster. It is not the light golden brown depicted in the picture at all. Very disappointed.", 
    "I ordered 2 anti-brown chairs and received 1 dark brown chair so I needed to deliver it to a UPS store to send it back and then wait for my correct chair.", 
    "I am very happy with the look and construction the of this chair.It is a GREAT buy compared to comparable leather butterfly chairs. After having this chair for a few weeks now I can say without reservation,I would buy one again.", 
    "The leather is nice, and it is definitely a great alternative to the $$$ versions of this chair available elsewhere (*** for example). It has the mid-century look that the famous chair is known for... however, the frame is very shiny, and has to be assembled (which was not easy) and isn't as refined looking as I would have liked (you can see where all the parts fit together - it does not give the appearance of a solid one piece frame). The frame is a little uneven. However, none of this is so bad that it takes away from the overall look of the chair. I like it, glad I bought it. Will keep it. Just not head over heels", 
    "This chair tips over very easily, with the slightest lean forward. I do not recommend.", 
    "AMAZING quality leather, but my only complaint is that it sits lower than most of the butterfly chairs that I have sat in before. a great item for the price!", 
    "I am so sad that I have to return both of the chairs I ordered. Too pricy not to be functional. I have stained wooden floors which makes it difficult to get in and out of the chair without it tipping forward and me falling flat on my face! Not to mention the way the seat curves makes it difficult for any male (both my husband and my brother fell out of the chair) to sit comfortably. Not worth the price if you can't even sit in it!", 
    "Leather looks great and is true to the photo. Frame is tough to assemble and even once you're done it doesn't fit together very nicely. I'm going to take leather cord and wrap it around the joints to keep it in place. Otherwise, if you pick it up and shake it a bit, the bottom legs can fall off. Overall, for half the price of comparable looking chairs, this is a good value.", 
    "These chairs were a bit of a challenge to put together and the instructions are actually just hilarious. But once assembled, they are gorgeous. They add such a rich vibe to my living room. I added non skid adhesive dots to the bottoms of the legs, because otherwise they do slide A TON. Be warned however, when you're sitting in these they are a bit scary to get out of if you're not careful!", 
    "These are difficult to put together. However it makes up with style points on the distressed leather. They are comfortable but a bit hard to get out of. My only disappointment are the brown tubular legs. I thought they would be more blackish in color and a bit stronger.", 
    "The chair is tricky to assemble because the instructions are difficult to follow. It's like they were written in a foreign language then translated into English using Google translate and not proof read by an English speaker. Once you figure it out, this is a great chair. The leather is very stiff initially. Give it a week or so to break in and this will become your favorite man cave chair.", 
    "Great styled chair, it was a bit challenging to assemble.", 
    "a pain to put together and not for chubletts like myself. very good for the price.", 
    "Not solid iron as described. Hard to put legs together and is hollow metal, not heavy at all. When you try to get up it tips forward and is dangerous!!!!!! No one would want this. M", 
    "Great color, just as pictured. Heavy duty and sturdy. We love the effect it has on the room.", 
    "Looks Fabulous for any room you want to go cool with. Love the size, it's very cute and comfortable. Thanks", 
    "Color is much darker than shown in picture. Tough to put together. Does not sit evenly on the floor. Wobbles.", 
    "perfect for entrance patio ...under cover and looks great.", 
    "Very unstable poor quality", 
    "TIPS OVER WHEN YOU LEAN FORWARD- MADE WRONG, I RETURNED MINE", 
    "Leather butterfly chairs are very difficult to find and this has met all of my expectations! Pretty simple to put together and looks great! Leather is thick and sturdy, very comfortable and stylish!", 
    "This chair was disappointing and I ended up sending it back. The metal frame was not built well and it was uneven when I finally got the whole thing together. It would wobble and I could not fix it. The leather was fine, though, so that was good."
