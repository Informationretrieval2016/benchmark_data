    "This is a beautiful desk and looks more expensive than the price. The wood top is very nice and sturdy. The metal legs and drawers are cool looking and the color is a pewter gray. This is a solid piece of furniture with a unique style - I needed a desk that would coordinate with some traditional & vintage furnishings - this works because the wood top balances the metal very nicely. I highly recommend this desk and would buy it again. Assembly notes: This desk was packed nicely and delivered in perfect condition - within days of purchase. I put this desk together by myself in less than an hour - one of the screw holes didn't line up perfectly so it took me a few times to put the base together (2 screws only) - the base attached to the desk top (drawers already installed) in minutes (8 screws). The 1 screw not lining up didn't bother me very much because the end result is a great looking desk.", 
    "This desk is not only beautiful and unique, it's extremely well crafted and amazingly easy to put together. The desk come already assembled with just the legs needing attached. It literally to longer to open and unpack than to put it together. Probably my best purchase ever on Overstock.com. I couldn't be happier.", 
    "Everything about this table worked out just perfect, size, color, quality, assembly had easy. I'd order this product again and again.", 
    "I was very impressed with the quality of this desk for the price. It is the perfect scale for a home office and it has a handsome design with a wood top and gun metal finish.", 
    "Purchased this desk for a little office alcove. It is lovely. The industrial look of the metal brings a new element to my particular room. The top is a little \"lunch room table\" looking however that part is growing on me. I would buy this again and recommend it for anyone needing a small desk/writing table to add to their furniture collection.", 
    "Well made. Easy to assemble. Drawers glide well so as not to bang like tin can. Exactly the look I wanted at a good price.", 
    "very nice. the quality is much better than i expected", 
    "Great for the price! It looks clean and neat and it is heavy! Not rickety- very sturdy.", 
    "I have a small office area so this works great. A bit unsturdy but u can adjust the legs. Super easy to assemble.", 
    "Great computer desk. Solid pieces great deal for the price.", 
    "The desk is very heavy, sturdy, and the top is really nice and solid. It took only ten minutes to put the legs on. The desk was for my daughter who is very tall, it fits her nicely, and she sits up straight now. The drawers pull out smoothly and the desk looks great, she likes the industrial look, and it seems to go with just about anything. It takes two people to assemble it because of the weight. But we are very happy with our purchase.", 
    "Nice desk. Good quality.", 
    "I really like the desk as it is what I was looking for. I was disappointed when I received it and all of the feet were bent and I had to wait for new ones. I called and it was handled quickly and professionally. I received the new parts a week later. As we put it together, the face of one of the drawers came off. We reattached it and it is fine. The quality is not as good as I thought but overall, I like the desk and am happy with my purchase.", 
    "Although it came with a few dings, Overstock send us a replacement part and we kept the desk for an office that is infrequently used. It's pretty sturdy otherwise, and we like the wood/metal combination.", 
    "Looked better online. Desktop is cheap veneer-look. The metal legs and drawers are odd,dull-toned, kind of bronze shade, but doesn' t look half as good as the online depiction which looks like shiny metal. Not so glad I got it, I'm trying to change the ugly veneer color to an espresso brown..", 
    "I love this desk PERFECT!!", 
    "This item was very easy to assemble and quite attractive", 
    "Beautiful industrial desk. Fits perfectly with my boho collection. The perfect desk just big enough to get the work done.", 
    "I liked the look of this desk on-line. Unfortunately it does not look as good in person. It is actually a cheap imitation. The wood top is like a piece of plywood and the pipe base is kinda phony looking in person. I shoulda known based on the price.", 
    "I bought this desk for my home office. It's just large enough to hold my dual 17 inch wide screen monitors, my laptop in the docking station as well as my full sized keyboard. There is no room for a printer on the desk so I'll have to buy a separate stand for that. The two drawers are large enough to hold note pads, post it notes, stapler, pens and general office supplies. If you have a lot of paperwork invest in a filing cabinet. The desk is well made, looks much more expensive than it's price point and is simple to put together. The desk is only four pieces. The two sides that are the legs, the bottom support bar that goes between the legs on the floor and the complete desktop with drawers. It all goes together with an allen wrench which was not included. (what gives with that?!) The desk top is MDF with a nice wood look textured finish that I'm guessing is some type of laminate. The desk body is a brushed metal reminiscent of a dull brushed nickle or tin. It has a slightly industrial feel but not overwhelming. The desk itself is incredibly sturdy and my husband prefers my desk over his much more expensive solid wood desk. At this price point it is an amazing deal and wonderful quality. I don't think anyone would be disappointed. I looked many places both online and physical and couldn't find anything nicer of this size for this price. If you need a desk I would highly suggest snatching one of these up before they are gone. This would also make a great student desk or a crafting table. Hope you love your desk as much as I love mine!", 
    "I love this desk. It looks so pretty in my family room / office. The only problem was one of the packets of bolts was missing, but I called the 800 number on the instructions sheet and the bolts were sent out in less than a week. You won't be sorry with this purchase!!", 
    "Nice desk with easy assembly. Looks clean and sleek for a small office area.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised by this table. It was easy to assemble, sturdy (It weights approximately 150 pounds) and lovely to look at. It adds a really nice, eclectic feel to my living room. Great price as well.", 
    "I am very happy with the look and quality of this desk. It was also easy to assemble", 
    "Huge dent in a corner of the metal under the wood desk top. Such a hassle to return since it is big, heavy and box was falling apart at delivery. Like the look and size of the desk, but very disappointed with the damage.", 
    "We downsized our home and this desk was perfect for the space. Easy to put together, was up and ready to use within 15 min.", 
    "This desk arrived exactly as described. It was the perfect size for my home office, which I share with my husband. It was easy to assemble, packaged well, and in perfect condition when delivered. It is a sturdy well made piece of furniture and has the look I wanted to work with the other pieces already in the office. I am very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Legs were bent when we received the piece. Overstock customer service was fantastic and had new legs shipped to us within 3 days! Solid desk!", 
    "The first one I received was damaged, but it was easy to return and I received a replacement within the week. Super easy to put together and it looks great in my husband's office.", 
    "Heavy, which is a good thing. Put it together in half an hour. It looks great! I'm very pleased.", 
    "Excellent quality product", 
    "Beautiful piece of furniture. Very happy with it.", 
    "It's ok. Looks better from a distance (in my opinion) I feel like up close it looks kind of cheap. But maybe that is because I have purchased furniture from Restoration Hardware, so I am use to more solid pieces. This desk has been put in an upstairs bedroom."
