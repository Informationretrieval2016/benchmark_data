    "Needed file and drawer storage space for home office, ordered 2 of these. Looked well packaged when delivered, but pieces inside were not well protected and had a few scratches in areas you see. Assembly instructions are OK, not the best. Took 2 hours for 2 of us to put together. Drawers have a 'anti-tip' mechanism, which makes an awful loud click noise each time you open and close any drawer. The 'file' drawer on the bottom is not well designed. You can only put one row of (front to back) on the left side based on the width of the pre-notched holes for the bars. And they did not take into consideration you would put a hanging file folder, then a folder inside of that, when making the pre-notched holes. All of top-tab files catch against the top of the drawer when opening/closing and bend back and forth, always getting stuck. Once I put it all together and realized this, if it were easier to return it I would, but the thought of disassembling, packaging up and shipping back is too much. It looks nice, but it is not at all functional for a home office if you want to use the bottom drawer for files.", 
    "drawers don't close properly; there was a chunk out of the front top when unwrapped that I'll have to find paint to match; legal-size needs one more bracket (ie, 3 rods don't work - need 4, with an additional slot to insert it); it nicely holds the printer and the modems freeing up space on a very small 1961 desk, and from a distance looks nice, but with fighting to open and close drawers (and I'm very handy - have never had problems assembling furniture of any kind), it's not nearly as functional as I need. Sorry. Other products have been fine - this one's a bit disappointing.", 
    "The anti-tip mechanisms made it so neither drawer would open. After 2 hours of putting it together, and finally getting the packing styrofoam remnants off of my clothes, the carpet, the walls, the furniture...there was no way I was going to disassemble it and figure out how to ship it back. After stewing for a day and wondering whether I should take the product to the dump, I removed the back and managed to remove the anti-tipping mechanisms. The drawers open & close now. Whether tipping will be a problem remains to be seen. And then I took on assembling the matching desk...", 
    "terrible product, rapidly falling apart; not worth it", 
    "estechically nice looking but drawers get stuck all the time", 
    "The drawers on this stick a lot and you can only open one at a time. Then one drawer locks shut, so you have to unlock it every time! A little frustrating. Definitely a \"fair\" rating.", 
    "Plenty of room for files etc. Nicely designed, good color.", 
    "It holds our files, but seems a bit unsteady at times. The hardware in the file drawer wasn't aligned properly, my husband had to make some modifications to make it work.", 
    "the build was a little bit challenging but not difficult. but once I had it all built and in place I started to fill it and would you believe that the middle bracket is for both sides so you can not use both sides to file in the bottom draw and to top that, you cant use the labels on top of the hanging folders because then the draw will not close.", 
    "Purchased one earlier in the year - and needed another - great product, easy to assemble and very easy to use. Looks great!", 
    "There is no doubt that this lateral file, with a second top drawer, is a very solid, well made, handsome piece of furniture. But it was very difficult to assemble, and really requires two people. The lateral file has built in frames for legal files and letter sized files - a nice touch. The drawers open smoothly and easily, and it has a no-tip feature.", 
    "Perfect size, perfect price !", 
    "This is a unique piece and good for storage. The file cabinet has one side for legal size and the other is for regular. There is only 3 notches, so I think the legal and regular will have to share a center hook. (I havent tried it). It's a composite so it has that smell, but after a while it goes away.", 
    "The file cabinet is exactly as pictured. It was easy to assemble and looks great in my office as opposed to an ugly traditional metal file cabinet.", 
    "This is a great purchase, great price! I wanted a more contemporary look for my office and this gives me just that....SO much better than a metal file cabinet!", 
    "This is a very well made cabinet that goes well with the rest of the office set. The combo drawer and file drawer are great. Only issue is be large file drawer only accommodates one row of files.", 
    "This was a gift and can't wait to see it. Thought it might be made of thin metals but she assures me it was made very well", 
    "First of all do not underestimate the amount of time and patience required to assemble this piece. If you have to pay someone to do it consider the added expense. File drawer, bottom drawer only, is awkward. 3 metal rods are supplied to hang files from, allowing, in theory for both legal and letter files. But if using the middle rod for files on both sides you can not move the files because they interfere with each other. That renders the file drawer only half functional. Also, file tabs scrape top drawer when opening or closing."
