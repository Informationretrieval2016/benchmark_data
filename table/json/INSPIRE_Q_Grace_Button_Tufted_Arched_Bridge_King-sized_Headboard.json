  "reviews": [
    "The buttons are a connected strand, not individual. It sits low and is larger than the bedframe and mattresses. Would not purchase again.", 
    "Absolute garbage! It is too big for a king bedframe and is poor quality. Last purchase I'll be making from overstock.", 
    "Nice touch for our master bedroom", 
    "Inexpensive. Pretty and easy to assemble. Delivery said 1-4 weeks and it arrived in 1. Very happy though much darker than i expected for the lighter grey color.", 
    "Purchased for my son, he wanted a nice headboard and seen this one, he loves it, says it fits perfect for the single guy. Not too feminine.", 
    "It's a perfect size, great material and nice color. We're very happy with our selection.", 
    "Looks beautiful. It's not white it's more like Ivory. I've received many complements on the headboard.", 
    "We haven't had a headboard ever - this is the first and it really finishes the bed and makes it feel cozier"
