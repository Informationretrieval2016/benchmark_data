    "This is really rustic. Love it with my red accent towels rolled up in it!", 
    "Purchased as a towel holder.. It looks great..", 
    "I used for towels in master bath and it looks great", 
    "I was going to use this as a towel rack. I found my plush towels wouldn't rollup tight enough to even get them in to the sections where the wine bottles should go. The metal is VERY thin and very rusty. I wouldn't want to combine moisture with the already rusted finish. I think it would ruin your towels. Returned the rack", 
    "I used it for decoration in my room. It allows me to add some color to a blah spot in the corner.", 
    "I used this in my bathroom as a towel rack. It's very nice.", 
    "I bought this wine rack to use as a towel rack in my bathroom lol the metal is a little lighter/thinner than expected but works perfectly for my towels!", 
    "Too small for the price but it's cute", 
    "great wine rack for the money", 
    "I use this as a towel rack in my bathroom. I sprayed it with a clear sealant before installing in case it rusts. Looks great hanging up but seems somewhat cheap. However, I am over very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Bought this wine rack to use as a towel holder. I have a short wall before entering a Bath/Powder room. There wasn't enough room to put a cabinet, but this rack - which holds 4 towels beautifully - did the trick. Don't be afraid to think out of the box.", 
    "I bought this to use as a towel rack. Not quite big enough for average thickness rolled towels - pity! I have not tried as a wine rack -the metal does not seem heavy enough.", 
    "The wine rack is perfect for what I was using it for - a bathroom towel holder! Would also be great for its intended use of a wine rack. Really cute and sturdy.", 
    "The description says black and it's not. It's like a rust color. Cheap and thin. If you're looking for a rustic look then this is for you. However, my decor is modern so it doesn't match at all. I'm not sending it back because I'm just going to spend the money (and time) to paint it black. The description is very deceiving and the picture doesn't tell the whole story.", 
    "I purchased this product to go in our new home and was very excited to get it but when it arrived and I pulled it out of the box it was extremely misshaped. I'm not sure if it was welded crooked or what but the top of the rack is angled instead of straight. I love this product expect for the construction defect. I am returning the original purchase and hopefully the replacement is straight."
