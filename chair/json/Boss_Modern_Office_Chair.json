    "Most comfortable office chair I have EVER had! Had a friend sit in mine and she ordered one for herself and says she absolutely loves it!", 
    "I work from home and so a chair that was comfortable to sit on for extended periods of time was extremely important to me without risking style. Cautiously optimistic, I ordered this and crossed my fingers. It's a beautiful chair and looks great. It has a soft 'leather' material that stands up to my dogs' paws and the chair padding is thick enough for me to be comfortable for 6-8 hrs a day. I got the white which is a pretty soft-white color.", 
    "Bought this chair unsure of what the quality would be like. It looks great and modern in my office. Buying a second!", 
    "This chair is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted the sleeker appearance, but to still be comfortable to be able to sit for several hours at a time, if needed. It is a great buy!", 
    "Very comfy! Lumbar support! Not ALL handle screws fit in on the bottom, but it is not a big deal. Great purchase for this quality!", 
    "Loved adding this chair to my modern theme I had going on", 
    "I bought this chair specifically since it was described as being adjustable.It is not. You cannot adjust the back at all. It is straight up and unmoveable.", 
    "chair is perfect for my home office/dressing room, easy to assemble and very contemporary and feminine looking.", 
    "Love love love this chair. It is perfect, comfortable and well made. Very nice looking- couldn't be happier!!", 
    "Purchased this to complete my new home office. Beautiful & comfortable. Can't go wrong with this price!", 
    "I was looking for a sleek, smaller profile office chair and after much research decided to with this one. I was not disappointed - it took about 5 minutes to assemble and it looks and feels great. It's soft, looks nice and modern and the handles are low enough that it can slide under the desk and be tucked away when not used. Love it!", 
    "One of my favorite all time purchases - soft as butter, sleek, elegant."
