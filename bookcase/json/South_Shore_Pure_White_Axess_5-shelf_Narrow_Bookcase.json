  "reviews": [
    "Bookcase is everything I expected for the price. Compressed, laminated wood from Canada is extremely heavy. Does not take to long to screw the pieces together. The back board needs to be ' tacked' in place. After sixty plus nails I felt like a shoe maker. Convenient size to tuck in a small corner of the kitchen area forbooks, nic-nacs and whatever. Alignment of pieces is acceptable.", 
    "This bookcase looks great and is very easy to set up. It took me maybe 15 minutes to put together, and I haven't had a problem with it at all.", 
    "Not stable, shelf clips are flimsy", 
    "Ordered this to fit a small space and it works. Not fancy but when filled with my \"stuff\" it looks fine.", 
    "The shelf is sturdy and worth the price. The chenille bedspread is veryPretty and good quality.", 
    "Looks great & easy to assemble.", 
    "Great product, as described, went together easily", 
    "Easy to put together and very sturdy!"
