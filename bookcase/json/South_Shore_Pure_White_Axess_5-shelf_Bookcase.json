  "reviews": [
    "The bookshelves arrived with dings and chips that mar it's attractiveness and, sadly, has cardboard for backing. Altogether an inferior product. Unfortunately, once you have removed all the packaging and put it together, it's nearly too much trouble to send it back.", 
    "This is a second item we ordered from Overstock and it was damaged .With this Bookcase... one major piece was damaged so we have to reorder new one. After it arrived and we wanted to put it together we discovered that other pieces didn't match the bookcase. We are very disappointed. ..", 
    "Just what i needed! I wanted a bookcase that could fit my guest bedroom tv in it, plus hold books and decor. This one is perfect! I arrived in perfect condition and was easy (for my nephew) to put together. lol", 
    "I had books on all the shelves, but I noticed the ones that are held in place with the pegs on the side had a slight sag in the middle. Would work well for decorative items, but not anything heavy (only bottom shelf and middle shelf which is secured to sides stayed straight).", 
    "Good sturdy shelf for the price. Not too difficult to assemble.", 
    "this bookcase was very disappointing it chips really bad,just put it together today it is very weak has a cardboard backing lacks support very weak, when nailing the tacks on the back it chipped real bad in 2 places and 2 small places and looks like it had been put together and took back apart I believe this was a returned shelf because all the screw holes were flaked.", 
    "typical bookshelf construction, used for media, works fine", 
    "Easy to put together, works great", 
    "This bookcase is just the right size for the spot where I am using it. And it wasn't too hard to put together.", 
    "She shelf is nice, however, the back is literally a piece of cardboard.", 
    "Love the fact I could adjust the shelves. However, the finishing touches (covers for screws) were so cheap they fell apart when applying them."
