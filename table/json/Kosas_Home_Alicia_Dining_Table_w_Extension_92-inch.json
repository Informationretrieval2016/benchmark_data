    "This table is gorgeous, and very sturdy. I ordered the Natural stain, and I love that you can see the plentiful, natural variations in the wood. If you prefer a more 'perfect' wood where everything is consistent, this is not the table for you - so take a close look at the photo. I think it is beautiful! Everyone who has seen it has loved it. The style is understated with its straight lines, so it allows the natural beauty of the wood to shine through. As other reviews state, this table is very heavy, and very stable. Assembly was pretty straightforward. About the leaves: the grain of the wood goes the other direction than the regular table, so it looks a little odd when you add the leaves. I would definitely use a tablecloth, or a big runner and placemats/chargers/decorations, if using the leaves. If you plan to use the table with leaves all the time, you will probably want to plan to use a tablecloth, or something to distract from the mismatched grains.", 
    "Heavy and sturdy. Assembly was very simple and easy. The wood is beautiful and extensions that attach on either side are made very well, easy to attach. I am very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "I searched a long time for a sturdy table with a primitive look, loathing the idea of owning a traditional formal table or a typical casual table. We buy a lot of furniture on overstock so I knew once I found the right style I could trust the quality. This table was perfect for us and we bought it as soon as we saw it. It is so beautiful and unique and HEAVY - the delivery men complained about how heavy it was. It definitely requires two people to turn it over once the legs are attached. The extensions (also quite heavy) are easy to insert when needed. We could dance on this table every night for decades if we so chose. This is by far my best purchase on overstock.", 
    "I enjoy to marvel at how nice the table is everyday! All my guests admire it also...and even more so after I told them how much I paid for it!", 
    "This is a stunning table! I'm very happy to have gotten it from Overstock at what must be a substantially reduced price. The wood is gorgeous. It's actually quite heavy, which points to its solid construction. This style is very popular right now in NYC, but I think that the table feels timeless enough that I should be able to keep it for decades. It's that well-made. The only issue with it is that it's nicer than the rest of my furniture!", 
    "This is a very pretty table. It is also very heavy - according to the shipper it is 190lbs. The table comes well packaged and is easily assembled.", 
    "Everyone wants to know what kind of wood this is. We use it in our vacation home and it is a fantastic balance of rustic and elegant. Very hard, heavy wood and seems to resist rings and stains.", 
    "I have had this table(in the natural) now for almost 6 monthes and I am thrilled with this purchase, Everyone who has had dinner at our home, has commented on the beauty of the grain of the wood and the overall quality. The size of the table is perfect for our space and I love the versatility of the leave extensions. Perfect without the leaves for a family of 4 and can seat up to 8 if needed with the leaves. My husband who is more traditional in taste loves the look of this table and has even stated that it was a smart buy and has no regrets about the purchase. The construction is solid wood and gorgeous. Measure your space and if it fits, buy it. You will love it!", 
    "The wood grain of the table is gorgeous. It looks better in person than on the screen. It has a simple style with straight legs. The leaves are easily attached at both ends of the table for more seating. The table without the leaves will seat 4 and with the leaves it seats 6. That is the only issue. Because the table is not that wide, you can only seat one person at either end. If you tried to seat more, the legs are in the way. All in all, works great for us and I do love the look. The table is extremely heavy and durable. One of the legs came cracked at the top, but my husband used some glue before attaching it to the table. And now you would never know there was a problem.", 
    "could not be happy.very well built shiped fast highlee rac", 
    "We love it. It is high quality, heavy and beautiful.", 
    "Got many compliments on this Shesham, brown stained wood table. It is darker than expected but reddish variations blended well with cherry color chairs. The extensions slide in on both sides which are bulky and do not store easily. Very solid, heavy table. No veneers!", 
    "This table is sturdy and beautiful. The extension pieces are very low tech. They are 2 slabs of wood with steel prongs protruding outward that you insert through the holes under the table. As a result, the extensions aren't perfectly aligned with the table height as it's not the tightest fit. That being said, I'm very happy with my purchase, and I would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "It's a great looking table and exceptionally sturdy. Very easy to assemble. It does have a quite a lot of surface flaws-any knot holes or blemishes in the surface of the wood planks were not filled in. Also some dings on the edges. All in all, it's still a great looking table. Shipping was exceptionally fast, at least to the local trucking office. They held it from a Thurs. to the next Tuesday before delivering it. I'd buy it again. Overstock is a great seller to work with.", 
    "Needed a sturdy table that could be extended in length to accommodate larger family dinners on occasion. This piece is exceptional, beautiful, the extensions are simple to add and remove, completely stable. All who see and sit at this table have nothing but highly complimentary things to say about it. The wood grain, dark and light, works wonderfully with our oak wood flooring and Maine woods setting. The price is almost unbelievable for the quality.", 
    "VERY sturdy construction and easy to assemble, too. The wood is from India and it is a hard wood but is not a \"perfect\" wood in that there are a few knots and spots that add character. The finish used by the manufacturer is good not great. Looks really nice and it is almost heavy duty enough to have a dance party on it.", 
    "The table arrived quickly & was well packaged. Easy to put together & looks amazing. The colors of the wood are rich and warm. Now if only I could get the matching chairs. They keep selling out. I also ordered the bench.", 
    "Not too wide and the wood is beautiful", 
    "This solid wood table is beautiful! This is an excellent buy for this price. I am very happy with this table.", 
    "disappointed. Luck of the draw, but the grain in mine isn't as awesome as it could have been. However, this is a VERY sturdy, heavy piece of furniture. Sadly, no chairs available that match it on OVERSTOCK.", 
    "The table is more beautiful in person. It can seat up to 10 people, but it is better suited to 8. The leaves insert at the ends of the table. The legs get in the way of having 4 chairs on each side. It still looks amazing and is beautiful with the clear acrylic Eiffel style chairs I bought to go with it. Together they look like a magazine photo!", 
    "This table is high quality with a beautiful wood grain. The natural chairs I purchased with it along with the light bench matched perfectly. With all of the many colors in the grain it pulled all of the different woods I have in my house together. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again.", 
    "Sturdy, beautiful wood grain, and wonderful new center piece to our dining area. Matches the Alicia chairs perfectly. Easy assembly. Would recommend this product for any dining area. Great product for a great price."
