    "We ordered this table to use with kids because a scratch or dent would not show. Great purchase! Pros are the cool lime washed finish, which is a fun addition to our otherwise sleek decor, the sturdiness, the size which can seat at least eight (we squeezed 8 plus 2 babies around it). Cons are the heaviness - it took 2 strong guys to upend it after we screwed the legs on - and one or two of the bolts were not extremely solid in the legs so we are relying on one bolt on places rather than two. However, the while thing is so solid that I am not worried about it. For the price, we would definitely buy this again.", 
    "I've gotten so many compliments on this table; it is beautifully crafted, simple, but sturdy and the perfect compliment to our kitchen. I wanted something that was going to wear well and clean up easily with 2 young kids, and after a couple of months, I couldn't have been happier. I looked for several months for the perfect solid wood dining table, and am so happy that this is the one that we went with. We opted for the medium brown color, which is a nice rich walnut-y color. The 82\" length fits 3 chairs comfortably along one side, and we can add chairs on the ends when we have guests. The table arrived and all we had to attach were the 4 legs, which was a pretty easy fit. Overall, this is a great, sturdy table and one that I'm sure we'll have for years to come!", 
    "WOW! This table is amazing...if you are hesitating to pull the trigger, like I did months ago, then don't...buy it already! You will NOT be disappointed! It is GORGEOUS! It arrived in less time than indicated, it is VERY heavy and super sturdy. The lime finish is so unique...this table is sophisticated and elegant while being relaxed and casual at the same time. I'm in LOVE with my dining room because of this purchase. I walk into the room just to look at it, its like art...it IS art. I'm thrilled it came back and that I bought it! YAY!!", 
    "this TABLE is only 36\" wide, NOT 38\" as advertised. I wanted a WIDER table, so that was a bit of a disappointment!! ALSO, we put the legs on as prescribed according to the letters - to match the particular corners where they should be, HOWEVER, on one side of the table BOTH legs were slightly at an inward angle toward the table as a result. After reshuffling the legs, we ended up with just ONE leg that was still inverted. this was better than having TWO on the same side! This table is extremely heavy, and solid. that gives me some confidence that the one inverted leg won't be too big of an issue going forward. FINALLY, the first table delivered was completely BUSTED/cracked at the top, so it was probably dropped during shipment -- so I highly recommend unwrapping the package when it arrives WITH the delivery guys still there so they can take it away immediately. OTHERWISE, you will have this huge table sitting around for a couple WEEKS until a new pickup and delivery of new table can be arranged.", 
    "Bought the limewash table...very sturdy and heavy, I feel like it should last a lifetime with proper care. The table I received has one plank at the top that is significantly darker than the rest...at first I was a little annoyed but at the end of the day, it adds to its rustic charm. There are several areas of filler used to presumably smooth out missing bits or imperfections in the surface of the table top, however they blend pretty well and are perfectly smooth and hard like the rest of the table so they shouldnt pose any problems. There is also one area toward the end of one side where two planks join on the table top where there is a dip in the surface. Fortunately this isnt right where one would set a plate so I dont expect it to be problematic. Overall I do feel it was a good value, rustic and charming...easily 6 to 8 can be accommodated for dinner and the distressed wash makes it perfect for families...looks elegant and unique without worry of damaging its finish. Overall happy with purchase.", 
    "The wood is gorgeous and pretty true to photo color, just a hint more grey-washed, which I love. The styling is modern, clean-lined and substantial, but also equally traditional rustic. Well built, sturdy and VERY heavy. This could fit with most any decor, from traditional to modern minimal rustic. Great size too! I can sit 10 at this table comfortably. I bought this to \"bring the warmth of wood & a bit of rustic charm\" to my ultra-modern-minimal dining room; to keep the \"modern\" I paired it with 8 sleek high-back pure white leather dining chairs, and 2 \"clear acrylic & chrome\" low-back chairs at each end. Looks awesome! This table can adapt to nearly any decor style with a \"change of the chairs\". This is my most favorite furniture purchase ever! 3 good men had to assemble it for me though, as it is a very heavy piece. Totally Love it!", 
    "This is exactly what I was looking for! I searched forever for a dining table and finally came across this one. Nothing in the local furniture stores appealed to me. I was hesitant to buy online, but I am so glad I ordered this table! I paired it with a set of blue wooden cross back dining chairs from Ashley furniture and I love the rustic charm of this set. The top surface is not completely level and it does have different colored boards, but this adds to the rustic charm. I ordered the lime wash color and it is perfect. It is a very heavy table, but it shipped in great condition. It was packed really good and double boxed. The exact dimensions for the top are 38\" X 82\".", 
    "I got this table back in June a couple of weeks after moving into our new house...I got the darker brown color, which is definitely a more glossy/shiny finish and paired it with some modern white dining chairs. Overall love the table, perfect size for our dining room and pairs well with any type of decor. The only issue I have is that the table I received has a very noticeable crack in it, which unfortunately we only noticed after un-packaging the entire table, flipping it over and assembling it. It is HEAVY and huge and honestly I wasn't even sure how we'd go about returning it since I already signed off on the delivery that it was OK, and with everything else going on with renovating our house, I never followed up on it to send it back. But the crack bothers me every day and I really wish I had tried to return it for a new table. Moral of the story - while the delivery person is still there, unwrap the ENTIRE table and thoroughly check for damage (he helped us unwrap one portion of it to 'inspect' it, then had me sign the delivery note and took off, before we noticed the crack). Other than that, would recommend the table.", 
    "I got the darker finish - it doesn't have any wash to it (it seemed to in the pictures). I still love the table. There were some chunks missing in 2 legs (minor). The only reason I saw them was that the finish was missing in those spots (small chunks). In time, or with the help of a marker, they will blend in with the natural chunks. It is a very substantial table. When the delivery called to schedule, I asked about having it brought all the to my apartment, as I had recalled the delivery notes said \"to the front door\". Even though the shipping company said it was already scheduled as \"to the room of my choice\" - when the contracted delivery guys got here, they said \"no, to the door of your building.\" A little extra tip got it in the door. It is definitely not one you can do on your own! Be sure to ask and clarify and ask again...or have buddies, beer and pizza waiting.", 
    "Beautiful but came with some cracks and ruffles in the wood", 
    "This table is such a great deal. Awesome, good quality table. Very heavy! Perfectly fits up to eight people. Great purchase. Getting tons of compliments on it.", 
    "Solid construction, heavy beautiful piece of furniture. I looked everywhere online and in stores and this was the best deal for what I was looking for. This is simple design ans as such, versatile and functional. Can work as a daily, big breakfast table and with the right accesories as a very chic and modern dining set. You can sit 6 people comfortably, but it has room for up to 8 guests, if you need it.Check it out before you accept shipment. It's heavy and can easily cracked while in transit. Mine had a minor crack so I rejected the delivery. I contacted overstock and they immediately send a replacement. The second shipment arrived promptly and with no damage.It arrives in 5 pieces, top and four legs, and my husband and boys put it together in less than 30 minutes, eeeeeaaasy.Good product, good value and the traditional excellent customer service from overstock. I'm a happy customer!", 
    "This is a beautiful table. It fits perfectly with our existing decor. It arrived in good condition. Delivery company was prompt. I'm only disappointed that I couldn't find the bench pictured with it.", 
    "Sturdy, well-made. We get tons of compliments.", 
    "This table is so solid I can barely budge it, it took three men to pick it up and place it upright after my husband assembled it (15 mins and simple). It really is gorgeous and unique, everyone who has seen it is oohing and aweing ... I'm so pleased with it, we bought it for our beach house and it fits three chairs on each side and one at either end very comfortably.", 
    "I received this table last week and love it more and more each day!! It is heavy and sturdy, great for kids and busy families. Looking forward to using this table every day!", 
    "I love the lime finish, the table is really strong and it was better than what I expected.", 
    "It's a great table. Looks nice and great value!", 
    "The table was easy to assemble (it just needs to have the legs attached) and looks fantastic. I think it's even better than the pictures.", 
    "We just received this table and I absolutely love it. Our home is modern and this adds such a rustic chic touch to our dining space. The table is over 200 pounds and the wood is gorgeous. So happy with this purchase!!!!!!!", 
    "I'm in love with this table! I purchased the lime wash and my planks are much darker (not as white washed) as the ones in the table pictured. I think there is probably a lot of variation between tables. It's perfect for our space and has great character. I have 3 large dark wood chairs on each side so plenty of room for the family!", 
    "This was an amazing purchase. It looks even better in person and fit perfectly into our dining room. Easy to assemble. Will be keeping for life!", 
    "Love, love, love this table! The table is sturdy, solid and generally well-made. I assembled the table quickly but it's so sturdy and heavy that it was a struggle for 2 people (including my weightlifting son) to right it. I love the table and have gotten several compliments.", 
    "I was very hesitant about purchasing my dining room table online but after looking everywhere at local furniture stores I was not finding what i was looking for so started looking online and found this table. I was a little nervous about buying online but i am so glad i did. We just got it yesterday and it is a very well made heavy duty table. I bought the abbyson colin beige chairs to go with it and my vision came together. So happy with my purchase!!", 
    "My husband said \"I didnt know they had such a good furniture on overstock. I am very happy with your choice.\" - Table is very heavy, very beautiful.", 
    "Amazing look and feel well worth the money", 
    "This table is super heavy, rustic in an authentic way and beautiful. I've received countless compliments.", 
    "The table shipped very fast. It is Very Heavy, I dropped a leg on my foot and nearly broke it. This is not an **** table for sure!It looks awesome in my \"open plan\" dinning room. I have a southwest vibe in my house & it looks like it was custom make", 
    "the color is different from the photo. I still kept mine though and not sure someone else would have done the same if misled by the color.", 
    "This table is top notch. Easy to assemble with two people and very sturdy!", 
    "The table was a smashing hit for my client. I would highly recommend.", 
    "My husband and I love our table! The first table had a crack in the top, but was quickly replaced by customer service. Guests are constantly complimenting us on our table. We love the rustic look. Great quality, very solid furniture.", 
    "I get complements on this table all the time. Nice distressed/washed finish. It's extremely heavy and sturdy, which I like. We can easily seat 8.", 
    "This table is heavy-duty, gorgeously cool, and a great deal. Love it! Get tons of compliments.", 
    "I was amazed at how solid the wood was. The distressed look was great can't wait to get other pieces to complete the room", 
    "This is one solid piece of furniture. It's absolutely beautiful and exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a dining table that seats 8 for the new house. It sat for about a week in the box, and by the time we put it together, there was a crack in the middle, as stated in other reviews. The prospect of returning it and waiting for another was undaunting. So we took a mallet and pounded it back it place. Can't even tell. the wood is nice and even, and it just adds character to it!", 
    "Excellent table! Saw it on another website for almost double. It's sturdy and decorative. I've received many compliments on it from company.", 
    "HOLY COW!!!!!!!!! This table is HEAVY! I mean insanely heavy. Even an individual leg took effort to lift. THE LEG! No veneers here. The legs are, basically, tree trunks. Gotta weigh about 20 pounds each. So this tells you about the table top. Very sturdy, packed extremely well, a breeze to put together.I wanted a table I didn't have to fuss with and I think I found it. Performing an operation on this table wouldn't damage it. I could tap dance on it with spiked shoes and it would look the same. It has a VERY rustic look. I think if the finish were less rustic it would be more appealing as the distressing seems a little too contrived. If it were more subtle this would look like a much more expensive piece of furniture. One day I might attempt to refinish it myself. For now it is fine. The best representation of this table is the picture with the chairs around it. In this picture you can see the gouging and lime in the gouges. The small side view of the table doesn't really show all the nooks and crannies it has. I wish it looked like that smaller picture - that's the image that originally sold me on the table. But, all in al, I really like it a lot and am so glad I got it.", 
    "I loved this table online and even love it more in person. It was exactly what i was looking for to add a rustic touch in the dining room. It looks beautiful with my beige, tufted chairs as well. The finish is beautiful and hides any spills or scratches you might get from kids or just every day wear and tear. Looks like it will last ages. The only downfall was that it was SOOOO HEAVY! You need lots of help carrying or assembling this table. My husband did it alone and he was not happy. Pls find the adequate help to assemble and carry up the stairs if necessary. this is not a one person job. It fits 8 ppl comfortably, i am even hoping to try to squeeze 2-3 more kids on the corners if possible for big family dinners.", 
    "Bought this for the lake house. Received several compliments. Good job replicating distressed/reclaimed wood.", 
    "Love this table, was skeptical about buying on line .. I couldn't be happier , wasn't shipped when it was supposed to had to keep calling back. Was so worth the wait !! It's is very heavy and sturdy. Will last forever. Will be handed down to generations...", 
    "We liked the table, before we received it, and fell in love all over again, once it was delivered. Overstock's pictures do not do this table justice!", 
    "This is an excellent table. very heavy and very sturdy. the original one came with a crack, so I had to call overstock to switch it out. they did it no problem, so I can confirm the great service you get at Overstock.com!", 
    "Shipping service was great especially since the table weighs a ton. To me that means quality solid wood with variations in color. Super easy to put together. My hubbie and I were able to flip and place table. Though I am 5' tall with the will of a giant. It's really heavy. You just have to watch where you put a wine glass since it is supposed to be rustic some of the wood is rounded on top but the planks are super smooth. Received many compliments especially when I tell them where I got it from. Love it."
