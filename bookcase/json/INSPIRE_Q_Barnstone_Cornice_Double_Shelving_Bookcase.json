  "reviews": [
    "I am very happy with these bookcases. I ordered two, to flank my fireplace. They were easy to assemble and are very attractive. I wish there were coffee and end tables to match.", 
    "The wood shelves look great. For some reason, the metal looks a little plasticy to me- maybe its the color of the paint, its a bit dull, without the shine of metal. If the metal poles looked better, i would have been over the moon. As is, it's just okay to me. but we still get compliments on it.", 
    "I am very happy with this purchase. At first look after an easy assembling I thought was too big and looked a bit heavy. The day after I started loving it and found out looks great in the big space I have.", 
    "Perfect and easy to assemble", 
    "Really nice bookshelf. Went together easily. Made the room\u2026\u2026.", 
    "Not Forgotten only functional, but quite the statement piece!", 
    "Great price for excellent quality shelves. Look great in my living room.", 
    "Given the choice, I prefer the single bookshelf instead. This unit arrived w/out instructions and banged up from the trip. CAVEAT: It is actually 5 FIXED long boards NOT 10 as stated, if that helps anyone.", 
    "Great quality and beautiful piece. The white is more of a cream/ off white, but still very nice and looks great.", 
    "It gives the Luxe look for less.", 
    "Designer looking shelf. Loved it", 
    "Get compliments on this every time someone walks in our apartment. Love this bookshelf, it's perfect!", 
    "We get so many compliments on this shelf! It's solid, gorgeous and looks fantastic in our living room! I absolutely recommend!", 
    "Nothing negative to say here!! Easy to put together by one person. Nice looking and very sturdy!! I love the way they look in my living room!!", 
    "Great bookshelf. Looks great, sturdy design. Great price ... 60% less than name brand stores.", 
    "Awesome, well made sturdy shelving. Cost is $400 less than a popular furniture store.", 
    "We love all the extra storage for our dining are this unit provides. We got the biggest one and were able to display lots of Christmas collections this year. Not only do we love the size and quality of these shelves, but our daughter said, \"I wish everything we had was this aesthetic.\" Five stars from the teenager and her middle-aged parents.", 
    "Overall we are happy with our purchase. The unit is well made and is real wood, not pressboard. Very easy to put together. The cons are the shelves are not stained on both sides so you can see the unfinished bottom of each shelf when put together. We put this in our living room so I had to match the stain and finish them myself. Some of the shelves arrived damaged which I also had to repair. We do like the look of this bookcase and it was a great price.", 
    "I bought the white-washed shelving. My style is (don't laugh) industrial cottage. I have a real Persian Heriz rug, Mies van der Rohe Barcelona chair, white sectional, 7-foot black metal toolbox/TV console and a rebar & glass coffee table. This shelving is right at home!", 
    "Love the Bookcase. The quality however could be better. Two board were crooked and the cross support elements stand out too. My bookcase is standing against the wall so it's not a big deal. It wouldn't look great if you're planning to put the bookcase somewhere in an open area.", 
    "Very sturdy shelf. It came in great shape. Instructions could have been better.", 
    "I was really looking for a solid, well made bookcase and I definitely found it. It was money well spent. I did not want any thing that looked like it belonged in a dorm room.", 
    "This is a very large and sturdy piece! I was surprised at its hefty weight and size for the price.", 
    "I've only had this set of shelves up for about 4 days and I love seeing it every time I pass thru the living room. 2 person job to put together and get moved, but even without directions it took maybe 20 minutes to put together (with a motorized drill, not the Allen wrench that comes with it). Color (I got the brown) is great, kind of distressed looking, metal part is a dark brown/oiled bronze. Very stable, sturdy, heavy piece. The one at Restoration Hardware looks almost identical for double the price of this one! Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "What a great piece. Easily assembled, comes packed in excellent form, and looks great.", 
    "Easy to assemble ...Only one major criticism: the folding X support bars should be able to be attached to the center vertical strut both for stability and to prevent a very annoying rattle when using the shelves. Judicious use of some Crazy Glue solved the problem.", 
    "I bought 2 of these bookcases for either side of my fireplace and I just love them! I put them together by myself and it took me about 4 hours total but it was easy and would've been shorted time is I hadn't been watching tv at the same time. There is one small dented spot but you don't notice it. I would definitely recommend these!", 
    "These bookshelves are fantastic. They are very comparable to the bookshelves from Restoration Hardware. Very high quality easy to put together. Look very high end. I purchased the double and tripled shelves. Very pleased with purchased.", 
    "This bookcase came quickly and well packed. It was really easy to put together. Very heavy and nice looking unit.", 
    "I first saw this item on overstock but failed to purchase it initially. When I finally decided that I wanted it, it had sold out! I watched the website for weeks and when it finally came back in stock, I purchased it immediately. I love this shelf! My husband put it together in about an hour and he did not seem to have much trouble with the assembly. It is a beautiful addition to our living room. I would highly recommend it!", 
    "I love this shelf! It looks Fantastic and I get so many compliments on it. It was easy to put together. My only complaint is that the wood had white crud all over it. It took some work, but we were able to get almost all of it off with a wood soap and brush.", 
    "Piece came as shown. Very pleased with the quality and the lookup. Easy to set up.", 
    "Good quality. I ordered two of these and easy assembly. Would recommend.", 
    "Great Product. I would definitely suggest this product to a friend!", 
    "This shelving shelving unit is a great addition to any room you would choose to put it in. very stylish looking. It is sturdy and has a quality look/feel to it as well. A great purchase!!", 
    "We love the bookcase. It was better looking then shown online. Easy to put together.", 
    "This shelf was exactly what I needed. It looks great and was easy to put together. The open shelving does not make my small home office look crowded. Love it.", 
    "Looks great and is nice and sturdy however, this item had two deep chucks of wood missing on two of the shelves. If not for the damage I would have given this five stars.", 
    "I looked at the shelves sold by Restoration Hardware and these are actually better at one third the cost. The quality is excellent and they look very impressive. Most competitors don't have the thick wood top but merely a skinny shelf on top. Great product for this price or even twice as much.", 
    "This is a mock of a ******* ******* shelf unit, but at a fraction of the cost. The top face of each wood plank veneer has a beautiful rustic texture of wood. It was also very easy to put together - took 10min. i would recommend this shelving unit :)", 
    "At a fraction of the cost of RH, it looks almost exactly the same and it is very nice quality. It's not the same color as the rest of my furniture in our family room but it still blends beautifully."
