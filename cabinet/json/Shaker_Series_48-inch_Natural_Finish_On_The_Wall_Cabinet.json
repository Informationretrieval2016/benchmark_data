    "More expensive than other cabinets for storage, but they are made totally of solid wood! And the idea and the use of space with these is just magic. I bought two of them, one for the upstairs hallway, and one for the adjacent SMALL bathroom which had no storage space. Wish I could afford two more. They are just wonderful - period."
