    "My primary fear in buying furniture online is that when it arrives I'll discover I've purchased paper-laminated cardboard. I'm happy to say that this piece isn't paper-laminated cardboard; it's an actual piece of furniture. Solid, well-made, well-designed. Even the back piece is luan...and this is a VERY nice touch: the back attaches with screws, not with tacks or nails. The holes for the back aren't pre-drilled. Strictly speaking, pre-drilling may not be necessary, but I didn't want to chance it so I pre-drilled them myself.Arrived one day early, package in excellent condition. All parts present and well-labeled. Instructions/illustrations clear and easy to follow. Assembly method is standard peg-and-locknut, which will be familiar to most anyone who's experienced with assembling cabinets or \"box\" furniture.Actual product looks just as good as the picture.", 
    "Great piece of furniture. Solid wood and not particle board like the bookshelves from the office supply stores. Looks great in the room. Putting it together was quick.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the construction. Most of the flat-pack furniture available have connections that are not reinforced.", 
    "Well-made, beautiful bookcase. I'm going to buy another one for another room in our house. It's solid, functional, and a great price.", 
    "Nice product... easy to put together... great deal for the money!", 
    "Bookcase is not as sturdy as I hoped, but it is good for the price. It is easy to assemble and the color is good.", 
    "Nice piece of furniture. Good quality and easy to put together."
