    "Chair arrived damaged, holes inside the seat at the lower rear. Kept the chairs after Overstock discounted for damage because we will use them for staging homes for sale. Overstock great at listening to me and promptly making a discount. I would recommend Overstock but not this chair.", 
    "While reading the reviews, someone asked if the legs were plastic or wood. Someone, I assumed to be the manufacturer or Overstock customer service, said that the legs were wood. They are certainly not wood. Just a very hard plastic. And as all the reviews pretty much say, not a chair for anything other than decoration. Very uncomfortable and not solid at all.", 
    "My only complaint about these chairs is that they are not comfortable at all, but other than that, they are perfect! Mine are more for decoration anyway.", 
    "Comfortable, reasonably priced chairs.", 
    "Great corner club chair and most important fabric does not smell with chemical This one i will not have to discard", 
    "Based on the weight this chair is said to be able to hold I thought it would be better built than it was. It's okay. It looks better in person than online. Beware the legs are plastic and look plastic. They may have strength...I don't know but I can't keep it in my living room. Sorry I bought it. I knew the risk. The first big disappointment I've had from Overstock.com. I wish I could return it but luckily I bought it with a discount so I didn't pay full price. This is the last time I buy something without any reviews. I'll let someone else take that risk from now on unless it's something easy to return.", 
    "Nice for the bedroom. Great to read in.", 
    "It is perfect for the corner of my living room", 
    "This chair is perfect for color, size and height! Not cushy but still comfortable!", 
    "This chair is just the right size for the space I have. However, it is a bit low but I still like it.", 
    "The legs are plastic, but really who is going to be on the floor looking at them,other than my cats? I wouldn't recommend for everyday use as they are a little small, but for an occaisonal visitor they're fab.", 
    "If you need something in an area that is going to get a lot of use, do not buy this. The legs are black plastic. The whole thing weighs about 10 lbs. I am not sure how it can hold up to 350 lbs. A little wobbly. My small 80 lb son even said it feels cheap. However, if you want something to just \"sit there\" like I did, it isn't horrible. Priced high I think for what it actually is. I was expecting something a little more solid. The cats love it and it works....", 
    "Most popular chair in the kitchen. I have to kick one of the kids out of it to sit in it myself. Needless to say, comfy! Not sure how long those legs are going to hold up, but so far so good. It's a little bulky to get around for the kitchen but it's replacing a club chair at a game table now being used as a kitchen table and the height and sitting comfort is perfect.", 
    "color is as not as red as picture", 
    "This chair is good size while being nice and light and easy to move when cleaning.", 
    "yet chairs are quite lightweight, but for the price they can't be beat. nice texture to fabric.", 
    "Nice chair but very light weight and with a hard seat. Not for someone looking for a cushy chair. Works well in my entry foyer.", 
    "Comfortable but lightweight, kind of chintzy", 
    "This is a very nice chair. Made in the USA. Easy to assemble, just screw on the legs. The seat is attached to the chair, is very firm, but already I can feel its getting softer. A great chair for the money. Will not take up much room, if you have a small room to fill. I love it!"
