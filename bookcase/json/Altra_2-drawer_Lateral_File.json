    "I waited alot longer than Id anticipated to get my File, but after we opened the box and saw the damage I asked my husband to put it together anyway as the damage wouldnt interfere with its purpose & that was so that I could file away months of paper work. Which I have and it works fine. Unfortunately it doesnt lock but I knew that befor I bought it. If it were a perfect world Id liked to have received it looking new....darn it!!!!", 
    "I realized or my boyfriend did once we opened the box this was a challenge and he is a builder so he certainly knows how to put things together. Took him 3.5 hours to do it. The drawers don't open very well and the look of it compared to the online view is very shabby. I'm just not sure it's a well made cabinet for the $189.00 you are charging.", 
    "Quality is okay. I expected something better than what I received. Thanks", 
    "It came damage I asked for return sent me another and this was damaged too..The file cabinet is very cheaply made ..", 
    "Packaging is inadequate to protect contents. Lots of chips on corners and tons of white polystyrene pieces. Took 4 hours to assemble and another half hour to clean up the mess of static white bits of plastic. Total parts count: 159. Tools included: 0. Would have sent it back but time is tight and I really needed this to get a printer in place for my wife before i headed back out of town on business. I thought the shipping damage might not show. I was wrong. Quality of materials is very poor, the back of the unit is paper. Seriously, I've seen cereal boxes with thicker stock. Instructions were very hard to figure out. Several complex steps which, if you get it wrong, mean a lot of extra work. I didn't get them wrong, and it still took 4 hours. I ordered this because it is just the right size. It just doesn't look very good. A bit like something I found used and slightly abused. There has to be a better way than this to get reasonably priced, decent looking office furniture.", 
    "This was not what I expected. This was all pressed wood with a cover that made it look like wood. The hardware was cheap. Construction was poor at best", 
    "I don't like the heavy pressed board. Once you get it together its so heavy to move and it you drop f forget it. Otherwise, it looks ok and functions like intended.", 
    "This is a piece of junk. It came all damaged up but even besides that, it's very low quality. Don't waste your money!"
