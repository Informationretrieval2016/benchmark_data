    "If you are looking for a nice looking, inexpensive, functional piece of furniture made for a light usage situation then this will work. Although it is not solid wood, it is rather sturdy. I have a TV sitting on it with the components on the shelf and it works fine. It would work fine for a buffet with some dish storage too. The doors, however, do not fit properly and have to be closed in tandem to fit flat. Assembly was not difficult but took about an hour because in one place the connections did not fit properly and all the connections must be accurately placed for a strong connection. I think it will be fine for a few years where I have it but I would not recommend its use where children will be opening and closing the doors.", 
    "The instructions came with missing pages so we had to guess how to put it together. Once it was together, we noticed the front door of the cabinet was horrible scratched.", 
    "Was missing some parts. Also had to request some replacement piecse because of either damage, scratches or poor paint job. The only reason I did not return the cabinet is because it was the only thing I could find that would fit in the area I put it in and hold what I needed without it costing a lot more money. Also, the brown color is a solid \"painted\" brown with absolutley no variation in color. I do have to say that the company did ship out the replacement parts very quickly and without question and they packaged the replacement pieces very carefully.", 
    "I've been looking for a cabinet that was thin (depth-wise) to fit in my kitchen. I am so thankful I found this because it's been exhausting trolling the internet for the exact measurements (and price) I needed. This cabinet was perfect and fit my budget! The search is over and I'm happy with this product. It's a great space saver and it pretty cute when assembled. It took about 3 hours, by myself, to put this together, but take into account that an hour of that was carefully unwrapping all the pieces, organizing it, and checking it off the list to confirm you have all the parts needed for assembly. For someone that isn't a fan of puzzles or constructing things, I can see putting this together will be a job. The instructions are condensed, so you really have to pay attention to each diagram to see the details of the instructions. There are no words in the instruction manual. The very last steps are kind of trial an error because you may ask yourself, \"does this piece go this way or that way because I can't really tell from the picture\" (the front wood piece under the top)...but you can easily figure it out by trial and error. It's not that hard. I had a dilemma when I put the top piece on and I noticed it had a couple dings. The box was packaged perfectly, so it was probably put in the box damaged. I got on the Overstock Chat and they were able to help me out very quickly. They simply sent me another top! YES!!! What a great resolution!!!!! If I would have bought this anywhere else, I would have probably had to repackage the darn thing and have them send me out replacement. That's a bunch of hassle I was spared. Thank you! I just got the new top piece within a few days and the Overstock Representative kept me informed through the entire process. I give Overstock lots of credit for being swift and efficient. Hey, as a customer, problems may arise..it's how they handle it. I'm a fan.", 
    "I am very satified with the product and have had some compliements on how nice it looks. I have a rather large kitchen and it works well for storing large items such as pressure cooker and bread maker", 
    "This is what I have been looking for ! Good price and great product ! When I received it I thought it will be difficult to assemble, but the instructions were so clear and assembly was very easy. I may purchase one more unit for use at my other corner of kitchen !", 
    "works great as a mini bar", 
    "Assembly was not to bad takes two. It is a nice piece for the price. I would recommend for any one who needs a little extra storage", 
    "I bought this for a small pantry for my kitchen/dining area. It took a little time to put together, but was worth the time. Perfect for what I needed it for!", 
    "It looks great on the site and in person but I am a little disappointed with the quality.", 
    "Would have been perfect, except the doors are off somehow and don't latch quite right but it works for what it was intended for.", 
    "it does the job...but you can tell right away that the quality is very cheap.", 
    "When I unpacked this item we noticed a few little dings and flaws but I didn't want to judge this buffet until I put it all together. The directions were faded (copied too many times) so it was difficult to use. When I realized that the left door had been glued together (as if it had broken as it was being manufactured) and it showed horribly on the outside I was ticked off. Then the left whole front corner strip was painted over unfinished wood and looks horrible. I may be able to sand and re-stain that but I need the left door replaced. I hope Overstock can get me a new left door that isn't damaged.", 
    "this buffet serves our purpose (just needed a little extra room for kitchen appliances), but it is much flimsier than i imagined. and i had to put a felt pad on one of the legs, as it was clearly uneven when fully assembled.", 
    "This item fell apart as soon as i assembled it. After putting in a few bottles of wine, the wood literally split. If you think you're gonna save some money by purchasing this, think again!", 
    "Tried to put together and it would not tighten. It completely fell apart in two days.", 
    "I ordered this piece and it looked really nice in the pictures but when we received it the quality was awful. First of the parts were mislabeled so it was very hard to assemble. Then some of the pieces were scratched. The material felt like thin plywood and not a durable kind of material. The most annoying thing was the holes for the door were mis-aligned so the doors when they close do not line up. I wish I could return this piece but my husband got rid of the box.", 
    "Not the easiest to put together but once you get it the buffet sits nice and pretty.", 
    "A very nice piece, not too big so worked very well in smaller places.", 
    "Came with obvious flaws. There was a gouge in the front that was poorly patched with putty(meaning they caught the defect and decided it was good enough). Legs are very flimsy and made of mdf o if you try to move this on carpet they will break. Finish is paint, not stain (and more of a burgundy than a brown).", 
    "too difficult for one person to assemble. lots of pressed wood and fell apart when I tried to assemble. ended up throwing it out and ate the cost.", 
    "This is the worst piece of furniture that I have ever seen!! The instructions are a joke. You need to put it together on your own. Very unhappy with Overstock, on this item!! I advise not to purchase this item......true Nightmare!!", 
    "For the price, this is an amazing product. The only complaint I have is the magnets on the door don't keep the door shut that great.", 
    "The box was not damaged, yet the product inside was cracked and damaged. It's made of cheap fiberboard so it's easily chipped and cracked. This was a huge hassle because we took all the pieces out only to discover that it was damaged and had to figure out how to get it back in the box and to the UPS store. Very disappointed in the waste of time.", 
    "Looks nice, but very hard to put together and not as well made as I would have liked. Was a good price, so I guess you get what you pay for!", 
    "I really don't like the fact that the wooden buffet was sent to me missing pieces and the wood was chipped like it was sent to me from somebody else return also the directions aren't great at all GOOD LUCK", 
    "It arrived in a thousand pieces. Directions were poor and \"wood\" split when trying to put it together. It ended up in the ditch for the garbage man to pick up. Complete waste of time and money!", 
    "There is a lot to do to put this together and would work better if there were two people.", 
    "Purchased for my daughter and son in law as Christmas gift. Took my husband better part of day to assemble. Had to glue some parts, but it turned out great. They loved it and started filling it as soon as we gave it to them.", 
    "This is one of the worst products that I have ordered from overstock I have been very pleased over the years. This product has no wood no where. When putting together screw holes split. Not difficult to put together but not a great product worthy of overstock. Parts and screws missing. And product corners snashed during delivery I assume could have come from factory this way. Not what it seem. Would like a refund. Discarded to trash as it is.", 
    "Definetly a two person job. Took a few hours to put together. It'ts pretty stable and light enough to move for easy cleaning. A great value. Coupon and Club O ***, the price was really sweeter.", 
    "I'm a fairly handy guy who has put together many things, including things purchased from Overstock and this was by far the hardest. The first thing I noticed after opening the box was the very strong smell of the finish that was applied. It took several days for the odor to dissipate and it wasn't a pleasant odor. The build quality is fair at best. I had a hard time getting everything stable. Some of the locking mechanisms didn't seem to adequately stay locked. After finally putting it together, it looks ok, but it wouldn't work in a living room. It is used in our garage for storage.", 
    "Very easy but time consuming to put together. We added peg holes to use the shelf much higher, now a perfect bar cabinet, with the liquor on the bottom shelf and glasses on the small top shelf. Mixers in the open space down below. One of the cabinet handles didn't screw on properly, so we had to drill the hole deeper before it screwed properly. So far so good, but only have had it for a month.", 
    "met the need but not my expectation. Sadly I had to get someone else to fix the flaws so I could use it. I didn't have the time to order something else.", 
    "This is an attractive piece and was very much as I expected from the online description. The instructions left a little to be desired, but were generally pretty similar to the assembly of other particle board furniture (pegs and cam-locks). My biggest complaint, and why this product got at \"good\" instead of \"excellent,\" is that a significant amount of the hardware was missing. It was short 2 pegs and 5 of the screws for the cam-locks! I had to use other screws and brackets to finish assembly.", 
    "I love this product.. It was a trip putting it together working with my husband we have different approaches. But, it worked out well we got it done. I would suggest a dry run on assembly then using wood glue to hold it together better.", 
    "this product was easy to assemble and i am most proud of the buffett. I would recommend it my friends.", 
    "Looks great, thin wood and low quality knobs but worth the price.", 
    "I have built a number of different furniture pieces and this one was kind of a pain! It took about three hours for me to put it together. The most frustrating part was that two of the holes for the hinges were not pre drilled and the shelf pegs were not included.", 
    "The product is actually a very rich looking buffet for the price of it. We were missing some screws, but we just picked a couple up at the store to complete it. it was perfect and exactly what we wanted with the ease of putting it together.", 
    "Do not purchase this buffett piece. It was a pain in the hiny to put together! The color is a dull brown and not a dark espresso like you would think. I was disappointed with my purchase. It took my husband and I 2 hours to put it together. I'm scared to put heavier things inside on the shelves because i feel like the shelv is going to split.", 
    "One step of the instructions was unclear and it seemed wobbly while being built, but is sturdy enough to serve as a coffee-maker stand for us. Honestly, this was the cheapest thing we could find to fit this purpose, and it serves very well for the price.", 
    "PRODUCT WAS FOR OFFICE COFFE BAR, INSTALLED SMALL REFRIGERATOR IN SIDE DOUBLE DOORS, WORKS GREAT. SUPER CUSTOMER SERVICE, EASY TO PUT TOGETHER WITH TWO PEOPLE,", 
    "I was extremely disappointed when my husband and I opened the undamaged box to find a severely damaged buffet! The door was cracked, multiple chips in the wood, side panel has punctured wood panel. This product was obviously packed in the box already damaged. I will not order from this company ever again and would not recommend them to anyone I know.", 
    "The instructions are very poorly written & not drawn well. If revamped, would save most of the time used to assemble. One must try different directions for assembly of the boards; upsidedown/backwards. There are chips in the finish. The piece is not stable and can be pulled on the diagonal; the doors are poorly fitted. In all, looks good, size is nice, but quality is disppointing.", 
    "I'd been looking for a small, expresso colored buffet for dining room storage at a minimal price. This piece worked out great. It looks like it's painted brown, no wood grain at all, but I don't mind it much. My husband put it together in just over 2 hours by himself. It seems sturdy enough. I have my good dishes, extra serving bowls, a tea set and some medium sized platters in it, just what I wanted it for. It doesn't look like a high end piece of furniture, but for dirt cheap storage it's perfect.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for hallway put it all together looks nice I love it ! I'm very happy wit this purchase :)", 
    "Great addition to my home. Great color and good storage. The back panel doesn't cover completely and it took over an hour to assemble.", 
    "Once the table was built i loved it but it was very difficult to build. The instructions were not clear. There was a missing piece. It had 2 scratches on the doors. So overall i'm happy with the buffet table now that its built. I use it daily. i think it was worth the price as well.", 
    "got this for the waiting room to put a coffee maker on top for guests. the quality is okay i guess... its more flimsy than i was expecting. if its just sitting there and you dont touch it, it seems nicer than it really is. it was a little difficult to put together but ive had worse. some holes didnt match up where they were supposed to so i had to use a screw gun and make my own holes. if i had known ahead of time i probably wouldnt have bought it but im dealing with it. if you just need a cheap piece of furniture to take up space its fine, but dont plan on getting long use out of it if its something you'll be taking things in and out of every day.", 
    "I've had the best experence buying from your company and will purchase more.", 
    "Nice piece of furniture but it took hours to assemble. There needs to be a better way to deliver this item without so many small parts and pieces.Took my whole morning.", 
    "Came very quickly and was easy to put together. Only problem we had was getting the doors level with each other, which I am pretty sure was our fault, not theirs.", 
    "the concept of this piece is good but the fit and finish is not as good as I expected. The screws that were supposed to anchor the top front rail to the top were too short and I had to replace them. Some cams would not tighten properly so the middle and botton front rails are loose.", 
    "Cheapest particle board I have ever seen. The \"wood\" had several dings in it, especially on the doors. A couple screws were missing.", 
    "Looks nice and perfect for what I am using it for but the directions were terrible. Actually, worse than terrible. It was nearly impossible to discern what went where. I am familiar with how cam locks work so I got it figured out but it was a HUGE headache.", 
    "product cannot be assembled. 17 cams of are camlocks are missing. all the pins are there. I've called on this but didn't get a reply. All the parts look fine and I would like to asemble it if you can get the missing parts for me", 
    "As per the above comments this item was not worth the money.", 
    "Was fairly easy to assemble, looks nice as a side console in our home office. Smells really bad on the inside though - some kind of chemical smell. Hoping it will air out.", 
    "You get what you pay for with this piece, it's very inexpensive but does the job for a storage unit you won't subject to every day use. The assembly instructions were not great, but good enough.", 
    "I had to return that buffet...top scratched all over and painted uneven", 
    "I thought this was wood but I had to kidding myself at this price. It's particle board for the most part. I wasn't totally surprised. It's painted this pseudo mahogany color. My club O dollars and a 15% coupon made it worth the $***paid for it. It serves the purpose. We moved and put a real solid north caroolina wood full sized side board with wine rack in storage. We needed something smaller for our temporary living space and didn't want to invest that kind of money again. Two of the parts on this thing were defective and missing holes. I called and O'stock sent me replacement parts. I have yet to put open the box because it means dissembling this thing and reassembling it. It's a bit time consuming and not the most intuitive construction. Oh and the second shelf is useless if you have anything as tall as a wine bottle. it to store wine, liquor and other miscellaneous stuff and that second shelf wont cut it with the wine bottles Bottom line, if you need something functional and obscure for cheap, then get this", 
    "Although the furniture is just what I needed, the time required for assembly was awful. This item should come with better instructions. Also, all the time is was taking me to put this together, the cost was dropping.", 
    "The product looks excellent. The wood quality is excellent. It was very easy to put together. That is until the last step of putting the doors on. It was the most difficult step and the person who designed it should be fired. I love putting furniture together (actually its very therapeutic to me) until the doors were to be installed. Very difficult to place, and almost impossible to line up correctly. They scratch the wood, take off the paint. I would return it if did not mean I had to take it apart and pack it, and that was worth my time. I would not buy the same item again, and I would not recommend it to anyone because doors were very difficult to out together.", 
    "Very nice product. Easy to assemble. Would purchase like items", 
    "Difficult to build and looks like something you put togethee", 
    "Looks nice in picture, but cheap materials, cheap hardware ...wouldn't recommend", 
    "Nice, functional, attractive cabinet. I am able to store quite a bit in it and the interior shelf is sturdy.", 
    "My wife uses this in our solarium to go along with our other dark brown furniture and it fits very well. It is very functional as a place to store reading material and books we like to read now and then. The lower shelf lets her display some of her decorative pottery so it makes a very presentable piece of furniture while being very functional. Mary is very happy with it.", 
    "Buffet had to be put together and required medium effort and time by a medium effort man. Doors were not good as one was quite abit higher than the other. The entire buffet had white streaks which will require a paint pen to hide what is probably glue. However this unit did hold several pots, pans and even had room for plastic storage containers. There was room on the shelf below the misaligned doors to hold more kitchen stuff or could even be a nice spot for the kitty to sleep. For the relatively low price for this buffet i was quite satisfied with the added storage for my little Polly Pocket size house.", 
    "A good price and well design furniture. The installation instruction is clear. It will not take long to install it if you read carefully the installation instruction.Very sturdy set. The size is just perfect for me. Overall, I love it", 
    "I have been looking for a buffet or cabinet to store my spare pots n pans and cookbooks, but wanted it to blend well with my dining furniture and living room. This cabinet meshed well and isn't too big to get in the way. I'm very satisfied! :)", 
    "The product looks good but is very poor quality. While putting together realized how cheap material is. Every time I open the doors i am afraid they will break apart......Suggest spend a little more money for a sturdier product"
