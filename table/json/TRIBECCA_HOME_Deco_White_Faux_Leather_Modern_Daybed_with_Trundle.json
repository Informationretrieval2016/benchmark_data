    "To be clear, this product comes with zero mattresses. NO mattresses included. To complete the setup, you will need to purchase two mattresses. The daybed cavity (into which you drop a mattress) is 77 inches; too short for a twin XL matteress, but two inches longer than a twin mattress, so you end up with an inch gap on either end of the mattress once centered. The slats provided with the daybed seemed a little weak, so I added a 3/8 inch plywood bed board for extra support. The slats alone would probably be sufficient for a small child, but for rambunctious kids or adults, the extra board may be necessary. The trundle bed exactly fits a regular twin mattress. I purchased 7-inch memory foam mattresses from Overstock, and the trundle still has an inch or so of additional clearance under the daybed with that mattress, I did not add an additional bed board in the trundle. One of the steel brackets used to assemble the sides was incorrectly milled, so I had to take it to a local small engine repair shop to use their industrial drill press as I didn't have time to work it through customer service for a new part. Overall the assembled piece looks nice and functions exactly as I want it to.", 
    "I am a Family Therapist I was the Director of Family Treatment**in ** NY I find it so Sad when I purchase something of poor qualliy.....In my case I saw this bed in a client's Home. I fell in love with it! I Wish I purchased this Bed a year ago! It appears the quality in Materials has Plumetted! Your products are usually of Higher Quality... Sincerely Mary A.J. S.", 
    "We got this for our guest room and every other weekend kids.... It is great for both - I just change the bedding and voila! Fun for the kids to have some extra space for playtime when the trundle is stowed. My only complaint is the space between the wall and the top \"bunk\" if you have smaller children they should go on the trundle pullout as there is a rather large gap on the top.", 
    "Product was easy to assembly. Once together it looks good. Ours had a section that had a tear. I was told it is now discontinued and they could not replace the damaged part. I already had it put together and did not want to take it apart and then repack it into the three boxes it came and ship it back, so they gave me a small credit. It does look good and hopefully the rip will not get bigger.", 
    "I ordered this piece for my home office/guest bedroom. My room is 11x11 and its fits well in the room with a small side table, computer desk, printer table, and oversized chair with ottoman. The daybed is bed it functions more as an oversized couch for me. I'm using a twin mattress but an twin XL will fit for sure. Its easy to clean. The trundle rolls but only front and back, thinking of exchanging the wheels for casters for a little more freedom with movement. It best to assemble in the room you plan on using it in (lesson learned), but the assemble is easy. I added tons of accent pillows and had a custom bed cover made for the mattress. I love it. After all I do my best work when I am sleep :-)!!!", 
    "We have a very small guest bedroom in our house, and we had trouble finding something that would fit our space and the style of our furniture. This fit the bill perfectly, and it looks fantastic in our dark gray room. The construction is solid and the assembly was fairly easy-- it will wobble if you don't tighten the pieces enough and it's easier to tighten if there are two of you working together so that the first person can hold it perfectly in place while the second tightens. Assembly was quick, and this has held up well in a room that is frequented by children. One thing to note-- we found that the height of the piece in the description did not take into account the slightly rounded back, so it is actually a tiny bit taller than described.", 
    "The only difference I noted from the picture was in its proportional size to the room. This is a large kind of imposing piece of furniture. It is not just a little daybed. There are pretty big spaces between the mattress and the sides and back of the \"sofa\" making the overall structure much larger than I expected. Still, it does fit in my small room and wlil provide good extra sleeping space.", 
    "IT'S DEEP, EASY TO CLEAN VINYL, ACCURATE SIZING PROVIDED ON DESCRIPTION. GOT SOME COMFORTABLE MATTRESS FROM WALMART, EXCELLENT EXTRA BED (S) - CONTEMPORARY DESIGN. GREAT PURCHASE.", 
    "Slightly larger than I expected, but it looks beautiful. Works great for company.", 
    "I purchased this daybed a few months ago after searching other sites. I love it. I have it in my spare bedroom that my grandkids share. The daybed is not off-white but is a really bright white. The daybed is also bigger than it look so if you are putting it in a small room you may want to go with a bed that is smaller. This daybed was easy to put together by myself byt did take about 45 mins. I was also missing a few pieces which Overstock sent but it did take a week to get them.", 
    "Would buy again. Very nice and easy to assemble. Exactly as pictured. Brought it for my beach house and it looks great.", 
    "I was lead to believe it came with the top mattress so I only ordered one. When it arrived I had to find one locally to buy. Had it been clear, I would have ordered 2 from overstock.", 
    "This bed is awesome. Bought it for our daughter and its perfect for sleep over with friends. Quality and construction is wonderful. It is little oversized but again great for sleepovers and our daughter is very proud of her bed and bedroom.", 
    "my only complaint is that it was apparently a floor model that was not disclosed", 
    "This daybed is terrific. The assembly takes a while but is easy. The finished product looks great. It is huge. I would not say it is good for a small room.", 
    "The first bed sent to us had so many flaws in the \"leather\" seams that I contacted customer service. A new bed was sent, and between the two we were able to get one decent bed. My daughter loves the style and it has held up well over the last year.", 
    "Larger than life, but very nice.", 
    "Great value! Perfect for a small room!", 
    "I like the look of this daybed. It is subtle and doubles as a couch. The quality is not excellent, however, it is good for the price. There is an open back on the bed that is not shown in the picture. Pillows cover the gab...but hardly noticeable with pillows.", 
    "It took my daughter and I two hours to put it together; the instructions are very clear. It is big and bulky so is not for a tiny space, but it fits our needs perfectly.", 
    "Great bed for guestroom. This bed will not support heavy people though it is wobbly when both my husband and I lay in it which we are together about 390lbs. Would be great for a teenager room too", 
    "Enjoy the clean look of the Sofa Bed. Bottom Trundle slides under and looks as one piece unit. Although the rollers need some locks to stabilize during use but some blocks kept near the wheels kept it from moving.", 
    "I put this in my sewing room in case we need an extra bed for guests. Step sons slept on it and said it was very comfortable!!", 
    "This turned out to be perfect in my studio apartment. Space is a premium and I was looking for something that could function as a high quality sofa during the day and a bed by night. Was very pleased with how this worked out. Also love the color as its complements the rest of my light bright decor.", 
    "I really love this daybed. It has a touch of sofistication.", 
    "This bed came on time and in good condition. My husband and I put it together in about 45 min ( it would have taken less time but we were watching the cat explore the boxes. the only complaint was that the slates to hold up the mattress in a couple spots was a little too narrow so we had to carefully drill them at the edge. But otherwise it was beautiful. We have had many compliments on the bed. It is in my office/guest room so I sit on it sometime and watch tv and it holds up great. We didn't have to use the trundle this holiday but it is nice to know we have that extra bed hidden away. Love it and would order it again and again if I had another room to put it in.", 
    "The picture is so, so misleading. The product arrived and required assembling. Which was fine. But, Its only a skeletin. No cushion to sit on and no mattress to go under the bed. I understand no pillow. But, no cushion to sit on? Its insane who would be this product at that price and what you are getting...Honestly, I called so many times to explain. Intitially I was told, oh, sorry, the cushion to sit on was not sent, and we'll send it to you in two days..A week later, no cushion, nothing. I called again, and someone else answer, and been told, oh, no..no...Nothing has shipped and now, Im told, the couch, as in couch, comes with nothing..Just a frame and need to order everything. And no cushions gets sold, so, you have to put a mattress to sit on to use it as a couch. Really? I mean, a whole month and finally after hours and hours. Got frustrated and never, ever, again would buy anything from overstock..My first and last order, ever!", 
    "this bed was very cozy and spacious.I am highly satisfied that it saves space in my room and the color is beautiful. I highly recommend this bed.", 
    "All is great with this bed. Trundle pulls out smoothly and easily, not too difficult to put together, and I love the feel of the vinyl. ONLY ISSUE is that although I was told prior to purchase that there is no gap in the backing of the bed as seen in one of the pictures, THERE IS A GAP. Which is to say that if you don't put lots of pillows back there, you're going to see the wall behind the bed. Not a big deal for us, but I could see how it could bother some.", 
    "Great bed, bought for my 14 yr old granddaughter . She loves it. Gave the room the right style she was looking for. It is larger then it appears to be, but still fit the room. Was not too difficult to put together, easy directions. We were nervous about buying furniture without trying it first but we are so glad we did. Delivery was great and on time.", 
    "Easy to build, good size, I have a studio and it fixs fine.", 
    "Photo looks more quality. Sort of cheap looking and side received a large scratch when we tried picking it up and my finger nails scratched the fake leather when my fingers slipped on grasp. Screws for the second portion were missing so Overstock refunded me $20 to buy my own at the hardware store since I had the assemble directions. There are two boxes arriving for the trundle and the other the bed. Too complicated to put together and the screws I had to purchase were over $20 bucks Overstock refunded me for. I paid $33. Product is made in China and not worth the over $400 I paid. Worth about $150. Mattress does not come with it so you are only paying for the frame.", 
    "I had a heck of a time assembling this item as holes didn't line up and the trundle piece really wasn't sturdy. After it was assembled it looked great. I bought this for a guest bedroom for family for Thanksgiving. I slept in it a couple of times to check it out and it was very comfortable. Then my father in law slept in it (not the trundle, the top part) and it broke on the third night. Not the horizontal slats but the side structure wrapped by the leather. I don't understand at all how it could have broken - it is completely twisted and irreparable. He is not an unusually heavy or big man. Very poorly made.", 
    "Great piece and easy to assemble, arrived in a timely manner, was not damaged in shipping, gives room a modern look and sleeps two adults in comfort", 
    "The daybed is exactly as it is pictured online. It is stylish and nicely made. It looks like real leather and was assembled quickly and without any issues. Shipping was fast and updates provided.", 
    "I assembled this by myself with ease and it took me about 90 minutes. It was packed well with parts in a logical order to aid in ease of assembly. I'm very happy with my new daybed.", 
    "I purchased this bed for my 5year old, all of her furniture is a bright white so when purchasing this bed I was a little hesitant because it seems to be off white looking online. But I was very happy when I opened the box to see that it is a very bright white! It was very easy to put together, all but one screw lined up, and it seems very sturdy and well built. The only down fall is the trundle is a little wobbly(not level) but it fits under the bed just fine and looks great! I can't wait for my daughter to be able to use it and plenty of sleep overs!!!", 
    "Just not the quality I have come to expect from Ocerstock.com"
