    "In reading the summary of this \"deluxe posture chair\", I thought it would be more than just a task chair. It wasn't. It was pretty much the most basic task chair to be found and I really missed having a spring-tension back and height adjustment on the back of the chair. The cushioning is also very sparse and the the chair pads seem smaller than my ordinary ten-year-old task chair that I found at an office supply store. So, this one is ordinary, very average, and not notably comfortable. Although I appreciate a good executive chair for conference rooms, I like a solid task chair for computer work -- it absolutely has to have a separate back and seat, and lumbar support. This chair meets my basic criteria, and the fabric looks durable. However, if I were to do it again, I'd be more careful to read the fine print and get a chair with adjustable height on the back and adjustable tension/swing. This one pretty much just sits there upright, with no tilt, swing or height adjustment except for the standard seat height pneumatic control.", 
    "solid chair, good feel, gives a good postural support, I use it a lot for teaching, good buy as well", 
    "Got this for an area in a bedroom with not much room. It is a well padded chair and takes up little space. Used everyday and it's holding up well.", 
    "I bought one for myself and then two more for the kids since they love it too. Very easy to assemble, took 10-15 min, only need a screw driver.", 
    "Very suitable inexpensive office chair. Simple and workable for occasional use. Well padded. Only height adjustment without back adjustment or seat tilt adjustment but for occasional use and for the price this is a very good chair.", 
    "I needed a comfortable chair for a few hours/day of computer work... this chair totally filled the bill, plus!! it's stylish and enhances my decor.", 
    "Screws for the bottom of the chair weren't fully tapped couldn't get them to go all the way in", 
    "A comfortable desk chair, smallish and compact, but as represented and just what I needed. For the price, a good buy. A little difficulty in putting some of it together. Directions could be a little more detailed.", 
    "Relatively easy to assemble and all parts were there with the directions. I love the fabric and the color and the seat fits quite well. I have only had it a month so I do not know how it will wear, but I do not sit in it all day every day. It does have a little \"pop\" whenever I sit down which may be the way I put it together or it could be a design problem. That is why I took one star off. However, I am very satisfied with the chair.", 
    "I needed an armless chair that would give me adequate support while working from home. This chair provided that. The seat and back are both very sturdy. I didn't want to invest a huge sum of money and the cost of this item fit the bill. Thanks Overstock for offering this item.", 
    "I bought 3 of these chairs and all of them are fantastic. They went together without any problems, they are durable and comfortable to use. Since I teach sewing I am going to be buying more of these very shortly. For the money spent on these chairs, you actually get chairs that feel as if they cost much more. VERY happy!", 
    "This is a great quality chair for the price. You don't get all of the bells and whistles that come with the $100 chairs, but for price range, this chair is the way to go. The seat and back are sturdy and made of good quality materials. The automatic height adjustment works very well, but the back doesn't adjust very easily. Assembly was very quick and easy - less than 10 minutes. This chair is definitely better quality than the ones advertised as for \"students\" and is perfect for a home office.", 
    "This was at first a little confusing to assemble. Instructions were not the greatest. For my needs this is a great product.", 
    "This chair is durable and sturdy. After a few months, I started to feel a screw or something poking me in the butt sometimes. Nearly two years later, though, it's still going strong.", 
    "bought for our sons room. love it, assembly was super easy.", 
    "Overall a nice little chair, looks good, easy to put together, just needs a bit more padding on the seat", 
    "This chair was purchased for my new sewing room and it's the perfect height and SO comfortable. I have lower back problems and the chair back gives me great support. Another terrific purchase from Overstock.com!", 
    "This chair has a great extension range. It goes up to a nice height", 
    "this is a wonderful way to work at your computer or office desk. It is soooo comfortable and helps me with my posture. I bought the gray one and it complements my black & walnut desk as well as my gray carpetingg in my office. I love it!!", 
    "If you're looking for a desk chair with a little but of pattern in the fabric, this one is for you. The fabric dresses up what would otherwise be a fairly standard piece of furniture. Padding is good and seating is comfortable.", 
    "Ordered it, received it promptly, easy to put together, great quality!", 
    "The online photo did not give an accurate view of the fabric on the chair. But it is high quality and I like it.", 
    "but it does the job. did not want a chair with arms and the price was right. It still is comfortable enough so I can sit and do my job and also adjusts so I can move it to my sewing table also.", 
    "Love my chair, perfect for desk built into the wall.", 
    "Using the chair everyday and have no problems. Easy to assemble and color is great.", 
    "Seems good for now, just got it. Looks fine. More my size than the larger chairs.", 
    "Brought it for wife she is happy with it", 
    "I'm sitting in this chair as I write this review and am very pleased with this item. It's small scale is perfect for an all purpose room that I prefer not to look like an office. It's a lovely subdued shade of red and, most important, it is comfortable!", 
    "A comfortable chair but the knob that holds the back on strips easily. Its made of plastic and the threads dont hold.", 
    "We love the color and fabric. It has ample thickness to the cushions and good support for the back, and is easy to adjust the height.", 
    "I would have to look quite a while to find a better chair for the price", 
    "Amazing. .comfortable. and true colors as on line .ordered the royal blue and couldn't be more pleased", 
    "Only four stars for a chair with no arms. Works for my purpose and am happy with. Very easy to put together!", 
    "The specs reflected that this was assembled item but when I received it was unassembled.", 
    "I work at my computer all day so this chair was a long time coming! Good lumbar support, firm, thick seat pad.", 
    "Not a lot of cushioning in chair seat. It is sturdy and has held up OK.", 
    "Nice chair, I would order again.", 
    "Not bad, but definitely not for sitting hours at a time. The chair is cheap and feels even cheaper. Great for short uses and easy to move around from one room to another. Very light and portable, unless most office charis!", 
    "I bought 36 of these chairs for school. They look nice and the kids really like rolling around in them. They do need to be tightened every month or the back begins to loosen.", 
    "For the price, the choice of colors, quick shipping, this is a good value. It arrived packaged nicely, undamaged, put together quickly. It's a very good chair for an averaged sized person. If you are very tall or weigh more than average, I might go for a bigger, sturdier chair. But for average height, weight and usage, this is perfect for a home office.", 
    "We have to make the guest bedroom, also usable as an \"office space\" with a small desk. This task chair gave us the smallness we needed and the fabric seat cover made it more \"homey\". Great value; just what we needed!", 
    "Chair was easy to put together and is comfy, perfect height for the desk", 
    "While this chair is sturdy and a nice color, it becomes uncomfortable after sitting in for any time over a hour. I really like a comfortable chair since I do lots of work at the computer. I am going to buy a cushion to put on the seat.", 
    "This chair has met all my expectations.High quality Great price and very comfortable", 
    "I needed a small chair for use at my sewing machine. It was easy to put together, but I should add that at first I thought the pneumatic raise/lower of the seat didn't work. You just have to lift up really hard on the handle. It works fine now, and is much better for my back than a regular chair. Casters seem to be working fine, too, but I've only had it for two weeks.", 
    "I ordered these chairs for a conference room. They were just what I was looking for at a much reduced rate! Shipping was quick!", 
    "I have had the chair for almost a month, so far so good.", 
    "This chair was super easy to assemble, didn't require much time. The chair serves its purpose, tho if I sit on it too long it doesn't have great back support. Overall I can't complain for the price I paid.", 
    "It is about what I expected for the cost..........", 
    "This chair is better than I was expecting! Very comfortable, very good quality, feels great on my back. Very nice fabric.", 
    "Fast delivery. Easy to assemble. The seat is firm and contoured; my butt fit snugly. I'm 5'2\" and the height is good with the table I bought from this site. I can swivel easily. I wish I got the chair with the arm rests!", 
    "I just wanted a basic computer chair. This is not supper \"cushy;\" therefore, it's comfortable for only a couple of hours. All in all, it's worth the money.", 
    "Everything I was looking for in a computer chair. Great back support, comfortable seat, compact size, plush, great with the decor - I got red, excellent price. So glad I got this chair! Will definitely order this again.", 
    "happy great buy very good shopping with you ,best deal", 
    "The product was exactly what I expected, the fast shipping was a great surprise, and the price was the best I could find.", 
    "I looked in three or four stores, Staples, etc for the right chair for my office and \"O\" was the only place I found exactly what I was looking for. thanks!", 
    "great chair for the price, company easy to work with and very,very nice and helpfull. Know their products", 
    "For the smaller home office, this is a great little chair. I wouldn't recommend if for folks that weigh 250 or more, but there are plenty of other chairs on the market that are designed for larger people. I actually bought this for my mother as a Christmas gift. She didn't have a desk chair in her office and her ladder back chair was awful! Now, she can actually spend some real time on her computer without having leg and back problems. I think I have a similar chair in my sewing room and I love it. You cannot beat the price. I looked all over the internet and Overstock absolutely had the best price. I would recommend this without hesitation to people in the normal height and weight ranges.", 
    "Good basic desk chair, easy to assemble. Got this for my teenagers and it should last quite a few years.", 
    "I love the burgundy color, easy to put together and very comfortable!", 
    "Excellent chair and met all my expectations. Easy assembly and works perfectly with my desk.", 
    "Great students chair for my daughter! The seat will be uncomfortable if you are a larger framed person.", 
    "Had my home office chair, same type as this one, for 25 years. Hopefully, this one will last as long :) Very comfortable and adjustable.", 
    "I'm very pleased with this chair. Very comfortable and good looking.", 
    "Great product, nice material, great value! Easy to assemble!", 
    "Excellent easy to assemble 5-10 minutes strong sturdy can work on a kitchen counter ( wash dishes in a sink from a sitting position). Strong fabric well built.My room mate is in a wheelchair these are perfect.", 
    "This chair was a good purchase for the money, sturdy and good quality.", 
    "I bought two of these for my desk (has two openings). Love them. Very comfortable and look great!", 
    "easy to assemble, rolls and swivels well but don't try to pick it up by just the seat once it is assembled. it's held together by gravity", 
    "I am very happy with the purchase, and have no complaints. I feel I paid a just price for a good product. I use it every day. It was also easy to assemble.", 
    "This chair is perfect for our needs at the desk, and looks great as an additional piece of furniture. The process of buying the chair was incredibly simple and easy and was shipped directly to us within 3 days. I have been impressed and extremely pleased with the product and the process.", 
    "Durable and easy to assemble. Color was a little different than I expected but a good chair nonetheless.", 
    "I wasn't sure if I liked it at first because felt so different from the one I was accustomed to using. Now, after a few weeks, I LOVE IT!!!", 
    "The two chairs I ordered arrived quickly, were easy to assemble, are made from nice quality fabric and are comfortable. I expected far less considering the price. The blue chairs are actually a tweed pattern with a weave made up of deep purple, sky blue and black, which was not apparent in the images on the website. Great deal on a good chair.", 
    "This chair was easy to assemble, and is a very nice basic office chair, great for use at my home computer. I am pleased with the material used, and the chair is comfortable. Great deal!", 
    "Purchased this chair for my 82 year old Mother to use as a sewing chair. She is only 5 ft. tall and needed a comfortable chair that would adjust up to a comfortable height to sew. The chair easily adjusted to her confortable working height. Chair covering is nice quality and chair was easy to assemple for an 82 year old.", 
    "I love this chair. It is very comfortable and good for my back. It's black which matches my computer. I received it quickly and in super condition. Thanks so much", 
    "All I wanted was a chair, plain and simple. This one is great for the price and looks good.", 
    "Chair was easy to assemble, it is firm and extremely comfortable seems sturdy", 
    "Nothing fancy schmancy about this chair but it suits my needs and doesn't take up a lot of room. It was very easy to assemble and is comfortable. The back of the seat supports my back exactly where I need it. Overall, I'd say it's a perfectly fine chair.", 
    "This chair arrived quickly and had all the features as described and desired. The 5 wheel base is superior to 4 wheel for steadiness and comfort. Gliding is smooth. Comfort and back support is great. Good quality.", 
    "We are very pleased with this chair. It is comfortable and attractive. It raises to a bit higher level than other chairs we have purchased for the office which is helpful at our front desk. It was shipped in a much shorter time than expected as well.", 
    "Chair was easy to assemble, attractive, cimfortable and exactly as pictured. It works wonderfully in my son's room!", 
    "I love my new office chair. It was easy to put together. I have another more expensive chair with more adjustments but this chair is just as comfortable to sit in.", 
    "Great chair for value, ease of assembly and delivery. Easy, comfortable basic office chair. Looks great. Delivery was immediate.", 
    "I've been using this chair for a couple of weeks. Great lumbar support! Sturdy and fabric quality is excellent! Very good product and a great value. Husband bought the drafting version of this chair and loves his also. I'm short and this chair fits me very well. My husband is tall and loves his drafting version. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "received the chair on time. It works fine in front of my daughter desk in her room.", 
    "Comfortable. 13 year old son put it together without any difficulty.", 
    "I really like my new chair. It is not a real overly cushy chair - but it is perfect for me. I like that it has a nice big seat. It was VERY easy to put together. For the price this is a great deal.", 
    "I got the chair with not complete the part so I did contact to customer service and I get in another week. The seat is not big so if your weight is not normal don't order this chair.", 
    "What's pictured is solid colored chairs. What I received was a black/blue hounds tooth sort of thing chair. Also, the chair is not very comfortable at all. Maybe that's why it's an overstock. Oh, here's a thought...What about not making ME review the thing I just bought, but have someone at Overstock.com review the thing and give me a better description so I know what I am getting BEFORE I buy it. Word to the wise: Don't buy furniture online."
