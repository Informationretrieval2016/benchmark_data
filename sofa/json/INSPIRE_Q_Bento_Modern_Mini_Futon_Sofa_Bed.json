    "Perfect couch for son in his basement lounge, he is 12. It wipes off easily and is low sitting, perfect for the lounge/gamer room he has going on. The bottom where the back would sit one is made of a thin black lining (like the kind you would see under a boxspring) and he stepped through that the 1st day when he climbed over the top to get onto it instead of going around like a normal person. I stapled a heaver weight fabric on there (just like the other fabric is attached) and it seems to be holding up to even him. The seat back held up to him and his friends wrestling on it and hasn't broken, so that in itself should say it all. It is very comfortable to sleep on as well, something I have experienced 1st hand. The cats dug thier claws into the vinyl seat the 1st day I got it and left little pin holds but they are barely noticeable because the underlying fabric is off white all the way through. So in short, if this little sofa/futon can stand up to my family, it would be wonderful for anyone elses.", 
    "I was hesitant to order this futon at the time as it had not been reviewed yet but when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised. I was actually glad that the color was not truly white, as my office is beige, black and purple and it matches perfectly. I agree that this belongs in a smaller space and it is low to the ground but it is perfect for me and I like the firmness of the cushion. If you plan on using it as a bed however you should know that it is not suited for a tall person. I am 5'2'' and I fit comfortably but if you are over 5'7\" you likely will not be too comfortable. Overall I am glad I made the purchase and the assembly is so easy (you only have to twist on the legs).", 
    "So I took the plunge and ordered this futon after reading the only review available at the time. I guess you do get what you pay for even from Overstock! I recommend you check the dimensions because it definitely is small, with a low back and quite low to the ground. We want it for extra seating in our daughter's bedroom in front of the TV and for that it works fine. Would not recommend for a living room but maybe a small den or sun room. Ordinary end tables would be way too tall for this futon. It is definitely more a light beige color rather than even off white, I would say. Also, the back of it is black felt-like cloth and my husband accidentally put his finger right through it when unpacking the box. So be REALLY careful when you unpack it. If you have it sitting against a wall the black back won't show but we have it in the middle of the room so we have to deal with that too. On the plus side, it seems comfortable to sit on and the back has 2 different positions, one straight and one more reclined. In summary, we will be keeping and using it and I hope it holds up well for the price.", 
    "This futon only sits 6-12\" off the ground. It's not workable except for children and umpa loompas.", 
    "The size of this sofa is perfect for the 2nd bedroom in my NYC apartment. Also, the assembly was pretty straightforward. The overall quality of the product, however, is absolutely horrendous. The stitching is generally irregular, and they missed some stitches altogether--which causes the sofa to look cheap or even defective. If I could, I would post photos to show you how bad it is! Also, clearly, it has not been produced with much care, and nobody inspected it before shipping it--as there are threads hanging out from everywhere and the mattress doesn't really fold right (it creates a lump on the right hand side when upright). The color, too, is a bit weird. It is beige, yes, but it has a strange green tint to it, making it look like a hospital sofa. All in all, I regret having purchased this but, frankly, it is too much trouble to ship it back.", 
    "Well, it's about what I paid for. A bit bigger than I'd thought, having read the reviews. Measure your space. It's heavy - 54 pounds, I believe, so if you want some little portable thing, this might not be it. The color is accurate with my computer screen, but get it in normal light (not the glamour light of the catalogue), and it kind of looks like a car seat. The backing is that cheapie almost paperish black, so it won't look good in the center of the room as pictured. Also, the legs are plastic and hollow and one of mine came severely chipped. But it serves as a futon - not squishy soft but not horribly uncomfortable. Might slide under the bed with the legs off to store for a pretty firm cot. It's not terrible and kind of cute.", 
    "I bought this for occasional use. Its is literally falling part...Not only are the seat coils not holding up but a lot of the seams are ripping and coming apart. The sofa is VERY small if you are 5ft you can sleep on it other than that no one can fit comfortably. I would not recommend anyone purchase this; it is a WASTE of money, not I have to buy something else.", 
    "The description says its white but it is more like a light biege color. But overall, its a little small but comfortable. Don't put it in a large room or it will look lost. We do like the look of the button tucks, but for the most part, it's not what we expected. Just really wanted white.", 
    "Nice futon. Works great for my home office and as a spare bed. Assembly was as easy as it gets. Only problem was the legs are hard plastic and on delivery one of them was broken. The leg was still usable and I just faced the broken part towards the inside instead of facing out.. so it looks ok..just disapointed it was broken.", 
    "It's a prefect couch for a small room. Not ideal to sleep on if you're even average height. Wish that O.co would've offered a matching ottoman.", 
    "In reading the reviews of this futon prior to purchasing it, I had awareness that it was not 'fullsize'...not, perhaps suitable for a full-sized adult to use as a place to sleep. I had awareness that it sits lower than some would prefer. My purpose for the purchase of this futon was, although likely not completely unique, also not typical. The need I hoped to meet was having a comfortable raised sleeping space to accommodate a Labrador, Great Dane and Golden Retriever that prefer to cuddle together into one bed....and not have them join the humans in their bed. This products has a faux leather exterior that makes it easy to clean, is relatively durable and creates a comfortable platform, when flattened, that is large enough for all three of my K-9 friends. I would agree with previous reviews that I read that if I was not using it for my pooches, it would be a perfect size for a youth-sized couch. I'm very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I recommend this sofa bed as a fashionable furniture piece for an office when you also need a bed. I agree with other people that it's not good for very, very tall people, but it works for average height people. It is well made and I love the contemporary style.", 
    "The back of this couch is black and ugly. It doesn't show that in any of the pictures. So it's fine when it is laid down or next to a wall but that was not my intention for it.It also doesn't seem very stable. I'm not sure I would recommend 3 people sitting on it and leaning back while it is in the upright position. You definitely get what you pay for. But it was really cheap, so I guess for the money it isn't that bad.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised with this futon for the price. It was very easy to assemble, just screw on the legs, and very easy to adjust the back to make it a bed. I think it is a small bed but it works for its' purpose.", 
    "It's small for you to sleep on if you're taller than 5'2\". It is comfortable for a couple of nights, but then you can really start feeling the wood frame in the middle of it. It's a good price and it looks great in my small studio apartment.", 
    "Total junk... I think this will break in just 15 minutes of use. The \"faux leather\" is paper thin, and feels like a plastic trash bag. The frame is flimsy, and the legs are hollow plastic. One leg actually broke as soon as a guest (thin woman) sat on it. I am using this on my balcony as a day bed. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Overall, I feel that the quality of overstock in general has greatly slipped, which is really too bad... I used to order a lot from them, but will definitely not order anymore, as recently, everything I have ordered has been of the poorest quality. Overstock... Please here this, and start stocking quality items again. Please!", 
    "I bought the product for the kids to lounge on while watching TV, so they won't lounge on my cream leather sofa. Ihad to put it in a dark corner to try and blend i in. The firmness is okay, but it really sits low to the ground. O.co compensated for my disappointment when I called Customer Service. So I'm a \"Happy Camper\" again. Love my O.co finds.", 
    "that I was never able to sit or lie down for more than 15 mins.", 
    "Uncomfortable, and didn't last. The seams came apart within a month. It was too hard to sit on. Not worth the money, would not buy again or recommend.", 
    "Too hard and low to the ground. Returned immediately.", 
    "length to short, purchase for guest room sleeping accommodation, but only a small child would be able to sleep on. Sofa is firm.", 
    "For looks only. strings hanging from stitching and could feel the springs the first time I sat on it. do not buy.", 
    "got this for teens tv room and it looks good and folds up and down easy, 3 settings. firm to sleep on but all futons are!", 
    "The color is good but the structure was not strong.", 
    "We were looking for a small futon for our office. It fits well in the space we have. It's not very comfortable for sleeping, but since it will not be used for that often it works for us.", 
    "It feel like **** ani It smell like ****.", 
    "I'd say I got what a paid for. It came on time, looks stylish, and was easy to assemble. I already have a couch I use regularly but wanted something guests could sleep on. I rarely use it, which means it'll last a while. I doubt it's of a quality that could withstand habitual use.", 
    "This futon is perfect for my 11 year old daughter, but I wouldn't sit on it for long because the legs are not very strong. It was easy to screw the legs on which is hidden in the back zipper. There was a small nick on the side from the transport, but it is hardly noticeable. I love the color and style.", 
    "This mini futon is priced well. I use it in our library sort of as a filler. It is not very comfortable, however it looks amazing. It really brought the room together. I have not slept on it as a futon. It is a good size for a smaller person to sleep on though. I am 5\"2 and could probably sleep on it fine. My fiance sits and plays the guitar on it. It is under **** so you can't expect perfection. I would purchase this again for another room if needed.", 
    "Very pleased with my purchase. it was as described, and looks great.", 
    "This product is extremely lightweight and easy to move. I am using it in my studio where it functions as both a sofa and a bed for short periods of time. It doesn't take up much space and works perfectly for my needs. It does sit a little low to the ground. For my purposes, I screwed bed lifts into the bottom of the legs to approximate a more standard sofa height. The color was a little darker than I anticipated from the photo. It's still a nice color... I was just expecting a lighter shade of beige.", 
    "Cheap price and cheaper quality. I have had this futon for 5 months and it has completely ripped at the seams!! It is horrible quality and I cannot believe it is still being sold. Overstock should be ashamed to sell something of this poor quality. Sure they need to have products available in all price ranges, but it does you no good to buy something inexpensive only to have to replace it within months. It is a waste of your money. It is an good looking futon, which is what sucked me in to buying it even after reading the bad reviews. But from the moment you take it out of the box you will know you got less than what you paid. The netting in the back will rip almost immediately (not a big deal you say, because if you have it against a wall no one will notice). I thought the same thing, but that was a sign of things to come. The legs do not screw on tightly. I was seriously concerned that my puppy would go under the couch, my kids would sit on the couch and it would collapse. Not made well at all. Uncomfortable too! Worst of all, the seams all over the seats started to separate within one month. Now, I do have three kids who sat on this couch. But they sat and played video games. They weren't bouncing and jumping on it (I think they would have popped right through the cushions if they would have done that!!). They just sat on it and the seams all ripped and separated. This couch will be thrown out now, just 5 months after purchase. Do not waste your money.", 
    "This sofa is very small, great for kids room or dorm room, but came with one leg broken and could not be repaired. Replacing it just takes too long.", 
    "First let me say I love Overstock, have been shopping with them for many years, will continue to go to Overstock before looking anywhere else for most items. Read every review and the reviewers that had complaints were generally complaints about features and elements that were not applicable to my needs for the futon. I had measured my area and the size was exactly what I needed. The firmness was not a concern for me. The color was a nice and neutral beige. I did plan on placing against the wall so the cheap ugly material in the back was also to be of no concern to me. What I did not get from the reviews I read was that the actual cover material The \"high quality faux leather\" as the ad stated, was the thinnest and lowest quality faux leather I have ever come across in my life. The furniture did not even make it out of it's original packaging before there were several large areas that the vinyl upholstery actually just rubbed or scuffed off. These were not tears or scrapes but just rubbed off to the super thin white layer under the ridiculously thin faux leather. In calling overstock immediately I concluded that this must be a bad batch of fabric since this issue was only a recent complaint to them about this particular item. Of course the Overstock customer service took care of me fully as they rock like no other customer service I have ever encountered. They always take the greatest care of their customers. I would wait a good while before considering purchasing this piece. Hopefully the manufacturer will get a better batch of material in for future construction or will change the covering to a completely different fabric. If the material had been better I think this would have been a great little piece.", 
    "small sofa and almost as painful to sit on as it is to try to sleep on. awful color and awful fake leather", 
    "The sofa is really small, I would say childlike. I was thinking of using as a spare bed for adult, but ended using it for my grandson.", 
    "Do Not buy this unless you are buying it for a child. they should stand someone next to it in the picture.", 
    "Upon arrival, I was totally disappointed with the look of this item. It was not what we saw and expected to receive. The item has no body to it; it is rather flat with no cushion to it. The color was like a dirty cream with coffee stain. I would not recommend this item to anyone else. Also, returning this item, I, the Buyer had to pay for shipping and all; something I was rather unhappy with. Two thumbs down....", 
    "This futon was of very poor quality. The legs were plastic and one was broken upon arrival. The Faux leather was so cheap it looked like something that had come out of a 50's diner. The seams came apart within 1 week. I decided to keep it just to avoid the hassle", 
    "Looks extremely cheap with the back of black fabric. Flimsy, low grade, awefull", 
    "Okay, first it arrived without legs or hardware to install legs. It is an okay piece but not worth the money. Pay another hundred bucks and buy a real couch.", 
    "Not happy with this purchase way too small! Wish I had not ordered this one.", 
    "I will never use your site , never recommand it , Uncomfortable , very short legs it\u0092s just bad sofa.", 
    "Just received the sofa/futon and it is very nice looking and serves its. Intended purpose. Very EZ to unpack..No assembly required but to add the feet!. Thank you.", 
    "It was good until my son jumped on it.", 
    "This is a great couch. So cheap. Don't expect Ethan Allen but it served my purpose. Guests slept in it and we're happy. It looks the part. It is a low couch.", 
    "Packaging was perfect. Easy to open and easy to assemble. NOT a mini couch! Will seat 3 normal weight people. If none of my uninvited guests weigh 400 pounds, will be perfect bed. Price was right. Thank you!!!!", 
    "Ok for a showpiece. Not very sturdy.", 
    "Bought this for my beach porch. Perfect small size, no worries if it gets wet, extra space for guests. Color is deeper than I imagined. It is almost a light greenish taupe. Love it!", 
    "this sofa was comfortable for about a minute. To lay on it was ok, but i needed it 95% to be used as sofa. About after a month, i could start to see my 'behind' dent on the side that i was sitting. After a couple of months, i could feel the metal springs/construction. Terrible. Also, its a faux leather, which is fine if it would've lasted. But as its paper thin, became all cracked until some of it even flacked off. Just a terrible product. I have purchased MANY items from the O, & never been dissatisfied. If I could get my money back - that would be a Merry Christmas!", 
    "Pretty to look at it, however terrible quality. The legs broke after a month and it is super uncomfy and causes back pain. Would not recommend this if you plan to use it everyday.", 
    "Perfect for guest room especially for smaller person. Looks just like picture and easy to convert.", 
    "Have not used as a bed yet. However, its awful to sit on because you can feel the boards on your back side and is very uncomfortable to sit on. Can only imagine what it would be like to sleep on.", 
    "Not comfortable to sit for a long period.", 
    "awesome steal !! light and easy to move/ wipes cleanthe back of it did rip but.. whateves", 
    "returned- appears different then actual Item", 
    "This sofa seemed right compact, opens out for a bed, modern and affordable. However, it is much small than it seems once its in front of you and it is not comfortable at all. My cat doesn't even want to sleep on it! Probably good as an accent piece or a completely cosmetic buy.", 
    "Let's start with the color; beige? Hardly! It isn't comfortable. It is as hard as a rock. I bought it for my extra bedroom and no one wants to sleep on it.", 
    "Very uncomfortable. I tried adding a 4\" memory foam topper when it's used as a bed and I could still feel the \"lumps.\" I can't imagine anyone sleeping on it, except for \"maybe\" a child. Too expensive to send back.", 
    "for small places it is the choice, fragile but nice", 
    "I'm so glad I ordered this futon. Easy to operate and perfect for kids playing video games, hanging out or an unexpected overnight by a friend. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Thank you, Overstock.", 
    "My great grandaughter feels so grownup with a couch in her room and has had several friends who slept overnight for her birthday.", 
    "Just like in the picture. Very sturdy and well made. Perfect for a studio or small apartment.", 
    "looks great but weak workmanship.", 
    "For the price, an excellent buy. Sits well but sleeps kinda terrible; needs more cushioning for sleeping. It's a very useable piece of furniture, again, for the price, and it sits great, but you will need to put perhaps a twin mattress on top to sleep comfortably; it's hard.", 
    "This is the 2nd mini futon that I purchased and it is well worth the money. I think it is good quality and very sturdy. I put a memory foam topper on it and used it for a guest bed. Very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Great price, awesome futon!", 
    "Firm, durable looks good. If UPS did NOT leave it in my apartment lobby it would have been GREAT. Driver said it wouldn't fit in the elevator. I (115 lb 5'3\" female) had no problem getting it in the elevator but was quite a task maneuvering it to my flat.", 
    "I was so very glad I purchased this item it looks very nice in my dining area, Already I have received many compliments and inquires as to where I got it for . again thanks , Also the price was amazing.", 
    "one of the legs were broken when i received the futon", 
    "So flexible, can be a bed or sofa or even a party-time cocktail table. Easy assembly too!", 
    "I ordered a futon to fill in the empty space in my room...was really excited to receive it..it came in a timely manner only thing it wasn't the color i ordered...but actually love it.", 
    "Got two of these one for me and one for my brother in law. They are good for the price. We both put a throw over them so we would not sweat and stick to them. Good construction good material. However one was torn because of the poor shipping container. They need to place a protective shield on both sides of the inside of box. I am asking for a replacement on the one torn or an adjustment. Will let you know what they do.", 
    "Looks good, but is not high quality. With my dogs, will probably last about 1 year", 
    "The only thing I miss is arms, but if you have bolster pillows its fine", 
    "The first thing I noticed was that the color was off. It is not the creamy beige shown in the picture, but more of a cargo pant khaki. It had a small tear, clearly visible. All in all I was disappointed and would not recommend buying this product.", 
    "It's ok, as the other reviewers have said its short. If your other furniture is short as well, it can serve a purpose. However, I will be returning mine due to one of the legs not screwing into the futon", 
    "It's a nice sized futon (not too big) and looks nice in my husband's office. It was easy to put together. It's not the most comfortable couch in the world...I can't review for how it sleeps but sitting on it is not my preference of lounging. Overall, it's good for the price and it is a place to sit.", 
    "Light weight, lovely, easy to use.", 
    "I used this futon as a interim sofa in my living room. This is a great piece and versatile.", 
    "It is a nice piece, but not stong enough for a queen size parent to sleep on. I bought for grandchildern and it works for them.", 
    "This is really more a guest bed that can be used for seating than it is a sofa that can be used as a bed. Read the dimensions before you order. Seat height is quite low so difficult to get up and down if you have bad knees. Otherwise decent for the price. Fabric is nice. Easy to assemble.", 
    "I was not happy with this purchase. The futon was cheap and when it arrive that is still how I think of it but I do have a high expectation for things and do not always read the \"fine print\" so it was much smaller than I expected and just not the quality I expected so guess I got what I paid for. Make sure to completely understand the measurements and quality of what you are purchasing.", 
    "...if that were a futon. It's pretty badass.", 
    "All you need to do is attach the feet! We placed this piece into our sun room for lazy reading and for an extra guest bed. It is very firm, but comfortable enough for a night. It is long enough for an average sized adult to sleep on. The color seems a bit darker than pictured, almost more ash than cream, but works well in our neutral space.", 
    "It's look so good in my bedroom.", 
    "my son wanted this for his room so his friends had a place to sit in his room. He loves it.", 
    "My granddaughter loved it!", 
    "It sits very low to the ground but it's nice for visitors to sit on. I use it more for decor than for function. It leaves lots of wall space above to decorate!", 
    "I'd been searching for an affordable [less than $300.00] non fabric, futon for about 4 months when I came across this one.The price and surface material insipired me to purchase. I'm using it in my small, home based, photo studio. The \"mini\" size is absolutely perfect for the room. If you're considering this futon for sleeping purposed you should know the \"mini\" size is perfect for a child or teen, but definitely NOT an adult because it's smaller than the normal sized futon. The futon is relatively low to the floor which makes it a wee bit difficult for 8 & 9 month expectant moms to initially lie down on; but it's very sturdy and reassuringly stable, so it helps my clients feel completely safe and comfortable. The material looks and feels like leather even though it's not. Cleaning is simple, with an antibacterial wipe. Overall, I would purchase it again and I would recommend others buy it as well. I've included camparitive dimensions below so you don't have to look them up. If you decide to purchase, I'm pretty sure you'll like it as much as I do. Normal sized futon: Sofa dimensions: 71\"L x 22\"D x 31\"HSleeper dimensions: 71\"L x 44\"W x 15\"HTribecca Mini dimensions: Futon sofa dimensions: 67\u0094L x 38.5\u0094W x 31\u0094HFuton bed dimensions: 67\u0094L x 38\u0094W x 12\u0094H", 
    "Though this is very easy to assemble, this is not a bed to sleep in. I bought it for my daughter when she comes home from college. She was not happy about it.", 
    "Don't expect beige..............its more like grey....or an ugly putty color. I was so disappointed with the color. The quality seems great.....one of the legs came damaged and I was supposed to receive this product on a Friday and it came on Monday. So, that's why the average review.", 
    "Best value for price. Would look best near a wall since the back isn't as aesthetically pleasing as the front. The fabric is synthetic, but it is a great cheap solution.", 
    "Very hard when you sit on it,if you use this as a bed and roll over on your side the entire bed will move llke a see saw,very disappointed in this purchase", 
    "If the cost of return wasn't so high I would return it.The Futon looks nice on the picture and before you have to sit on it.Low quality when it comes to comfort and I don't think it will last long if used for anything else except for looking at it.Definitely disappointing buy.", 
    "Perfect for my guest room - very stylish - great purchase!", 
    "Not comfortable and just ok for time being Pic is good but actual look in average and not what I expected after seeing the pic on web", 
    "I purchased this before there were any reviews, so it was a gamble. I bought this for my son's room to use in front of the TV. First thing was the color. Not exactly what I was expecting, more beige than the picture. Second, was the length. It is shorter than I expected and my son is 5'8\", so his legs hang off it when he lays down. That is more my fault as I should have the read the dimension closer. For the first week we liked the sofa, until.....the front leg broke off completely. I don't know how it happened exactly, but am thinking someone sat on the edge. So don't sit on the edge. My husband was just going to MacGyver the leg back on there, but there was literally nothing to attach it to. He would have had to build a whole new frame for it. My son has propped the sofa up on some books and continues to use it, but I am now looking for yet another replacement. I wish I would have spent more for a better quality item the first time. If you are looking for a temp piece of furniture that will not get extensive use, this would probably work. But for a usable piece of furniture, go with something else.", 
    "I'm a 5' 3:\" female that usually has an issue trying to maneuver furniture pieces once they arrive on the front step. But this petite little \"click-clack\" sofa/bed was a breeze for me to shimmy through the front door, get out of the box, put on the feet and set up! I use it as a sofa/guest bed in my 3rd bedroom. The back lowers easily and it makes into a twin size sleeper. BEWARE - It is VERY firm, but I use one of those *** bedrolls on top of it, plus a cushioned mattress pad and it's pretty comfortable. Other reviewers mentioned the thin fabric back that is easily punctured, so I was careful removing it from the box and had no issues. The color is kind of an odd grey/green...but that's the color of the walls in my townhome, so it is perfect.", 
    "Not bad for this price range,will recommend to friends", 
    "This was a perfect little sofa for a hard to fit space in our finished attic room. It's definitely for an informal space. We've had a few people sleep on it and I know it's uncomfortable for that but I think a nice mattress cover will solve that.", 
    "Should've spent an extra *** and got something of better quality. Money I spent on this purchase was much higher then the quality I received.", 
    "We bought this futon for an extra sleeping place in our home office. It was so inexpensive I thought I would give it a try. I think it is priced to match the value. It will work for what I need. It has a super firm top that is comfortable to sit on but a little stiff to sleep on. I had no trouble getting it out of the box and after reading the other reviews I was careful with the black fabric on the backing. I didnt think it was any worse than what is on the bottom or back of lots of furniture. The beige color is a little odd. It does have some green undertones that give it an odd tint. Most of all it looks a little too shiny and the stitching looks like it was done with a large needle so that each stitch hole shows. It is also a bit shorter than most futons but I knew that from the product specs. It looks inexpensive. Overall it will work for me as I didnt want to spend any more than I did but I would not recommend it.", 
    "It looks great but one of the legs gave out during the first week.", 
    "I got this sofa for an extra room. It looks decent. I like firm bed like this sofa but my husband said this product is too firm. I'm a small person(5\"2), so this sofa is big enough when it is used as a bed but It might not be large enough for other people. However, those points are not problems to me, overall I am pretty happy about this product.", 
    "This product is very nice for a den or an office space where when you feel a little tired and want to relax you can just lay down and unwind.", 
    "I bought this for my 9 year olds bedroom. He does not have a big room but it fit perfectly with a queen size bed and two dressers. It is easy to set up and keep clean and great for sleep overs.", 
    "I was looking for something for my spare bedroom/exercise room. It needed to be small like a loveseat, but something I could sleep on if need be. I wanted something with a structured look, too. This futon is just what I needed. It doesn't overwhelm the space, it looks pretty, and I can sleep on it (I am 5 feet tall). The futon is small and is low to the ground. I love this, as I can finally sit on something and my feet reach the floor! In terms of the price and the value of the item, you really cannot beat this deal.", 
    "The sofa is very nice looking. I bought it for my office so it is not for everyday use. It is on the small side as a bed and I'm not sure how comfortable it would be to sleep in, but for occasional use it works perfect and looks great.", 
    "The look is what I expected, beautiful. However, seating very hard making it not as comfortable for an everyday sitting.", 
    "I really like these futons! I ordered two and was very happy!", 
    "This futon was very easy to set up. It is simple and easy on the eyes, looks great with colored throw pillows. I have not layed on it though, so I am not sure how comfortable it is.", 
    "This product is uncomfortably hard and no one wants to sit on it.", 
    "Cute sleeper for the tv room. Love the camel leather.and it is comfortable. Good quality construction", 
    "We needed a small futon for our son's game room. This was just perfect. Install was easy and the size was perfect. Please note that it is small and if you're more than 5'5, this might not work. We don't make our guest sleep on it. It is more for my son's friend as they are small and don't worry too much about comfort. The color and quality is good. It is exactly like the picture.", 
    "Great product for it's price range. Color is slightly darker than expected. The Futon is nice and thick and pretty comfortable. It is a good size when you fold it down into a bed. There is no assembly other than screwing in the legs which was nice. The only down side is the crease that runs through it when you fold it down to a bed. Sleeping on the crease is a bit uncomfortable but I threw a thick comforter over it and that made it much better. Looks great with a couple of throw pillows added to it.", 
    "This futon sits to low to the floor...The legs on it should be at least 12 inches and the futon itself should be 2-4 inches taller to give it more height to sit down on and get up from. My grands love it because it's just their height so I put it in the office for them to play on while I work.", 
    "For the price, it's a great deal. I got it to complement a beige sofa in the livingroom and it fits in well. The setup took less than 5 minutes with just having to take it out of the box and screwing on the 4 legs.", 
    "My daughter like it very much. It looks great and feels comfortable. It is worth its price.", 
    "This is a very cute mini-futon! I really like the leather and it was super easy to install the legs. My only complaint is that one of my legs does not go into the hole straight, but that's because the manufacturers didn't install the hole for the leg correctly. It's just slightly slanted, but it still holds weight. Like the other reviews have said, you can't be an 'average sized' person and expect to sleep comfortably (but we all know the 'average size' is ever increasing in the U.S.), but luckily I'm below 'average sized', so it's perfect!", 
    "Not very comfortable to sit on and when folded out, the seam in middle makes it even more uncomfortable. Very hard. I kept because it looks good in the area I needed. good for the price.", 
    "We bought this for my 9 year old son's hangout space, so he and his friends can play their video games and watch tv. Obviously, wasn't looking for anything fancy, given the intended users. The Sofa took longer to arrive than was estimated, so that was a bummer (b/c I ordered it hoping it would be in place by the time we had a Memorial Day weekend Party. Unfortunately, it came about 5 days after the approx. delivery date that was quoted in the shipping section.) Once it arrived, it was super easy to put together -- just screw in the legs and you're pretty much done. It was well packed, and after reading other reviews, I took pains to open the package carefully, so as not to cut into the fabric backing -- probably good advice to follow. This couch is best against a wall because of the black fabric backing (not something you would want in view.) As per the instructions, it seems like it will be easy to clean. As for the bed part...we haven't had occasion to use it, but it looks like it could fit one adult comfortably. Overall, I am pleased with the product for the purpose we intended.", 
    "This is definitely a bang for the buck product. I read more positive reviews than negative reviews so I purchased one. I think some of the negative reviews would be folks that were expecting a $500 couch for this Futon price. It looks great and am thinking of purchasing another one. It is not as low as I expected from the reviews also so I am happy with the height as well. The only negative is there is a small tear when we put it together, which others have written about so be careful. Although it has a ledge in the back when in upright position, it really would not look attractive unless up against a wall.", 
    "It's small. The back is low so I think that's what makes it look so tiny.. but it fits well in my small living room. I folded it open and put some really big pillows on it. Works well for lounging.", 
    "It's a wonderful sofa bed for my 11 year old daughter and a great couch to sit on. Yes it's like a real couch when you don't put it down. And it's a wonderful bed also. The quality is just surprisingly great. We love it. The price is absolutely reasonable. I'd get another one if I need it. If you're petite like me (5'2''), it's a perfect one. We're very pleased to have this bed.", 
    "I purchased this for my young grandson to sleep on when he comes to visit. His room doubles as my office/work room and I needed something small enough to fit, yet be comfortable for him. I was concerned that the separation between the cushions would not be comfortable for him when it was set up as a bed and purchased a comfy mattress cover to use under the sheets. For his age, this is perfect. I don't think an adult would be as comfortable, but would be better than sleeping on the floor for a night..", 
    "The product was delivered timely, excellent updates regarding shipping, and was just as described and the quality was as pictured. It was easy to assemble and after a few weeks I can say it was a very smart purchase. It's comfortable and sturdy and is also compact. It is a nice addition to the room.", 
    "I purchased this for the look and for my Grandson, who is 15. He luvs it for the comfort. When it's in the seated position, he actually puts his blanket, sheet, et cetera \"away.\" There is plenty of room if you fold all of it/in the back full-length section of the sofa. It says \"MINI,\" but it's perfect as a sofa ~ three(e) people can sit comfortably with room! I luv it too!!", 
    "i was looking to fill a void in my loft area of my condo, this piece is smaller, sits a little low to the ground but looks very nice and is perfect for kids. i dont plan on any adults crashing on this futon but if they have, to then there feet will overhang a little. if you are looking for a decent piece to fill an area and need a smaller piece or for a kids play area....this is perfect....delivered by UPS fast, pull out of the box, screw the legs in and your all set!", 
    "We have had these futon sofas for over a year and they have heald up very well. The were exactly what I had expected and we are very happy with them!", 
    "One of the legs was broken when we opened the box. The sofa also is a bit on the hard side. If it is possible to send a new leg that would be great.", 
    "I ordered this for my 11 year old grandson to sleep on when he is over. It was exactly what I expected. It is a thin faux leather, which before I even had it all the way out of the box, my cat left claw holes in. I expected that I would need to cover it with a mattress foam pad, which helped with the comfort level. I also keep it covered with a thick comforter now at all times. The back is a very think cloth, which tore when I moved it, but I keep it against a wall, so it doesn't show. It is what I expected and I am fine with the quality for a low priced futon. My grandson fits on it, and has not complained about the comfort level, so it does its job. I expect that in a year or two I will need to replace it when he outgrows it. Overall, I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "My husband bought this for his office (I would never buy anything faux) but it is really impossible to sit on rendering it without function. Also, the piece of the platform that hangs out the back is hideous.", 
    "I needed a love seat or futon that would be able to convert into a bed in case family came over to stay. The futon is firm and fine to sit on. To sleep will it will work well for short people or children. For the price it works really well. It's a nice beige color that will go with most interiors.", 
    "I bought this as a quick solution to filling up a small space in a spare room. In terms of quality the product is definitely a 'cheaper' solution, and it does show slightly, but not in any way that matters for casual use. If you are very very picky, and thinking you are getting a deal on a high end piece of furniture, this unit is not for you. However, if you are looking for a functional little futon, without paying 3 times as much, this fits the bill. I'm 5'8\" and can sleep on it, and it's comfy enough to watch a little TV on for a couple hours. For the price, it's worth it....but if you're searching for 'high quality' furniture, don't expect it at this price....but I'm glad I bought it for my use, and would def buy again.", 
    "cute little sofa. like the other reviews said, not super comfy, but fits the bill for what we need (extra seating for kids and their friends). Only had to put the legs on out of the box (one leg slightly cracked, no biggie). Box said Ethan Home was the maker.", 
    "Neat, clean lines and mini size for small spaces. I got for an at-home office setting, but may put in spare room when grandchildren visit. Color, style, and size are all plus features. Might be too low to ground for some adults to use. But, easy to set up - just add the legs which fit neatly inside the sofa. Excellent purchase for the low price. .", 
    "The comfort level on this futon is not so good. We bought this futon our guest bedroom when family visit and it is very uncomfortable to sleep on. When the description said mini, they weren't kidding? It looks great but we had to purchase a memory foam in order for it to be usable.. It is very low to the ground and looks almost like a kids mini couch. I recommend for sitting only not for sleep.", 
    "Perfect sized Futon for small boat salon. Easy to put together, nice heavy material.", 
    "I bought this for an extra room that I had turned into a study area for reading and relaxing its very comfortable for a smaller person as it sits lower to the ground, I would say that only one person can sit/lay down on this at a time as it doesn't seem sturdy enough for a lot of weight I am 5'0 and 110 pounds so it's perfect as a \"lounger\" but i don't think a regular size adult would be very comfortable on this The picture fits the futon perfectly and it is rather stylish and has a modern look It goes perfect with the espresso colored wood coffee table and bookshelf I have and overall I am pleased with my purchase.", 
    "This futon is very low to the ground, but I was already aware from the other reviews. It sits perfectly in my seating area in my room. It's a great quality for the price. After my roommate saw it, he's going to purchase one for his room as well. The installation of the legs was very easy, simply just screws on.", 
    "The color is amazing, soft leather. I would buy it again. The only thing i have changed was the legs. The sofa is way too low.", 
    "I brought this sofa for teenager to play game from. This was just perfect for them. Great buy for me. Thanks overstock", 
    "was as described, easy to assemble - just add legs. Low to ground but that works for me. Easy to convert to bed and back, and looks good as a sofa. I like it for a small space but if you put it next to big furnature high off the ground it may not match. I put is it in a bedroom for a second convertible bed and I like it there.", 
    "I was stressed about moving into a new place downtown and worring about costs. Untill I found this site as well as this futon sofa. Could not of asked for a better price or futon! Thanks for making my purchase easy :) Mindy", 
    "This little sofa is TINY. It is made for little kids: 9 year old max. Do not buy unless it is for kids or VERY small (under 4'8\") adults.", 
    "wanted a small futon to replace an old one in the kids' playroom. this is exactly what i was looking for. the size is great for the kids. i love the material as it is very easy to wipe clean. sturdy enough for the kids to play around on. no assembly required other than screwing on the feet.", 
    "I love my mini futon! It's perfect for small people. I'm 5'1\" and I live in a tiny apartment by myself, so this futon is perfect. It's really easy to assemble, just screw the feet on. I plan on using it without the feet as a big floor cushion. Great buy!", 
    "it is fine for a college student for friends to sit around.", 
    "I would say order this for your kids or a small space for seating. This is not the product you would want of you are over 5 feet tall for extra sleeping. I bought it for that to fit in a small space instead of a twice size bed and it will be good only for my nephew to spend the night on and he's 5 yrs old. It is very firm and seats very low to the floor as well. not bad for what you pay for,..just glad I won't have to sleep on it.", 
    "This isn't going to win any awards, but it's less than $XXX. It held up well to our three year old's abuse.", 
    "Grest futon for the money. Relatively comfortable. If you're looking for a bed for a spare room that might be used on a regular basis, this is not the futon for you. Futons are more for convenience than comfort. If you want comfort, buy a bed.", 
    "Absolutely loved everything about it. It was perfect for my teens bedroom. He loves it too. Had looked at many futons, they all looked cheap and were expensive. This was definitely worth the money.", 
    "It looks nice and is a decent price. Sitting or laying on it is extremely uncomforable, causing limbs and other body parts to go numb. It also has a tendency to flip over on you if you choose to lay on it while folded out...there is very little support under the back side when it is folded out.", 
    "This is a very nice futon for my spare bedroom. I would not recommend this futon if you plan to sleep on it every night. It is small, I am 5' 4\" & 130 lbs and my feet almost hang over the end.", 
    "I love this futon. It is modern, and fits perfect. I only wish the legs were about three or four more inches higher as it is low to the ground. Other than that, it is wonderful.", 
    "I perchased this for the basement for the kids to sit and hang out and for a place for me to sit when down there with them and it is perfect. If you have trouble getting up from sitting to low it could be a problem it does sit very low but for a 6 and 7 year old its perfect. When my dad stays over it the perfect size bed. If your really tall your feet will hang over. But over very happy with this sofa bed.", 
    "I purchased this couch to be used for a bedroom that will get moderate use. The condition, color, and quality were exactly as descripted on the site. I am very pleased with the way this couch looks. Its comfortable and functional. I haven't had a chance to test it out as a bed yet but I'm excited about how it fits in with my decor. Great style, quality, value for the price- it can't be beat!", 
    "Other reviewers have pointed out that it's not the most comfortable piece ever, but it certainly is quite funcional and looks good as it's performing it's function (allowing us to lounge, sleep and doze). I recommend it.", 
    "Once I received this item, I wish that I could return it for a different color....But the paperwork stated that I could not return this item.", 
    "looks good in small area in upright position comphy to sit but cannot lay on as a couch seat to narrow sits low to ground as stated was not a problem not good for tall person good for 5\" -5\"2 person seating is ok low back no neck support .will use till i can aford a real sofa", 
    "This is a smart looking futon. It's very light and easy to use and move around. Be prepared for how small it is. My husband laughed when we first got it and said it was a \"toy futon\" because it's so low to the ground and is pretty much the size of a twin bed when folded out. Very firm and comfortable. I get compliments about the color and look.", 
    "I had searched for a small coach/loveseat/futon to complete the furnishings of my daughter's college apartment. My daughter is \"particular\", so it has not been easy to find an item that was both acceptable to her and acceptable to me pricewise. This product amazingly satisfied all of requirements beyond our expectations. The futon changes positions easily, is very comfortable for sitting and sleeping and is the perfect size for a small apartment or small room. The color is more cream, than white. So, if you want a true white color, this would be a problem for you. If you can get past that, you will be very happy with this contemporary look in compact furniture.", 
    "small enough for a seating area to watch tv. Pretty happy w purchase.", 
    "bought this for an extra sleeping place. It looks like real leather. Quality is very nice. Price was great", 
    "the reviews mentioned were accurate. this is a mini sofa bed. about the size of a love seat. looks great for a small living room. won't sleep a person 5'10\" or over comfortably.", 
    "Great lil sofa. If your looking for a contemporary/modern style sofa that doesn't take up much space this is the one for you. Its stylish and looks great.", 
    "I like how this sofa bed looks in my front room. The color of the faux leather is very soft and buttery looking. When you touch it, it seems quite delicate and made me a little nervous having kids and cats. Within one day, the fabric covering the base behind the sofa back got a big hole in it not sure who the culprit was, but luckily, it is not visible. Within two weeks, my cats had scratched 4 smalls cuts in that faux leather now THAT was a problem for me! I am pretty sure there is a compound to repair that, but, I was pretty disappointed that the fabric wasn\u0092t more durable. It was very easy to assemble,, the seat is very comfortable, but the legs are too short; i.e. you sit low to the floor. Even with these issues, I would buy it again!", 
    "The design is beautiful but it's not that well cushioned, so when you sit on it, your butt sinks foward, and i like firm couches that I can sit up straight in. As a bed though it's pretty comfortable, and it opens and closes as a futon very easily which is great because we like to lie in front of the tv to watch a movie. For the price it's as good as you can get I think, and we are content, but if you need an overstuffed couch this is not for you.", 
    "This futon is not big enought for an average sized person to use it as a bed and the bar down the middle makes it really uncomfortable. I keep it in the futon position to use it as a couch it is so small. When it is in the seating position it's like a child's couch. I really think you can find better options for the price.", 
    "If you are looking for white or even off white, this product is not for you. It is for sure more on the brown side! I knew it wouldn't be the most comfortable, but when we received it, it was like sitting on cinderblocks lined with a 1/3 inch of foam pads. I have to go out and find a pillow topper or blowup mattress to put on top for when guests come over. If you are looking for something that is just for looks, this is a good product because it's real stream line. If you are looking for something more than that, I would suggest to keep looking :)", 
    "This was a good value for the money but, certainly looks low end.", 
    "We used the sofa in a kids room, which the size if perfect for. However, the quality of the piece is poor and I don't know how long this sofa will last under the use of kids.", 
    "We almost returned it because the futon sits 4\" lower than was described. However, we decided to take the legs off of the futon, build a box to sit the whole futon on top of, bringing it up to an acceptable height. We'll screw the box on where the legs would go. This will allow us to sit more comfortably and store bedding underneath. It's a lot more work than we wanted to do, but the futon was a great price. It's a nice quality piece, and it's great looking. --The length is as described and is rather on the short side for an adult to be able to sleep comfortably.", 
    "It's smaller than we thought and beige not white but has worked out perfect! and our first guest who slept on it loved it! It's comforatble to sit on as well.", 
    "Overall, this product is as advertised and good deal. Easy to assemble and light enough to move with ease. We purchased this to put at the foot of our king bed. It fits perfectly. Our only complaint is that it sits quite low; certainly not a deal-breaker. Shipping was fast. We are happy with the purchase. Looks very nice.", 
    "Wouldn't recommend this product. Too small, uncomfortable, and not well made.", 
    "Futon arrived in a single box, well-packaged. The seats feel a bit springy (you can kinda feel the coils). The main thing is that the futon appears smaller than most futons, so double check the dimensions before you buy! It might just be that it also sits low (reminds me of a platform bed). Alone, it looks too small for my already small apartment... If I bought another to create a sort of L-shaped sectional layout, it might look a little better.", 
    "I purchased this to sleep on when I vist my daughter. My Granson is certain we will both fit ! Very light and easy to move. Not durable in the sense I would not put it in a childs room and expect it to last. As previously noted the back is thin fabric that I already put my thumb through. All in all I got what I paid for and it looks like it will serve my purpose as it will be in an home office .", 
    "This is nice for a porch or area of little use. more comfortable when placed in flat position.", 
    "I was very disappointed when it arrived. What I saw on line was a nice size sofa bed but what was delivered was a low to the floor sofa which was not described in the ad. Also there is not enough seating area on the sofa it feels like you are on the edge of the sofa. I should have paid attention to the price to know I was not getting something decent then I would have invested more money into my sofa purchase but the ad described something totally different and I thought I was getting a great deal. It really made me think twice about doing this again.", 
    "If you tall below 5\"3, then it will be confortable. I put it in living room but it is a small. No require assemble! Easy to set up!"
