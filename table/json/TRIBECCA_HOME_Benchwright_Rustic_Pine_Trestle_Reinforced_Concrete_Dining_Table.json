    "I've bought numerous very expensive items from overstock including beds and dining room chairs, rugs, lamps, etc. This is the most horrible thing I've ever received. I don't know how the top is \"concrete\" because it looks like plastic, sounds like plastic (when knocking on it), feels like plastic and is NOTHING like concrete. It doesn't even remember concrete. I've never been more embarrassed or disappointed by a purchase in my life. If you've ever sat at a plastic picnic table this is EXACTLY what this top is. I want to cry. Get the Zinc top, at least metal is metal", 
    "Perfect height and width for business, quilting projects, and as a dining table! Friends and contractors have admired this table so much by running their hands along surface and legs with great envy and admiration. The delivery crew of two were so nice, funny and quick. Thanks so much! Quality of this table is out of this world and exceeded my expectations! Buy one!", 
    "Love, love, love my table. Very rustic and very heavy. I am so pleased!", 
    "Very nice rustic dining table. East to install.", 
    "Easy to assemble and beautiful with my French dining chairs!"
