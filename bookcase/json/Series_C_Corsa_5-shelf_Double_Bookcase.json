    "Pretty easy to put t ogether. Looks nice but there was some damage to the shelves.", 
    "This bookcase is wonderful - large and plenty of space and well made and just PURRFECT! It was easy to put together - holds all I need and looks great!", 
    "This unit was q little larger than I anticipated that is o.k. It has the look of something more expesive and coming from an up-case merchanant. Good buy for the money.", 
    "My wife and I are pleased. It looks very nice and i have no issues with my shelves or anything cheap showing. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.", 
    "Documentation and instructions manual was not detailed enough. Plywood is exposed when shelving unit is completed because the shelves are not completed painted on the bottom side. The shelving unit is tall so when you are sitting down you can see the unpainted plywood. My biggest complaint is that the back panel (cardboard) was folded in the box so when the shelving unit was assembled you could still she the creases.", 
    "This is a lovely bookcase and easy to put together. I was looking for a bit larger than standard bookcase for my space and this is perfect. Looks lovely and is perfect for the books.", 
    "Good product for the price. Easy to assemble, but the instructions could be clearer.", 
    "This bookcase is absolutely wonderful. It is made out of sturdy, solid wood, and holds a ton of books! We anchored it to the wall so that it couldn't be pulled forward by our 2 year old. Other than that, it looks great in our entry way. Definitely a good buy!", 
    "We bought this Double bookcase and the single one as well. They are heavy and easy to put together. They are not solid wood, but do you expect that for the price?! They look wonderful in my office and complete it perfectly.", 
    "It looks great, it's taller than me (I'm 6') and has tons of room. My only complaint is that the assembly instructions are practically worthless. There's no words, only instructions by pictures, which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of five. I neglected to put the backing on right because the instructions were shoddy and as such didn't realize I needed to nail the backing to one of the shelves until it was too late to reverse. Besides that, no complaints.", 
    "The bookcase arrived quickly and was relatively easy to construct. It looks great and completes my home office.", 
    "Looks good; hold lots of books, but I'm concerned that long term, this bookcase won't hold up. The 50 pound limit on the amount of weight each shelf can hold sounds like it would be enough, but I have old photo albums that could pretty easily bump up against the limit. If you're planning to use it for mostly paperbacks, this unit will be perfect. Also, I'm using it as a room divider, so I have some concern about the faux wood back - probably not as much of an issue if you're backing it up to a wall. For now, I'm mostly satisfied - will keep my fingers crossed that it holds up over time."
