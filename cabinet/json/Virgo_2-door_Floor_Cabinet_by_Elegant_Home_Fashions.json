    "For a relatively inexpensive cabinet, it is very nice. It went together very quickly; directions were easy to follow. It seems durable, looks nice in our bathroom, is a good size, and meets our needs well.", 
    "I ordered 2 of these for my bathroom. They were packaged expertly packaged and went together very easily. For my bathroom location I left the legs off and mounted them at the end of our sunken tub. I love the look and they hold my towels as well as various bathroom items. My only complaint is the smell. It must be something in the treatment of the partical board - almost like formaldehyde - but I am very sensitive to orders and I have even put baking soda in each cabinet. It has been seven weeks and there is still some odor. It has certainly lessened but it's still noticeable to me.", 
    "The measurements given do not include the top overhang. It doesn't fit in the space I specifically bought it for. It would cost too much to return, so I will probably try to sell it in a consignment store to recoup some of my money. I am very disappointed.", 
    "I needed a cabinet for my guest bathroom to hold towels and other supplies. Wanted white to match the fixtures and tile in this new bathroom. I love the style of the cabinet, the glass in the doors and the glass knobs. I have no problem with any odor from the cabinet. I put the cabinet together myself. I used a pillow to lean the door on while screwing the door to the cabinet. At first it looked like the doors were not lined up evenly. I lined up the doors, then screwed the screws into the back of the cabinet. The doors lined up perfectly. The pieces to the cabinet were labeled with stickers (A,B etc.). There was residual stickiness left on the cabinet.. I used some Goo Gone to remove the stickiness. Bad idea! It takes the paint off the cabinet. Luckily I realized it before I went to far.", 
    "This cabinet was not difficult to put together. It is attractive and is a fine quality for the laundry room where I have it. It is not a substantial piece and the doors sometimes drift open, so I would not put it in a location where it might get bumped. But I have it in a corner and it looks nice and serves the purpose.", 
    "Love this cabinet. Used it in a bathroom with a pedestal sink", 
    "The piece arrived a day ahead of schedule. When opening the package that held all the screws, etc, I thought that a couple were missing but they ended being with the knobs. Was easy to put together, did need a little help with the doors. The piece didn't have any odor at all. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "We LOVE this cabinet! It's substantial and VERY well-made. I love the details like the glass knobs. We're extremely happy with this purchase.", 
    "I normally don't review merchandise puchased online but feel compelled to warn people against purchasing this item. It was the worst chemical smell I have ever experienced and it came scratched. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this item.", 
    "This piece of furniture had with it very good instructions on how to assemble it----even for me, who usually struggles with this. The only trouble I had was when putting in the screws. I failed to screw some of them in as striaight as they should have been on the sides so they appeared on the inside of the back. I wish they had warned me of that, and maybe they did, and I just missed it. It ended up being a very attractive stand. I use it for towels in my bathroom. There is an odor from the cabinet that transferred to the towels, but I would guess this will subside once it is in use for a time.", 
    "The Virgo 2-door floor cabinet is perfect for our office restrooms. We ordered two - one for the ladies room and one for the mens room. They are the perfect size and hold exactly what we need. Couldn't be happier with them.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for our newly renovated masterbath. We have a large storage closet in the guest bath and took out the small linen closet in the master, so we just needed a small amount of storage for a few towels and incidentals. This cabinet is perfect for this purpose. It's small footprint is nice - doesn't overpower the room and with the small design elements looks smart. Very nice product for the price.", 
    "This piece looks great and I have received compliments on it. I've had it for about a year and the only con is that the top is a little scratched up, but I imagine this would happen with any piece. Highly recommended. I also got the matching piece that goes over the toliet which was great as well.", 
    "I bought this cabinet to place in the bathroom at my husband's office. It is good for storing items that are best put away. It was a bit difficutl to assemble but it came together nicely. The color is good but the finish had a few imperfections. It is a good cabinet if you treat it well.", 
    "Ok its easier to put together than this site and other reviews led me to believe. The hardest part was lifting the box. Took me close to 45 minutes but pictures are easy to follow and goes together perfectly. I love this and its just the right size for the new bathroom..", 
    "I have never smelled fumes so strong coming off of something before. Terrible, terrible chemical smell coming off of all of the laminated wood parts. It took a while to put together, but it is very well designed I'd say (apart from the smell), and looks pretty good. I would have given it 4 or 5 stars without the smell. Right now, it is sitting in the bathroom with the exhaust fan running 24 hours, and I'm hoping the fumes will go away after a week or so. Don't know what we'll do if the fumes don't go away, I don't think it's safe to be breathing in the fumes from this thing for very long.I would recommend this only if you are willing to put up with the fumes until they (hopefully) go away over time.", 
    "Cabinet is nice but the height dimension is wrong on the website when I bought it over a month ago. And the dimensions are still listed wrong-the height is 34 inches high.", 
    "Very nice! Perfect for the bathroom", 
    "This was easy to assemble, but it is flimsy and lacks sturdiness. For the price, not so bad. If you want sturdy, this prob isn't your piece. The cabinets are pretty narrow too, folded blanket/linens pop the door open. (This was for use in an acupuncture room)", 
    "And made pretty sturdy Was pretty easy to assemble", 
    "Good cabinet for the price.", 
    "It's great and useful for what we needed it for", 
    "Ordered for our bathroom. It looks very nice and holds many supplies.", 
    "looked around for a good value of durability and price. This was it. Purchased several pieces of the line.", 
    "The cabinet was fairly easy to assemble and works perfectly to store extra towels and sundries.", 
    "Easy to put together. Looks good .Fits the place I wanted it for. Very happy", 
    "Great cabinet. It looks really pretty/functional.", 
    "Purchased this to help save some needed space in a very small bathroom. It looks very nice and fits all of the towels and washcloths for the downstairs bathroom.", 
    "Convenient bathroom storage for a teen bathroom.", 
    "This is a nice cabinet. I have it in the water closet to store toilet paper, personal products, wash cloths, hand towels and cleaning products. I would have given it 5 stars but there was an imperfection in the finish on one of the doors. Assembly was easy. You need another set of hands when installing the doors.", 
    "Very nice cabinet, bottom shelf holds at least 6 to 8 tri folded large bath towels, middle shelf holds all my soaps and lotions, razors etc..and I use the top shelf to hold Toilet paper, hand towels, face cloths and q-tips. That way guests can see through the glass that there is more paper if needed ;-)", 
    "My friends just renovated their lower level bathroom and was in need of a cabinet. I found this on Overstock and ordered it for them. They had one of the workmen assemble it and were glad they did. The husband said it was a bit complicated to assemble but it's well made, looks beautiful and fits PERFECTLY in that space. They love it!", 
    "Just what we were looking for. And easy to assemble", 
    "The cabinet is attractive and relatively easy to put together. It is perfect for my large bathroom. One caution is that the finish on the top is easily damaged so I put an attractive tray on top for my morning coffee, etc. ideal would be to have a glass top added.", 
    "This cabinet looks very nice, was easily assembled and seems sturdy.", 
    "The dimensions of this little cabinet worked perfectly in my bathroom! Didn't take me long at all to build, and seems very solid and well-made.", 
    "Took a bit to put together - but it works just fine for what I wanted.", 
    "My kids like it, stuffed full o stuff.", 
    "Very pretty and well put together. I love it.", 
    "A bit flimsy but nice looking piece.", 
    "Pretty cabinet but assembly was tricky. Looks good when assembled. I love the detail on the doors.", 
    "Put together in about half an hour, great piece.", 
    "Very cheaply made. the doors do not stay closed. Fine to hide away in a spare bathroom. Having purchased real quality furniture from Overstock this piece was a disappointment.", 
    "Great quality for the price. No problems or concerns.", 
    "i love this i have it in a bath room with towel on one level.hand towel on the other and towel on the last shelf ... i bought a smaller one to go across the bathroom for other cleaning and bathroom stuff.... great quility and great to look at... every one wants to know where i got them", 
    "It looks great. After several months of frequent use, the magnetic pieces seem to be getting weak, but overall it was perfect for the price and for our purposes.", 
    "I love it and think I might purchase another one. Looks great in my bathroom.", 
    "used it in our bathroom, looks great!", 
    "Shipped great, easy to put together,wonderful for storage in a small bathroom. Finish was nice. Price was right! Looks awesome in the bathroom, very happy with this purchase and got the matching wall cabinet, love both pieces!", 
    "Easy to assemble. Looks good.", 
    "I've had this cabinet for a month now and love it. I have a pedestal sink so this cabinet works great, offering the storage I need without being a bulky piece of furniture in my bathroom. It took about a half an hour to assemble and was very easy. There are two adjustable shelves as opposed to fixed shelves which are nice for bigger/smaller items. Great cabinet for price and storage solution.", 
    "Very happy with purchase. Have had very many compliments. Easy to put together.", 
    "Don't waste your money. Very easy to put together, but the hardware doesn't align correctly. For the price, I knew I wasn't get high quality, but I just needed something that looked decent for extra storage for a bathroom. I've put together particle board pieces before, but this is by far the biggest piece of crap. I just got it this morning, put it together this afternoon and will be putting it out for bulk garbage pick up on Friday morning.", 
    "Very nice cabinet for my husband's office bathroom. Plenty of storage and nice finish. Glass at top gives it a good design.", 
    "I bought two of these for a narrow space in an old bathroom. They looked great and added some well needed storage. HOWEVER, I had plants on top, and when one was unknowingly over watered, the entire area--at least 1/4 of the top, warped, cracked and bubbled up. Also, the top stains easily. I'm handy, so I sanded and repainted the top and it looks fine--but keep in mind that while this is a perfectly adorable and useable cabinet, it is not fine furniture.", 
    "This is a great looking, sturdy cabinet. The pulls and window details are nice touches. Great value. Can't comment on assembly; I paid a carpenter to do it.", 
    "It was just what we needed for an empty space in our master bathroom. Very nice piece and easy to get together.", 
    "It looks great in my white on white bathroom! Fits my space perfectly and the shelves adjusted to meet my needs. Now for the putting together......I've put a lot of stuff together in my time but I've NEVER seen this type. After I finally figured out how it works it went together and held tight. You have a pin that you insert into the side & bottom then you put a round disk in a hole in the side and twist with a flathead screwdriver.", 
    "Easy to put together with electric screwdriver.", 
    "I love the way this looks assembled and together. The one detractors was a thin board back. The rest is heavy MDF. The glass doors and simple linesake it perfect as a small towel cabinet with doors that hide content. The glass knobs on doors are a nice detail. The top is spacious enough for small lamp and decor. All in all a sturdy, attractive piece of furniture", 
    "Easy to assemble looks great in my bathroom. Our bathroom doesn't have a linen closet so this is great for holding towels and toiletry items. The glass panels give it a nice look.", 
    "Love this! Added it to my small kitchen to add some extra cabinet and counter space. It did exactly what I had hoped for and looks lovely too!", 
    "Looks nice in my bathroom and hides all your \"stuff.\" I have a pedestal sink so I really needed the extra storage space.", 
    "You get what you pay for. It is light & a bit flimsy, but good enough for me. Assembly was simple.", 
    "Cabinet was right size and much thinner material; than anticipated. It smelled for at least 3 days like a solvent debasing. Two blems in paint finish on the very thin top, but I have white paint and will remedy myself. I needed more storage in the bathroom for meds and smaller storage bins, so it will do he trick.", 
    "Looks great in pics and in person, but thats it. The white finish is damaged in several areas. The materials are cheap and cracked while tightening. The knobs don't align in height. The doors aren't aligned when closed. I expect better from Overstock products. This was a definite disappointment.", 
    "Easy to assemble. A little rickety, but you get what you pay for. Overall, I'm happy with it.", 
    "perfect for cleaning products", 
    "Love it. Wondered why I didn't buy something like this before. It is a perfect size for storing makeup, towels and cleaning supplies.", 
    "Nice cabinet. There is a space between the doors, which bothers me, but besides that, it is an ok piece and serves the purpose.", 
    "When something is exactly as described, looks good and comes in perfect condition, in my opinion, it is a 5 star purchase .", 
    "This is a great cabinet for the price! It was very easy to put together especially for someone instruction challenged like me. The thing I liked best was the it was actually white and not some off color of white.", 
    "I've had this cabinet for about 6 months now and love it. At first I didn't quite know what to do with the open window shelf- I hated the thought of wasted storage. Now I take the hand towels used for that bathroom and roll them up nicely and place them on the shelf. With the matching colors to the bathroom, it looks really nice- almost like a decorative touch. Storage inside is good.", 
    "I love this cabinet! It was easy to assemble and it looks beautiful in my small bathroom. One reviewer described it as girly, and I agree but that's what I was going for. Another site carries this cabinet for $22 less ,but many people complained about the quality of that one. This one however, from Overstock, is sturdy and it holds everything I needed it. to. Guess you get what you pay for .", 
    "The cabinet did not have a smell that others had said in their reviews, which almost deterred me from not even to consider purchasing the product. After many searches on line for a cabinet that met the dimensions I needed, I only found this one that really would work. I decided to go ahead and purchase it anyway despite some negative reviews. I am very much satisfied with the cabinet. The assembly was very easy, it was packaged well, no damage. Looks great in the bathroom space which I bought it for. Glad I purchased it!", 
    "Looks even nicer than you'd expect relative to the very affordable cost, blends well in most any space, and holds a surprising amount of stuff (I use it for toiletries soaps and similar supplies..). Assembly not too challenging, just set aside 20 to 30 minutes, depending upon how adept you are at furniture assembly...", 
    "The cabinet was a great addition to our home. The only concern that I had was that I envisioned it to be taller. It would help if the measurements were given, but otherwise, it is a fine cabinet.", 
    "this is a perfect cabinet and went together very easily! great product and great price!", 
    "This cabinet arrived quickly and assembly was easy. We are using this cabinet on a screened porch as a TV stand. However, the inside storage area is perfect for gardening accessories and other items for outside dining. Perfect addition.", 
    "Lovely cabinet used as an addition in the powder room. Beautiful & very easy to put together (took about 35-40 minutes to do by myself, however I did just get done putting together many items from ikea....). There was no odor as reported in earlier reviews. Only thing that would have been helpful is if the pieces would have been labeled \"front\" & \"back\". I had put a few pieces together upside down & had to disassemble a couple times to get everything right.", 
    "Easy assembly. Super cute, fits right where I need it. Holds pots and pans.", 
    "Beautiful modern white cabinet that is perfect for the master bathroom, will hold towels and other items. I recommend it", 
    "Too bad there's a 0 star because this cabinet would get it. First. The cabinet arrived with no assembly instructions. I probably should have taken the hint and just returned it then, but I waited to get the instructions. Second. Hubby assembled this, and he said it was hands down one of the worst RTA products he has ever put together (and this man has assembled all sorts of things over the years). The legs kept falling off because the attachment mechanism was faulty. The holes didn't line up. There were four holes on the bottom shelf that served no purpose and came without plugs, so he had to plug them with wood putty, sand that down and dab white paint on them. Third. THE STENCH. Oh my god...I've only smelled products with that smell that were chemicals to spray on the yard. Absolutely awful. This cabinet is in my bath, and after four days, I can STILL smell it from 20 feet away. This right here would be enough to warn people away. This is a horrible cabinet. There are other cabinets that are virtually identical from other manufacturers, so if you like this look, go to them. The experience I've had here has taught me to avoid products made by ****** at all costs.", 
    "This cabinet offered just the extra storage space I was seeking. Measurements were accurate, and the assembly was remarkably easy to accomplish, even putting it together myself. I particularly appreciated all the pre-drilled holes that made the screws easier to manage for my tendonitis-afflicted wrists!", 
    "This is the perfect cabinet for our space. Holds plenty of stuff needed for a small office.", 
    "I like the cabinet and it went together easily but there is a funky smell I'm guessing in the paint.", 
    "Just got put together. I wanted it for storage on my back enclosed porch. It did have an odor when it was put together but that soon disappeared. I just love it and found it to be a really great value. I would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "This item is not of high quality. The assembly was difficult because a lot of the pieces didn't line up correctly, it was not sturdy at all. My husband reinforced the legs and they were not level. Some of the hardware broke while assembling, it was very poor quality. Flimsy, not solid. Good thing my husband is handy and had spare parts to fix this. Also there was a big mark on the top of the cabinet. For the cost of it, we decided it was easier to just touch up the paint ourself.", 
    "I was confident buying this as I read the reviews. They were all true. Excellent quality and a good-looking piece for any bathroom. I was nervous about the assembly but it was well instructed and all the pieces were enclosed! It took me maybe an hour and a half and I went slow. I recommend this product.", 
    "Makes a nice statement in the room. The clean, nice lines update the space in just the way I hoped it would. Easy to put together.", 
    "Very roomy cabinet and I love the style, of coarse I had someone put it together so not sure how hard that was.", 
    "This is a great little cabinet for the price. It's the right size and easy to set up. It's the not the highest quality- but again- for the price it fits the need. The only blemish on the cabinet is on one of the little windows- the \"x\" has a break in it which looks a little unfinished- this may be unique to this particular piece. Other than that this is a good buy for the money", 
    "The cabinet is of good quality, very stylish and easy to put together. But I was disappointment once I placed in bathroom that it wobbled when I rocked it back and forth. I did not want to attach a floor cabinet to the wall but wanted more stability. So I went to the hardware store and purchased some brackets and white duct tape. I installed the brackets to the top and bottom sides of cabinet and used the duct tape to reinforce the back. Now it is much more stable!", 
    "This is a great little cabinet I needed for the guest toilet. It was an excellent price, easy to put together with very good directions, parts all labeled! Fits perfectly where I needed to put it and was an excellent purchase at the price. Couldn't be happier!!", 
    "I moved into a house that had only one cabinet, which was under the sink, and there was just not enough storage there for me. I ordered the wall cabinet and 2 floor cabinets all in the same style. My son put them together for me or I would probably never have gotten it done. The cabinets are sturdy, and really nice looking. They had a strange smell at first but I left the doors open and it dissipated. If you've got someone who can put them together for you, I would recommend them highly.", 
    "I needed to find something to store towels for my sauna which is located in the Man's Cave. The space was small so I was on a difficult hunt to find the right cabinet. This is what the doctor ordered except I am not completely happy with the thickness of the particle board. Would have been more than willing to pay more for a little bit more quality./", 
    "This cabinet fit perfectly beneath our window sill in our powder room - dimensions were accurate. Great price for a quality piece. The reviews had me sold, and I'm very happy with our purchase.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for additional storage in my bathroom. The directions were fine, no missing parts, didn't take too long to put together, and it looks very nice with a decent amount of shelf space.", 
    "This is higher quality than expected for the price. Assembly was easy by myself, except for attaching the doors. I was able to attach the doors by myself, it was just a bit tricky holding it up and screwing it in at the same time. Overall, it looks very nice in the bathroom and holds extra towels and toilet paper as well as some toiletries. This is a great, affordable option for someone who needs a little extra storage in the bathroom.", 
    "matches the wall cabinet to a T. This product is everything is says it is. Lovely and functional in every way.", 
    "Very pleased with the cabinets glad I found them on over stock.", 
    "I love this cabinet. It took some time to put together (about 2 hours, but I am VERY inexperienced) and the directions weren't super clear, but very doable. I am using this in the kitchen as extra cabinet storage space, and it has been perfect. Yes, this product does have a strong chemical smell just as others have noted. However, it is not something that a couple days and a candle in your house can't fix. Cute, functional, and useful. Definitely recommend. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because of smell and assembly.", 
    "Cabinet came together with dowels and cams... I'm a huge fan of cams, they really are easy to install and seem to have more sturdy results than nails or screws alone. Cabinet was exactly and pictured and described on the internet and we are very pleased with this purchase (great price too!). Only thing is that it was damaged during delivery and it has a big ding on the front corner (right in front) and we should have sent it back, but we wanted it so badly that we just try to ignore the ding.", 
    "This small cabinet holds a lot and displayes color in the glass area. It is so functional. Not just for a bathroom, we use it in our breakfast room.", 
    "They look great in our office restrooms, both men's and women's. They hold quite a bit of items too.", 
    "Easy to put together - but needed two people to install the doors to the cabinet. Would have liked the backboard to be made out of the same material as the rest of the cabinet. And, the magnets securing the doors to the cabinet could be stronger - the doors don't stay closed all the way sometimes. Overall, I'm pleased with the product - it fits the space I wanted to put it in and it looks nice. Good cabinet for the price.", 
    "This item was priced very low and it reflects it very well! Materials are poor and it was a bear putting together. Wobbles a little and doors don't close evenly. Since it is already \"built\" and the price was so reasonable we'll keep it. P.S. It also gives off a horrible smell so you might not want to put towels in it.", 
    "After reading many reviews on this cabinet I decided to order it and I am very glad I did. The shipping was amazingly quick, the cabinet was not very difficult for me to assemble by myself (I am a 30 year old female), and it seems very durable. I have only had it for about a month but I love it. I put it in my bathroom with nautical decor for additional storage. It did have the chemical smell other reviewers were discussing however the smell is gone now. If I had the space/need I would buy another one in a heart beat and I would definitely recommend this to a friend..", 
    "Perfect for the bathroom where we needed more storage. Very nice quality !", 
    "I really thought it would be much bigger disappointed in the size. Its a nice looking piece and goes with the white furniture I have. I am using it as extra storage in my bedroom for sheets, towels etc. Works but would have liked it a bit larger.", 
    "I bought this for my mudroom after buying a bench from the same manufacturer. I knew they would go together, but this was very easy to assemble (easier than the bench). It's very classy looking.", 
    "I bought this cabinet to replace one that I had broken the door off of. I love the style and it has ample storage area inside. The description is inacurate, however: it has 2 shelves, not just 1. Very nice piece for an excellent price!", 
    "perfect size for my half bath...looks wonderful ..had someone else put it together...", 
    "This cabinet is perfectly sized and looks beautiful. Assembly was a little bit of a challenge, and a few panels should have been reversed, but all in all it makes no difference in the integrity of the unit. I chose to leave the legs off (don't like things going under) and am very happy with the usefulness and beauty of the cabinet.", 
    "It's made out of particle board and is somewhat sturdy but I would not put it anywhere but a corner or enclosed space. It's fine for my purposes because it just stores basic downstairs bathroom items such as tp, bandaids, hair elastics, etc... It looks fine and a decent product for what I'm using it for. Not a high-quality piece of furniture by any means.", 
    "We are using this cabinet in a small bath for storing toilet paper and hair gear. I had read from other reviews about an off smell, so I told my partner that when it arrived, be sure to unwrap it and leave it outside on the porch to air out. He left it out for only two hours, then assembled it. He had no problems with the assembly. It still had an odd odor, but after a couple of weeks, it is barely noticable. It's a keeper for a small bathroom.", 
    "This is a very nice cabinet works great for what I needed it for to put towels in the bath room works great for that holds about 30-40 fairly large bath towels.", 
    "I have no complaints at all with my new bathroom cabinet. My daughter put it together in about an hour with no problems. I have had the cabinet for several weeks now, and wish I had room for another one just like it. I love the appearance of it, and it is so useful to me.", 
    "I bought this along with the corresponding Wall cabinet for my bathroom. I have so little storage space in my bathroom that I wanted to add \"something\" so that I could have a medicine cabinet and a \"towel and other stuff\" cabinet. I thought that the cabinets were easy and fun to put together. There is a slight off gassing, but that goes away with time. The Wall Cabinet is about the size of a medicine cabinet, and the Floor Cabinet is about 8 inches wider and about 1 2/3 as deep, and probably eight inches taller.", 
    "We purchased this cabinet for extra storage in our powder room and it is the perfect fit. It's exactly what I wanted. My husband and I put it together in about 35 minutes. The directions aren't very clear but we figured it out. It's great quality and good looking for what you pay and looks amazing in our bathroom. We keep a large bag of dog food in the bottom, but it would be great for towels or other storage. There is a shelf and you can choose what height you want to place it - it's perfect", 
    "This piece was very easy to put together and good quality.", 
    "We meticulously put the cabinet together and I was initially very impressed with how well all the components were marked and the fact it included wood glue for the dowels. Everything seemed great until the last step. We attached the doors and there's a two inch gap between them...iWe were shocked. I will contact customer service and hope this can be resolved.", 
    "Easy assembly and wow! does it look nice in my bathroom--and it's a great size for keeping clutter under wraps. easy to assemble--thinking about getting another one", 
    "This is cabinet is a great value. The assembly was very easy (about 20 minutes) and the result is a very usable bathroom storage cabinet. I would definitely order again from this manufacturer.", 
    "my only complaint (as some of the other reviews say) is that the chest has a chemical smell to it at first. it is lovely and provides lots of extra storage. looks very nice.", 
    "This is a perfect cabinets for wide but narrow spaces. It's well priced and sturdy. The only drawback is the time it takes to put it all together. The directions are fairly easy to follow, but there are just so many pieces that it takes a long time to assemble. I would buy this again without hesitation.", 
    "I like this cabinet, good quality for the price, sturdy and easy to assemble. Assembly instructions were very easy to follow for nonmechanical me. Lots of storage space.", 
    "Very nice cabinet. Great price and quality. Was a little difficult to put together, but was a good deal.", 
    "This is a pretty little cabinet. I didn't notice the dimensions when I purchased - but based on the picture I was expecting something a bit taller than this. It was pretty basic to assemble - it took me about 90 minutes by myself - but I followed every step to a \"T\". LOTS of little pieces - tons of screws. I'd hoped it would be a bit more sturdy, but it is pretty similar to other particle board furniture. It will do what I need it to do and that's store toiletries in my small bathroom.", 
    "I've been looking for a small cabinet to fit and I'm very pleased with it. It holds my towels, body lotions, shampoo and body gels. Glad I purchased it.", 
    "love! love it! The cabinet is very attractive. Nice storage, which I use in my bathroom. I am pleased and happy with this cabinet. It could be used in many rooms in your home.", 
    "Strong and nice looking piece of furniture. Dimensions were exact and fit in the kitchen nook where needed. Took a bit of time to put together, but worth it.", 
    "Took a long time to to put together but instructions were very good. I'm using this is my kitchen and is perfect for that use.", 
    "this piece was very easy to assemble. I did it in about 20 minutes. The directions were right on. I use it in the living room as storage for DVDs and it keeps them out-of-sight.", 
    "I bought this cabinet because it was the perfect size for my powder room. I needed a cabinet to store two 5-gallon water bottles and toilet paper. This cabinet is THE perfect size. It's not fine furniture, but almost looks like it. It went together easily - the instructions and part labels were perfect. Fast shipped from o.co made this a great purchase! The only thing that would have gotten this product 5 stars was knowing the size of the inside shelves - the top shelf is not adjustable. I took a chance and it paid off. I don't use the adjustable shelf and my water bottles fit PERFECTLY. I did frost the glass in the door to obscure the toilet paper on the top shelf, but that's a personal preference.", 
    "This case fits our need exactly. It was the measurement that was advertised. It was easy to assemble and looks great! We looked a long time before deciding on this one and it was a good decision. I would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "I bought this for the wife's bathroom renovation. It was the best deal I could find for quality, apperance and price. It went together easily, was well organized and had cler instructions. The wife is still commenting about how elegant it looks.", 
    "Cabinet is a great addition to our bathroom. Piece is a great looking storage option and for the price a great value. It was easy to put together and really solid construction.", 
    "I bought this cabinet to put next to a pedestal sink in our guest bathroom. It's a beautiful addition to the room. The details of the cabinet make it look custom made. No one would ever guess that it's one that I put together myself !", 
    "I recently purchased this cabinet for my brother, asked him how long it took to assemble it and if he liked the product. His response: \"Took a couple of hours. Mainly cuz I had to find my own nut & bolt to replace a bolt that would not attach properly. Otherwise, it installed OK. Thanks.\" He was looking for a small cabinet to place in the hallway and this cabinet fit the purpose.", 
    "Got this for my master bath to replace an open shelf unit I was using. This is so much nicer looking to have everything tucked away. It was easy and quick to put together.", 
    "Adorable little cabinet! It was just what I needed to complete my shabby chic breakfast nook. The cabinet was easy to put together and everything aligned just right. The crystal knobs are the cherry on top of this inexpensive trendy piece. I have seen similar designs in spring catalogs for much more. The only reason I would not give this cabinet 5 stars is because it could be a little more durable. I would suggest bolting it to the wall if you have young children.", 
    "This cabinet is sturdy and easy to put together. I gave it just four stars as stated before there is a noxious odor on the inside. I can't smell it when the doors are closed so it is not a big problem for us. We use it for storage so it is not opened too often. Also I must add that the items I store in the cabinet have not picked up the odor that is inside. So far everything I have purchased is good quality from Overstock. It is the first web site I go to when I need something. Thank you Overstock for the great service.", 
    "The good - fast shipping; fairly easy assembly; goes well in a small bathroom needing a cabinet for extra towels, soap, etc. The bad - missing some screws for the one of the doors. Had to go to xxxxx for them. Not a big deal, but still should not have had too. The Ugly - Glass (actually plastic) door pulls. Looked cheap. replaced with two stainless ones that matched my current vanity. Overall a good cabinet at a good price. Plus the shipping costs (not any really) helped a lot. I would recomeend this item and O-stock to anyone.", 
    "I purchased this item to replace a different one I bought previously from Overstock (Nassau white cabinet). What a difference!! The instructions were easy to follow. I put it together by myself in less than an hour (and I'm a girl). It sits beautiful in the guest bathroom. It's sturdy and elegant. I am so glad I returned the other one for this one because the Nassau cabinet not only smelled awful and was defective, but it was not match to the finished quality of this one (Virgo).", 
    "We had this together in about 30 minutes. The doors are perfectly even and the knobs are really pretty. I would like to buy one in a much larger size to go in my sewing room/ office. It is just that cute and I like the white, clean look. My husband and I like the challenge of working together and getting it done. Warning...directions are pictures only. If you aren't handy, it won't be as much fun.", 
    "The package arrived in good shape, with no damage. All of the (many) parts were inside, and the parts were clearly numbered. The instructions are all illustrations, so you have to look very closely at the pictrues to determine the orientation of some pieces. From start to finish, it took me about 75 to 90 minutes to assemble -- and it can be assembled by one person using only a screwdriver. It's sturdy and holds all my bathroom cleaning supplies, keeping them out of site (since I have a pedestal sink with no storage). Unlike some of the earlier reviews, I detected no oder at all, even straight out of the box. I am considering getting a second one for a second bathroom.", 
    "I was pleasently surprised when my husband put this together. The quality is very good. I have gotten numerous compliments on it. When asked where I purchased it my famous words are Overstock.com. That has made an eyebrow or two rise...I may have recruited some new shoppers :)", 
    "This cabinet was delivered fast and in perfect condition....followed the instructions and had no trouble putting together...it was perfect for what we needed it for... extra storage in the bathroom", 
    "I bought this cabinet for a new basement bathroom. I wanted something that was small. This cabinet was perfect. It is beautiful and very sturdy. I put this together myself, the items were marked so that it was easy to follow the directions. Other things I have put together in the past did not mark the screws and small items but this one does and it makes putting it together very easy. I liked it so much I just bought another one.", 
    "This cabinet is of good size and depth. Perfect fit for my needs. I t has to be assembled but requires only a screwdriver. There are many pieces and parts and looks overwhelming but actually the directions were good and it went together well. Everything fit perfectly. Caution: there are screw holes in the backside of each shelf and the sides. Make sure you get them truned toward the back. Good quality. Would definitely recommend.", 
    "Exactly as described. Directions were easy to follow. Took about 45 mins. to assemble and pieces fit very well. Good buy for the $.", 
    "The cabinet was easy to assemble and the quality is very good. I love it !!", 
    "It didn't take to long to build and the directions were easy to understand. The only problem I had was the stickers that numbered everything came off, but it was easy to figure out which piece was needed next. It looks great in my new bathroom!", 
    "It's a nice looking narrow cabinet - made fairly well- as well as you would expect for $*** Simple to put together I would reccomend this if you need a small cabinet for bathroom storage", 
    "Cabinet was easy to assemble, is sturdy, makes a pleasant appearance in our bathroom. Down side is not deep enough to really hold bath towels and doors can't remain closed with the magnets. The top has a scratch that is not able to hidden. For what it cost it is a good purchase.", 
    "The cabinet was easy to put together, is well made and is very sturdy. Its a nice addition to our bathroom. The size is good, not huge or overly roomy, but nice for storage of toiletries and those extras that seem to accumulate (shampoos, extra toilet paper, etc.). Very sturdy, not-cheap-feeling cabinet that I would recommend to anyone.", 
    "I needed a bathroom cabinet and did a little looking online. First of all this looked great in the picture - and second the price was right. I read through the reviews and one common theme was the strong smell - and a suggestion to air it out prior to assembly. The cabinet arrived qucikly within just a few days. I took it home and unapacked the pieces in my garage - and YES, the packaging had a very chemical smell, but the pieces did not absorb it. I was able to assemble myself in just about an hour. The cabinet is very sturdy and includes 2 shelves. Plenty of space to store my things - and it looks great too. Would definately recommend.", 
    "Works perfectly as extra storage next to my desk; I did not have any smell problem as some of the other reviews noted. I did have a few missteps in assembly (I am generally good with ***** stuff), so make sure you double check which way you are attaching the shelf. This cabinet is a great deal and seems sturdy. The door handles look better than I expected. Am definitely happy with this.", 
    "Ordered this cabinet and received in 5 days. I put it together in about an hour. The cabinet itself is great is size. It's for our bathroom which is long and narrow so I wanted a piece of furniture that would hold lots of items, but not take up a lot of space. There are 2 shelves in the unit, it doesn't state this in the details. I rated it a 4 and not 5 because while it was pretty easy to put together, the instructions lacked, well instructions. I put one piece on back wards (didn't know and instructions did not show clearly how to) and had to take apart and reassemble. Overall I'm very happy with this.", 
    "We were looking for a floor standing bathroom cabinet for months when I found this online. We ordered it and within a week it was on our doorstep. It was easy to put together and looks great.", 
    "This was my first purchase from Overstock and I'm really pleased with it. The exact same cabinet sells at Target for $179.99, so I was happy with the deal. Since other buyers said there was a strong paint solvent smell, I put the pieces out on our porch as soon as they arrived to let them air out before putting it together. Once it was put together (Boyfriend built it, so I can't attest to how easily it came together, but it didn't take him long.), I didn't notice any smell stronger than when you buy anything else new from a big box store. I put towels in it right away and they haven't seemed to absorb any odor. It's a sturdy piece, and like others have mentioned, it looks much more expensive than it is!", 
    "I wasn't sure if I would like this since I put the single cabinet together first and that one is not very sturdy. That is NOT the case with the double cabinet since it is VERY sturdy. You will need to have two people to attached the door hinges to the main cabinet to line up properly. I am very happy with this product. The door pulls are plastic and it does stink/smell, but I am putting up with it since I like it.", 
    "it's a beautiful cabinet. fits well in our bathroom. not to difficult to assemble. the knob of the door didn't fit very well though.", 
    "This arrived quickly and was quite easy to put together. It is sturdy and stable and looks great! First purchase of furniture from Overstock. I've since bought 2 more things!", 
    "Great item! Great Price! it was easy to put together and mine does not have smell at all (something i was a little bit concern about after reading the reviews).", 
    "This is a fantastic cabinet, and totally reasonable in price. Boyfriend was able to put together in about an hour (or less-- can't recall)-- but it didn't seem to be very difficult. There is a slight smell to the cabinet at first but it goes away. It's sturdy, and looks much more expensive than it is. A good size, too. Very happy!", 
    "The Virgo 2-door floor cabinet looks very nice in my basement bathroom. It was relatively easy to assemble despite the fact that the instructions were a bit lacking. I was still able to figure it out and put it together within a reasonable amount of time. It looks very nice in my bathroom and provides ample space for storage.", 
    "This is a nice cabinet. It was shipped quickly and was easy to assemble. It looks nice in our bathroom. The one complaint I have is that is continues to have a very strong lacquer/paint odor on the inside. I left it open to air out for a few days and it still has not gone away.", 
    "Cabinet definately looks good and I have not had any problems with it. Easy enough to put together. 2 shelves inside (so 3 rows to put stuff on). Originally was going to use it for linens in my bathroom but was a little smaller than expected--would look nice in a bathroom or other rooms in the house. Fast shipping!", 
    "I put cabinet together in about 1 1/2 hrs - by myself. Went together easily, directions very easy to follow, although some screws won't tighten, will replace with larger ones. Cabinet looks great, large capacity for misc bathrm supplies. Have had lots of compliments on it. Looks like a much higher end piece.", 
    "After looking in home stores and bedding stores for a cabinet for my guest bathroom I suddenly thought to look at Overstock.com to see if they had anything. I was so surprised to see that they had quite a few different cabinets. I chose this one because I liked the looks very much and also because of previous reveiws. I was so surprised to get my cabinet in a matter of 3 days. The one I almost bought at a store would have had to been ordered and they said it would take 2 weeks for delivery and the delivery charge would have been 15.00. The only problem we had was the top shelf did not fit at first and my husband had to remove it a couple of times before he got it in correctly. Now, everytime that I go into that bathroom I see the cabinet and am so happy with my purchase. Soon my guests will be arriving and I now have plenty of room for them to tuck away grooming supplies.", 
    "This is a decent cabinet, it will endure light to moderate usage.Assembly was quite easy and straightforward. The painted finish is durable, but I would recommend that you put this together and allow it to stand in a ventilated area, open for a few days before putting it into use. Even after that, place an open box of baking soda inside for about a month. The smell of the paint is very strong, and will be absorbed into towels for some time.", 
    "Very poor, laminate that scratches immediately. Priced well but I would recommend paying a little more for better quality", 
    "This was very difficult to put together. The hinges are already attached to the doors and you have to take two tiny screws for each hinge and try and hold the door while you screw the hinge to the inside of the cabinet. There are some pieces that go in under step 2 that have miserable instructions.", 
    "My only wish for the designers of this product - and any similar - is to actually fold up a bath towel and or a sheet set, and create and 'inside shelf depth' that easily accommodates these items. Have had to come up with a type of folding on mentioned items, so that all would fit.", 
    "The reason I won't recommend this product is the amount of time and difficulty it takes for an older person to put this together. It took a little over three hours and is relatively heavy. I will not order another piece of put-it-together-yourself furniture. It's difficult. When I was younger...yes!"
