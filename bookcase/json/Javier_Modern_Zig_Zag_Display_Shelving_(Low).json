    "I have now spent 2 days messing around with this thing. If I could give this a minus 20 I would. All the people that said this is easy lied., Holes not lined up. directions are wrong. Dowl pins and cheap screws. The table is unsteady even against a wall. I will burn this *** in the fireplace this winter. Never buy an unassembled piece again from overstock. Garbage", 
    "Just what I wanted, and had been searching for! Price was good, just tax/shipping that made it expensive. The item itself is sturdy and stylish. Would have liked it just a little more than I do if it had had a back to it to stop things falling off the back of the shelves, but that's a minor thing.", 
    "These shelves have a great contemporary look but they are cheap looking too.", 
    "Putting this together was a little tricky for me but once it was done.....I loved it. This piece is so beautiful. It's exactly what I needed for my living room. I definitely recommend it. I would say be careful assembling as the material lends to scratches and damage if u aren't.", 
    "Very pleased with this unit. Super easy to put together. Bought it to define a space between breakfast area and family room. It is perfect for my application.", 
    "I was pleased with the quality of the pieces and how easily it went together. Instructions were clear and everything fit well. The resulting shelf looks very good. I would recommend the product.", 
    "Ordered the white version to display my Star Wars collection. It's a really nice looking shelf and easy to put together. It really is striking in a room. I was thinking about it for quite awhile, glad I finally pulled the trigger because it's way better in person and pretty study as well.", 
    "It was fairly easy to put together and is pretty sturdy. It looks great in my living room holding our bluray's and dvd's and other things. It's not super big, so fits our space perfectly. I would recommend this to someone else.", 
    "I bought this item to put in our \u00e7loset. My fiance loves that he can see all his pants! And I love that he doesn't have to throw them all over the floor anytime he needs pants! This was so easy to get put together, I used his electric drill for whatever I couldn't do by hand. Well worth the money!!!!", 
    "Love these. I have 3 of them", 
    "Great piece of furniture. It was easy to put together and serves its purpose well. Looks good.", 
    "It looks very rich for the money we paid for it. Satisfied with a product.", 
    "It took three of us to put it together, but it fits perfectly and looks fantastic!", 
    "Great - Product - Easy to assemble - Looked great in the breakfast area", 
    "I was looking for a piece of furniture for a coffee bar and this unit works perfectly. Just the right height to put a coffee maker. Using the other shelves for cups, etc.", 
    "Easy to put together and looks great.", 
    "As others have said, the process of building was a challenge. Took 2 hours to build no. 1. However, luckily i bought two. The second took 25 minutes. I'm learned: first, go ahead and use a drill, the screwdriver and pressure rendered multiple biohazardous incidents. Second, start from the bottom, part F, and work your way up. I then inserted dowels and attachments and worked UP in height. I have to say, well worth the effort. I love looking at my books, which have been living in bags and boxes for a while. And these cases are lovely.", 
    "The wood is high quality and looks perfect with my other furniture. Gives the room a different look to it.", 
    "I don't understand the negative reviews. It went together quite easily (less than 30 minutes) and feels solid with no shimmying noted. For the price it looks fantastic.", 
    "pretty easy to assemble -- took me approx 35 min alone. however, the screws were difficult to screw into the prepared slots. i wish that the metal was more of a chrome-like dull shine instead. overall, looks pretty good in our bonus room and was pretty spot on with the pictures.", 
    "Since shelf is narrow, it fits right next to my loveseat. Serves as table, holds knick knacks, and crafts.", 
    "Matching tall shelving came missing pieces & had to be sent back & this was a bit hard to assemble but the finished product is very nice & attractive in our entryway", 
    "Sturdy, nice clean look for a low price. Pretty dark wood color and nice looking metal--not cheap looking. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Very nice but a little bit shorter than expected", 
    "Just right to store or display items. The open design creates the look of more room while you're getting storage. When you first put together, it might seem a little bit rickety but when you put it to use, it is just right.", 
    "It looks good and is sturdy. Simply follow the directions and it's easy to build. Helpful to have two people to build it.", 
    "Purchased for my daughters room for under her tv. Works perfectly, easy to assemble, looks great. It is very lightweight, would recommend an anchor if around small children.", 
    "not that stable, but I have it filled with books and it works plus looks good.", 
    "Looks great in our grandsons room. It is low enough put his tv on.", 
    "Perfect for your contemporary/modern home. Good quality. Easy assembly.", 
    "We are pleased with our purchased, and it's pretty much as described.", 
    "look nice, easy to assemble, only negative, a little lighter brown than I had expected, thought they would be more wenge, but nice and a good value for the price", 
    "I had been wanting these for a long time. I finally ordered them and I love them. They were simple to assemble, and they look great in my modern living room. I love that they come right to the door.", 
    "This is larger than it appears. Good quality", 
    "I purchased these bookshelves as an alternative to the closetmaid system that holds storage bins. The shelves hold 3 bins each and look so much better than the closetmaid system. Great modern design.", 
    "These shelves were excellent quality for the price. I purchased 4 shelves. They were very easy to assemble. I stacked one on top of the other to make two large shelves, but with easier mobility with the smaller two pieces than the one big shelf. They have set up against the wall very well together and don't tip. I am very pleased with my purchase!!", 
    "We bought 2 of these shelves for each side of the fireplace. They look great with our modern decor and the quality is good. Love my shelves!", 
    "Love, love, love this shelving unit. Doesn't take up a lot of space but gives me just the amount of storage needed. I finish is nice and very stylish. You can't go wrong with this item.", 
    "very good quality, got it for my office, easy assembly, looks grat", 
    "This product has worked out perfectly for the space where it is being used. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.", 
    "Looks perfect In m'y living room", 
    "just retro enough to be cute. fun to put together. shelves are HOLLOW and cheap laminated.", 
    "The bookshelf has a nice modern style. Easy to assemble. Make sure you get the screws tight. I thought I had them all tight, but when I lifted it, it started to come apart. It is kind of small. The coffee-table-size books will not fit standing up.", 
    "Made very well and easy to install/", 
    "This shelf looks great, very modern and original. I would not put too much weight on it, it is not an expensive sturdy piece of furniture, but, on the other hand, too much stuff would block its elegant features from view anyway. It is a very nice display shelf and you can't beat the price!", 
    "Love the way it looks. It was expensive to ensemble. But at the end it was worth it. Looks great. My only problem the sharp edges, they should be rounded.", 
    "Good the sign very functional love.", 
    "This bookcase exceeded expectation as far as the quality of the shelves. It would have rated Excellent if the support bars weren't so cheap looking. Very sturdy.", 
    "This shelving unit is awesome! It was easy to assemble and looks great in my room, its bigger than I thought it would be and holds so much ! I highly recommend it", 
    "Purchased for a long full size bath room. It looks great. No cons.", 
    "Most boxed items you get, directions and assembly can be tough but not with this shelving unit. I personally put this together myself in short order! Its beautiful. It is partical board not a solid wood so know what you are buying. I would not recommend this for a kids/ Dorm room because I would not consider this a durable piece of furniture. I am using it in a guest bedroom so a room that doesnt get a lot of traffic or use.", 
    "I absolutely love this bookshelf and would buy more if I had the space for it. The design is great, it's very sleek and contemporary. As far as sturdiness, it is pretty sturdy I have nothing but books on mine as well as a few decorations. It can be a bit wobbly when moving it, so if you have to move it remove everything first so nothing breaks. It's also extremely easy to put together, I did this one and the large one myself & had them together in an hour. I would recommend this if your looking for this kind of bookshelf.", 
    "Great shelf, looks very nice. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that it comes in regular white paint and not the nice high gloss finish. Other than that great.", 
    "Product was packaged fine and arrived in good shape. Assembly instructions were easy to follow. Quality of the product was not great, but as long as the outside paper covering on the particle board is not damaged, it looks great. Do not believe it would take a lot of usage without rapidly showing wear, but if you are using it to display items and the likelihood of the unit being hit, it should do the job for a long time. Customer service from Overstock was a different matter. I am used to companies like Ebay and Amazon and even many others which keep you updated about order progress, shipping dates, and actual shipping and estimated time of arrival. None were received from Overstock, and it was very difficult to attempt to retrieve any information from the company. I do not remember this poor service prior with Overstock and do not plan to order from them again because of these issues. They need to work on their customer support, or in the very least place a computerized system in place that keeps the customer informed of an order status.", 
    "Nice piece. It is a floor unit. Might be able to attach to wall which would be better but a great piece. I wish they had one smaller to hang in bathroom above the toilet.", 
    "It is easy to set up, and it's beautiful and functional.", 
    "This set of shelves was not for beginners in terms of putting it together. Directions were not clear and sometimes repeated a step. Shelves are hollow and very lightweight. I do like the look of the shelves. I'm using it to protect the back of a loveseat that backs onto my kitchen area. Overall I'm pleased with the results.", 
    "definitely not very sturdy shelves, the bars has minimum support. On the other side, it's very pretty and easy assemble. For the price, it's a good buy.", 
    "just like in the picture. We love it and would order it again.", 
    "We are very pleased with the quality and look of this shelving unit. It was easy to put together. I think it adds a look of class to our home office area.", 
    "A very practical choice for small living spaces. I use it instead of a nightstand. and have installed a mirror on top so serves me a dual purpose of a nightstand and dresser.", 
    "Just what I was looking for. I live in small apartment and wanted shelving that was not heavy looking. This filled the bill. It is light weight so you would not want to load it up with heavy things except on bottom shelf and if you are in earthquake country (or even if you have little kids around) it needs to be wall braced.", 
    "This shelf is fairly easy to assemble, and for being a zig zag figure, it holds pretty steady after assembling.The color of the wood is exactly as the picture, and the size is just perfect. I am really happy with the product. I believe the price is reasonable. I do recommend this shelf if you want something simple, elegant and different.. I get a lot of compliments from the people that have seen it.", 
    "The reviews in general are right. It's a very sharp-looking piece of furniture, and I like it and plan to use it as an entryway console in my house. But (in case you couldn't tell from the price) it's cheap and flimsy. My husband complained the whole time he was putting it together, because it was so obviously cheaply made, and so it was hard to get everything to line up right. But I think it looked great once it was all done. All you can really ask for, for this price.", 
    "Overall the product came in as described but after constructing, I did not like the back braces used in the construction. You would need to hide those with books or something tall enough to draw your eye away from that. Overall, I would have chosen another design.", 
    "I have a contemporary look and this shelving fits perfectly! Holds pictures, decor, candles and a fabulous set of flowers on top. Get it!", 
    "I had a hard time finding this size unit, so I was super happy to find it. It's just perfect. It did not come with instructions, I had to go on line to see the build, but it was pretty easy to do.", 
    "Good quality easy to put together makes the room look great!!", 
    "Very easy to assemble, sturdy, and looks good", 
    "This is a great piece of furniture for the area I am using it for. It looks good and was easy to put together. Very modern look."
