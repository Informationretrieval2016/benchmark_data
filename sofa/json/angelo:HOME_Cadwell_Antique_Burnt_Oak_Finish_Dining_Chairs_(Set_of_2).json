    "I am absolutely thrilled with these chairs. I waited and searched for a long time for these! Very similar to the RH style but the quality is so much better. The cane seats are comfortable and the chairs feel very sturdy when seated. They arrived in one box, unpacked very easily, and no set up at all. This may be my favorite Overstock purchase yet!", 
    "Great chairs, perfect height for our farmhouse table setting, but we just can't get over the rattan seat. Not a bad thing in general, but not what we want.", 
    "They are BEAUTIFUL! Just what we wanted.Only wish Home offered matching 30in. Bar Chairs!!Quilty great!Would purchase again.", 
    "Love the chairs. Great deal.", 
    "Absolutely love!!! I looked forever for dinning room chairs and wanted the prefect grey color. These are it. They go well with my table and decor and are comfortable!", 
    "These chairs are great. I just hope they restock them soon, as I ordered 2 and decided I need 2 more.", 
    "Love love these chairs! The picture doesn't do them justice... And they and already assembled which was a major plus!", 
    "Darling chairs. Great price!! Sturdy construction. Love them so much, trying to order more but they are out of stock!",
