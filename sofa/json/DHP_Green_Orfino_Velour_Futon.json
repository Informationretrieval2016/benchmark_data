  "reviews": [
    "Pros: nice dark green color. Looks very close to the picture on the website.Cons: smaller than advertised on the website. Actual dimensions 15 x 68 x 38. The back of the futon is quite wobbly. The middle of the futon where the moving parts connect doesn't have enough cushion which makes it hard as rock there.When I purchased this futon its sleeping dimensions were advertised as 15 inches high x 70 inches wide x 43 inches deep.When I received it, I noticed that it was smaller. The actual sleeping dimensions for this futon are 15 inches high x 68 inches wide x 38 inches deep."
