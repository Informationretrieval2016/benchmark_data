    "Very nice - once put together (which takes quite some time) it works great. Drawers slide well and it is very sturdy.", 
    "Beware. Only someone very adept at assembly would want to take this on. And, some of the assembly requires more than one person. I did manage to get the job done. The instructions, while complicated, were good as were the labeling of parts. But, there are a LOT of parts, even more screws and bolts. This is a big job that many would not want to undertake and probably couldn't successfully complete. Perhaps I missed it, but the listing should have warned of the complex assembly requirement.", 
    "takes about an hour to put this cabinet together. I did it on a work bench\u2026.no bending.", 
    "Great looking but bottom drawer won't shut.", 
    "This took a little while to put together by myself, but was not really difficult and everything came together aesthetically and functionally. Al drawers lined up and open and close well, etc. It is a sturdy and quality item and looks good also. Well worth the cost.", 
    "This file is perfect for my needs, and, fits in easily with my d\u00e9cor. The only negative is the assembly. It took over 2 hours to assemble, and that's with people that know what they're doing. Very frustrating at times. But even the assembler liked it and wants one for himself.", 
    "It's perfect for the office. Plenty of filing room", 
    "Purchase this item because hardware matched my bedroom furniture. It came,hardware have been replaced with ugly black handles.", 
    "I want to hate because of the damaged product that they had sent me.This file cabinet is so heavy. It was bit hard to put it together. But Overstock was nice enough to send me a new cabinet. For this I really love to shop at Overstock.com. I have been buying from this site for last ten years. Love to shop in this site."
