    "Just love this little table, it is strong and sturdy fits perfectly in my kitchen. My only complaint is that the instructions on how you put it together could have been a little clearer. Other than that it is perfect.", 
    "Brought two of these tables and probable will buy two more of them . They are so versatile , I am using two together as a coffee table in the living room and if I need to separate them for a table next to a chair for some reason I can just move one. I love the height and size table top is 20 x 20 which is perfect to put a lamp and your mess in the draw. They look lovely and the wood grain comes out in slightly different shadings and creates the fact that you have a solid wood table. Glass on top no problem it is about 20 bucks to have a piece cut if your worried about marking the tables. I can't say enough, they are solid wood, attractive and very functional.", 
    "The product specifications listed in the site were perfectly accurate. Though it is a small table and I think the price was a little higher than it should be, you should be able to expect somewhat of a discount purchasing from Overstock, the table is excellent quality. It is rare these days to receive something that is all wood instead of particle board with wood accents or veneer. The color was slightly darker in person, but still within the correct honey tone to match the other wood in the room. The assembly instructions are straight forward and super easy to understnad and assemble. The table is solid, not weak and wobbly.", 
    "Its really my fault that I have to give a good rating since I didn't closely look at the height of the table. My current side tables are 20\" and this was 18. Just doesn't look right. It wasn't difficult to put together but it was time consuming. Instructions aren't great so go slow.", 
    "THE END TABLE IS THE PERFECT SIZE. WAS NOT HARD TO PUT TOGETHER. GLAD THAT I PURCHASED THE TABLE. GREAT BUY. FAST DELIVERY.", 
    "For the price, I didn't expect this table to be such good quality. It is very sturdy, the finish is of good quality, and looks very nice next to my new chair. It was simple to put together. The instructions for assembly were very precise and easy to follow. I would recommend this table to my friends.", 
    "We were very pleased with the 3 small end tables that I ordered, with a few exceptions. One was missing four screws, another had five extra lock nuts, and the third, the screw for the handle was too long. They arrived even sooner than we expected.", 
    "Perfect end table for my sofa which does not have high arms. The drawer and lower shelf make convenient storage. It is not hard to put together but does take some time.", 
    "This is a nice end table and it was easy to assemble. The quality is good and it looks like it will be durable. The only negative thing is that the color is a lot darker than it appears on the site. It's closer to walnut than what is shown on the website.", 
    "The tables look great and fit great in smaller spaces.", 
    "All real wood, quality instructions and hardware and packaged so no damage at all to contents. I would buy again and I would recommend.", 
    "solid product !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "This table was a little difficult to put together and I couldn't fit the drawer correctly so it is extremely hard to open and close it. Over-priced. It is functional though. I definitely would not buy it again!", 
    "Loved the look but when I put it together the top split. Fortunately, Overstock refunded all my money and paid the return shipping. Wish these were sturdier because I loved the style", 
    "I found this piece easy to assemble and it looks perfect in our family room.", 
    "This piece was not worth the price as very few of the holes where the dolls were to fit into are drilled and even the ones that were present do not line up with the dolls, making it impossible to put together as sent. Also, the tract for the drawer is not placed correctly and therefore the drawer does not sit in it's space correctly and causes the drawer to hang down over the bottom of the piece. Unless you are a carpenter or have one at your disposal that is capable of completely remaking this product, I do not recommend this item.", 
    "Good to see an all wood piece.I bought the 2 matching end tables and matching entertainment center. There are a bit tricky to assemble but in my case every piece is assembled the same way. Only difference is the size of the pieces so it got easier but took a while, to do all 4 prices.Complaints #1.minus 1 star my coffee table underside support bracket that was all ready attached had gotten broken off during shipment, which was dis-appointing but I noticed it upon initial inspection and rather than call and weight in a compete new top with support brackets I decided it was a clean break so I got some good wood glue and 2 extra screws that I relocated away from broken area, Glued it and put the extra screws in. Used some clamps and let it dry overnight and while I put the other pieces of furniture together.Complaints #2 minus 1 starWood is very soft. I was writing on the coffee table with an ink pen and a single sheet if paper and when I was done I notice the imprint of what I wrote embedded into the sift wood surface. Everyone knows that pine is soft wood but think they should have put a harder seal coat on the top surfaces. Not a deal breaker but be aware that its very soft, I'd put a cloth runner or somthing on it, especially if you have kids banging toys on it.If mine gets damaged I will sand and put a poly urethane finish on top.", 
    "Great little end tables, easy to put together, look nice", 
    "Table is made well and is the right size I needed would recommend it", 
    "This was real wood and a great table but a bit smaller than I wanted. It will make a great bed side table but will not work as a living room table. Was fairly easy to put together and is real wood!", 
    "Table was OK. Assembly was easy and all parts were there.", 
    "Not as easy to assemble as you might hope but beautiful wood and is very solid. Would purchase again.", 
    "Very easy to put together! This piece is quality at an affordable price. Simple design and very functional. Will be looking more at this collection in the future.", 
    "I ordered this table in black for my son's updated room. He loves having the single drawer and it is just the right height for both his bed, and his chair, which it sits right in between. It was a breeze to assemble and is very solid and sturdy.", 
    "nice looking tables for the price, a little difficult to put together", 
    "Quality is OK, but VERY difficult to assemble!", 
    "Very good quality and easy to assemble", 
    "I really like the look of these end tables! Such a good deal for solid wood tables. Upon receiving the packages to assemble, one of the tables came with two left ends as opposed to one right and one left. I called the company and without any problems or delay they sent me a \"right\" side. Easy to assemble, great look, sturdy, and love them!", 
    "This is a very well-made table and not too difficult to assemble. However, I was disappointed in the height of the table. It's not as tall as the image led me to believe. It is such a beautiful piece of furniture though so I will keep it and use in another place.", 
    "Great for size- not too tall.", 
    "This table is very nice it was very easy to put together I really like it", 
    "Loved the end tables as I bought 2 of them for our recroom. They are built very well & I can put games in the drawer.", 
    "Priced right, fit perfectly in the room", 
    "work well in our bedroom decor", 
    "Great little nightstand/end table; ordered black and color was true to expectations. Easy to assemble as holes and screws matched perfectly; everything was included-no trips to hardware store; very sturdy; roomy drawer and nice shelf. Highly recommend!", 
    "I ordered this item and the 31\" column lamp. After receiving this and putting it together, I ordered another set. Then I ordered a third set. WOW! I was impressed. Now there are a few imperfections in craftsmanship ( some of the screw holes had been over drilled so that the screw would not hold--careful not to over tighten; the item is not 100% square -- an issue one would never notice unless one is super over critical, like me). but enough of the negative. This is solid wood not pressed, not veneer, not rubber but real wood. And they are very elegant with a beautiful presence in any room. I guess if you order additional ones after seeing the first, you know you have a winner.. I'd also like to thank the customer Care workers of OS. They are the friendliest most helpful customer service people I have dealt with. Extremely professional with a desire to go the extra mile to resolve even the most minor issue. They are exceptionally patient and considerate in their approach to customer care. And they move quickly for resolution. Thanks...", 
    "Beautiful table and very easy to put together.", 
    "I bought two of these end tables, and I am satisfied with the purchase, but only because I got them at a good sale price ($*each). For the \"original\" price, I was expecting pre-assembled, but putting them together wasn't too big a deal. I was disappointed to find the directions to be very poor (pictures for the beginning steps didn't even match the state of the product as shipped), and I did have a problem with one of the cam-lock units being misaligned and cracking the wood when I tightened it. Since it was inside the drawer, it wasn't a big deal. Overall, quality control on the manufacture and printed directions seemed a little low. Although these are far better than any Sauder furniture I've ever put together, I had a little higher expectations. I may still end up buying the matching coffee table or entertainment center...but am hoping to see the price drop on those first.", 
    "just what we wanted to compliment our d\u00e9cor. Was easy to assemble.", 
    "O.K. not as nice as I hoped.", 
    "Real wood, sturdy, true to color and size. A++", 
    "This was a good buy for me. Easy to put together. Substantial weight. A welcome addition to my apartment.", 
    "very good quality and very easy to put together!!!", 
    "This table was just size I was looking for. It was easy to assemble and when I was done looked great. It has a drawer where I can hide my Kindle and the cord to charge it. The space below the top is handy to store some magazines and still look neat. The price was reasonable.", 
    "The table is a great size. not to big. I love the natural wood grain. Do issues with putting together, My husband did the construction and I didn't hear him cuss once about how crappy or difficult it was :-)", 
    "Nice size and very well built. Easy to put together.", 
    "Look for blemishes BEFORE you put it together. Quality control is a little lax", 
    "love the table came in perfect condition just what I was looking for", 
    "It is just what I wanted for my family room. Fairly easy to assemble", 
    "Tables are weill made. Price is very good. Tables are not high so keep that in mind if table lamps will be used. Purchased two tables and very pleased.", 
    "Was pleasantly surprised that this table was all wood for the price I paid. Did a one person put together without too much trouble", 
    "I just got these last week and am very satisfied with the two I bought. My son put them together with no trouble.", 
    "good solid table larger than I expected", 
    "Very poor construction with flimsy wood product material. Even more disappointing is the Herculean task of assembling it ---- every single nut and bolt of the way!", 
    "Use it for a tv stand, only problem was that there was no hard wear with it, had to call the company but they shipped it about a week later", 
    "Sturdy, nice warm color, easy to assemble.", 
    "Assembly is pretty easier, took some time though. When opening/shutting the drawers you have a very loud hollow sound. It doesn't sound solid.", 
    "I added these end tables to accompany the entertainment center I purchased. If I had more room I would definitely get the coffee table. I am thrilled with the quality, and the ease of putting these together.", 
    "We've had this table for a couple of years & it still looks like the day we bought it! It does exactly what it's suppose to do! Shipping was fast & delivery right to the front door! Thanks Overstock!", 
    "Love them. Easy to put together. Delivered in great condition.", 
    "I ordered 2 and put them together myself. It is a very nice looking piece but dents and scratches easily.", 
    "This is a fantastic table! It's well made and looks beautiful. Set up was easy and it is a solid piece of furniture.", 
    "I bought this to go with other honey oak mission furniture. This is significantly darker than typical mission honey oak, so I just recently replaced this with a better match. I am happy with the quality though, so will use this elsewhere.", 
    "Good price for what you get", 
    "I am very happy with this item. Easy assembly. Packaged very well..", 
    "Great quality. Easy to put together. A little shorter than expected.", 
    "Great piece of furniture, wonderfully made, great quality, high construction.If this was the quality I can expct from Overstock, then nobody will be goign to the retail stores anymore - internet shopping!", 
    "I am pleased with the appearance of this table. Looks just like the picture. However it was rather difficult to put together as the instructions were in Japanese and the picture on the instructions doesn't match the parts I received. There was 10 pieces of wood and 5 bags of parts. I finally figured it out and got it together about 2 hrs later, and it looks good.", 
    "It is heavy and could be put together easily. The drawer pull didn't attach well though because the screw was too long.", 
    "Was pretty easy to put together, and sturdy. Like the drawer as it keeps stuff from cluttering the top but in easy reach. Thinking about purchasing other pieces as we get more settled in our new home.", 
    "Very well made ( sturdy) but very short.", 
    "This table is nice and comes with easy to build instructions. I'm not sure if it's the way we built it but it is a little rocky. Overall good table and would recommend.", 
    "Needs a lot of assemblage But nice once it's done", 
    "Great little end table. Easy to assemble and fits perfectly. Shelf and drawer add to organization value. Highly recommend.", 
    "What a great little table and at a bargain price too .. I bought this as a present for my sister and liked it so much I found her another gift and kept this table for myself! The color of the wood is true to the picture in the ad, and it certainly looks like it cost a lot more than it did. My only complaint was that I am not good at putting things together so it took a bit longer than I anticipated. I recommend this table highly.", 
    "The table was easy to assemble. But for me i did not look at the specifications and after it was assembled it was too small for my needs but i used it in another area. The table will be great for anyone that needs a quality product at a value price.", 
    "Would have given it 5 stars except the picture shows the table without knots in the wood. There are a few knots. But since it is pine, I was expecting this. Nothing I would return it for, though. Solid piece of furniture with solid pull knob. Delivery \ud83d\ude9a took longer than I expected but was undamaged. I would buy a second table except I already did. Overall, very pleased.", 
    "This little end table fits perfectly in our sunroom. It holds a lamp and is a perfect spot to hold a drink.", 
    "Using these in my bedroom for night stands. Live the drawer.Assembly was simple!", 
    "I purchased 4 of these little tables. I'll use 2 as end tables and put 2 together (most of the time) as a coffee table. They arrived very promptly. They are real wood, not pressed board. Lovely! I got the Norfolk Honey Brown, and it is a nice rich brown, just as shown. I was curious about what the measurements were really going to be, as the description says 20x20\", but the drawing says 18x20\". The tops are REALLY 18x20\" and the tables are 19.5\" tall, just like the drawing. My husband says that the instructions are good, and he had no trouble putting them together. I'm a very satisfied customer.", 
    "Nice tables except for the fact that both tables had what looked like water spots on top and one of the tables had a piece of wood that was not stained like the others. It was unfinished.", 
    "Table came unassembled but was very easy to put together with simple tools. Table given to family member as a birthday gift and was just the right size for use beside her recliner chair in her apartment. We would recommend this item to anyone.", 
    "Easy to assemble and handsome.", 
    "I have an older bed frame and this matched the wood tone perfectly", 
    "not extremely sturdy, but just what we wanted for a price we could afford!", 
    "Well built end table. Easy to assemble.", 
    "I am so happy with these tables! My husband put them together in a jiffy and they are very sturdy. I have ordered two more! Thanks Overstock!!", 
    "These End Tables do not disappoint. They are solid wood, easy to assemble and very functional. Would highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a a good value, especially in comparison to other department store type end tables.", 
    "I have been wanting a side table with a drawer and shelf to store items which were cluttering the top of my old one. This looked like just the thing. And after assembling it I found it perfect for my needs. The color is lovely and the structure is sturdy. The drawer holds a lot and slides well. I didn't give it five stars because the wood is soft and can be marred if anything is dropped on it. That doesn't affect the beauty, however. Mine has a naturally occurring knot on one part, which adds to the character. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "It was easy to put together and is stable. The drawer bottom is a little slim -- cannot store anything heavy. Looks nice.", 
    "We bought 4 pieces of this furniture; two end tables, 1 coffee table and 1 TV stand, all matching. They DO all match well and look very nice in our living room. They are 100% real wood, no cardboard or chipboard or vinyl cladding. Assemble easily and sturdy. Would buy again; recommend to a friend.", 
    "Pieces fit together fairly well. Easy to assemble. Solid wood seems to be good quality and is finished nicely. The drawer is okay, although the hardware for it certainly isn't top quality. I got two of these and the one top cracked while I was assembling it and customer service was great and promptly mailed out a replacement to me at no charge without any hassle. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "very nice wood end tables the color is a little darker that expected. assembly isn't that simple but can be done", 
    "Perfect little side table..The height of it could have been an inch or two higher but still perfect..Color was great and overall well worth the money.", 
    "I was impressed by all the reviews that raved about the ease of assembly but I found it to be at least moderate difficulty. I had three screws that didn't properly install....hopefully gorilla glue to the rescue. Other than this, the quality is the best I've seen in 'some assembly required' furniture. This only increases my disappointment in my failed table. I'm debating whether to try the second unit I ordered or just send it back.", 
    "I like the size, color and size of these tables. They look nice and were easy to put together. I would have given them a 5-star rating except for the fact that the top edge of both of the drawers (purchased 2 tables) had some scratches and dents that appeared to be from the way they were packaged for shipment. I was able to cover the damage with scratch cover furniture polish, so they're not as noticeable and are only seen when the drawers are opened. Since I am single and live alone, I'm the only one opening the drawers. Also, when I mentioned this to overstock.com, I was extended a small credit for the damage from their excellent customer service rep.", 
    "It looks how it does in the picture but I just didn't like it in person. It also didn't fit in the space we needed it to fit.", 
    "This is what an inexpensive furniture should be: all wood construction, not a single particle board piece here, nice finish, great hardware, some pieces come already assembled, clear instructions. Assembly is very easy and quick. All parts are made of what appears to be pine - inexpensive, very lightweight, very nice finish, a pleasure to handle. Extra hardware is included, not a lot, but still a nice touch. The result is a great looking night stand (I do not think it is meant to be a side table despite the name). The only downside is the rails: it is a cheaper stamped metal type rails, drawer does not extend all the way (minor issue considering the use of this), the bigger issue is the noise - drawer is pretty noisy when moving.", 
    "Excellant quality table so happy we bought 2 plus the matching coffee table, really well made and fairly simple to assemble.", 
    "Easy to assemble,solid wood,great looking,Excellent table for the price", 
    "I bought this as part of sets. The media table, coffee table. They all match very well and well constructed. Assembly is a little complected and time consuming but it is well worth spending time. If you are not used to putting furniture together this may not be for you. It does come with a lot of small pieces and might overwhelm you. Love the material. It feels like very high quality solid wood.", 
    "I love this lovely piece of furniture and would order it again.", 
    "Very nice looking end tables. Perfect size for our living room. The drawer is a nice size where things can be stored and also a shelf to put books etc on. We bought two end tables. One the holes where drilled wrong so we had to drill new holes. But other than that they went together very well and look sharp in our home.", 
    "Received this product and began to assemble and discovered that one piece was missing. In addition, after assembly, the drawer did not work properly and is sticking.", 
    "Well made, very happy with style and color. Used between our recliners.", 
    "Looking for a middle sized accent table for the end of my Love seat. It's perfect. Tall lamp sits on it now. My brother put it together and was fairly easy to do. He said it was no problem.", 
    "End tables were of good quality and pretty easy to assemble one I figured out the lock screws. I love the color and that the wood is real and not particle board. I would order these again or recommend them for those who don't think they can put furniture together by themselves.", 
    "Love this table, only one complaint - the drawer sticks sometimes but not bad. Also the construction and quality is very good solid wood.", 
    "This is an adorable little table. I have mine standing alone in a bedroom. It is too low to be used as a bedside table and too low to stand beside a chair. It is perfect though to stand alone. The assembly was easy (20 minutes or so). It is a sturdy little table.", 
    "Arrived well protected and easy to put together. This is a base table for a slab of Indian granite. It is perfect for the room. I love the drawer because it holds things you need but do not want on the table all the time. Perfect for in front of the sofa. Color is very warm, and the weight is very solid.", 
    "I purchased two of the tables. My adult son put them together in a matter of minutes. The tables are solid and nicely finished. I had read the reviews about how small they were and they were on target. I have a leather low-profile sectional and they are still lower than the sectional. At first I wasn't sure about them, but they do look nice and are a good value so we are keeping them. The up side is there isn't much space to let things stack up and it keeps the clutter down.", 
    "assembled in less than one hour, solid wood, looks as pictured. good buy, very happy, would recommend", 
    "It was hard to tell what the tables would look like from the pictures on the Web page , but they looked nice so we thought we would take a chance and get them . They turned out to be exactly right for what we wanted and they blended well with our other wood furniture in the room . So we are very pleased with them and just ordered another piece of furniture from Overstock for another room in our house . Take the chance people if you like what you see .", 
    "I needed a honey stained wood end table large enough for a lamp. This was perfect and a great price.", 
    "I was hesitant to order these tables but so glad that I did. They are exact color I was looking for. They were easy to assemble also. So glad I bought them!!", 
    "These are quite small tables. For the modern high beds probably too small. OK for kids or spare rooms. 6 inches higher and they would work fine. Quite fussy to assemble - tiny parts and lots of them. Wood nice warm honey color, and reasonable quality. For the price - good value.", 
    "The first table I got was great loved it... The second one I ordered predrilled holes did not line up the top of table is not flat. The bottom of the drawer looks like its been wet so it's bent. Just got a bad batch.. Other than that the tables are really nice.", 
    "solid piece of furniture, arrived well packed and in perfect condition. assembly was fairly simple. solid wood, finished on all surfaces. well worth the price.", 
    "I really like this table. It is a bit shorter than i hoped but i love the style and color. I have assembled several furniture items and this was much easier to assemble than most and looks and feels very nice and sturdy", 
    "Great little table. It was just what I needed to put my printer on.", 
    "We had been looking for end tables for months. With finding out about your pricing and huge selection, we found exactly what we wanted. And we received exactly what we expected.", 
    "My Wife wanted these to replace some we had that did not have the right color of wood for the room. We were very pleased with the quality of these and found them fairly easy to assemble. They were a much better made than many of these type products. We are very satisfied with them.", 
    "Was easy to put together, has a beautiful finish and was exactly what I had been looking for.", 
    "They were a little darker than what it showed on the website. Easy to put together. Very nice product.", 
    "This table is good quality. It was easy to put together. It arrived quickly. The color is a little darker, but that was fine for us. Love the extra drawer for remotes so we don't lose them.", 
    "Overall, a good product and a great value. The materials are solid and the table is easy to assemble. The only disappointment is with the drawer. The quality of the slider hardware is definitely inferior to the rest of the table. It's also positioned too deep into the table, so the drawer pushes back further into the table than one might expect. I may replace the sliders with stock hardware from ***, but it works perfectly well for the present.", 
    "Te instructions were fairly clear and the end tables went together pretty easily. Nice real wood and they looked good after assembly. I am pleased with this product.", 
    "This table is a solid and made of good materials. It looks great after shining it up.", 
    "very happy with any purchases I have ordered several and would advise anyone to use this shopping tool.", 
    "Beautiful end table. Nice and sturdy. Easy to put together. Just ordered another & coffee table to match. Great prices!", 
    "This one I had a little problem with because I ordered the coffee table with this and I got the coffee table first and it was find, but the color looking at it, it appeared lighter online and when I received it, it was some what darker it wasn't to bad I would have liked it lighter. Had to wait for the end table to come back in stock and when the did I ordered it, when it came I put it together and now the draw was wrong I had two of one side that allows the draw to slide in the roller part was facing the inside of the draw, but I contact \"O\" and explain and they did get a proper draw to me."
