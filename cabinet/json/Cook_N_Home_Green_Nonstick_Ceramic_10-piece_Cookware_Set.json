    "I had my eye on this set of cookware because of the color, which matches my brand new kitchen perfectly. I didn't buy it right away and continued to shop around. I kept coming back to this one. Once I read the reviews of other customers who raved about this set, (how well this cookware works, that it's easy to clean, etc.), I decided to buy it. I figured, the price is so low that even if it didn't perform as well as expected, it still looks awesome in my kitchen.The good news is that everything I read about this cookware set is right on the money! I used some of the pots for my Thanksgiving dinner last night and I was thrilled. Best part of all is that they're super easy to clean and still look beautiful.If you are thinking of buying this set, just go for it! You'll be very happy you did.", 
    "I bought this set for my daughter-in-law and she just told me she LOVES, LOVES, LOVES it! Loves the color, loves the style and loves the way these pans cook food!", 
    "These are by far the best pots and pans I have ever owned. Clean up is a breeze. The pots and pans heat evenly, and I can cook at a lower temp. I am very glad I purchased this set. The color is very true to the picture as well.", 
    "Sizes and good, the frying pan is deep enough. Affordable.", 
    "These were worth the money, but once the bottom blackens from the gas burner, can't remove the black", 
    "I gave this as a gift to my 21 y/o son and he loves it. The color is cute and fresh and he doesn't have to worry about anything sticking and easy clean up.", 
    "These are lightweight, pretty, healthy to use. And the price was right!", 
    "I'd buy them again. Good quality for the casual cooking type person.", 
    "The set is not bad at all, if you like ceramic and cannot afford more expensive cookware. I am happy with the purchase.", 
    "i used once it was delivered. great product, great look!!", 
    "Great price, beautiful color and very easy to clean. Excellent value for the money.", 
    "Cooks food well and don't stick", 
    "Great affordable cookware just what I wanted in green to start my New Year's cooking more at home and healthier. Green reminds me. :)", 
    "Beautiful and durable. I love it!", 
    "Got these for my daughter. She likes them..", 
    "Great for cooking without losing food stuck to the pan. Food slides out even without oil/butter", 
    "Love the pots but the frying pans do not hold up well to oil and had to get rid of them after a period of time because of yellowing.", 
    "Everything is functional & bright. However, it is very difficult to get stains off the exteriors.", 
    "I found this cookware to be very light weight and the ceramic surface became \"pocked\" easily. I was very disappointed in this purchase. Each piece has some problem with the coating after just a few uses. I would not recommend buying this if you are a serious cook.", 
    "Great little fun colored pans but they do scratch within the first couple uses.", 
    "I recommend this product it gives you exactly what it says. Great value!", 
    "They cook pretty well & evenly. Easily marked in the bottom though.", 
    "Love these ceramic pans, so easy to clean and cook with", 
    "Love the nonstick cookware really easy to clean and they not burn easy", 
    "My daughter likes the set a lot.", 
    "I love this set. Nothing sticks and no cooking oils etc needed whatsoever!", 
    "Good pots for the price, easy to cook in and clean after cooking.", 
    "They cook evenly and food is beautiful, but concentric circular ridges on bottoms collect grease, so I need to scrub with steel wool to really get that out. Cooking surface cleans more easily, but I'm noticing hints of stains both inside and out that I don't want to scratch with steel wool, so need to find another product. Pros and cons.", 
    "We use the cookware every day with good results,we bought a set for my son(a Christmas gift).", 
    "My pots and pans are great.Very easy to cook in and wash when your done.No staining and there wonderful.", 
    "Great value, love the set.", 
    "Nice pieces. They have great weight to them. They are well made and have a nice non stick surface which is the same as the inside color so you cant see it.", 
    "We love the nonstick cookware because it needs so little if any oil and washes up so easily!", 
    "I have a lot of Le Creuset and these are far better. I love them.", 
    "this set is great, nothing sticks to them and they are ceramic, really happy with the quality, love cooking with them!", 
    "Cooks great with no stick,cleans easily, just wipe out and you're done. Little to no oil needed.", 
    "Had for few months now and use them often ....no complaints. I love the how easy they are to clean!", 
    "Very easy to clean. Good even cooking. Great look. Handles need to be tightened occasionally. Good for the price.", 
    "We have an old school coil-burner oven....the bottom of these pots have a great grip so they don't slide around while cooking. The green color is as shown and I love it! Honestly, these are the best pots we have owned!! Nothing gets stuck to the insides of them and they clean up so easily. The frying pans are way better than the \"green non stick\" pans you see around. Highly recommend and we are on about a year into owning this set!", 
    "I have used other items like these except this one really is special. Great to cook with and even easier to clean. I am so happy I purchased this set of cookware, it makes cooking so much easier.",

    "Incredible price -- more importantly such a quality product! I'm thrilled with it.", 
    "Love this set. Easy to clean and great for the price.", 
    "I appreciate the looks and so far the durability. Little touches like the rubber handles and a steam vent in the glass lids are nice. Haven't really tested them yet - i.e. fried eggs or cooked stews or any real stresses yet, but as of one month into it yes I like them", 
    "I've had plenty of Non-stick cookware and I have to say this is the best!", 
    "Everything you need in the kitchen.", 
    "Very nice set, took me awhile to get used to the bright green! Nice quality and came quickly!", 
    "Couldn't be any happier with the quality of this product. No complaints this far. Highly recommend this", 
    "love this ......................", 
    "I bought the cookware set for my son for his apartment and he was very pleased with them.", 
    "Pretty cookware set! Love the color! fast shipping!", 
    "These pieces are VERY light, and the handles get HOT with cooking. So you must remember to use pot holders with them. Also the handles do need re-tightening after a while, so look out for that too. They are easy to clean, however oil that gets on the botton does stain.", 
    "We don't cook much but bought this for my in-laws' visit. It's a very well priced set, much better than buying by piece at Target or Walmart", 
    "Not going to last long. Already looking old and I have not used much.", 
    "Great color, cooks evenly and cleans nicely.", 
    "love the color, they cook well also.", 
    "About this for our son in law and daughter for a Christmas present they were amazed at how AZ the cleanup and the cooking qualities of this item is", 
    "granddaughter happy with new cookware", 
    "I bought these for my daughter's new apartment and so I didn't have to travel with pots when I visit her in college. I was extremely happy and surprised at the quality and weight! Wish I had gotten a set for me!",

    "I purchased this set for my daughter and she loves it! She says it's easy to clean, cook evenly and the color is great. She's very pleased!", 
    "I just received these and after cooking a few meals with them, I am really enjoying the simple clean-up. So far, so good.", 
    "They heat well, wash easily. A great value. Love the green color to use as separate sets.", 
    "Though it's recommended to hand wash they clean up easy. A bit of dish soap and hot water gets the job done in seconds. Browns meat nicely without sticking to the pan. Just wish there would be an option to add a large, 12\" pan. I had to buy one separately.", 
    "I bought these pans for an apartment and I'm very pleased with the quality (so far). I've only used them a few times and I've been very careful not to use metal utensils, so they still look new. I do like the bright, cheery color and they are lightweight, which is a plus.", 
    "Bought this set for my son. Love that it is nonstick and easy to clean. Worth the price for sure.", 
    "love this set! Non sticky, light. perfect size. very easy to clean. one of the best sets I have ever owned. strongly recommend it!", 
    "I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this product, I am usually not the type to buy something without seeing it in person first. I have cooked with these dishes for over a week now and I am amazed at how easy they are to clean and how nothing yet hasn't gotten stuck to the plan. If you are looking for a quality set of dishes for under $ than I would buy these!", 
    "I love my cast iron fry pan that is properly cured but I find these pans just as good for cooking without having the food stick to the surface. But what I like the best is they don't scratch as easily as teflon pans. They clean up easily, cook evenly, and look great hanging in my kitchen. The only thing I could find negative is the fact that you should use a little oil, spray, or butter to achieve the results they show on TV.", 
    "Love this set of pots and pans. Very easy to clean and they look great. I bought the green set and I am very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "single living alone. just what i need. easy clean up easy storage just what a new bachelor needs.", 
    "I bought these as a gift for a family member. I have since only heard raves over them. I used them to cook one night at their house, and I was very pleased with the quality of them. Clean up well, sturdy, lids fit well.", 
    "I do very little cooking, so this set of pots/pans is perfect for me. I love the color and the glass lids. The lids have an opening to let some steam escape, which I like. I don't think the lining would last through heavy use for long, but I enjoy mine and they truly meet my needs. I would order them again, as well as recommend them to my peers.", 
    "A great deal for amount paid", 
    "I received this as a gift for my new apartmenT. I am pleased with how sturdy and durable this set is. Never thought I would love a pan so much...", 
    "Love this set. Every time I think \"This time I'm sure they are going to be hard to clean\" I am wrong. Everything washes off so easily. Would definitely recommend this set! (Plus I love the green color!)", 
    "It wasn't what I expected. I expected it to have an anodized aluminum inside the pots/pans. I returned it, and am watching for anodized pots/pans on Overstock network. I'm sure the set would be great for someone who was not as specific as I am.", 
    "We used it a few times couple months after that everything cook in it was thick not recommended"
