  "reviews": [
    "Nice product for the price. Another reviewer stated it came assembled, but Overstock clearly shows this is NOT assembled. Easy assembly though, took appx 20 minutes. Cheap drywall anchors/inplants, but quick fix is changing to heavier duty ones when securing to the wall.", 
    "I am very happy with the look of this product. it came fully assembled and was easy to hang", 
    "Very clean simple design easy to build. Looks just like the picture", 
    "This is a nice cabinet for the price. Easy to out together and all pieces were included.", 
    "This looks great in out bathroom and is a well made piece. I would recommend.", 
    "Fits my needs. Looks like good quality. No complaints", 
    "great storage, nice size.", 
    "This was for an office bathroom and it's perfect. Hangs true and just big enough for the girly stuff we like to have in the bathroom.", 
    "Fits perfect for additional storage", 
    "It does what it needs to do. Looks good. Came in one piece, just needed to hang it", 
    "Looks great. Directions were clear. Had it together I'm 30 minutes.", 
    "But this is in no way a high end quality piece, but we didn't pay a high end price. It looks nice and it is spacious inside.", 
    "Came with 2 pieces that were the same and missing a vital piece instead (these pieces are the sides of the cabinet). Since the piece was wrong, I had to drill new holes to be able to assemble it.", 
    "Haven't installed yet. I hope it's good", 
    "Took longer to put together than I anticipated, but the directions were actually very clear, and all of the pieces were clearly marked and matched the directions. It's your typical manufactured wood piece, which has somewhat of a cheap look to it. Overpriced for what you get though.", 
    "Love this! Our temporary house had no medicine cabinet. This works great.", 
    "Very Nice addition, great space saver.", 
    "Great cabinet and good quality for money for sure.", 
    "Good quality piece for the price. We looked at many other cabinets similar to this & this price was much better than the others. Quality is good, cabinet doors dont line up perfectly.", 
    "easy assembly and quality product", 
    "The cabinet was easy to assemble and looks nice in our bathroom. The trim gives it more character than similiar cabinets.", 
    "I really like this cabinet. It is simple, but more affordable than anything at Lowe's and Home Depot that I liked. The shelf inside is adjustable to fit anything you need. Good storage piece that gets the toilet paper and other toiletries off of the floor. Would buy again if needed for another bathroom.", 
    "This cabinet looks perfect in my girls bathroom. It came quickly and was easy to put together. Works perfectly in a small space to add storage.", 
    "It is the size I wanted for a bathroom makeover. However, upon assembly, it was clear that the doors would touch in the middle slightly. It's not a big deal as the doors still close, but it's obvious that the cabinet is not quite 'straight' when assembled. Still looks good so i kept it and used handles to match the rest of the bathroom. Works for what I need.", 
    "I love this cabinet. It allows me to get my \"stuff\" off the bathroom vanity, yet it's right there, at my fingertips for use. It looks VERY NICE, quality is exceptional for the price, and there's plenty of room to store all of my skin care products! And the bottom shelf is open to display something pretty.", 
    "Wasn't happy about having to put this together, but it wasn't difficult at all. Instructions were simple...easy to follow. Looks really nice hanging on my bathroom wall. Love the final product.", 
    "Lots of pieces and parts but good instructions. Hinges are flimsy and the doors were hard to align.", 
    "This cabinet was fairly simple to assemble and is very substantial. It is perfect over the toilet in our bathroom. Love it.", 
    "My bath has very little area for storing those daily items like make up, hair spray etc. this cabinet fit well and looks great! Husband found it easy to assemble and all the parts were well marked to the directions. The only negative was the hanging screws, they were a little fliimzy so he used another to hang.", 
    "Looks nice but came missing the mounting hardware.", 
    "This might be just a little smaller than I thought it would be, but still very functional. Solid, good cabinet.", 
    "I love everything regarding this cabinet. The only reason it did not receive 5 stars was due to the difficulty of hanging it on the wall.", 
    "I needed a small white cupboard for above my toilet in the master bath. This is small but well made (after the hubs glued and assembled - it's sturdy). It's finished on the side nicely because you see that when entering my bathroom. I wanted to change the handles to match my vanity - but these are undersized and the two hole drill is not standard - so I left the ones that came with it. The color is white and not off white.", 
    "Great cabinet. Easy to put together. Is steady and heavy. Lots of storage room for all of my bathroom items. It was a perfect fit on the wall over the toilet.", 
    "A little difficult to hang but so far so good. Nice, clean lines.", 
    "I had been wanting a small cabinet for my bathroom as it didn't have one. This was exactly what I needed to get the clutter off my vanity and out of sight. I am very happy with my choice. This is my 4th. order from Overstock and am pleased with all of them. Shipping time is always short or reasonable.", 
    "The cabinet was easy to put together is light but sturdy and looks supr cute in our bathroom. Our bathroom is small so it's perfect size. I looked at other cabinets in other stores but they were too big and more then ***$. This is a great product if u got small bathroom. Looks beautiful !", 
    "Good product .it serves my purpose very well."
