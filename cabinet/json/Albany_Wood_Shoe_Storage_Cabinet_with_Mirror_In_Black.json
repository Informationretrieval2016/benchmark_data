    "Looks exactly like the picture, looks nice but truly isn't practical. Had NO instructions to put it together. Which btw was very very hard to do! Have tons of screws, parts, etc. Took hours to put together. Doesn't fit very many shoes, and gets dirty very easily obviously from hands having to touch the mirrors to open every day for shoes. Looks nice, That's all I can really give it!", 
    "I really like this cabinet. It is beautiful- exactly the way that was pictured. I cannot comment to how it was set up (it was a christmas gift) but the person who did construct it said it took hours and was not easy. The reason I give it only 4 stars is because my shoes don't actually fit. I have rather large feet (women's size 10) so this could be the problem. I managed to figure out that if you put them in sideways and at an angle, things fit so it is useable. But a word of caution if you have a lot of heels: there is a barrier in the middle of the rack. I am unsure if it is removable but it means that high heels cannot be placed in the \"normal\" way.Even with all of this in mind, I still really love it. I didn't realize this when I asked for it for christmas but the mirror is great to check out your shoes and see how they look with your outfit!"
