    "This Christopher Knight headboard is one of the smartest purchases I have made. Great quality, great price, fast shipping are just the start of this smart move. My wife and I were going to make one very similar to the one we bought and we couldn't be more happy. A wonderful addition to our bedroom. Highly recommended.", 
    "I asked my husband to pick out the headboard he liked and this was the one he choose. Looks very high end. Well made and really compliments my beige bedroom!!! Also due to size, was great to have delivered right to front door.", 
    "Was looking for a black, king size headboard but the price on this gray velvet was too good to pass up. As usual, I wasn't disappointed with the C. Knight line of furniture.", 
    "Fits my king bed perfectly. I was keeping my fingers crossed because of the low price but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived! The only minor complaint I have was that the bolts that came with it did not fit in the slots of my headboard bracket of my bed frame. But a quick run to the hardware store and 10 bucks later, it was fixed and installed. I am extremely happy with my purchase!", 
    "The legs came damaged and we had to make our own", 
    "absolutely LOVE how this headboard looks", 
    "We have debated over a headboard for years and finally settled on this one, based on the reviews and photos. We chose the gray velvet one and couldn't be happier. It was easy to install, with one exception. The screws it comes with are 8mm. The holes in our King mattress frame (standard floor frame, nothing fancy) did not fit the screws, so I ran to the local hardware store and found a set of 7mm which worked perfectly. It's been very stable. A good buy for the money.", 
    "Beautiful and we'll built. A little disappointed that the tufting has no buttons as the photo looks like it does. It's still very beautiful and a great price so I'm keeping it!", 
    "the picture makes you think there are buttons, but there are not. Still, it is a nice looking headboard. We are please with it.", 
    "Very sturdy and perfect for our king bed!", 
    "Love this headboard. Lovely!"
