    "I purchased this cabinet after being unable to find any wooden vanity cabinets that I liked - there was not one made to match our new bathroom vanity, so I opted for this unfinished piece. Quality is very good. Was pleased to see sample wood for testing stain color before starting to stain actual product. Overall, very pleased. I liked that it was recessed as well. Looking forward to having it mounted and ready to go.", 
    "I cut the panel out and made picture a frame cabinet door.", 
    "perfect for replacing the cheap plastic/mirrored ones. Slim,clean lines, paintable, used left or right, with or without knob", 
    "I wanted cabinets without mirrors, able to be stained,of good quality and a specific width. These were are ideal. Very good quality throughout.", 
    "Very well made and easy to install", 
    "The quality for this little cabinet is beyond what I was expecting. What really took me by surprise was the care that went into the packaging and shipping. Everything was properly isolated from scratching any thing else. Padding everywhere. I would hope that in the future the company would move away from using so much Styrofoam and use more cardboard. At least not use the packing peanuts which are harder to find places to recycle them.The cabinet construction is very good but a word of warning. The back panel needs to be assembled on site. I bought 3 units and 2 of the 3 were slightly out of square so I had to square them up when putting on the back. This is normal for constructing a cabinet but I suspect that a lot of DIY folks who order this may not have built custom cabinets. When you square the cabinet you need to align the bottom edge and nail the back on, then use the cabinet back to help you align the cabinet to square and start nailing to hold the position.I was also very impressed that they send some wood scraps of the cabinet ply so you can use them for stain samples."
