    "I bought this piece for a guest bedroom. I was most concerned about the color, its hard to find colored bookshelves and I needed a particular hue of off white. The color is perfect for what I wanted. The quality was better than I expected. It goes together very easily - did it in about 15 minutes and you cannot tell its a self assembly - all the fasteners are hidden. Its very sturdy, takes a littel muscle to move once its assembled. The only complaint I have is the shelf feet. These are the little feet that goe into the holes that the shelves sit on. The feet themselves are high quality, metal with rubber coating, butthey dont fit the holes well - the holes are too big and they fall out unless the shelve is sitting on it.", 
    "Super easy to put together. It took me less than 15 minutes to assemble it by myself and it appears to be pretty sturdy.", 
    "The top of the bookcase was split across the top (through the delivery maybe?), two of the shelves were a little too big and scratched the sides when put in. It is easy to put together though, and I like the style & color. I think the price is a little high for what you actually get.", 
    "Make sure you know the dimensions. it really isn't \"tall\" for a \"tall bookcase\". Upon taking the pieces out of the box I found a broken piece. i called and emailed the manufacturer and never have gotten a response. We made it work anyway. The paint job is very poor. oh, there are no huge defects, but there are alot of places where there were air bubbles in the paint, and if you look closely you can see where they popped and there are small \"holes\" in the paint. It would have been too hard to put it all back in the box to ship back so we used it in a back workroom instead of in one of the front offices like it was ordered for.", 
    "It's a little narrower than I expected it to be, but it holds all the books and things I wanted to put in it. It was very simple assembly. But the finish on the wood has a very strong chemical odor, I had to sleep with the windows open last night because the smell was unbearable. I hope it goes away after a couple of days.", 
    "Decent little bookcase. Assembly was a bit of a pain as one of the screw holes had been painted over, but it seems pretty solid after that challenge. It's not perfect, as there are a few not-too-noticeable dings and sloppy paint issues, but overall it's pretty nice.", 
    "This is a VERY nice bookcase....especially for the price!!!....It was not that difficult to assemble.....I did it by myself, and I am a 62 year old woman!!.....Very pleased!!!!", 
    "I needed a white book shelf for my daughter's room. The style is excellent, and easy to put together. The quality is acceptable though not superb, as it's not all made of real wood. Also, it's pretty small for the price, therefore a 4 star.", 
    "Easy cheesy to put together until you get to the shelves which is usually the easy part. Just make sure that the direction is correct, and you should have no problem", 
    "Nice looking shelves. Easy to assemble. Sturdy. The color and paint were good quality. I bought one and decided to order a second identical shelf", 
    "I love this bookcase! Even my husband was impressed by the high quality material and construction, how easy it was to assemble, and it works perfectly in my home office.", 
    "Item is well made and easy to put together. Fits nicely in space it was bought for. Probably a little overpriced. After I purchased this item I found it for $$ cheaper.", 
    "This is a nice shelf. Bottom fixed shelf came cracked in mine and Overstock was RIGHT THERE with a replacement. Major applause to O.co for that. The finish on this has a touch of a strong varnish or oil based odor to it. Not caustic, noxious or anything... just \"there\" Wearing off though. The thing is sturdy and level and holds my books and junk so 5 stars there.", 
    "Book case is a perfect size for my daughters room, which has a sloped ceiling. The shelves are equil depths apart. I wish one of the shelves was further apart for taller books, but I made do by putting the larger book sideways. Sturdy and attractive. Bookshelf looks perfect with my daughter's bedroom furniture. The sand color is a light beige and works well with her cream colored bedroom furniture.", 
    "Product description states that the color is black, but it is more a grey/navy. If you are looking for a true black, this is not it!", 
    "I ordered 2 of these and they are excatly what I needed. I was looking for something taller for a small room but I liked the look of these and they actually worked out very well. I measured the areas where I would be placing them so I knew what to expect. They were easy to put together and they look fantastic. Only problem is that the company shorted me on 4 of the shelf brackets. The instructions do not give a phone number, only an email. I emailed right away that I needed just 4 shelf brackets. No response. I gave it 10 days and emailed again. No response. Ended up going to Home Depot and buying 4 universal shelf brackets. Kind of a pain, so as much as I liked these, I would not order from that particular company again since their customer service is lacking and there are lots of other choices on Overstock. Thankfully I wasn't missing a whole shelf or anything!", 
    "I needed two 4' bookcases to fit on either side of an entertainment center -- not for components (the entertainment center has plenty of shelves) but to store other things like books and baskets of \"stuff.\" I found several 4' bookcases but most looked really cheap, had a finish I didn't like, or were too wide (I needed 2' wide). These looked PERFECT in terms of size, and they are. My entertainment center is ivory so I was going to get black as a contrast, but the lamps I'm using are a deep bronze and I thought they'd be too dark on the black, so I crossed my fingers and went with ivory (very hard to match different shades of \"ivory\"!). Alas, the color is slightly different -- the bookcases are much brighter (much closer to white) than my entertainment center, but they are pretty close, and if it ever really starts to bug me, I can just paint them black. Assembly was very easy -- took maybe 15 minutes for the first and 10 for the second, but then, I'm the type who reads the instructions over about 20 times before I start as I am not mechanically inclined in the least. I do wish that the screwdriver they included was a right-angle one, as I have relatively small hands and I still had a bit of a hard time tightening the bolt in a couple of places. Not a big deal, though, and certainly not enough to take off any stars! I am very happy with my purchase -- in fact, I may buy 2 more (in black this time) for my living room.", 
    "Great bookcase for compact space! Solid wood. Very well made. Easy to put together.", 
    "This bookcase is adorable! Yes, it is rather small but that came as no surprise as the dimensions described are accurate. It is also a bit pricey compared to most other furniture of its kind, but it is well worth the money. It is solid, it came in perfect condition, it was super easy to put together (it literally took me about 7 minutes since there are no small or cheap pieces), and the little details like the rubber coated shelve holders and side details make it a great buy.", 
    "I like that this piece looks like I paid more for it than I did! I had trouble with a panel in which the hole was malformed but Overstock sent me a replacement and it fit fine. I really like this!", 
    "This is a quality book case, so much nicer than ikea. The best part is I bought this with my rewards, so it was at no extra cost. Looks beautiful in my daughter's room. Slightly off white color is lovely! Very pleased!!! And, very easy to put together. Looks as good as ones seen at pottery barn kids to me.", 
    "The people helping me put it together and I were fairly surprised at how sturdy the piece was. It is able to handle all my heavy books, and it looks really nice. It came with just enough screws (no extra ones) and its own screwdriver. Just keep in mind that if you are looking for real solid wood, this is not the bookshelf for you. The horizontal shelf pieces were particle board. Nevertheless, I plan on keeping it with me.", 
    "This ais a lovely small scale bookcase ideal for a small room-very nice design and easy assembly.", 
    "Only complaint is that one shelf is a little narrow but it still works. I'm very pleased .", 
    "Love this bookcase! Excellent quality and easy to put together! Very happy with my first purchase from overstock.com! Arrived before the estimated date.", 
    "This product is quality on par with bookcases costing 2 or 3 times as much. My brother who is a builder was impressed with the build quality. Very easy to assemble with 2 people.", 
    "This bookcase was fantastic. It looks much more expensive than it is, and was easy to put together in about 20 minutes (I am a woman who doesn't consider herself to be particularly handy). I couldn't believe the other reviews that talked about how long it took to put together and that they needed 2 people, etc. One thing I would note is to pay attention to the dimensions in the description. I was expecting a much taller bookcase, but I didn't read the dimensions beforehand :)", 
    "I had limited space on either side of a double window for a small sunroom that we're using for an office. I bought 2 of these because the dimensions were just what I needed. They have great style and add a nice touch to the room. I've already been asked where I got them. There is room to adjust the shelves a little if necessary. I got the sand color and am very happy with my choice. They look like a more expensive piece of furniture. I would recommend them.", 
    "I need a small-ish bookcase for my living room, this fit the bill. I was able to assemble myself, took me about 20 minutes. Bookcase looks great for what I needed.", 
    "I needed this for a specific space. It fits perfectly and was exactly what I expected, maybe even better. I am very pleased.", 
    "A snap to put together and fits in well with vintage pieces in a shabby chic bedroom.", 
    "This bookcase was a great purchase. Definitely worth the money! It was fairly easy to assemble and the wood is gorgeous. The color is lovely and I love the scrollwork detailing on the sides. Plus, the shelves are sturdy and are able to hold all my heavy books!", 
    "I like the book case. The color is exactly what I was looking for. It is a bit smaller than I thought. I have plenty of books and they don't fit. If you are not looking for something big. This is it. Very nice looking book case", 
    "My husband and I were both really impressed with the quality of this bookcase. We have seen more expensive bookcases lack the wood and finishing that this case provides. I looked at dozens and dozens of bookcases online and read all the reviews before selecting this one. You just can't beat this price for a very heavy, solid wood bookcase. The shelves and back are all solid and it looks like a case we had several years ago from Ethan Allen that costs 4x as much. My husband had it together in less than 15 minutes- maybe 10. We placed it in my home office as I have just started a doctoral program and needed a new bookcase for my future studies. I have designed my home office in a chabby chic style with traditional furniture some pieces are cherry and antique white woods. I did expect the bookcase to be a bit more antique white. It's not as off-white as I expected, but it looks really good. I am so glad I found this one, and as I mentioned, my husband could not believe the price paid for the quality received.", 
    "Highest quality self-assembled bookcase I've ever had. It's really solid, pretty to look at, and super simple to assemble. Takes maybe 15 minutes and all needed tools are supplied. None of the shelf fasteners are visible once assembled. I will echo the reviewer who mentioned the shelf-holding tabs don't stay in place without a shelf resting on them, but that's a minor quibble. The holders themselves are super high quality, just like the rest of the bookcase."
