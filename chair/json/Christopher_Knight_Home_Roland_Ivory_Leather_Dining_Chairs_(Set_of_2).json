  "reviews": [
    "Should have paid closer attention to dimensions. Returned, ordered larger chairs. Great customer service, no hassle return.", 
    "I can't believe they came assembled! There's a switch. Lovely chairs, a little on the small side. I had bought them because they matched the seat height of my previous chairs. I have a low height table, and my old chairs had a stiff cushion, so there wasn't any give. These feel like the seat of a 50's automobile - very comfortable - and have enough give that I could have gone an inch or two up in seat height. They'll certainly suit their purpose until I get a new table.", 
    "Cushions are so soft you sit 2\" lower. We are disappointed and have no real option. We had discarded the packing. The quality is fair. Buttons on seat backs are loose and catch everything, so we do not expect them to last as we had hopped. We had been looking at a similar chair at **** ***, however your chair is far inferior. Future orders, if any, will be effected greatly by this item. Pictures can be deceiving.", 
    "I love them . it makes me feel like I'm rich", 
    "These chairs are great quality, sturdy & a beautiful cream color! They were packaged nicely & all four arrived in excellent condition. My husband loved the fact that they came assembled!! Overstock rocks!!", 
    "I love these chairs. I bought two to start with to go with my oak dining table, and as soon as I had the money, I got two more. They are more cream or off-white than white, but not too yellow or dark. The leather is very pretty, and the chairs are pretty comfortable to sit in. They are on the smaller side, so check the dimensions before you order. They were delivered quickly and arrived in excellent condition.", 
    "very lightweight, really small seat. came with button falling off.", 
    "These were sent to my daughter as a well needed gift and she indicated their worth", 
    "they are beautiful! Keep in mind that if you have guests that weigh 200 pounds or more, they may not hold up to that load often. But for average sized people, they are comfortable and gorgeous! We use them as accent pieces and up to the table as need arises with guests. Packaged very well, no damage at all, no assembly required...just unwrap and enjoy!!! Thank you, Overstock!", 
    "They were nice for the money.", 
    "I bought these chairs to accompany my antique dining room table. I did not want anything big, heavy and bulky.These were perfect, lightweight, not too wide, comfortable, firm and overall appealing.", 
    "I needed new chairs for my kitchen area. Side by side they look about the same size of my previous chairs, but feel just a bit small when I sit in them (I'm 5' 7\"). But they look nice and are fairly comfortable (My husband and son - both about 6' - felt they were comfortable as well). Plus I wanted something that looked a little more modern, light in color, and kid friendly for my 6 year old - and these fit the bill on all three. Overall, I feel like these were a very good buy.", 
    "Very nice! Very good quality. Exceptionally comfortable!", 
    "The chairs arrived in great order, well packaged. They look and feel great...will be easy to keep clean...may order another 2 later.", 
    "Nice dinning room chairs. Got four of the ivory color. My son loves them. Modern mix with his grandmother's old dark table looks even better.Thank you Overstock.com"
