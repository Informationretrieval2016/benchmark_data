    "I received this cabinet 2 days ago and assembled it last night. Overall the quality of the cabinet is very poor, it looks cheap (handles are plastic) and it is made of compressed particle board which is not durable. It is also very very heavy, around 95 lbs. The only positive thing is that I am a girl and I was able to put it together in about 1 hr. I would not buy this cabinet again and would instead invest money on something that will last for at least a few years. Save your money.", 
    "This was one of the best things I have bought from Overstock. ....for the money it does the job, easy enough to put up...When my mother saw it, guess what..another order coming our way for her. Shoes are now easily avialable and dust free, while the huge cabinet kept all of our stuff in place. VERY useful cabinet that is worth much more than the cost - what a bargain!!! :)", 
    "I ordered this one day and was amazed that it was at my door two days later! Some of the reviewers said that the quality of this cabinet wasn't very good. So I was a little concerned when I bought it, but for the price, I wouldn't have expected a solid wood piece of furniture. Once assembled, it looks nice and really improved our entryway which always looked like a mess with all our shoes laying around. I was definitely pleasantly surprised by how good it looks. The assembly was very simple. My eleven year old daughter and I assembled it in no time! Just make sure that you building it close to it's permanent location. It is quite heavy and would be very difficult to move across carpeting without some lifting.", 
    "Heavy and Solid, but overall really good product.Very well packaged. instruction was clear. relatively easy to assemble. it was many pieces as expected to put together, but is still doable with only one person", 
    "The cabinet arrived in good shape, quite heavy. The materials were nice, handles were metal-like. Assemble was easy, but we made some mistakes and had to redo it. The bottom cracked when we redid it. Overall, it's a nice cabinet, sturdy and holds as many pairs of shoes as it can!", 
    "The cabinet was very affordable and the shipping was fast, it came to me in just a matter of days. It was easy to assemble and the cabinet is very heavy that's probably why it's so sturdy. So glad I bought it, it keeps my kids organized and my garage clean with no shoes scatter every where.", 
    "I bought this shoe rack because my closet was getting way too full. This unit was easy to assemble and fits alot of shoes. I put all my summer shoes and sport shoes! I didn't even have to use the outside shelves and gave that to my boyfriend. It's a little pricier than what I wanted to spend and the wood does scratch very easily but I'm glad I bought it cause now I can walk into my closet. PS I am a female and put this whole thing together in about and hour and 15 minutes. The directions are very easy to floor and I was not short on any parts. In fact I got more than what I needed.", 
    "It keeps my whole family organized with no shes thrown all over the place. It took about a little over half an hour to assemble but easy to assemble. Quality is great, sturdy shelves to stores all the shoes and it looks nice. The price was great but the shipping was even better, less than a week. Great stuff, and worth buying.", 
    "My wife has tons of shoes and she would leave it everywhere!, and I always trip over it. So when I saw this on the webiste I jumped on it right away. I bought 2 so it can consume all her millions of shoes. It arriveed pretty fast so that was pretty cool, and it didn't take long at all to put it together. I stored all her shoes inside and when she arrived, she loved it! It has been months and she still loves it. Good price for shoe cabinets and the quality is is cool!", 
    "My wife bought this to tidy up part of her shoe collection and naturally I am the one that need to assemble it. You'll need plenty of floorspace to assemble it & identify all the parts. It takes 25 minutes to unpack it, lay out the bits, identify each one & read the instructions. It went together nicely, overall product is definitely sturdy. Works perfectly for her!", 
    "My shoes are happy in this roomy and oversized cabinet. I must admit that I was surprised by the size when I put it together. It is a heavy unit and should last a while.", 
    "It came way ahead of the scheduled time and it only took me less than hour to set it up and I'm so happy with the end result. Good quality cabinet that has a lot of room for all my wonderful shoes!!", 
    "The perfect shoe cabinet size that I've been looking for. It gives me all the room I need for my shoes and the quality is great. I bought the dark brown and it goes well with the rest of my furniture color and the very sturdy too. Easy access on the right for everyday shoes, and also access inside the cabinet for special occasions Just perfect for my need.", 
    "This is a great piece for the price. If you have ever setup Ikea furniture before, you may feel that a couple extra screws/holders could have been added, which leads me to my only negative. The glue that comes with the piece to make sure the wooden pegs are firmly secured is not that strong in my opinion. The wooden pegs do not always fit firmly within the hole, so some extra glue was required. I didn't think the glue was strong enough, so I used a combination of the glue provided and crazy glue. Other than the glue issue, this is a great piece of furniture. I have size 10 1/2 feet, and all my shoes were able to fit with the door closed. I also took out some of the panels on the right and created a mini bookshelf Quality- Compressed particle board, but feels very solid, a lot better than any Ikea furniture I have assembled Ease of Setup- It took me about 1 hour to complete setup Notes: Make sure the glue is completely dry and solid before trying to move the cabinet. The pieces on the bottom are essentially held together by the pegs and glue, so if you try to push it along a carpet before drying, they could begin to shift b/c of the weight of the piece.", 
    "It truly provided a nice look to our rear entryway where we prefer to enter our home. The handles are cheap in appearance but my husband just went out and purchased handles that looked better. However, the holes for the hinges easily loosen up and enlarge due to the poor quality of the 'wood' or MDF. The screws basically ripped and fell out of the hinges, and we often find the door to the shoe cabinet fallen from the base of the cabinet. This is after just five months of use and ownership. It was a waste of money, and I highly recommend you do not purchase this item.", 
    "This product was great.. does not look cheap ... my husband put it together with no problem :) over all I love it :)", 
    "The shoe cabinet was great, can hold a lots of shoes, my house is clean now.", 
    "I bought this just because I love such design (half close and half open), which I only found at overstock.", 
    "it met our expectation and it looks good for the area.", 
    "Nice shoe organizer and great for multi purpose items. Great price!", 
    "Love the idea on the whole shoe cabinet. Delivery was great and easy to put together and the shoe cabinet is very sturdy and it looks great in my closet.", 
    "So glad I bought this for myself, all my shoes are now stored in a nice place and it has help me from looking all around for them. I didn't spend very much on this but received fast delivery and putting it together was also easy. The shoe cabinet is also sturdy and a lot of room.", 
    "This cabinet which I love so much it has been very helpful with organizayitional skills. It provide a nice place for shoes needed ofen on the outer storage and the shoes I rarely use inside. Plus the quality and the color finished is great. I'm glad that I bought this one.", 
    "The shoe cabinet looks good and pretty sturdy. It isn't hard to put together. It also fits lots of shoes, I put mine and my husband's in there and we still got room to spare. The only thing that looks cheap is the handle, but that can be easily changed by buying a new one at any hardware store. Overall, this is a good buy.", 
    "Bought it for my wife and she loved it! It was quite easy to assemble and each shelf is made out of solid wood and very strong. So great deal. My wife is happy and now she can put all her shoes in their and of course not mine. Well that's the way the ball rolls.", 
    "It was very easy to assemble and is very nice. Holds a lot of shoes. Makes my closet look so much neater and organized.", 
    "It's certainly a nice piece of furniture for the price and to store shoes in.", 
    "This cabinet is great!!!! I would highly recommend it . It is well worth the money. Easy to put together. It is quite heavy about 92 pounds. I bought one and when my husband saw it he bought one for our downstairs. It has really organized my room and it is a very pretty addition to the decor.", 
    "Practical, neat, and definitely inexpensive cabinet for how much room it offers. I am using it as a TV cabinet for my bedroom and it is sturdy enough to hold my 35\" TV - this is indeed a multi-purpose cabinet not just shoes alone. Very versatile piece of furniture for every household.", 
    "This is slightly wider than we wanted it to be but knew what we were getting into. Currently it is holding 31 pairs of shoes, a combination of my feet (size 9 women's) and my husbands (size 12 mens). My favourite part is having the door to close shoes behind. I just wish is was available in white.", 
    "My entryway has been a mess of shoes (mostly my husband's big clonkers) and I wanted to find good storage for all our shoes once and for all. I bought two of these cabinets and have placed them side-by-side in my entryway. It looks so good!!! I like that it doesn't protrude far from the wall and the height is very nice as well. The price is amazing for what you get. Assembly was straight forward with no confusion, though it does take some time to first take everything out of the the packaging and get all the tiny styrofoam pieces off the boards. All together it took me about 5 hours to build two of these cabinets, including taking out the trash. One thing you must make sure of: If you are planning on storing men's shoes that are larger than size 11 the cabinets probably will not close unless you plan to store the shoes sideways. My husband is a size 10.5 and all his shoes just BARELY fit in the cabinets (thank goodness).", 
    "simple and functional. good for the price. Have enough room to store 8 pairs of shoes in the open section and 16 pairs shoes in the closed section. My foyer is no longer cluttered. I am very happy for that.", 
    "My mom bought this for my room and I love it! My dad did the whole set of the thing and it was quick because maybe I was rushing him but everything was assembled in like 15-20 minutes so I was so happy and eager to put all my shoes already. I love it! It can carry all my shoes and holds all my shoes without any of the shelfs falling down and the the color looks very nice.", 
    "Bought one and it was such a great idea! I can store the summer shoes inside the cabinet and leave the winter shoes outside where it's easy access. Such a smart idea. Plus it comes with instructions that's very easy to follow with pictures to show you step by step, so helpful. This cabinet is such a great idea, I'm really enjoying it.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for. The only issue I have is that I have to put some of my shoes sideways or else I can't close the doors (size 11 or larger might have this issue). Other than that its great. Easy access to shoes I wear regularly and hides the rest of them behind closed doors.", 
    "My wife compared several products, finally we found this. It is perfect for our apartment size, and the price is reasonable. Assembly wasn't difficult and the cabinet is built in a way that you can practically use it for any purposes.", 
    "Although the individual pieces seemed flimsy at first the whole structure is actually very stable and suitable for purpose. Instructions were sensible and clear enough. The finish is even for all pieces, so that's definitely a plus. Shipping was fast. So far, I'm really loving this cabinet. Now all my shoes have a home. :)", 
    "This cabinet is big, heavy , and requires a good amount of time to assemble. The pieces are made of pressed wood, so don't tighten them too much or the wood will split. There's a lot of storage for shoes of all sizes. Be careful of shoes that are larger than size 10 1/2 as the door won't close fully.", 
    "The design itself is fine. The problem I have with it is that it stinks! It's got a super potent chemical smell that doesn't go away for at least half a year. Every time I open the cabinet door to get a pair of shoes, I have to hold my breath for a few second. I put several plants that clean the air around the area to help reduce the chemical. It helps a little.", 
    "I have way too many shoes and nowhere to put them so I decided to buy this because it looked great and I hate over-the-door shoe racks. Really what convinced me to buy it was the great reviews, the color and it looked functional. I was completely wrong. The instructions were terrible and it took almost three hours to set up. There were no words only pictures and there were not clear as to what to do. I got sent the wrong screws and I had go to the local Lowe's to buy the right kind of equipment. The back part part is incredibly woobly and there is little I can do to fix it. For shoes it is functional but I would not put something heavy in it for fear of it falling over.For the money it is not worth, I could have probably got the something for the same quality for about half the price. The only thing that I like about it is the color.", 
    "I really love this cabinet (I didn't buy it to use with shoes but it works perfect for my blankets and scrapbooks:)", 
    "Overall, this was an excellent value. The cabinet is fairly easy to put together - my husband and I assembled it in less than 2 hours. Just a warning that if you have shoes that are over a size 9-10 male, the cabinet door may not be able to shut if the shoes are placed in vertically. Also the amount of shoes it can store is much higher than what is estimated in description. We can fit fifteen size 9 men's shoes in the cabinet with the doors and another ten pair on the open shelving. For women's shoes, 16-25 pair in the cabinet with doors and another 15 on the open shelves (regular high heels, tennies - Ugg type boots take more room). I'm really glad we made this purchase. We are an Asian household and we used to have shoes piled up by the front door. This cabinet allows us to keep our shoes close at hand and makes our house look neat and clean!", 
    "I am a shoe collector and was excited when I found out there was a product made just for my shoes. I had been storing my shoes in boxes and after some time it became hard to find the shoes I was looking for. I read all the reviews and was excited about the positive comments that were left. I had to order two of these shoe cabinets and they came to the front store. The assembly was not a problem and I put both together myself it took me 1 hr 1/2 to put one of them together. I am glad I listened to the reviews because it is better to assemble the cabinet close or in the same area where you want to put it. The cabinet can be heavy for one person so having an extra hand is a plus. Overall, I was surprised by the quality and I must say the shoe cabinets are very sturdy and I love the color of the wood. I think the shoe cabinet can look good anywhere you want to put it because it has the design where the shoe cabinet could be placed in the hallway or in my case in my closet. Overall 5 stars very happy with the product.", 
    "very poor materials. not real wood", 
    "Easy to assemble...looks great...who could ask for more", 
    "My best piece of furniture is for my shoes. How fun!", 
    "Solid cabinet and easy to assemble. My guests are always complimenting.", 
    "It's useful and I like it a lot.", 
    "This piece was nicer than I thought it would be for the price and although, took two of us to put it together, it wasn't too bad.", 
    "Easy to build, just make sure you build it where you're gonna be placing the unit. Love that its 2/3 covered by 2 doors, nice look for the price.", 
    "Enough Space and side shelves are comfortable to use.", 
    "Very poor craftsmanship, not at all what I expected it to be.", 
    "Good Item. Prompt delivery. Easy assembly.", 
    "We bought this as a shoe cabinet. It met our expectations. It's made from cheap pressured wood and it shows. The handles are plastic, so we upgraded them for the 'real thing' from hardware store.", 
    "I bought this and I use it for my shoes works great", 
    "Takes enough time to assemble but it is worthy of every second. You will love it..I promise.", 
    "I am actually using this as a TV stand and storage for clothes and shoes in my bedroom. It is holding my 42\" TV well and provides much needed storage. I use the open shelves for the cable box and pictures. It is a really nice and sturdy piece of furniture for such a great price and was pretty easy to put together.", 
    "Love this cabinet!! Wish I would've made this purchased long time ago.. holds all of my rooms just right!! Very easy to assemble if you have patience to do things like that..", 
    "Looks just like the picture. I ordered it in black, took me a couple of hours to assemble but not difficult", 
    "I bought this cabinet to basically hide shoes on the inside while using the outer shelves as a bookcase. Took a long time (for my boyfriend) to put together, but it is very sturdy and looks great. Materials are not the greatest, but it was definitely a great product for the price.", 
    "We bought this to go in our foyer where shoes threaten to take over the floor. It is an excellent value. For its size, it fits a LOT of shoes and you can put the most used ones on the outside shelves. I had no trouble fitting high heels, my husbands bigger shoes , boots etc. the cabinet is good quality for the price and quite sturdy. this was important to us due to our toddler trying to climb on anything that looks remotely climb-able. We love it, and get many compliments on it. THe color is really a dark, rich chocolate than it looks onthe website.", 
    "It's a substantial piece and fits nicely in my entryway. Like others said.....it's heavy so its best to assemble it in the area you are going to keep it in. I am using it as a shoe cabinet but I can see it as a great multi purpose cabinet. The boards are made of mdf but are thick. The backing is cardboard but but finished when you look at it from inside. Best against a wall.", 
    "nice cabinet. easy to put together. and it functions great. It's in my hallway and so glad to have it for the extra room for my shoes. it came in with a bit scartch on the bottom but overstock handles very well. overall i am happy with this purchase.", 
    "Well made product, practical and easy to assemble! I searched for quite some time before i decided to purchase this product from overstock, not only was it a good price but i got rewards as well because i am part of Club O!", 
    "Product is decent quality wise. Takes time to assemble..easy as long ss u follow the instruction.overall good product.", 
    "Make sure you have a minimum of two people to put this item together. Instructions are confusing. A couple of times we had to undo what we put together to start all over again. The handles did not line up evenly. We ended up with extra hardware, not sure why, even though we followed (as best we could) the instructions. Not very sturdy. Would not recommend this item to anyone. Unless of course you need something cheap that will last you about a year.", 
    "This product was very easy to put together and looks great... It came with easy to use instructions and the style looks exactly as it did in the picture!", 
    "Nothing but trouble from the beginning. First missing parts, then pieces that did not fit, then wooden dowels went right through the particle board. A nightmare from the beginning. Overstock support was better than I expected, they did give me a partial refund because I was not able to send back the product via UPS. I did not save the box and at that point I wanted the darn thing out in the trash.", 
    "this shoe cabinet is very affordable but doesn't look cheap at all! it's big enough to hold 20+ of shoes and also could be used an extra storage for small items if needed. a great purchase!", 
    "I feel bad to say this. But this is a product I won't recommend. After online researching and reading all those review of all dresser/cabinet I can find on all websites I could think of, I decided to get this one as a \"leave whatever useful but not being used now\" cabinet for my bedroom. The look and the color is fine. Since I'm paying *** I don't look for luxury. And here comes the problem: the installation sucks. I am someone who installed almost everything in my house: window, kitchen cabinets, all furniture-thanks to my low income I got all these skills. So I know what I am doing when installing things. But this guy: 1. >2 screws didn't go to the holes they are supposed to on the base and I have to use some other way to fix that part tightly that I am pretty sure the holes are not in the right position; 2, the doors bump to each other when closing because the doors are not flat and not in the correct position - definitely not because of my skills, period. There are other small things but I will stop complaining due to the rather cheap price. However, if you are not putting it in a no-one-will-see-it-everyday closet, don't get this. With *** more you can get a pretty good one from a store you can see the product.", 
    "If you need a simple big show cabinet, this is a good option. However, the quality of the woos isn't good and it smells like some kind of chemical. I had to leave the door open for few days after It was assembled to get rid of the smell.", 
    "It's a great product that serves my needs on putting all my shoes away neatly. Made a big difference in my entry way. It is not solid wood thus the doors and back panels are not as sturdy as I would like but I got what I paid for.", 
    "I really like this piece of furniture for the inexpensive furniture category. It went together very easily and the color in the photo is the actual color. I would suggest having your own Elmer's or wood glue around for the wooden dowels because the glue included in the package was bad. I would also be prepared to replace the handles because they are plastic, although do look remarkably like metal. Otherwise, all of the shelves are adjustable and those large 12x12 fabric foldable containers you can find at every major box store fit inside perfectly if you choose not to use it for shoes.", 
    "Great buy! Fits a lot of shoes, looks great! You can even customize shelving to accommodate boots or super tall heels. Only downside is the assembly takes awhile.", 
    "I love my shoe organizer. The color and the style match my living room decor. It fits most of our shoes , and keeps them orgainized and hidden. Excellent buy!", 
    "I bought this about 2 years ago - it moved apartments with me, it was in a flooded apartment, it takes a good beating from my toddler... and it's still looking as if I got it yesterday! I love this! It holds much more shoes that listed here. It hides the shoes! Easy to clean. Looks like an expensive piece of furniture! Everyone thinks I'm nuts for putting shoes in it. I recommended this to friend and she is going to purchase before the end of the week.", 
    "We're using this to store my art supplies (I'm a painter) and it neatly tucks everything away and looks beautiful!", 
    "This piece looks great and hides all my shoes in plain site (living room). Quality is ok though for the price, I think the quality is fine.", 
    "Quality Furniture and fits all our shoes...well worth the money!", 
    "When you open it up, memories of the kids swingset at Christmastime come flowing back. There are lots of pieces and parts. The flatness of the box it is delivered in is the first clue that this is gonna take some work. We love the piece but I don't know if I would order it again bacuase of the assembly. I simply don't have a hour-and-a-half for this. I am that guy that does Not read the instructions. OH but I read every word several times with this product. It looks just like the picture and it is a great way for my wife to strore some of her many shoes. The value that O is known for is evident in this item as well. No doubt it will last for years to come.", 
    "the cabinet arrived a little bit damage, but overstock compensate me for a in-store credit. It is quite smelly (I guess it because of the composite material), otherwise it looks OK and spacious to have enough layers to put shoes. I will still recommend it as you can't really expect better unless it was solid wood.", 
    "Great Cabinet. Much bigger than expected and sturdy. One piece was broken during shipping. I got a replacment part in a week. It was fixed easy and looks great.", 
    "This item was VERY VERY hard to assemble. It took hours to assemble and I definitely would never want to go through the hassle of doing this again. It is also very expensive for the piece. I understand the wood is what is making it expensive but ill definitely buy a product where the quality is not as amazing as this product but much less expensive and easier to assemble. Assembling it was a pain!!", 
    "it looks good put together however the doors dont line up exactly", 
    "Great product, very useful and pleasant to the eye. It keeps my shoes out of sight but within reach when I need them. I'm very glad I bought it and would recommend it to anyone who asked about it.", 
    "The color and quality of the product was very good. putting it together was easy, it came in one box within a few days. the construction is sturdy and it make s the room look spacious and less messy. The only thing that was a bit misleading about the product, in the description it said you could store shoe boxes and boots. The shelves are actually not high enough for boots unless you leave one shelf out, but it can hold a lot of other shoes. I would recommend this product to everyone.", 
    "I love this cabinet which has a lot of spaces for my shoes. it is in a perfect size for my home.", 
    "Was delivered to me 2 days after I placed the order. The assembly instructions are clear and easy to follow. The only thing I didn't like were handles, but I bought the replacement in the hardware store. Overall - great purchase!", 
    "Overstock sent me the wrong color. It has not held up, it was placed in a closet and the door is falling off already.", 
    "Loved this product. For the price and utility its a great buy. It's pressed particle board so make sure you are ready to follow assembly instructions to a \"T\". There isn't much room for error and have someone ready to help you assemble this piece. After it was assembled I put in tiny little nails to give it support. It goes together as shown in the images, the hardware is of good quality. The only drawback is that there isn't too much space in between the shelving so if you have heels that are really tall they may not fit. 4\" heels seems to be the max height in between shelves, or you'll need to loose a shelf to make enough room for the height of the shoe. If you have calf or knee high boots, you'll need to lay them across & stagger them.", 
    "Purchased this item after comparing with other similar products. Overall impression is that this is a good buy. Finished product shows well in the hallway. Once built, the cabinet is sturdy. Instructions are easy to follow and all parts accounted for. I gave it a very high rating based on the combination of quality and value.", 
    "I purchased this because we always had a lot of clutter with our shoes near the entry way. This product transformed my entire home. We received it yesterday and put it up right away. This is worth the money. It has a lot of shelves so it can hold a lot of shoes, even my 4 inch pumps. My husband's size 12 are a bit much to fit inside because the doors won't close properly, but using the extra area on the side works perfectly. Love it.", 
    "This is a great item for shoes. Very functional. My boyfriend uses the part that has the doors. He can fit three pairs on each shelf. I have smaller feet so i use the smaller part and i can fit two pairs of shes on each shelf. The black color matches my bedroom furniture. One of the doors was a little warped but we still managed to connect everything because i was not planning to exchange the whole thing. Overall, if you have better luck and lets say i didn't have problem with the door, i would give it a five star. I recommend this design to everyone.", 
    "I am happy with this purchase. I use it to store clothes inside of. However I did have two issues with it: One, it took my brother and I a few hours to put together because you do have to glue some parts and I suggest you give it time to dry before moving on to the next step. Two, the multi purpose space height is a little shorter than expected. I wanted to use that space for my body sprays and lotions however they can not stand in that space so I had to lay them down. Nothing major.", 
    "The bookcase was delivered promptly in good condition and being my first furniture assembly did felt like it took me a little longer than expected. Approx 2hrs Not bad though for a first timer.I'm very happy with the purchase. I placed it in the entryway and does look stylish in addition to keeping the shoes out of sight.", 
    "This unit was easy to assemble and beautiful. The only bad thing is the plastic handles.", 
    "Directions were easy to follow - female completed assembly in about 2 hours including unpackaging and counting all parts and pieces. Did as others suggested and replaced cheap plastic door handles with stylish metal ones. My only problem is getting the doors to perfectly align so they don't touch each other when opening/closing. Otherwise sturdy and attractive cabinet.", 
    "Good item, but hope it could be bigger, so can accomodrate more shoes. Like the design, would recommend to others", 
    "Fast shipping, price is very affordable, and the qualithy and all the storage that I need comes in thsi shoe cabinet,. I'm enjoying my shoe cabinet a lot, I fit all my shoes in a neat place, and the style is pretty modern just like the rest of my furniture.", 
    "was stripped out in three holes so there was no way I could get it tight. we needed to get stuff off the floor and I did not have the energy to put it all back in a box, retape it, take it to ups (it weight 90lbs) and wait for another one. no way I would have bought itif I knew it was this cheaply made.", 
    "This was supposed to go in a cove behind my interior garage door, but the depth wasn't quite right. The quality was fine for where I was placing it and for what I was storing, but when the depth didn't work for the space I had to move it to a much more visible area. It's great for the purpose for which I bought it, but not a quality looking piece -- very cheap: particle board with plastic painted handles. It's just a little deeper than 13\". I made the best of it by adding accessories to it to dress it up which made it look a little better in my foyer, but the quality is better suited out of sight behind the garage door where it was supposed to go. We don't allow shoes in my house, so it's an excellent alternative to what we had before -- visible shoes everywhere. Now they're all neatly hidden away in a modern cabinet. It'll do.", 
    "Very Sturdy and a lot of storage space. The back panel is cheap and it doesn't lay right.", 
    "Provide lots of space for my wife's shoes. Looks nice.",
