Stylish and light, this round dining table, suitable for up to four people, is made from ash and finished in a natural lacquer so the natural grain of the wood stands out. A clear glass top sits atop dramatically angled pale ash legs for a contrasting look that will catch your eye.Shape: RoundFurniture Room: Dining RoomMaterial: Glass, WoodStyle: ModernAssembly: Assembly RequiredFinish: Ash FinishSeats Up To: 4StyleModernMaterialGlass, WoodFinishAsh FinishShapeRoundAssemblyAssembly RequiredSeats Up To4
