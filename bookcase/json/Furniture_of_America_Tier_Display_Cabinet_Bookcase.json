    "The design is incredible, very artistic and very strudy quality. It took a little over an hour to assemble but it was easy, step by step instructions really helped a lot. I can fit lots of my books and it's very strong I highly recommend it. it's nice and stylish.", 
    "Very nice bookcase for the price, and an interesting look.", 
    "I researched this product on other sites and was thrilled when I saw it for a lot less on here. It arrived just a few days later and even though the directions to put the unit together were slightly confusing I had it put together in 45 minutes. It looks beautiful in my living room and I love the open shelves with the smaller cubby holes are closed. If you are planning to use this as a room divider (as I have) I highly recommend using it in a room where you will mostly be sitting in. It is not very high but, from a lower seating area it looks like it was made for the room.", 
    "My bookcase arrived so early that it surprised me. I order a lot of my stuff online and this was the fastest to ever get to me, and I think this my favorite item that I even bought online. The price was surprisingly good, and the quality is good! It took longer than an hour to set up but it wasn't hard at all, pretty easy. I like the way it's designed, so nice and different. It's also very sturdy and it looks great in the house.", 
    "I purchased this bookcase for my living room a few weeks ago and have already gotten many compliments on it. It's sturdy and took about an hour for my husband and I to assemble. I love the open back and the tiered look....it forms a nice focal point for the room. The shelves are not very tall, however, so don't plan on using it just for books unless you have short paperbacks or put them horizontally as in the picture.", 
    "I like it because the style is great and the quality is more that what I bought it for. Easy to assemble, and if you look at it, the first thing you think about is the assemble, but no worries this was easy to assemble. if you want a unique style bookcase that has great quality, this is it. I looked everywhere and this is one of the great ones. I get so much compliments, and it makes me feel even better knowing that I bought something of good qualtiy for less price.", 
    "i was afraid the boards/shelves would be skinnier in person but they are perfect size. Its also stronger than i was expecting which is a good thing ..its not something that im afraid will break if i place heavier items on it .the black color looks great against my grey walls and im very happy i went with this bookshelf because i was looking for a modern style to match the rest of my furniture. on the downside, it took me 2 and a half hours to put it together and came in 24 separate pieces. the directions did not describe how to put it together..it just showed pictures to follow (which i was able to figure out after studying the picture). i wouldn't let that keep you from getting this..just realize its not a 20 min project!..overall im very pleased and would reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a great black bookshelf.", 
    "The shelf itself is awesome. However there is a teeny tiny base that somehow its suppose to stand up on. Haha. Yeah it doesn't. My ceiling fan blew it over that's how little the base was. It came with a wall anchor. Really? Not gonna happen. All we did was yank off the bottom mount and laid it on the long big base of the last cell shelf. Now it's nice and solid. Just a tip for everyone else.", 
    "I love the unique design and I find it very aesthetically pleasing. It was quite a puzzle to assemble; no written directions just images. You will need to add some of your own glue. The tube provided was not sufficient. The screw holes were \"off\" slightly toward the top or maybe the board wasn't a smooth plane, so we had to \"force it\" slightly and put clamps on it overnight to allow the glue to dry and hold it in place. Had we not done this, there would have been an obvious 1/4-1/2 inch gap between the vertical board and the horizontal shelf on one side at the top. We were putting this in my nine year old daughter's room on carpet. Because of the base to height ratio, it can be wobbled with one finger. It would be very easy to pull it over, and it is heavy. We are going to have to bolt it to the wall so we can sleep at night.", 
    "I think the product is sturdy and nice. We are using it in the living room and it works well even with my daughter banging into it often. We have even found a way to use the narrow areas between the shelves to maximize storage.", 
    "I can't believe that this is a bookcase, I love it! So much room and quite sturdy...It took me about an hour to assemble but it was very easy plus I took breaks in between assembly. Anyways I love it, very good in price, good to look at, and altogether outstanding.", 
    "As other reviewers noted, this case is definitely closer to black. I thought it arrived speedily and had suffered no damage in transit. It was a little difficult to assemble but I had help and everything worked out perfectly. It's excellent quality and very sturdy. It is a little wobbly on carpet because of the shape of the very base piece. However, I found that by placing a few pieces of cardboard at the base that it helps stabilize it.", 
    "We LOVE our new bookshelf! The only thing we wish we had known about beforehand was that the height in between the shelves are somewhat small. They hold \"normal\" size books, but are too small for very large books to stand upright. The only way to place very large books on the shelf is to lay them down sideways.", 
    "The directions were tricky, but once I got the first shelf put together, the rest went fairly easily. I did refer to the picture several times as I assembled it because the written directions were a little bit confusing. It's a great piece for the price and very looks nice in the bedroom--I have books and toys on it and the kids enjoy \"pick up \" time a lot more as they 'design' the spaces.", 
    "I assembled this piece in about 45-60 minutes, but I am a perfectionist, so I'm sure it could be done much faster. Also, I am female and not real familiar with assembling furniture, but the instructions were so easy to understand. They are in picture format, not the long wordy kind. I have absolutely loved this piece. It is well worth the cost. If you buy this, you will not be disappointed!!!", 
    "Sturdy and well designed. Very attractive, and serves my function as store display very well.", 
    "Love the style that it brings in my family room, so eclectic, with devine style. Quality is fortunate for such bargain. I feel pretty luck to have stumbled upon a great bookcase with great design, great quality, and great price. Is highly recommended.", 
    "Love my bookcase, it looks nice, I didn't pay a lot for it, sturdy, I'm able to fit a lot of my things on each shelf other than my books, and shipping is fast.", 
    "Looks great, exactly what I wanted - not boring, a little funky, blends nicely with my mid-century mod-ish decor. When we first opened the box, the stack of \"lumber\" was a bit intimidating, but once we got into the swing of things it only took about 2 hours to put together and wasn't too difficult. They have everything nicely labeled with numbers and letters, just be patient and go one step at a time and you will end up with a delicious shelf!", 
    "We were given the white bookcase as a gift. We love it! Looks great! It doesn't seem to be perfectly level and we are looking for a solution, but it's pretty close to perfect. Very modern. I wasn't involved in the assembly, but my boyfriend said it was a PAIN to put together.", 
    "I love this shelf. I put it together all by myself!! It is exactly what I was looking for. I am very happy with the quality and the price I paid for it.", 
    "Bought this awhile ago but didn't put together until I had some free time, because the number of pieces seemed intimidating--but it was really not that hard. It took me a couple hours with just an ordinary phillips screwdriver. Pay close attention to the diagrams in the directions and note the placement of the holes (which side, or top vs. bottom) in any asymmetric pieces, and you will be fine. (It's also easy to undo if you flip something around and discover that later; just don't glue the dowels in place if you want that flexibility. I don't think gluing the dowels is necessary anyway; the unit is still very solid and sturdy.) It is a very beautiful unit for the price, and I am very pleased. I am using this unit in the dining area of my home and more for practical storage than display. I put a couple dark brown wicker storage bins on the bottom shelf as a way of hiding unsightly piles of papers!", 
    "I love this bookshelf! If you have thick or high carpet, this shelf will need to be bolted to the wall (bookshelf comes with wall mount hardware). It looks great and was easy to assemble!", 
    "My wife loves the bookcase. Came in only a few days from ordering. Was easy to assemble and looks great.", 
    "I love the design of this shelf. However, the instructions seemed incomplete, leaving me to guess some stages. It took me several hours to build which was very frustrating. Some sections would not fully tighten. Furthermore, they provided stickers to cover open areas with screws but for some reason did not provide enough to cover each hole. It looks great in the end but unfortunately I would not recommend this product.", 
    "Great price, easy assembly and the quality is good! I use it as a room divider and looks great, exactly what I wanted", 
    "Outstanding bookcase! Stylish, sturdy, great price, easy assembly, and it has so much room for my books! Outstanding!", 
    "Very pleased with the fast delivery and the product itself. It's perfect for my room!", 
    "The bookcase is wonderful. The style is great, very modern. It has great quality and it's very sturdy with so much more room than what I needed, which is great. I like it because it's very unique and affordable, and suprisingly, easy to assemble. Very well made instructions for a very well made bookcase. I highly recommend it.", 
    "My husband and I have been looking for a book shelf to use as a room divider. We saw one at ***** we really liked but it was $800! When I saw this one on Over stock I thought it looked just like the one at **** and for a much better price! The unit is really nice, and was easy for my husband to asseble. It is much darker then the color you see online. It is pretty much black, but it looks fine in our dining room which has dark brown furniture in it. Just make sure you look at the measurements too so you are fully aware of the size, b/c it looks much smaller once it's built (even though the measurements are given). Overall I would highly recommend this unit.", 
    "Good price for such woderful bookcase! delivery was great and quick and even the set up of the whole bookcase was easy and took me less than an house. Very well made and very sturdy. highly recommend it.", 
    "well it's just like what most people said. it's black rather than brown in the picture. the wood is not solid wood, it's just regular compressed wood. the quality is pretty good for compressed wood but I now wish i just spent a few hundred more for real solid wood instead. this is a somewhat reasonable price for this bookcase, but not necessarily a great deal by any means.", 
    "Arrived so fast! easy assemly and the quality is superb!", 
    "Came in the time it was supposed to arrive. Heavily wrapped in bubble wrap/plastic so there was no damage. Easy to assemble by myself, just took some time. Looked just like the picture.", 
    "very good, just like picture, took much longer to assemble then advertised, due to just having pictures, no written step by step instructions. love how well it works in my entry way!", 
    "This bookshelf is sturdy and a great architectural piece, but was a very different color than we expected. The photo shows a brown colored bookshelf, but the one we received was nearly black. I don't think we would have purchased it if we had known how dark it was going to be. In addition, there were multiple scratches on the wood veneer, and there were 2 areas of the veneer that was already peeling off. I've had my share of disappointment in getting furniture with dings & scratches (from all furniture stores, not just overstock), but get over it relatively fast because I rarely notice the blemishes again after the initial discovery...so I suppose this is not a huge deal to me. Overall, if you are lucky enough to get one with absolutely no defects and are happy to have a nearly-black bookshelf, then you won't go wrong with this lovely bookshelf!", 
    "I was very happy how it was packed, as some company skimp on it. Solid bookcase, not hard to assemble and I love the tiered look. Highly recommend!!", 
    "Purchased the white color, Great texture, I love it, assembled in less than 20 minutes. Comes with lots extra spare parts. A-plus!!! Fast shipping!!! Thanks Overstock! Another great product.", 
    "This cabinet has a unique, retro-modern look to it. Very different, which is what we like. It does, however, have a kind of cheap, mdf appearance if you look closely, with a fake oak grain. We like it in spite of that! The dark stain would probably be the better choice, but it was out of stock at the time.A bit time-consuming to put together. No instructions really, just diagrams. The most important diagram sat in the bottom of the box, and we didn't see it until after we had put the thing together. It was pretty common sense anyway.Very heavy box. You will need help moving this one.", 
    "In white, this tier display cabinet really pops when it's against a brightly colored wall. It's striking and unusual, very attractive. Construction was a bit tough because the directions were difficult to follow, but not impossible. It takes awhile to construct but is worth the time because it looks so great. I wish the base was a little more stable, but otherwise, a terrific piece. Packaging is amazing- the box was bubble wrapped like King Tut's tomb! All the corners of the box were padded as well- very impressive, no chips or dings possible! I bought 2- love them.", 
    "Pros: durable & solid construction. I ordered the white oak color and it's very nice. I usually don't like to purchase items online, however this is definitely not a disappointment. All the other display stand we'd found elsewhere were flimsy and over-priced. This is hefty enough to hold what we need - my wife's art frames. Not sure about heavy books, but this is more of a display stand than a bookshelf so I don't have much problem with it. Overall, very nice and sturdy. Will recommend it.", 
    "I bought it in white oak, and it's much better looking than in the picture. You can see the wood texture underneath the white color, giving it a very elegant, slightly distressed look. I'm not a completely contemporary person, more eclectic, and this fits nicely into my studio apartment. I'm thinking of using it as a separator between my bed and my living space because it seems sturdy enough to stand alone. This is one of the best purchases I have made at overstock.", 
    "My grandma bought me this Tier Display Cabinet/Bookcase for my birthday and I absolutely love it. I have wanted it since I first spot it on Overstock and shopped everywhere for the best deal. This bookshelf by far I think works wonderful. I put this bookcase together by myself and it was pretty easy. It is very modern and sleek, but still with a hint of traditionalism.", 
    "Cons: Assembly time - three hours for two people. Instructions were pointless \u2013 they consisted of one poorly translated sentence and four unhelpful pictures. Sturdiness \u2013 based on its size I would expect it to be able to lean against it without it wobbling. This is a safety concern for me because I have a small child so we will be attaching it to the wall with brackets. You could also flip it upside down or opt to not add the bottom piece and it would be quite sturdy. Pros: Appearance - this piece is a great addition to our living room. It\u2019s very attractive and has tons of storage. We use it to hold the DVD player and DVR and could easily hide the wires with some baskets on the lower shelves. Price \u2013 I have been looking for a few years for a tall, wide display cabinet within our price range with no luck until now. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase and definitely recommend it. It\u2019s a very unusual piece and I have already received several compliments.", 
    "This is a very solid piece of display cabinet/bookcase. Very roomy and sturdy. It's quite a handsome looking bookcase. We originally plan on buying one of the other display stands but opted for this one because it looks different than the other 100 other bookcases on this site and we could not be happier with our decision. We got the white oak color, and man it's very nice. I now have my family pictures and teapots and candles. Absolutely stunning. Very happy with our purchase. Assembly takes some time, that's the only thing but with a little patient you'll very happy with the product. Trust me!", 
    "If you are looking for an unusual bookcase, this is it! If you are looking for a functional bookcase, this is not the one for you. i purchased this piece for my husband's rather spacious home office. I love its contemporary style and it's quite an attention getter, but does not really serve as a true bookcase. I have placed CD's in the two places for them and they fit well and look neat. On most of the shelving I have placed decorative storage baskets mainly to house incoming mail and magazines. The smaller slots are good for small, decorative accent pieces.. If you do not have a large space to put other more useable bookcases, I would not recommend this for you. If you need a \"sweet\" focal point for your room, by all means, get it!!!", 
    "This design is great, but the materials are composited of MDF. Therefore, finish is not smooth; it has lines.", 
    "There are a LOT of pieces to this one, and I am a pretty slow assembler, so it took me a while. I really love the finished product though and appreciate the unique look once I added my own books and personal touches to all the little nooks and crannies in the completed bookcase. I would absolutely recommend this unit to a friend, and then promise to help them build it once it arrived!", 
    "Really like the product. But you really have to read n follow the assembly instructions...compare the picture while assembling it too coz I have to reverse one layer for it to match the picture. But all in all I am really happy with my purchase!!!;)", 
    "I purchased this piece for my dining room. It matches my existing table and chairs exactly. It is being used to display my collection of Vintage barware. Cool design. Very pleased with it.", 
    "I love the bookcase. It looks exactly the same and seems high in quality. It wasn't easy to assemble, but it wasn't impossible. It took my husband about and hour and a half.", 
    "I was torn between another cabinet and I'm so glad we purchased this one! AMAZING for the price (looks way more expensive than it really was)! It is a bit challenging to assemble. Lots of pieces and parts and a bit like a puzzle. But if you get past Step 3...it's smooth sailing (hang in there because it's worth it)! This piece compliments our other furniture nicely. Absolutely gorgeous. You won't be disappointed with this purchase.", 
    "Looks great, matches what I have perfect, easy to put together and shipped quickley.", 
    "I love contemporary items and this is just what I love! It's funky and adds a different twist to a traditional bookshelf. It is heavy and durable. It took my husband a little bit of time to put together and if I recall right, some of the screws did not align with the holes. His manly knowledge took care of it. It was nothing that stopped me from loving my new black book shelf. It stands tall and has plenty of space to fill or leave it a little more \"less is more\" looking.", 
    "This is a great looking shelf with a modern twist. My only complaint is it can easily rock forward so I had to put small cardboard under the legs to lean it against the wall. Assembly was very easy and straight forward.", 
    "Great quality bookcase and the style is incredible. It takes longer than an hour to asssemble, but very simple and easy assembly process. it's a looker, you can't help but look at it when you pass by it, it looks great! I'm very satisfied with my bookcase, I got more than what I paid for it. Highly recommend this bookcase, very nice.", 
    "This shelving unit is pretty much \"what you see is what you get\". The picture and description are very accurate. The instructions, however, are not! Poor, poor english (probably translated from Chinese) and vague directions. We had to take several sections apart after realizing toward the end of assembly how it \"should have been\". In a world where we have to assemble everything ourselves, I've gotten pretty good at it but these instructions had me a bit confused. Sturdy little unit though.", 
    "Bought this for my son to use as room divider in his room. Arrived well packed, no damage(yeah)! He was able to put together quite quickly by himself. It looks awesome and is great utilized as room divider. Didn't give 5 stars as he had to remove legs for safety reasons, his room has a very thick carpet pad (lower level room) and thick carpet. Due to that, was a bit wobbly - would have been OK against wall - however, he wanted room divider. Still looks great w/o legs and has good presence visually, would advise anyone w/thick carpet, etc. to consider that. Still love it ..... and most importantly, he is pleased AND it looks great flat!!!! Would but again & recommend this piece!!!!", 
    "I've very happy that I made the purchase. Everything in my living room is very organized thanks to my new bookcase. It came to me with fast delivery and took a fair amount of time to set but easy to follow insturctions and all shelfs come with great quality material and once it was put together it looks very nice. The cabinet is of good quality and very sturdy.", 
    "I really love this shelf it is a decent size and looks fantastic in our apartment. We took the bottom part off as it is not to study on carpet, but would be fine on hardwood or tile. I actually like ti better with out the bottom part anyways. The wood is nice and heavy, but I would compare this too Ikea quality. Still a great one of a kind shelving unit :)", 
    "this bookcase is of great value, the material are made out of good quality wood. I like it because it has the unique look to it and it is very sturdy and can hold the weight of heavy things. everything about it is great, the delviry was fast and the assembly took a bit long but the instrucions was easy to follow. I would recommend this to anyone because it's a great value.", 
    "I would defenitely recommend this to anyone. Weird but I bought the bookcase for my huge walk in closet and it looks fantastic! My girlfriends didn't even realized that it's bookcase until I told them! I love the fact that it holds so many things and makes everything look great. The only hard thing about it was that it was very heavy because of the the quality of the wood, it's great but heavy. I had someone assemble the bookcase and it took him 30-40 minutes, not long at all. I love the bookcase/closet, sturdy and extremely good quality.", 
    "The first time that I saw this bookcase, I was amazed because is not like any other bookcase I've ever seen. The design that was put into this item is incredible. When I received the bookcase, my sister and myself put it together, and it didn't take no more than 45 minutes. The instructions were easy to follow. Once it was assembled, I was very happy. It holds so many things and the quality is great.", 
    "This is a wonderful bookcase to put in any area of your home. Many pieces to put together but once assembled it rocks!! Enjoy!!!", 
    "One of the best looking and solid RTA products I've ordered to date. I built it myself but you really need 2 people unless you are both strong and dexterous.", 
    "instructions for putting the shelving together were clear and simple. certainly a project that a single person (male or female) can do without having to call in a neighbor. once put together and in place it looks very nice. the different approach to the design cosmetic makes for an attractive addition to any space.", 
    "I love this bookcase. It took forever to put together and definitely takes at least two people, but now that it is assembled, it's beautiful. It's sturdy and substantial and I have gotten compliments on it from every person who has been to my house since I bought it. I put it behind my couch to divide the room without closing it off. It looks lovely and I loaded it with books, DVDs, and decorations. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique bookcase or room divider that they want to actually use!", 
    "We (one gent + one lady) put this together with no problems whatsoever. The directions were straightforward, and though it took a little while, it turned out great. It feels quite solid and it looks great on the wall.", 
    "The bookshelf has such a beautiful design, it could go in an office or even bedroom. The shelves are surprisingly deep. Love this bookshelf. Not too heavy to move either.", 
    "Strong and sturdy. Nicely finished wood. Very pleased with the bookshelf. Would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "I thought this would be taller with the reviews about it being used as a room divider. It's not even as tall as me. I like the overall look and design, but it does need to be dusted frequently. With all the nooks and dividers it's hard to do so.", 
    "My wife put this together and her only complaint was instructions weren'y very clear, so it took her longer to assemble..also you really need two people...other than that the piece is exactly what we wanted and it looks great.this is the third item we ordered from Overstock and everything from order to shipping to delivery to assembly has been well worth the money and SAVINGS..thanks", 
    "My husband ordered this and I could not be happier with the style and quality. Very spacious with the right height, perfect for any items you want to display. Beautiful warm tone finish to the wood. Assembly was very easy, with an easy to follow instruction manual. Overall, I love the appearance and the sturdiness of this display stand, not flimsy at all. Will highly recommend this.", 
    "I bought one of each color and both colors are beautiful. I use them as a room divider and because the two colors compliment each other very well they really do make a statement in my apartment. Do measure your space before purchasing because I think it is wide enough for a very small space so one should be sufficient. I like the closed and open effect of this piece so you really do feel there is another room over at the other side granted that you know it's just for visual effects. I honestly think the quality is very good and for the price it is so worth it. We used it without the bottom base because we want it to sit lower than it is and it seems more sturdy although I am sure with the base it would have been as sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone. Trust us, we've gone through many bookcases and display stands and this by far the most versatile in designs and great is quality. $$$ well spent!", 
    "This is a beautiful piece of furniture for the money. I was pleased when I received it because it was bigger and sturdier than I expected. I like that it's not too heavy yet still stand well. I live alone so it makes it easier for me to move it around when I need to. All in all everything about this display cabinet is great from the online ordering to tracking your order to receiving it has been a good experience. Will consider ordering furniture from Overstock in the future.", 
    "This display stand is a wonderful product. Not only is it sturdy but it is also lightweight and easy to move around. The finish is tough and so it does not scratch easily. I could sense the good wood quality while assembly, everything goes into place without much force and no broken or crack wood pieces. Overall value and product quality is grade A. Will surely recommend this.", 
    "This was easy to put together and looks nice. It appears to be sturdy.", 
    "Without blocking the light, this bookshelf has been a great room divider. I have it free standing and perpendicular to my walls and with workouts and burpees it hardly shakes and has never fallen so I'm not sure it's necessary to nail to the wall. I also did not use the base piece as I felt its narrow nature would make that reality less likely.Overall I'm very satisfied with the product and rated it four stars instead of five because I wish it was one shelf taller. Lol it's great though!", 
    "This has complemented the furniture I have. Had to have someone else put it together. They did use glue to keep it sturdy.", 
    "My only complaint is that I wish it were taller!", 
    "I purchased two of these to fit two specific places. The assembly took a while to complete, but all pieces were shipped. I would not recommend for people with small children without attaching to the wall.", 
    "It has been about 5 years since I purchased this shelf and it is just strong as the day I bought it. Excellent quality. I highly recommend.", 
    "I like the item easy to set up quality of material is OK", 
    "exactly what you'd expect.", 
    "low profile and very stylish", 
    "This bookcase is gorgeous! Very heavy, and sturdy, despite the somewhat airy appearance. I thought it was easy to put together, with simple instructions. Very pleased!", 
    "This is so stylish & made well, I love it.", 
    "Ugh this one was a chore to put together! I did this in stages as i used stronger glue when needed so it had to dry before attaching to another piece. I like how it looks in my space, good value too.", 
    "It is sturdy and looks amazing!", 
    "I love this shelf, easy to assemble, (as long as you have 2 people.) Color is nice and work well in any setting. if you have a spot that needs a place to store your knick knacks, this is perfect. Glad i bought this one!", 
    "this is solid and well made. everyone notices it and it makes a statement. Can be used as a room divider. I used it to help separate my office area from the door. Just pay attention to the assembly instructions to get all the shelves the right way. There are holes where the screws go in and small matching covers to stick over the holes.", 
    "This bookcase did not have any assembly directions in the box so they had to send them to me. When I did receive them, they were extremely hard to follow.", 
    "Only giving it 4 stars because of the frustration my husband had putting it together. But it's a great modern piece for the price!", 
    "Love it, sturdy, looks great, perfect size for what I wanted", 
    "I would definately buy this again!", 
    "okay, we had some difficulties assembling this, as one of the gaskets was missing. It took several back-and-forth calls & emails to get them to understand what was actually missing. We rigged it with something ourselves since we couldn't wait any longer with it partially built; they said would be a week out, but showed up about 3 weeks later. I do like the piece but it's average materials. I would buy again if I knew there'd be no missing parts and on-sale.", 
    "Great looking and well made", 
    "Bought this for one private office in our real estate office. Agent likes a more contemporary look. Put together easily and looks very good. Sturdy. You can store a lot on the shelves. Price was terrific. Have had several positive comments on it from clients.", 
    "I got it in the White Oak color, which is deceiving because this bookcase isn't made of oak, it's pressed particleboard. It comes with wood patterned circle stickers to comouflage the screw holes (but I was short 3 stickers). It looks fine from far away, gets the job done.", 
    "It looks nice but it's not a book case. I can't even fit a children's book on the shelf. Every book I've tried, it can't fit. The space is just toooo narrow even for my photo frames. Now I have to move it to the basement. It's a waste for me.", 
    "I love the height of this bookshelf but I imagine others might expect it to be a bit taller. In my case it fits typical technology books perfectly in height and has more than enough depth for all of my books. The wood is really thick, solid but lightweight and the black wood grain finish looks amazing. I would purchase another of the exact same bookshelf if the space in my place ever makes itself available.", 
    "This is a very cool bookcase! I'm used to putting furniture together, so it was easy for me; just takes awhile with lots of patience and attention to detail. It turned out well; sturdy, and the quality is better than one may expect, especially for the price. I bought the white and love it! It can be used as a divider if you wish as both sides are finished. Not bad if you don't mind putting it together.", 
    "I bought this bookcase to place in my family room. I had one wall where I wanted to place a bookcase but didn't want it to be too tall. This bookcase fit perfectly.", 
    "It took me about 4 hours to assembly this cabinet where the materials lined up properly and it was very sturdy but not too heavy upon completion. It has a really nice open and modern appearance in my office.", 
    "Its a very sturdy piece of furniture. I was amazed with the quality of it. It looks great in my bedroom with other black furniture. It looks very easy to assemble, but it was actually pretty confusing at times and really time consuming for assembling. That's the only downside. Overall I loved this product. We modified it a bit for our needs. We took out the top two shelves and put TV on it in the bedroom. Its sturdy enough to put a 46\" TV. The top part I put in the living room passage as a bench! I put two pillows on it and it looks simply awesome. Its for the guests to sit on for putting on shoes etc.", 
    "I really love it this beautiful black tier Cabinet/Bookcase so prefect style match in my living room wow thank you again smiles ...", 
    "The product itself is great and I have no complains about it. However, the instructions could be much better. I ended up putting the middle shelf in the wrong orientation. Now, this isn't a big defect in the final appearance of the product and the shelf still looks OK, but with a clear picture and better instructions, it could have been avoided. By the way, putting it together is by no means a trivial task. It took me almost a day's worth of time (but then, I'm not the handyman type of person and in fact learned quite a bit during the process). Overall, I am satisfied with the bookcase. It is pretty sturdy and the quality of the material is decent. Price also seems reasonable. Recommended.", 
    "This is a great shelving unit. Very sturdy and easy to put together. I bought this for my 7 year old daughter's room because it will grow with her since the style is more sophisticated than other white units. Be aware though of the shelf heights. Her big books need to go in at an angle, but again, it will age with her and those books will go away.", 
    "I move into a new house 3 months ago and I looked everywhere to find something for my entryway that's kinda part of my livingroom.Anyways I am very glad I went with this instead of some boring entryway table.It took about an hour for my husband to put it together.Its sturdy and beautiful.", 
    "It is composed wood but well made and sturdy. Good and modern design.", 
    "This bookcase had many pieces but was not difficult to assemble provided you pay close attention to what you are doing. Once assembled, it looks much more expensive than it was. I love it!", 
    "Shelf looks really nice. Kind of difficult to put together but overall a pretty good value.", 
    "Comfortable and stylish...great finish and shipped and packaged very well. Would highly recommend.", 
    "I love this cabinet. I use it for an entertainment center- the shelves make it easy to store xbox/dvd player/wii/ and remotes and it looks neat and tidy! I have my TV on top and it looks great. Ordered Black but got white in error however the white looks great so it worked out perfectly. Very easy assembly and fit together tightly and is sturdy. I WOULD anchor as safety measure if used with TV but not because it is unstable. Very nice piece of furniture.. so glad I got it!", 
    "Stylish design, easy to put together. I wish it was heavier, I've never put much on it because I'm afraid it will fall. For the record, it's never fallen but shakes easily. It came with straps to tether it to the wall but I didn't want to put holes in my walls.", 
    "I like the bookcase but it is a little unstable when placed on a carpet.", 
    "WASN'T QUITE AS EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AS WE WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT IT IS A VERY, VERY NICE BOOKCASE. lOOKS GREAT AND IS SOLID.", 
    "A little time consuming to put together and definitely has to be attached to the wall but very modern and love the style. If you are not a DIY person the directions are not very detailed. Shipped quickly no damage!", 
    "We purchased this tiered bookcase as a way to store miscellaneous items and electronics such as our 55\" inch TV on the top tier of the shelf, our video game console, games and as well various novels and visual references books, coffee table books. Despite our ample usage, the design and the silhouette of this bookcase still holds on its own and I love it. It serves very well in function as well as in aesthetics beautifully. I was actually worried about it being wobbly, but if carefully and securely assembled, its structurally sound and very stable as well, which is always a plus, and I appreciated the timely transit of this item. Thank you, Overstock.", 
    "These (we bought two) are perfect. We bought them to flank our very large, flat screen TV and they are perfect. My husband spent a little while putting the first one together but the second took only half the time. They look both modern and retro - just what we were looking for. Price was great too! We found something similar, but not as nice, in a shop for twice the price!", 
    "I recommend this with qualifications: I tried to assemble it myself without help - mistake. The directions are quirky, pieces heavy. In the end it was wobbly and I think I did it wrong; ended up damaging it in the process. It's not great quality but I did not expect that given what I paid. I gave it to a friend for his basement. So, if you don't need quality and are a furniture-assembly expert, go for it. It's a nice design.", 
    "Oh boy! I have successfully assembled other flat box furniture. This was like night and day! In the end my son with a PHD in mechanical engineering whipped it together. I guess I fell for the design of the bookcase. It is of course modern. I also like the color of the book case. Enough said.", 
    "Looks nice in my living room. Item looks exactly as the picture on overstock. Have purchased many items before from overstock. Recommend that the bookcase be attached to the wall as it is a little tipsy, especially if you have children in your home. If I needed another bookcase for a different room would purchase this item again", 
    "I will first admit that I am a woman with very little mechanical ability. I was able to put this together myself but there were a lot of pieces left over. So, the unit is just barely together and had to be scooted from the bottom so as not to break it. There are too many fasteners and it is hard to determine what fastener goes into what hole. I had two different handymen refuse to even try to put this together. So, I will not be buying any more furniture that requires assembly,", 
    "Very difficult to put together. It is not sturdy and didn't survive a gentle move. The areas that have glue yellow quickly, staining the overall appearance.", 
    "This contemporary bookcase is beautiful. The dark wood finish is very rich; looks like it should have cost more. It took a few hours for me to put together but I did it by myself. Directions are a little hard to follow. I got to the last step and had a piece that was backwards so I had to undo the previous step and turn a part around. Other than that , it went well. The holes and openings are drilled well so everything goes together perfectly. When it's finished, it was worth the time and money.", 
    "This shelf does come in alot of pieces. It took my husband 2 hours to put together. There is NO written instructions only picture instructions. You will need your own WOOD GLUE. The one that comes with this shelf is NOT enough. We were lucky to have our own on hand. It is a nice shelf once put together.", 
    "I got the white bookcase. Fantastic product overall. Make sure to secure to the wall as It is prone to tipping. This compliments any room.", 
    "I purchased this product mainly for my Video Games/Blu-ray/Dvd collection. It actually looks excellent in design, and I get a lot of compliments on my new Entertainment storage shelf. I know that this is just a \"Bookcase\", not a Blu-ray/Dvd shelf, but i rated this product 4 stars because of the sole reason that this bookcase doesn't have backing strips for holding (whether it be Books, Video games, Blu-rays or Dvd movies) in place. You mainly have to make sure that your bookcase is flush against the wall, so your items can be flush as well. Other than that, it is an excellent product, and would definitely buy again.", 
    "Beautiful for my small living room. Be careful it scratches easy. Would like it better if there were plugs to cover the screw holes. Easy to put together if you follow the directions.", 
    "I was looking for a narrow but taller cabinet to fit in my Father's room at his nursing home. This fits the bill, perfectly. We placed a flat screen television on the wall just above this piece, The television could have actually sat on top of the cabinet, since it is so sturdy. This give lots of room for pictures of our family for our father to enjoy and has a distinctive male feel in his room. We are very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I liked this product which we purchased from the Overstock site. Shipping was fast and we assembed in couple of hours. It has easy to do instructions.", 
    "I like my cabinet, it sits my TV and my collectables and books at the same time. Doesn't take up much space width wise either, gives off a slim look, makes my room look bigger with more space in the center. I recommend this product.", 
    "Very sturdy piece, good quality and easy to assemble. Could have used a better way to secure it to a wall. Fast delivery! Need two people to put together because it ships in a box the size of a small coffin.", 
    "This item is a great centerpiece. It was a missing link to my modern living room. It fits perfectly under my wall mounted tv. It is very sturdy and modern. I am not too fond of piecing together furniture but this is by far my favorite. I am definitely happy with enitial lab furniture& will buy different e.lab furniture in the near future for my wife's office and nook area. Thank you overstock!", 
    "the unit looks very nice once together with display items on it. But my husband & I struggled to make sense of the instructions. We are fairly smart people but the instructions seemed confusing. There was not even one extra on the screws or items needed to put it together. There was a tiny tube of glue that did not go far. And the tabs to cover the screws was nothing more than shiny sticky paper. Would not buy another.", 
    "I think this is a very stylish/ modern piece of furniture. Only thing is that it is pressed wood, so when seen up close you can see that it's not a good quality piece of furniture. Not horrible ...but just for the amount of money you spend on this ...for just a bit more you could maybe find something with a little bit quality. But again, the style is great. I do receive compliments on it...", 
    "This shelf is a great shelf. Easy assemble....exactly as pictured. lots of shelves to put lots of goodies!!", 
    "When placed between two large windows, this display case has become the focal point of the living room. It fills the space perfectly and provides a place to put object collected over time. It took about 45 minutes to assemble. I'm extremely happy with this purchase.", 
    "pretty good for what you pay. Took me and my fiance almost 2 hrs to put it together, but it's not that frustrating if you consider it a \"together\" time with your significant the other. The final prodcut looks just like that in the pic, although it's not as sturdy as we want. Not sure it's the problem of our assembling technique, or it's because of some design problems. Perfect for a simple town house/apt/guest room. But probably not reliable enough for a living room in a house.", 
    "It looks great in my husbands man cave, holds all of his romotes, as well as chalks/supplies for his pool table (cards, etcl) ...BUT, I had to have someone bolt it to the wall. It wasn't very sturdy on the tile floors.", 
    "These are cool modern shelves. The came extremely well packaged - with a box inside a box and plenty of packing so nothing arrived with so much as a scratch. The instructions had an amusing note on the front - followed by very easy to follow instructions. I thought I might need a second person to help me assemble them - but I'm not very patient and didn't want to wait for my husband. They would have gone together faster with a second person - but I put them together myself in a little over an hour. They are very stable - they came with a strap to attach them to the wall for added stability, it seems to be unnecessary.", 
    "We liked this so much we bought a second one. They set off the living room from the entrance.", 
    "The shelves are exactly how they look in the picture. They arrived swiftly and as others have said, they were packaged very well. The box they arrived in was badly beaten up so I was worried but everything on the inside was unscathed. They were a little taller than I was expecting but that was probably due to my poor measuring abilities. The assembly looked very confusing. My boyfriend put them together and it took him several hours. He is an engineer so he is usually very good at that stuff. I know I would have failed miserably if I had tried it. So make sure you are ready to get frustrated and spend a long time on them if you are considering them. The pieces seemed very solid and were good quality for the price. The veneer looks like it won't peel off anytime soon. It chips pretty easily as I found out already but otherwise you are getting a really cool set of shelves for a very very low price. I think it was worth it!", 
    "I have been looking for a black display/book shelf like this one for a long time. When I finally found this, I immediately ordered it after reading the description. It came within a few days, and my teenage daughter put it together for me as a surprise! I absolutely LOVE IT and it looks great against a wall in my kitchen/breakfast area!! Thank you :)", 
    "Beautiful addition to my family room and added character to the wall.", 
    "We really like it. It is modern looking and beautiful. Took a while to put together, but we were very happy when it was completed. It is very sturdy.", 
    "these are great room dividers, perfect height, different but functional", 
    "It is sturdy, and of very good quality. It is a little bulky.", 
    "This price looks great in our bedroom. We needed it for the cable box and DVD player and it also holds some of the crafts my children have made. We love it!", 
    "I really like the bookshelf I ordered, its a great room divider or against the wall bookshelf and looks very modern. There is only one 'Con' comment I can make, there were a few chips in the veneer in places, they werent too big so I decided to keep the bookshelf. Putting it together takes a little work too, but its do-able!", 
    "It seems to be built well and will last a long time, but as I said earlier if you are not careful with putting it together, you can damage it and the design will not stand the test of time.", 
    "I ordered this based on the good reviews as well as the design. If you are a perfectionist or want a good quality piece of furniture do not order this shelf. Mine arrived with several scratches, as well as the particle board crumbling. It is a very large package and would have been a huge issue to return, so I kept it. The materials are very cheap particle board. I've seen much sturdier manufactured wood product. This is cheap. I ordered the white shelf. It went together easily, although it does take some time. Once together you can't see the crumbly particle board, and the scratches aren't that noticeable. It does look like it needs all of the screws to be re-tightened as there are gaps that are noticeable. I did not use the glue, and am glad because some pieces had to be taken apart and re-done. The instructions aren't the easiest to understand. I love the look of the shelf, and it looks nice as a divider between my living and dining room. I do think the price is way too high for the quality. It looks okay, but really is not a good piece of furniture, I don't expect it to last long.", 
    "We are using this as a stand under our wall mounted flat screen. It looks great and adds some interesting elements to what would otherwise be stakes of video games and consoles. It is a bit top heavy and should be attached to the wall.", 
    "The numbering for installation of this item was not etched clearly. It would help it numbering had some type of white sticker affixed so one can see the numbers clearly and precisely. The number embedded on the wood was very faint and could was unreadable. This piece of furniture required alot of time to put together using just a manual tool. It took over 1 1/2 hours to install. Also, there needs to be more of the black stickers included - there were only 33 affixed to the installation kit. we ran out of stickers used to plug over the open holes. Even tried getting some black ones from the store but no luck. So had to use black tape to cover up the holes rather than leave open.", 
    "It is a very cool piece once it is put together. It took over 2 hours to put together and came with a ton of pieces but was worth it.", 
    "This piece looks fantastic, from an aesthetic view point. Very unique, striking, your friends will wonder where you got it. Assembly - I would rate this as \"medium.\" My brother who is very handy helped me, and we had to adjust, go back a couple of steps, then go forward again, etc. Overall though, can be done. I could have done it by myself, but better/ easier with 2 people. Quality - Slightly disappointed in the construction/ screws/ bolts/ etc. One piece was missing the needed plastic part for the screw to secure into. however, screws we had at the house were able to fit, and we got it to work without having to send anything back. A few nicks/ dings on the wood. Nothing very noticeable, only when you get close and inspect it. (As I, a perfectionist, had to do.). I like that it will be easy to disassemble. We messed up on one part, and needed to flip one of the levels around so it looked like the picture, and it was easy to unscrew the items and put it all back together. If you like the \"look\" of this piece, I would HIGHLY recommend. The few problems I mentioned are very minor, and not worth returning, and not owning this very cool looking piece of furniture. Great for a contemporary furnished home.", 
    "Looks much better than expected. Good value for the money. Even the cheap fastener covers (sticky dots) don't really show up. Thickness of shelves (Black) reads well against wall. Using it to camouflage a large return air vent in the living room. Assembly a bit of a jigsaw puzzle. Stay sober. Best to assemble from the top first then flip the unit upright. Do not use a drill, not needed. Composite will strip out easily.", 
    "I love this display case. It took my husband about two hours to put together, and he said it wasn't too difficult. It's super sturdy, and I'm pleased with the quality. The only downfall for me is that the spaces are sort of small. I hadn't thought it would be an issue, but two of the immediate objects I wanted to display were too tall to fit. While disappointing, it's no fault of the product-- just be aware of the dimensions of not only the structure itself but also the size of the shelves. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.", 
    "I received the package just a couple of hours ago. I will say the quality looks better than most Ikea items, so continues to look like a good quality choice. The box was wrapped in lots of bubble wrap pus extra exterior padding for the corners. That exceeded any expectations - awesome. The parts are labeled, assembly instructions are clear - and BE SURE to review them a time or two and follow the sequence in the instructions. I will follow up after assembly, but I doubt it will take an hour.", 
    "I'm not shy to say that putting this bad boy together really challenged me. If you've got a drill, start charging it up now. Your hand will thank you. I'm glad I chose not to use the glue, because I put part of it together incorrectly and would have been in a world of hurt if things were permanently joined. I knew right away that I, too, would not attach the bottom section, for the unit would have been far too unstable on such a tiny base. The unit looks great, it's unique in its design, and is perfect for displaying smaller items. Thusfar, my only dislike is how easily my greasy fingerprints show on the surface. That's right, I said greasy, 'cause it's true.", 
    "We love the appearance of the bookcase..nice to see a different design for this type of product. The quality is there but heaven forbid you manage to get it together! The parts (screws and such) are not labeled on the directions and as for making the parts fit together, well that is done by trial and error.", 
    "Love this item, it's chock full of shoes because I saw a friend use a bookshelf that way and it made it that much better looking to display than piles of shoes.", 
    "Absolutely love this addition to our living room. We recently upgraded our living area and mounted our TV and needed a shelving unit to hold the cable box, DVD player, and other electronics. Saw this online and liked the modern look. Received it within a week. Took my husband and I just under two hours to complete it. We took our time and followed the instruction picture step by step. Other than the unexpected amount of time it took to assemble it, we are very pleased with the product and would not hesitate to suggest it to anyone. The crew that came to mount the TV even noted, \"Wow! What a great looking shelving unit! It is just perfect for this space and cool looking.\"", 
    "BOUGHT ONLINE ON A SUNDAY, GOT IN ON A TUE. LESS THAN AN HOUR ASSEMBY BUT EASY. DESIGN, QUALITY, AND STURDINESS IS TOP NOTCH! GOOD TO HAVE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS A LOT OF BOOKS AND TROPHIES LIKE ME. THIS BOOKCASE IS VERY STRONG AND I'M ABLE TO FIT EVERYTHING THAT I NEED TO SO IM GOOD! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.", 
    "This is what I call better than expected furniture! Very affordable price!, and the it comes with a great design, and some high quality material. I like it, I wouldn't trade it in for the world or return it. It looks very nice, and it's more than what I needed.", 
    "This bookcase is very cute, and unique. Arrived earlier than expected, and was easy to assemble. It looks great in my library, and it's very sturdy and can fit a lot of books. I love it, so I'm planning to buy another one. The first one was a test and it passed, and so I will purchase another. This cabinet is soooo nice, I liek it very much.", 
    "MY bookcase is very nice, it's huge and can fit a lot of my things. Assembling the bookcase was not bad at all, pretty easy and prompt directions. The delivery was no trouble at all, less than 3 days, but the quality and appearance is very nice. I'm so happy with my bookcase, is to die for. Great affordable price, is less than what I was planning to spend, and with high quality that's why I'm very satisfied with my bookcase.", 
    "The design of the product is really nice, however the quality is not as high as you'd expect for the price. While the directions were fairly straight forward, it took quite a bit of labor to build the cabinet and ran out of the provided glue very early in the build process. Overall, when you get close the product just looks cheap looking. For this price, it could have easily been made out of higher quality material.", 
    "If there is any difference between how this shelf is reflected online vs in person, I would agree with the review that it is dark, I would call it black and that suited me wonderfully. Additionally, the other difference compared to the other reviews for this shelf online, I think it is solid, well built and strong. I have assembled shelves and bought pre-assembled shelving units and I've got to say, I think it is as strong as any of the strongest have been. A great item, loaded with style vs. the everyday shelving unit and a great purchase", 
    "I guess it's one of those designs that looks cooler in picture than in person. And it's not practical, can't load a lot of books because you can't fit tall books in it unless put it face down. Not a nice show case either, the space just too small", 
    "I'm glad I bought this cabinet for all my stuff in the living room. So nice and sturdy, and the quality is great. It was pretty easy to assemble and it was less than an hour. I like the style and how it looks in the living room, it stands out a lot. I like it.", 
    "I put the cabinet in my family room and it looks very nice. We store so many things other than books and it keeps the family room looking neat and spiffy. The quality of the cabient is great and the assembly took me about an hour because it was off and on and I would forget where I left off heehee! but after the assemble I was very happy with the bookcase that I built. I highly recommend this bookcase if you have a lot of kids with so much stuff.", 
    "I purchased this book case to go under my wall mounted TV. It is the perfect size I was looking for however I was disapointed in the merchandise as soon as I received it. It is a very cheap wood. Very thin and \"hollow\" feeling. The directions are not user friendly and it took me a lot more time to put together than it should have, had the directions been more clear and organized. Also the color is called \"Black Oak\" but in the picture it looked more like a Brown-Black, but when I got it I was surprised that it was a solid Jet black color. I was hoping it would be more Brown-Black, as it appeared in the picture. Put together and placed in my living room it looks nice, but definately not worth the money....", 
    "Arrived quickly with ridiculously careful packaging. Not a mark or a scratch on it during the shipping process. Pretty easy to assemble, I did it in about 1.5 hours on my own. The final product is attractive and functional.", 
    "Display case is very sturdy and stylist at the same time. Assembly is quick and so is delivery. Buy this item and you won't regret. Could not find style like this else where, only on Overstock.com", 
    "I would recommend this product, but as stated above, it is probably a bit overpriced for the quality.", 
    "It is a nice unit, but prepare for the hardest ever assemble. I can't even call it assemble, it's building and it's no fun. First off make sure you have your own glue, b/c the glue they provide wont even be enough for the 1st two shelves. All in all it took us good 2 hours to put it together and it is not like we've never done it before. The piece itself is nice & solid. If you don't mind the pain of putting it together, then go for it.", 
    "The shelf came very fast, pretty easy to assemble. It looks great and a very nice decorative piece for the room, but not very sturdy. It's mainly for a few books, dvd's, and a few decorative items. If you need a sturdy shelf for heavy books, this isn't it.", 
    "The absolute worst product I have ever bought online. Incredibly tedious to assemble, not at all sturdy when completed, and of an overall poor quality. It doesn't even come with little wooden bits to cover the screw holes - it comes with little black stickers instead. It is low quality through and through.", 
    "I like the looks of the bookcase, but the shelves sag under their own weight. I thought I had to remove the bottom leg like shelf and let the entire first shelf rest on the floor. Buying online and shipping was fast and easy. I would not have bought the bookcase had I seen it, but I don't feel the need/desire to return it either.", 
    "Overall satisifed with how the shelf came out - but it was not easy to put together and the directions were not accurate. It fits well where we wanted it to, but would not use if not against a wall.", 
    "I knew thiswas going to be a project to put together. I expected the screws to actually work. They came with the lock screws that lock into the nuts (or should lock into the nuts. No such thing, and the screws didn't catch into the hole they were designed for. I gently used a wood mallet to help with connecting the pieces. End up putting a hole in one of the boards. So, a big waste of $$$. Not sure if there was anyway those screws would have ever worked.. GOOD LUCK if you purchase,"
