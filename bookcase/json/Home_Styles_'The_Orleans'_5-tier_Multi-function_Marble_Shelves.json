    "I am very pleased with these shelves. They added elegance to my dining room, especially we all the beautiful china, crystal and silver pieces I decorated it with. Looks much more expensive than it really is.", 
    "I've received so many compliments on these shelves! They were very easy to assemble and are quite sturdy. I am thinking about buying another.", 
    "Very easy to assemble, beautiful and modern but, classic at the same time. We put them, we bought 2, in our Optometrist office, which we have decorated with lots of real antiques. They look gorgeous!!!", 
    "Put them in the kitchen for appliances and extras since my pantry is so small.", 
    "The shelf is beautiful and very study, easy to put together. My handy man did not have any trouble. This is the second shelf I bought. First one came through with no problems, this one had a crack in one of the shelves. It looks like it happened when they drilled the hole to attach it to the frame.Customer service is giving me a problem with a replacement. I should have ordered it from W--fair. Their customer service is awesome.I have ordered a lot of items from Overstock, but I think from now on, I will order from the other sites which have better customer service.The shelf it self is worth buying, but if you have a problem, Good luck", 
    "The shelves look just like marble. It looks good in my contemporary living room.", 
    "Looks good but have to be very careful what you set on the shelf. Coating in very thing and they warn you about when you are putting it together. Takes two people or a long long time.", 
    "I get complimented on these shelves often. They are heavy and substantial.", 
    "Takes a while to put together but well worth it. Remember this is not real but faux marble, but still has realized a dozen compliments when friends visit. Super functional as a bar and bookshelf unit. Well worth it.", 
    "I love this shelf. It was a little tough putting together (the two rods in the back don't easily align with the holes) but all in all you won't be disappointed. Oh and the shelves are not marble as the title suggest the are like a pressed would with a faux marble wrap. but for the price I wasn't expecting real marble", 
    "Wow- these shelves are beautiful! it takes a little time to put together but it wasn't difficult. The \"marble\" shelves look authentic. Plus, you can't beat the price.", 
    "Good looking faux marble shelves, but quality doesn't with the price. If you are looking for something pretty and just to display small pieces, this is it. However, these shelves are not sturdy and way too narrow. I'm looking for a good looking shelves for storing my bowls and plates. For $270, I expect something with better quality.", 
    "Ordered this and it took about an hour to put together...husband did most of it. Very nice marble-like shelves, very heavy duty, stands nice and looks really pretty in our living room....no regrets....great purchase!", 
    "Easy to assemble, just had trouble with the last support piece that goes under each shelf.", 
    "This shelf is very sturdy, but I bought this one for the feet adjusters because I have uneven wood floors, they turned out to be made out of cheap plastic and I still had to use shims to make it level", 
    "Great size ,beautiful marble shelves, look real.Well made, very sturdy.", 
    "I love these shelves! We have them in our kitchen, but really they are nice enough to go anywhere. Easy to assemble but we needed two people. Highly recommend!", 
    "Very easy to put together by myself. Again, do not tighten screws till it's all together. The \"X\" needs a little muscle to reach the holes. But if you have not tightened all screws, not a problem. The marble finish looks fabulous, best faux marble I've ever seen. Also, there were bars to screw in under each shelf giving it more strength. I was able to put all my coffee table books on the shelves with no sagging. My daughter in law guessed the price to be $1500! Thrilled with this piece, as I always am with every item purchased from Overstock.Thankyou to everyone who takes the time to leave reviews, it really helps!", 
    "I am very happy with these shelves, looks like I payed much more than I did. First thing you need to know is that the shelves are only 11 inches deep. There is a 2-3 inch gap between the back of the shelf and the wall, so 11 inch dinner plates do fit fine on these shelves. Each shelf has a metal reinforcing bar under the shelf (have an electric screwdriver ready for assembly), the shelves can hold a lot of weight. Fit and finish is fine (though I was missing 5 washers). Very satisfied,", 
    "Love the look! Sturdy, polished, and a nice addition to our new home. Will be purchasing another", 
    "They're a lot sturdier than I thought they'd be, easy to put together and they look great", 
    "Placed the order on a Saturday it arrived on Wednesday. We put it together in 30 minutes. Easy to follow instructions. The quality is top notch. This was my first time ordering from Overstock so I was unsure what to expect. Very pleased!", 
    "I was expecting more when I read the reviews before I purchased. The quality is pretty good and was very easy to put together, but the marble shelves do not look real.....they are very plasticy. Sometimes you get what you pay for...."
