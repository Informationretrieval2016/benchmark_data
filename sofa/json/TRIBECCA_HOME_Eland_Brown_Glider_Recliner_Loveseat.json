    "Fun and very comfortable. We use it every day. Conforms very well to lower back problems", 
    "Do not buy this! I purchased mine 3 years ago with a warranty for the leather. It started coming off. I called the warranty company and sent pictures. I was told it was normal wear and tear. It is only 3 years old. I then went to pedigo furniture where I purchased this loveseat and a couch. The owner/manager told me the company has went out of business and there has been problems with the fabric/leather. He said he could do nothing for me. Now the leather is peeling off so bad, I can not use it anymore. 3 year old furniture I paid $3,000 for is totally destroyed. Please don't buy this!!!!!!!", 
    "The love seat is very lovely. The dark brown color looks very elegant. The love seat recliner and swivel back and fort seating very enjoyable. I receive the item without any damages. The love seat also has cup holder and a little compartment for TV and stereo remote controls. I love it.", 
    "very comfortable, fits me just right, my wife and kids love it too", 
    ".very easy to put together", 
    "The frame was bent and it's falling apart", 
    "It is a bit light (moves easily on hardwood) bit very nice looking and comfortable", 
    "Not worth the money, look for something else"
