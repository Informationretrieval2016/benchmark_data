    "These chairs are comfortable, stylish and exactly what we wanted for our home. We like them so much that we will probably be buying two armchairs to complete the set. So happy with our purchase!", 
    "product is absolutely fantastic, high quality, and comes very well packaged and protected!", 
    "these chairs are stylish and look nice. the white is \"white\", which I love. they are not super heavy or super sturdy, but they are exactly what you would expect when ordering. i have 4 of them around a small kitchen table which matches the legs... and we love it. i recommended to a friend for a desk chair w/ white desk."
