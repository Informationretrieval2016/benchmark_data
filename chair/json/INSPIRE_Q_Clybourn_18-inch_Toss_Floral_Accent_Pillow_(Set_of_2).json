  "reviews": [
    "These pillows were advertised as 18 inches. They are more like 14 inches so were disappointing. The fabric and style were great, only the size was a problem.", 
    "I ordered the blue floral print. It was delivered today, and the color is way off! The invoice says \"Grey Floral\" so I'm not sure if they sent the wrong item or if it's just a printing error. That being said, the color does not look blue or grey. It's some sort of greenish. Very unattractive. Didn't even bother removing it from the box. Opened it, took one look and knew it was going back. Returning immediately!", 
    "Very \"sturdy\" pillow. Will take plenty of tumbling in a family room, etc.", 
    "Match the chairs that I also purchased.", 
    "The firmness of these pillows is great for me as I require support to help me sit up. These truly fit the bill and are just beautiful. I am so glad that I broke our puppy from attacking pillows before I got these as I would hate to see anything that sad happen to them!", 
    "High-quality pillows with removable cover.", 
    "The pillow itself isn't very comfortable/fully. Plus, one came with a stain on it that we can't get out.", 
    "Love the colors with charcoal black sofa. gives it just enough POP!", 
    "Love them! Heavy fabric to match the chairs. Great quality.", 
    "Nice addition to my Mid Century style living room!", 
    "Goes well with the ottoman!", 
    "pillows are a little small for advertised size. Color D QUALITY OK", 
    "Not what I expected but found a guest room to put them in. A bit cheap. Not recommend. The colors are faded.", 
    "I needed one more pillow to complete the color story for my room. These pillows added the perfect finishing touch. The quality is great and I was pleasantly surprised to see a finished zipper on the back for easy-care.", 
    "When I looked at these pillows along with the ottoman and chairs I thought they were exactly what I was looking for. I needed grey blue and taupe colors. When I looked at the color on my monitor that was what I saw. After reading the reviews there seemed to be some controversy whether the blue was blue or green. I did not want to order all four products if the color was not going to match. I decided to ask a question. I got a response from Overstock that it was blue. So I ordered. When I received the shipment and opened just the pillows, the colors were not what I was expecting. Yes there is a part of the leave pattern that is blue but the stems are plant green with some other colors mingled in. I realize that colors look different on line but the smaller details are not seen. Color swatches in these cases would be great.", 
    "Nice quality pillow. Looks great on the couches I ordered!!!", 
    "Great for color fin for the home", 
    "I bought these pillows to match my chair and tie in my solid beige couch. The fabric is wonderful but as stated in another review, the foam inside is flat and doesn't fill out the pillow. I thought it would eventually puff up if I just left them sitting out, but after 3 weeks, they are still flat. I will probably have to do as the other buyer did, and buy new foam to go inside. Not a good deal for the money at all, but needed for my d\u00e9cor.", 
    "I already had a couple of these in a different color, I decided to get a contrasting color and it looks great!", 
    "Very little padding- the material is not as nice as it looks in the picture- there were strings coming off of the pillow- these should have been much less.", 
    "Don't know if what I received was NEW or quality of the material. OK and will keep but would NOT purchase again.", 
    "To expensive for the quality.NO piping around the edge.", 
    "I needed grey and purple pillows which is what I thought I was getting with these pillows. But they are shades of taupe. They are very pretty. But the color is wrong described.", 
    "I was so impressed with the quality of the material on these two pillows.........I ordered a matching chair today!", 
    "I was very disappointed when I opened the package and realized that the pillows are so much smaller than advertised. It is a square, 15\"x 15\" if stretched. Really it is 13\" x 13\".", 
    "These pillows were the perfect colors and style for my office. I take little power naps using them on the settee in my office, and they are cushy but firm. I've had them for a few months now, and they still look like new.", 
    "The pillows match the chair I purchased Though it was a little too expensive but Overall they are nice"
