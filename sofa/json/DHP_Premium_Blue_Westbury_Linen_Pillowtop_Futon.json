  "reviews": [
    "For the price I was surprised how attractive this futon is. Not the most comfortable option for sleeping but used a twin mattress topper which helped immensely. Easy assembly as well.", 
    "I bought this futon for my daughter's NY apartment. It was easily assembled within half an hour. It transforms from sofa to bed quickly. It was comfortable enough for a night.", 
    "Great for a futon....will need a soft cover if anyone is sleeping for a long period of time. It looks great and I really like the blue fabric.", 
    "It looks nice. But, when you seat on it for a while your derri\u00e8re hurts, it's just not as strong and firm.", 
    "low to the ground, but OK for a futon where you aren't using it regularly. Best for a spare room. 3 of the 4 legs fit in fine, but the 4th had to be jimmied in quite well. Not the best fit, but works. Color is true to the photo.", 
    "Very comfortable for sleeping. Great for kids room or rec room", 
    "This is a very small and not soft. Not sure how long it will hold up. If you are looking for a futon that someone can sleep on and a sofa this is not it. The back is very low, it come to mid back when sitting on it. It also is hard. If I had realized this I would have ordered a regular futon.", 
    "This futon looks nice, but feels like a very cheap foam over cardboard when you sit on it. It is fine for occasional use in my office/guestroom, but not sure it would be good for lots of use. When we had guests come, I put another pillow top on top for added comfort which seemed to help for sleeping.", 
    "Looks very nice and reclines at the perfect level for comfort. Well worth $300.", 
    "Good quality for the price. Very comfortable for sitting and sleeping. Nice look and can dress it up any style you like- country accents or very modern accents. Can go great many ways.", 
    "We bought this to replace a sleeper sofa that my dog had taken over, with his slobber and shedding. It was big, clunky, and kind of yuk. So, it looks great, lovely shade of blue, and clean lines. The problem is that it's a very hard surface. It's okay to sit on but the dog won't go near it as it's just too uncomfortable. I suppose that's good, but I feel a little bad about the old guy losing his comfy perch. Oh well. My husband recently slept on this and he found it passable, as long as you put a featherbed over it. I wouldn't recommend this for daily sleeping, but only as additional seating.", 
    "This is extremely easy to assemble - did it alone in just a few minutes. It is, as others state, a bit short for a tall adult; cushions very firm. But, it suits the purpose as an extra place for guests in a pinch!", 
    "For the price this is an excellent buy, however it is not as comfortable as I had hoped. It would be perfect if the cushion was thicker. I have a small apartment and the size fits perfectly. The color is perfect too. This couch is ideal for occasional sitting and guest bedding with a good mattress pad. I'm okay with this buy until I find my dream couch.", 
    "This futon is very stylish! The product pictures are accurate! It shipped folded in half, twice, so I was able to handle the box and assemble the futon alone. All you have to do is unfold it and screw on the legs. All the tools and instructions were included and easy to understand! The back is divided into two sections, that both recline easily into a bed. I have had guests tell me it is very firm, so probably not too comfortable, but for the price and style, I am very satisfied!", 
    "This futon is stylish, easy to assemble, and affordable. I'm very happy with it as both seating and sleeping accommodations!", 
    "Easy to build, looks good but you will not want to have your parents sleep on it. Not cushioned enough. Good for a child or small teen visitor.", 
    "Fast shipping and delivery. Easy assembly and looks beautiful.", 
    "It's smaller than a full bed. Ideal for guests. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "This futon is a great buy. It's easy to put together and does not look cheap!", 
    "We've looked at a lot of modern futons and sofa beds and this one cannot be beat for the price.", 
    "Feels cheap, not very comfortable -- you get what you pay for! But it's a practical, affordable solution if you need something quick and easy."
