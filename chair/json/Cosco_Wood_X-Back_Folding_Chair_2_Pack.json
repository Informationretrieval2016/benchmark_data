When they arrived, I was shocked with how lovely they were, especially at this price point. Not only do they look nice, but they are very sturdy and comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase!",

    "Quality and comfort are great .I would purchase them again.", 
    "Ordered 2 - 2packs for game table. We ended up using the table and chairs for extra seating at a dinner I hosted. They worked out just fine. I like the fact that they fold up and can be stored."
