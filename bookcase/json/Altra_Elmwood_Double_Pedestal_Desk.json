    "Ordered two of these desks for our loft area office. Perfect fit! Very nice wood finish, great price, very easy to assemble!", 
    "I order 2 of these desk for my home office and they are just PERFECT! nice and sturdy- match my plank flooring!!!! I don't assemble ANYTHING but this was so easy for me:-)! IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PICTURE", 
    "Works great for a small space. Easy to assemble and sturdy, although I recommend a power drill as the holes we difficult to screw in by hand.", 
    "Definetely need power tools to assemble this thing. The planks are tough! I had to drill (the already pre-drilled) holes and then screw with an electric screw driver.Once assembled, though, it looks great and serves its purpose well. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "It's a good looking enough table, in a modern industrial style. Looks as expected and I'm happy with the style. However it's much smaller than expected, once you have a lap top on the table there's little room for anything else save for a pile of papers. Once you put your printer on it, there's not much room left to have a lap top and work comfortably. The seat section is also quite snug, fits a normal sized dining hair but it's a 'just nice' fit so pushing in and out of chair is tight. I'm 5ft3\" and it fits me just right, my husband is 6\" and on the lean side and it's definitely snug for him. Side shelves are also too small to place a small sized printer or to accommodate letter-sized papers which are standing upright in a magazine rack.", 
    "Easy to put together. For the price, it's a great buy. Also, perfect for smaller spaces!", 
    "Assembly was simple on this piece, however, the materials seem cheap and it doesn't seem like it will last long.", 
    "This what I was looking for and it serves it's purpose", 
    "The desk it fine, however putting it together was difficult and the screws and legs didn't align. Called the company and they offered to send replacement parts. I ended up just leaving it the way it is and not getting replacement leg because it's in the back and I hardly use it. Probably would not recommend this desk, due to poor construction.", 
    "perfect size desk for my room, college. Nice color", 
    "everyone loved this in my office", 
    "This is a very basic dependable desk. Worth the money.", 
    "My home office is in my bedroom and it is not a large room. I purchased two of these to place side by side to hold 2 monitors, a tower and a printer. They are perfect and the perfect color to match my bookshelves purchased at ******. Very easy assembly and sturdy. Great deal for the price.", 
    "Love this desk. Very sturdy, functional & attractive.", 
    "Love it! A 16 year old girl easily put it together in 40 minutes.", 
    "I LOVE THIS DESK IT IS SO NICE AND STURDY AND EASY TO PUT TOGETHER.", 
    "Uperfect craft desk for my small space. Easy to assemble", 
    "This desk was a purchase for my son in college. I had it shipped directly to him and he put it together himself with no trouble. He says it was easy and that it's very sturdy. The price was very good for this desk too!", 
    "Overall, this is a nice looking piece... but it is constructed of thick particle board which does not seem to have been manufactured very well. During assembly, the screws supplied began to actually pull the particle board apart. The pieces were properly pre-drilled as far as I could tell, and everything fit together relatively well. All the pieces even came undamaged... BUT as the 1.5\" screws were about half way in, several of them started to cause the particle board to begin separating. Fortunately, this was no visible as it was on the undersides but it meant that the screwed had to had a lot more pressure applied to continue their movement \"into\" the particle board rather shredding it. Nice looking and seems sturdy otherwise.", 
    "Love this desk! Easy to put together and very sturdy. Looks nice in my office with the matching shelves. Fast delivery, as usual. Thanks overstock!", 
    "This desk was easy to put together with a drill. It was the size we expected, but the finish was shinier than we realized from the photos. A great purchase for the price.", 
    "Unfortunately I was disappointed by this table. I had read many reviews before I decided to purchase and in overall they were positive. But the table wobbles a lot. It was screwed on as tight as possible any tighter and the compressed wood will disintegrate. Its a nice desk and price was cheap but not sturdy enough so it defeats the purpose for what i orginally bought it for.", 
    "Easy to install and a good size. We were looking for a desk that is functional but does not take up a big area. Easy to install too.", 
    "Solid construction. Not too big; not too small. Am considering getting the end tables, coffee table and shelf unit.", 
    "Easy to put together and sturdy.", 
    "Great desk for my 7th grade son's room. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Sturdy and easy to assemble. Great look and style. Great price for quality!", 
    "Just what I was looking for to open up a small spare bedroom. Replaced bulky \"solid wood\" furniture with this set and incredible how it opened up the space. Great price too!"
