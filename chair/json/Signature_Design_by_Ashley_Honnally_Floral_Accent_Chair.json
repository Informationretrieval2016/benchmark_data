    "Easy to assemble. Light and easy to move around. Works perfect.", 
    "Great quality and looks even better in person", 
    "The chair looks like in the picture, but the quality is not there.", 
    "This was easy to assemble, even though the description stated it was assembled. It is a little low to the floor but provides good, comfortable seating when extra company comes over.", 
    "Very comfortable. I ordered two and am not disappointed.", 
    "Very nice quality for the price. The fabric wrinkles a little in the seat but can be smothed out.", 
    "Bought this for my daughter's new apartment and it goes perfectly with the decor and with a sofa I'd purchased."
