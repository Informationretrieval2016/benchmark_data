    "This set is sturdy and attractive. The reclaimed wood look is quite realistic but be aware that the shelf surfaces are not real wood but a paper-like veneer. This will make dusting and cleaning a breeze, though.Assembly is definitely a two-person job and requires a screwdriver to widen some of the metal clips to make shelving tower components fit together and an awl or drill to start screw holes.It was worth it in the end because there is a lot of storage and the pieces can be used together or separately, even in different rooms.", 
    "I am so happy with how this looks in my apartment. It took a very long time to put this together and some of the pieces had to be hammered a little and fixed to fit but it all came together.", 
    "I was looking for something industrial and rustic. This seemed perfect. The package arrived missing the hardware for one of the shelves and it took over a month to get them shipped to us. The middle piece with the drawers has a sticker made to look like wood on the front which is bubbling and looks totally tacky and cheap. The entire assembly has a very green tint. It doesn't look like the modern grey in the picture which goes with everything. I regret this purchase SO much. If I could return it I would. As a side point, we've had it for 5 months and it's already wobbly and basically turning to junk even though it just sits there with a tv on top. Yes this looks awesome and is a decent deal especially when you see other prices out there, but a piece of furniture that arrives different than pictured and can't even last a full 6 months isn't worth the time it takes to put it together. The worst purchase I have ever made from overstock.", 
    "I love this it look great in my living room", 
    "the shelves are wobbly and come with straps to attach to the wall- THE CONSOLES WERE SOLD OUT and never arrived. Overstock made the situation very right with me. I purchased two sets and only received the 4 shelves --NO consoles", 
    "As stated in other reviews the tabs do need to be bent back out a little bit a big deal however many parts to assemble but well worth the effort very very happy ! I personally kept the pieces a little more spaced apart it made for a better look on such a large wall again very satisfied !", 
    "Some of these pieces did not fit together properly.", 
    "Item looks good but when assembled the wooden shelves are too large for the metal stand. You will have to sand them down or shave them to make them fit.", 
    "Ordered this for daughter's tiny grad school apt. It is perfect, not too big, but plenty of usable space! Very sturdy, easy to assemble. Looks AMAZING!!!", 
    "This unit finished off my room perfectly", 
    "I was pleasingly surprised how nice the wood color is. And a nice solid weight. I haven't put it all together but it seems nice and simple. For the price I think it's a great purchase.I'd recommend it.", 
    "Nice........................", 
    "This looks exactly as it does in the picture and is as solid as a rock! While it is three seperate pieces there is not one bit of wiggle or rock to these pieces. My cat jumps up on it and it doesn't move. The urban distressed look.....fabulous!",
