    "I bought the Veranda Bay Linen Tower and the Veranda Bay 2DR Wall Cabinet for my under furnished bathroom. I was so surprised when it came in and was able to assemble both pieces in and hour and 20 minutes. My bathroom has very little storage so I needed to get something. Even when my little boy ran into it with his tricycle it did not scratch. This is one of the best values I have gotten for the money and it was way better than IKEA.", 
    "We looked around several places and online before we decided to make this purchase. The tower came well protected, all pieces were there and it was relatively easy to put together. I did it myself but would have been somewhat easy with another set of hands. We felt like we got what we expected and paid for.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for a home we're remodeling. I needed some storage space between the two vanities and this works perfectly. I'd looked all over in the box stores for something comparable but there's wan't anything that came close to this price. It's not a top-end furnitute piece but exactly what I needed. It's a petite cabinet with lots of storage. It took me about an hour to put it together - only needed a screwdriver.", 
    "Looks can fool you, cause it looked decent but when received it had cracks in the wood and the door was not straight, so repairs were necessary. To big to break back down and return Not worth the money or aggravation or days of repairs.", 
    "Generally as described. Comes in very cheap packaging though, with low quality cardboard and Styrofoam that makes a mess when you assemble the cabinet. You will be finding styrofoam beads from the packaging around your house for months to come. Many, many parts, but instructions are clear and all it takes is patience.", 
    "As another reviewer mentioned, the hardware connecting the tops to the bottoms is not fitted correctly. Cannot get the cam screws to tighten no matter what. Since I'll only be placing towels in the top half, I'm going to give it a try, but I fear the top will come toppling over any day now. Don't buy this unless you know how to correct for factory mistakes like this.", 
    "This is a pretty tower. I needed a narrow but tall tower that would fit between a bed and a door in my craft room. This works perfectly and holds all the containers of beads,It took a bit to put together, but it is really nice looking when put together.", 
    "To be truthful, my husband did all of the construction, I just picked them out. It took him only an hour to have the tower assembled, and about the same to put the cabinet together. I agree with my husband, they both would be better if the backs were made out of MFD instead of cardboard. The tower would benefit greatly from some sort of added stability. Until I filled the tower, I was a little concerned on how unstable it felt without the weight of the towels. A little deeper would have been nice, too. Over all, I am pleased with how good they look in my laundry room, which also happens to be my bathroom. I would recommend them to someone on a budget, like us, that it was money well spent.", 
    "I experienced none of the issues in previous negative reviews. Packaging of this item was excellent. Directions were very clear. Materials were well organized. The quality of the cabinet was very good. It is heavy and went together very easily. For the cost of the item, very well made and very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "Cute but cheap. The magnet doesn't keep the door closed. Some of the screws actually broke while assembling so its loose. Not worth the money.", 
    "The Linen Tower was as it appeared on line, the package came in quickly with no damage. The Linen Tower was easy to put together and very sturdy. We are extremely please with the purchase of this product!", 
    "I have a bathroom with no linen closet :( and I have many towels and linens. I looked and looked for something to hold bathroom products as well as towels. I thought about getting a floor cabinet and separate wall cabinet, but then I saw this and thought it would fit perfectly. It came in good shape with all te pieces. Out of all the pieces and tools and stuff, there was one piece/part that wasn't quite right. But it was able to be assembled regardless. I did it myself in a couple hours. It was pretty easy and sturdy. My only complaint is the door magnet. Does not stay closed. I worked with the tightening and loosening with the door hinges to make it work. I think it works and looks great for what its meant for. I don't see a way to add pics otherwise I would. I'm happy. I put a couple towels on top. Two top shelves four towels each. first shelf make up, drawer every day things like contacts, hair bands, etc. And in the door facial products and hair products (I\"m a girl I have a lot of stuff)", 
    "I would recommend to a friend with some disclosure first. Although it is good in its appearance and application, the construction needs serious improvement. It is flexible to the point where a strap is included to fasten the finally constructed product to the wall. Given the price, I didn't expect it to be indestructible, but when the camlocs won't even tighten down that the side panels are not wobbly, you begin to wonder about your purchase.", 
    "Contrary to other reviews I read this item came with great instructions to put it together. Everything fit together perfectly. It has round white glossy paper circles to cover hardware related holes. Took me about 40 minutes to put together and their stood this beautiful tower. My wife and I had no idea it would look so appealing when we first viewed the pieces in the box.", 
    "This falls under the category of \"you get what you pay for\" When it came it was missing pieces. Then, after months of use, I had to have it glued and screwed, and nailed to keep it together. No more fiber board for me.", 
    "This is just what I needed for a very small space in a second bathroom. It snuggles in between the wall and the sink so well. It's solid and I put it together in an hour. Everything was in perfect condition when it arrived, and I'm so pleased with how it looks in my home.", 
    "Beautiful cabinet. Took my husband 3 hours to put together. Some of the holes didn't match. One of the screws broke inside the drawer handle. So we ended up buying two new handles from the store and used them instead. The cabinet rocked backed and forth when moved as well, so we bought felt pads for the legs to even it out. So, expect to maybe put another $8 into it. We like it though!", 
    "Love this tower for the bath. Fits perfect, easy to assemble. Price is good too.", 
    "Overall, this was well worth what I paid for it. On the plus side, it looks pretty good and provides the storage I need. On the negative side, it arrives in about a million pieces and takes an engineer to assemble (fortunately I had one handy). Also, I've now had it a year and am starting to have a slight problem getting the door to close properly--sometimes it pops open. All things considered, I am satisfied with the purchase.", 
    "This cabinet came with instructions and was easy to put together. The description was very accurate. It looks great in my bathroom and is the perfect size to hold towels and other bathroom items.", 
    "I think it's very pretty. I'm glad I read the reviews or i would have thought I had put it together wrong because the drawer is useless.", 
    "I would say on a scall of one to one hundred I would put it at 85%", 
    "The tower itself is beautiful. Unfortunately there were manufacturer defects. The pre drilled holes for the bottom cabinet door were on the same side as the hinges - Overstock customer service was wonderful to deal with and is sending a replacement part but still an inconvenience. Also the pre-attached drawer runners were placed to high for the drawer to work properly so we had to take it apart and redrill the holes in order for it to work. Also fixable but for the price shouldn't have to be done. Overall the tower is lovely. We just were unlucky in getting one that was somewhat messed up.", 
    "I bought this item because I needed extra storage room in our guest bath. The linen tower fits perfectly in our available space. Its tall and has enough shelves to hold everything that needs to be available. It was a bit of a chore to put together but my husband and I got it put together before he had a melt down. I plan to order another one for one of our closets and I'm sure this one will be easier to assenble.", 
    "This linen tower was as I expected. It suits our needs and is very cute in our pale yellow and white bathroom. There was a nick in the glass door upon arrival, but we called and another one was promptly sent out. Customer service was very good. I am pleased with this product.", 
    "A reasonable product. Less expensive than IKEA. (Note: The plastic pieces that are meant to keep the back from rattling do not do the job. I had to insert wooden toothpicks in the gaps to stop the noise.) One issue with assembly was the fasteners used in the space where the drawer goes were hard to tighten due to lack of space.", 
    "furniture is expensive. knowing that, I had to hope that this shelving unit would fit my needs and it did. Not the best quality, but it does the job. I didn't notice the smell that others complained about.", 
    "The product is not too hard to assemble--did it myself at 9 months pregnant. However, some of the pieces did not match what was supposed to be in the box. I called the manufacturing company and they never returned m phone calls so I just made do with what I had. The structure is somewhat flimsy but if you don't meddle with it much--we're putting it in a downstairs guest bathroom so it isn't a high use area--it should be alright. It looks pretty and cleans up a space for us so it suits our purposes.", 
    "Just what we wanted and asked for. The tower was shipped on time and in excellent condition upon arrivel. Thanks", 
    "Fits in my bath room in the little space I had", 
    "When finished, I was amazed how much stuff it held. I have it within a closet to hold extra toiletries, etc, that my bathroom doesn't have room for. Took the hubby and me and hour to assemble, but, directions are good. Works fine. Recommend", 
    "I bought this to go in my kitchen to place breads, cookies, and chips on. It works great. Great looking too. It was easy to put together. Love it.", 
    "Perfect for the small wall space in my guest bath.", 
    "Loved this cabinet,took about 30 mins for my husband to put together, Its sturdy,decent quality and looks great in my bathroom,plenty of room for towels and anything else you want to store,great buy!!!", 
    "Perfect for what I needed it for! Easy to assemble and looks great!", 
    "Easy to put together and very solid using cams and wooden dowel pins, perfect fit between my sink and wall next to bathroom door.", 
    "Added much needed storage space in a very small footprint", 
    "I needed a little help putting it together, but all the part were there & the instructions were good. It is a sturdy piece of furniture.", 
    "Easy assembly, all pieces arrived in great condition despite beat up box. Highly recommend this unit for an affordable and well built option.", 
    "Easy to put together and looks great!", 
    "Good value .. Easy to assemble.. Still using and looking good after 3 tenants ..", 
    "The width was misleading. The top is the widest part. It is very narrow and \"ok\". I think it should be priced lower for the quality. It was not level once assembled. I wound up buying another piece and gave this to my son for his apartment at college. He can leave it there when he is done!", 
    "This actually worked for me...My bathroom is narrow and this fit perfect against my wall, nice looking too....", 
    "Linen tower is beautiful when you get it together. Had issues tightening up the bottom shelf. But overall good product", 
    "I've only had it about 3 to 4 weeks but it's working out well, it is sturdy and built to last if your not rough with it, good for all your bathroom products, I would recommend it, yes absolutely.", 
    "Instructions that come with the product need to be more detailed. This was hard to put together it took me 6 hrs and had to take it apart 3 times to get it the right way", 
    "Very nice in my new bathroom. Perfect size.", 
    "Very easy to assemble. Perfect size for my bedroom to keep towels, etc.", 
    "had to return. not big enuf", 
    "This tower is exactly as it looks. It is sturdy and is perfect for the bathroom.", 
    "It was difficult to put together. I couldn't do it myself, but it looks great and provides a lot of storage.", 
    "Great for small spaces.... used it for a corner in the bathroom. Not solid wood .... the back part is cardboard.", 
    "Purchased this for our small powder room, and it fits perfectly in the corner. It looks great, and I love the glass cabinet detail. Only thing I didn't like is the metal detail on the front of the glass part was scratched, so you can see the grey metal where it should be white.", 
    "nothing special. though glass door doesn't like to stay closed.", 
    "This cabinet is perfect.", 
    "This piece fit perfectly into an area I needed it... the directions were a tiny bit confusing at one point but we were able to go back and correct the problem...", 
    "I ordered two of these for a tiny hallway in my cottage and now by adding fabric \"drawers\" to each shelf (from the dollar store) we have his and hers storage for everything from shorts to t-shirts. Just love them - good price, easy to put together (make sure you keep track of the front as you build) and pretty darn sturdy!!", 
    "Works well -- I would suggest to anybody.", 
    "Very pretty and petite, simple instructions", 
    "This cabinet was exactly what I wanted. Fits perfectly in my bathroom and matches my wall cabinet. It was easy to put together.", 
    "The joints were a little sloppy", 
    "I like the unit. It looks better than your average laminate bathroom cabinet. Once everything was out of the box, it took about 90 minutes to put together with a pre-season football game on. I was disappointed by the corner of one of the shelves that clearly had been cut or torn (fiberboard) and glued back on. I was able to turn the shelf around so that it is not visible. It is a small area, about the size of a nickel, so I can see how it might have been missed if the item was returned. The point is, the item was sold as new, not as a return.", 
    "Got this for my 90 year old mother in law. She needed storage in her small bathroom, this workst perfectly.!", 
    "This is one of the few items I have purchased on Overstock that really disappointed me. This looks like a $25 piece of junk. Had we not spent so much time putting this mess together, it would be going back. I am going to push for some refund on it as it is clearly not worth $155. The shelves look off white, it wobbles and is a real disappointment. Stuffing it with towels and other things to try to hide the deficiencies. This is way overpriced so look elsewhere.", 
    "This was just what I needed for more storage in my small bathroom. Wasn't to difficult to put together.", 
    "Not real easy to assemble but not the hardest either. Looks more expensive than really is.", 
    "The item itself is pretty but lacks sturdiness. The top and bottom did not connect well and we had to use some glue. The drawer holes were not complete so we had to drill the holes ourselves. Again, pretty but it's compressed wood that lack quality.", 
    "Serves its purpose, but not the best quality and came in a million piecces to put together.", 
    "Perfect size for what I was needing in my master bath! Great looking a little tough to put together but great result!!", 
    "this cabinet was ok but came in a lot of pieces not very sturdy", 
    "I love this item; it added style to my bathroom; however I wish it had been wider. But would purchase it again. The price is good.", 
    "This tower was better than I thought it was going to be for the price. It took a little while to put together, but it looks good and is a solid piece of furniture.", 
    "I love this cabinet...it was easy to put together, with only one difficulty...you will need an angle screwdriver to attach two of the little \"bolts\" under the drawer area and the drawer stop required a bigger hole drilled for the plastic part, which I had to replace since the original got broken and they didn't provide an extra. Other than that, this seems very sturdy especially for the price.", 
    "I ordered this for a small spot in my bathroom for towels and etc.....it fits perfect and looks nice. It was not difficult at all to assemble. I am satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "great quality for the dollar . i get many compliments on it love it. will always deal with overstock", 
    "Easy to put together and very sturdy! Looks beautiful! HIGHLY recommend!", 
    "This linen tower has a decent amount of storage space; however, it is not sturdy and several of the pieces were not fully painted white -- including on surfaces that are visible once the item is put together. Some of the boards and screw holes did not align properly, which made it impossible to secure the pieces tightly and, hence a wobbly linen tower. Very disappointed.", 
    "Love it, fits perfectly in the place I bought it for. Hardware should be a better quality, a piece has broken while we were putting it together.", 
    "I'll start off by saying that the box was damaged during transit, so some of my opinions on this product would probably be different if I had received an undamaged box, but I am still opting for a refund vs. a replacement from Overstock because now that I have seen the product up close, I don't think it was worth ***. There were virtually large dings/divots on nearly every edge of the piece. The magnet mechanism on the door was so weak, that if I open the door or touch one of the upper shelves, then the cabinet door opens. The construction was just really poor - I have a lot of experience putting together various pieces of furniture so I don't think this was user error - things just don't fit together the way you think they should. Overstock was very responsive to my concerns so no complaints there. Probably off to *** to get a replacement tower.", 
    "Paint was damaged, blotches Drawer did not line up properly, cannot open Not very stable", 
    "The packaging of this cabinet was excellent. The hardware was blister packed which made it very easy to see each part and the quantity. It had two places where the paint was marred, but was in the back. There is 4 pieces of hardware that attaches the top of the cabinet to the bottom. Two were not long enough. Evidently, the holes were drilled to deep. Luckily, the other two fit properly to keep the two pieces from moving sideways. Another hole wasn't drilled correct, but was in the back and doesn't show. The size fit well for my small bathroom. It was fairly easy to put together. I felt the price was a little high considering the quality. I would only recommend buying this cabinet after explaining the pitfalls I've just mentioned.", 
    "I have a small bathroom. I needed something sturdy for my towels as well as storage. This fits my needs.", 
    "I was very happy with the quality of the product. It was just the right size for my small bathroom to add just the storage that I needed. Thanks again for another quality product..."
