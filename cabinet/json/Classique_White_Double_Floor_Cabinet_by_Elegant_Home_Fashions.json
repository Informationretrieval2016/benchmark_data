    "The delivery was speedy, so speedy that when the lady who signed for me informed me of its arrival (two days ago), i was shocked. I was alerting her that day of its possible arrival in the next day or two. QUALITY/ SPECS wise: It was just what i thought. I did a lot of research in both areas at this website and a numerous other websites, just to get a balanced view. ASSEMBLY: I am petite with weak arms (i am athletic, except with my arms). I am not one of those Home-Depot type women, who own drills and are good at using them. I do visit hardware stores for keys, nuts and bolts. THIS piece came with holes in all the proper places (for assembly) (two extra ones on the side piece alarmed me, but no consequences), correct number of bolts (everything was neatly sealed in their respective little plastics wraps). IT TOOK me maybe 1 3/4 - - 2 hours, but those were not head-scratching two hours. It was leisurely. I was basically reading the instruction (easy to understand), took my time to follow the instructions. EVERY wood piece was clearly marked, again, correctly as they are shown in the printed instructions. Because I stood them up around the hallway, i had to go look for the right piece when it is called for in the instruction for that particular step. AT THE the day, you do not feel it was two dreadful hours, filled with anxiety and surprises. It was well spent. You sit down and relish the sight of this pure, little practice piece that is, in part, the fruit of your labor. You love it.", 
    "The parts were clearly labeled. I took inventory of all the parts before I started. The only thing that threw me was parts 7 and 8. They were in the same bag and so I thought at first that I was missing part 7 because the 7 was printed on one side and the 8 was printed on the other. The instructions were very logical and the cabinet was designed well so I had no problems putting it together with just a Phillips head screwdriver. My mother is very pleased with the cabinet and she gets a lot of complements on it. I thought it was a good price and the shipping charge was cheap. I was shocked when I ordered it off of my IPhone Saturday night and it arrived on Wednesday.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for our back entryway/laundry area as a place for my daughter's art supplies. It is not as deep as some of the cabinets we considered, but perfect for smaller spaces. The cabinet is well designed and looks more expensive than what we paid for it. I gave it 4 stars for ease of assembly as there were a lot of parts and some gluing involved, but my husband was able to put it together in about 35 minutes without trouble. In my opinion, this cabinet may not be ideal for very heavy items (large books, dishware, for example), but it's perfectly suited for towels, linens, art supplies and the like. I'd definitely recommend this product to a friend.", 
    "I got this cabinet to put in my hall bath. I wanted to store extra guest towels, toilet paper, and some baskets for other bathroom toiletries. It was perfect. Special note on towels: you can only store them by turning them sideways and only two per shelf if shelves are evenly spaced, otherwise they jut out so the doors can't close, but I think they look neater this way. Great purchase. Very happy.", 
    "Like every other product I have purchased from O.com, the product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It took me about an 1.5 hours to put together, but I did it myself without incident. This is a great product for the price. I know this is sold as a \"bathroom\" cabinet, but I am using it as a display case in my living area. The size of the cabinet is perfect for a smaller space and I couldn't be more pleased! Thanks!", 
    "The product was easy to assemble and one wouldn't need a great deal of experience to assemble this product. However, one must remember, this is a factory product from China. There are instances where holes will not line up and therefore, it can make it difficult to insert screws where they are required. The hardware that arrives with the product, may not be checked for quality (I received some pieces that were defective and therefore, made it impossible to completely assemble as directed) doors are not even when closed (etc.) For the price, it is a nice addition to the bathroom, but the shelves are smaller than they appear on line. The cabinet isn't large enough to hold towels... maybe wash clothes and hand towels, but not a bath towel, there simply isn't room.", 
    "Had to call and get proper pieces for the cabinet. Great looking cabinet if the pieces were actuate.", 
    "I bought three of these for my kitchen. I lined them all together. A friend came over and said they looked like a built in cabinet set. The shelves are a little thin so I had to be carefull of the weight on the two middle shelves. I wouldn't store heavy dishes. The cabinet is sturdy so if you needed to store something with weight to it you would need to replace the shelves. I'm very happy with the look and how pretty my glassware collection looks in it. Can't beat the shipping either!", 
    "This piece looks nice in our bathroom. But...the materials are flimsy, machining (holes for screws, etc.) was bad, and several pieces of the metal hardware used to hold it together fell apart during assembly...cheap steel. I used to be a professional cabinetmaker, which was good since I had to drill some of my own holes and use my own screws to keep the top on. There were exactly the right amount of screws and other hardware, when I could have used a few extra when things broke on me. I don't expect it to last too long, but it's temporary, so I feel ok about it given the low price.", 
    "The cabinet is being used for additional storage in the guest bathroom. The product had a couple of small places where the paint was marred. Unfortunately, this was noticed after completing the assembly. I asked for touch up paint. That was not an option. The quality is OK for the money. However, the backing is very flimsy. On the whole, I am satisfied with the looks and function of the cabinet.", 
    "There was a sctratch near the class front door. The cabinet had been assembled and it was too much of a hassle to return.The quality was what can be expected for this price point.", 
    "It came broken and still haven't received the replacement part. I am getting really mad. I made 2 calls about this and was suppose to get an email to confirm parts being sent. Still have not heard. so I am paying for something I can not use!!!", 
    "Truly very low quality! Predrilled holes do not let the front door close, back panels holes do not align with holes in the cabinet, corner are off by .25\u0094 very noticeable. Cam screws are made of very soft metal. Overall, I will rated it with an \u0093F\u0094 It is not worth $*** it is more like $***!", 
    "First the packaging was not sealed well and all the hardware fell out during shipping, requring not 1 but 2 seperate shipments of the right hardware. They mixed up the doors when they put the magnets on, meaning the hardware didn't line up right, requiring me to drill new holes. and the magnets aren't that strong.but to the design, the whole thing is too short to hold towels well. poor design overall", 
    "When I opened the box, I discovered that one of the pieces went with a completely different piece of furniture. Customer Service was responsive and sent out a new cabinet. I had the cabinet completely assembled, aside from the doors, when I discovered that the doors were too big for the cut out on the cabinet. I contacted Customer Service again, and was told that since I hadn't sent the first cabinet back I could just swap out the doors. When I tried this I found that the doors from the first cabinet did not even go with this product. The hinges on the doors did not line up with the location for the hinges on the cabinet. Rather than calling again to have replacement doors sent out, I opted to just not having doors. After this experience I am leery about ordering any more furniture from Overstock, and I probably would not suggest it to any of my friends.", 
    "I am hesitant to order assemble it yourself furniture, especiallly a cabinet with glass doors, however this went together easily. Every part fit perfectly, even hinges and glass doors. It looks great in our newly renovated sea blue bathroom and is the perfect height for a cosmetic counter under a wall mirror.", 
    "This is a great cabinet for a small space. I used in a small bathroom to get things tidy and out of sight. The back probably would not be one to expose (not wood) but being it is against the wall made it no problem. It has nice clean simple lines. I would recommend using Overstock; the first cabinet arrived damaged which was due to the shipper not Overstock, I notified Overstock the day it arrived and they shipped another out immediately; very good customer service.", 
    "We needed a place to store towels in our master bathroom. This is the perfect compliment to suit our needs. Avery good product.", 
    "We were very pleased with the product. It was well made and easy to put together. The size was just right for our bathroom. The quality was better then I expected", 
    "It was a little of a pain to put together and the doors don't measure up perfectly but overall its a good addition to our bathroom and holds towels, bathroom accessories, etc..", 
    "It fits everything I need in my guest bathroom. Good quality and very sturdy.", 
    "Needed small storage in our bathroom...this little cabinet is very attractive and I had it put together in under an hour.", 
    "Easy assembly,lots of uses . I moved so can't fit it in my bathroom anymore so now it's in my hallway,works well.", 
    "love it and looks great in my bathroom!!!", 
    "Our granddaughter recently moved out so we've turned her room into our War Room. We needed a cabinet to put the TV on and this is perfect. It was easy to put together and looks awesome. Nice quality, clear white in color. Very sturdy. We just had to drill a hole in the back for the cords but with an electric drip it was easy.", 
    "This little cabinet has worked exceedingly well as a coffee center. It was very easy to put together and is very stable.", 
    "Love my cabinet, I really do! Very clean lines and is just perfect for the smaller things I need to put away. BUT, it was hard to put together. I live alone and while I have a tool box and know how to fix things, it seemed that some of the screw holes were not flush which made gaps in some of the joints. Considering what I paid, it was a great deal and I am happy with it but it was quite frustrating to feel inadequate to put it together. Also, there were extra parts that were not described in the instructions.", 
    "Easy to assemble..dainty bath cabinet. Love it", 
    "Easy to put together looks great in my Bathroom!", 
    "I was so excited to fine this cabinet however when it was deliver so many parts were missing especially the main part the top of the cabinet after viewing it in person based on the picture it was not big enough .", 
    "This cabinetis a pain to put together especially if you are over 60 and are not an octopus. You must have two people. We read the directions more than once and still found challenges.", 
    "cabinet had a warp board talk to customer service wanted us to take the whole cabinet apart after being put together and glued to return it instead of just giving us a discount for all the touble plus its very small.Very Disappointed", 
    "Beautiful and it goes with my bathroom set", 
    "This cabinet was an addition to a spare bathroom that doesn't get a lot of traffic. It's a perfect addition.", 
    "Although a little smaller than anticipated, it served my purpose perfectly. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "Needed a little extra storage for my bathroom. This fit nicely behind the bathroom door and is well made for the price. Would order again.", 
    "Perfect for a skinny space...", 
    "not the highest quality but good looking and a perfectfit.", 
    "I must have purchased this year's ago. I still have it and I still like it very much.", 
    "Amazing piece, easy to construct, fit perfectly in my bathroom. Good solid pieces and great fit. Very impressed but read the instructions carefully as the pieces are not all numbered.", 
    "Put it together this evening. I'm not handy with tools, but it was really easy. All I needed was a screwdriver. The hardware was mislabeled, but it was easy enough to figure out what was what. Looks great in my bathroom.", 
    "good quality and looks very nice in my bathroom.", 
    "easy to put together - has been a great piece of furniture for the bath room", 
    "This cabinet was easy to assemble and quality is consistent with the price point. Cabinet doors open and close smoothly.", 
    "I needed a small cabinet for my bathroom and the size of this one was right. The cabinet is very nice, although it has two fixed shelves, and not the adjustable shelf it claims. It was also a lot of work to put together, so the thought of returning it after I discovered the shelf issue was not an option. Overall, it's nice for the money.", 
    "This cabinet was a wonderful addition to our bathroom. It is small, but perfect for storing toiletry items and spare towels. It was easy to assemble and came with all parts and no damage. The wood does have a slight smells as others have mentioned, but this passes quickly. Great buy!", 
    "Glass on doors is flimsy.", 
    "easy to put together. Love it, good quality.", 
    "I am only giving this 4 stars because even though Overstock sent me a replacement side panel, the pre-drilled screw holes did not line up and I finally had to leave one screw out. I don't plan on putting anything heavy in this cabinet so it shouldn't be an issue", 
    "Thus cabinet fit perfectly in our guest bathroom. It is a good height. The glass doors allow us to showcase a stack of plush colorful towels that contrast nicely with the clean white finish.", 
    "happy with the purchase - didn't need anything fancy and looks exactly like the picture", 
    "I absolutely love my cabinet. It gives me the extra storage space I need in my bathroom.", 
    "Perfect for extra storage in bathroom", 
    "I love this cabinet, but I hated assembling it. Have had it several years and it could use some tightening because it has become slightly wobbly.", 
    "Bought this cabinet a few years ago and it is still standing strong!", 
    "I love the cabinet it is the right size for the 1/2 bath I keep all my towels in it on top I have two flower pot Had a little trouble with the back hole did not line up but it was not a problem husband took care of that", 
    "I'm very pleased with this purchase. The cabinet is well made and not at all difficult to put together. It looks great in the bathroom and provides much needed storage.. glad I made a great decision.. as always, Overstock did a great job meeting my needs.", 
    "This cabinet looks great in my bathroom. Works perfectly!", 
    "This was fairly easy to assemble, and I think it looks great in the bathroom next to the sink -- and exactly the same height. I took one star off for the strong smell! They treated it with some sort of chemical and it still smells after one month. :(", 
    "it is cute and fits in the space I had. It is exactly as shown and very white, which was what I was looking for. shelf adjusts enough that my tall cook books can go in using only 1 shelf but it comes with 2. It was easy to assemble and seems very sturdy. definitely recommend.", 
    "Was easy to put together Wish it was a little bigger but looks nice in the bathroom Using it for my sheets and towels", 
    "I purchased this cabinet hoping to fit it in a small space in the bathroom. It fit perfect between two vanity sets. The cabinet is small but spacious and it looks great in the space. It looks like it was purchased with the cabinets. I would recommend this item to others. Very satisfied with purchase.", 
    "Exactly as pictured, pleased!", 
    "There is a lot of assembly required. When the box came in the instructions were not included. Overstock.com emailed them to me within minutes after I contacted them!! The quality is great for the price.", 
    "Nice product, easily assembled.", 
    "Small white cabinet that is perfect for small spaces. It fit perfect in our hall 1/4 bathroom. Nice finish and easy to assemble.", 
    "Looks nice and as described", 
    "We purchased this cabinet for an older relative that needed a cabinet in her bath. She didn't use it long before we moved it to our granddaughter's room for added storage. It is cheaply made and after 2 years the painted top has peeled off and looks horrible. It still stands and functions but should be purchased for a place seldom used. The top should be protected from moisture and rough bottomed containers. I would not buy it again.", 
    "This is great in my bathroom. It is cute, durable and according to my hubby not to hard to put together.", 
    "We are using this as a night stand in the guest bedroom. It looks nice. Was pretty easy to put together. One problem is the doors have a gap. They do not meet when closed.it seems sturdy enough.", 
    "easy to assemble, sturdy construction", 
    "My husband put it together in about an hour. The reason I gave it a 4 star is because about an inch piece of the top layer of the paint came off when putting it together. The cabinet is perfect for extra towels, toilet paper, and bathroom stuff. I like it.", 
    "I ordered two of these for my bathroom - I am totally happy with them ... for the money, they were an excellent value and add so much to the room [which is over-sized and looked 'empty'] They look like they cost so much more than what I paid ...", 
    "I had trouble with some of the hardware and fit, but eventually got it together. Looks good and works well.", 
    "I wasn't expecting high quality with this so it is okay for what I paid but would not buy again. The wood cracked in two places while we were putting it together. Once was just when we put the screw in the back so doesn't show but one does. The shelf holders will not stay in so I am going to replace them today. I will say that it was very easy to put together. Most anyone could assemble it very quickly. Pieces and parts are very clearly labeled but of course no words just pictures as we are all assumed illiterate these days.", 
    "I love the look of this linen cabinet. It was a pain to put together. My kit was short on screw and two other pieces broke while assembling. I now know why my husband refuses to put together boxed furniture that is not high quality. I wanted to love this.", 
    "Very useful size in bathroom. Love it!", 
    "There was a side piece already broken off when received, nothing some Gorilla glue couldn't fix. When all assembled, the back and sides of the cabinet didn't line up. Had to file away a small notch so it would fit together. Cabinet looks great but poor quality.", 
    "It was difficult to put the cabinet together because the pieces didn't align as directed. When completed, one door binds and the other won't stay closed. We're using it in a guest bath but don't expect it to last long even there.", 
    "The order arrived very quickly, but the quality was quite poor.Some pieces of the cabinet were only glued together (though it looks like maybe they used very small, totally ineffective staples or brads), and came apart as soon as I took them out of the box. I had to glue them back together before assembling the unit.The hinges for the doors were of the absolute lowest quality, so the doors don't hang straight or line up with each other visually, and there are no adjustments possible.I didn't expect much from a $$$ flat-packed piece of furniture, but this was below even my minimal expectations.I decided to fix it myself and keep it rather than returning it just to avoid the hassle, but In retrospect, with some effort, you could probably find something similar, of slightly higher quality, at about the same price, perhaps from ****?If you do buy this, be prepared to fix it too.", 
    "This cupboard works well in my bathroom. It matches the woodwork very well. I am thoroughly pleased with it.", 
    "This was the perfect sized cabinet for my bathroom. It was a little cumbersome putting it together by myself but would suggest two people work together on assembly. It would assemble much more quickly with two persons.", 
    "Only problems were there was a small chip out of the left door and the glass was loose in the right door. I ended up taping it to the door as I was afraid it would fall out onto the bathroom tiled floor and didn't want broken glass in there.", 
    "I was a little disappointed in the product. The metal holding the glass is off center. The paint on one side of the cabinet is globbed and not smooth and the back of it is cardboard, not what I expected. Would not recommend, expected a little better quality.", 
    "We just finished putting this cabinet together, after much frustration. Panels didn't match up, parts were missing and of low quality. The cabinet is missing the back anchor pieces so it wobbles back and forth, so we will have to fix that with our own parts. One of the pieces fell out and chipped the particle board and the paint off the front/bottom shelf. The scrape shows because the door doesn't cover it. We had to touch up the paint. The panels are painted fiber board, not real wood. Bottom line, you get what you pay for. This cabinet won't last forever (far from it) but it's good enough until we find a piece of quality furniture.", 
    "This cabinet was extremely difficult to assemble, primarily because the holes for the dowels and screws were drilled far too large for the provided pieces. We ended up having to use wood glue to get the dowels to stay in place, and even then, there are some gaps in the assembly that are noticeable. The whole product seems unstable, and I don't have great confidence that it is a piece that can either a) hold much weight; or b) that it can be moved around at all. We have a lot of experience with self-assembly furniture from Ikea, Rooms 2 Go, Pottery Barn, and West Elm, and this is some of the worst made furniture we have seen. Although the cabinet looks nice from a distance, the workmanship is just so poor I would never buy this brand again.", 
    "Overstock.com has taken a turn for the worse. I ordered this piece of furniture over a month ago. When I received it it was missing the most important piece (step one brace). I called to have the piece shipped and was told it would go out from the warehouse in two business days. 2 weeks later, still no part. I call and was told my request was misplaced! The customer service rep told me it would be shipped out on Monday next day air (it was Friday end of day). When I didn't receive it on Wednesday, I called again and was told it should arrive by no later than Thursday. I get home late from work on Thursday and there is a message on my voicemail stating it would arrive on Monday! WHAT??? I called them immediately and was livid! I will never order anything from overstock ever again! BEWARE!", 
    "the cabinet is very attractive & what I expected it to be. However after it was fully assembled the front doors on the cabinet did not hang evenly. The left door hung lower than the right door leaving a 1/2 inch gap at the top of the door. The price was right so I will just have to live with it as it appears.", 
    "Usinge it t in my bathroom to store towels and cosmetics", 
    "The cabinet gives a very clean look to the area. I like the glass doors. The height and width are perfect. I am pleased,", 
    "very nice product is in order the peices put together. It was well pack", 
    "Terrible assembly instructions. No written help just awful illustrations. If a consumer were an octopus assembly might have been just a touch easier. Attaching the unit to the wall would be a joke. Cheap product. Customer service from the original supplier and Overstock.com was quick and excellent to replace a broken part upon arrival.", 
    "This is not an expensive piece of furniture, but it looks beautiful in the hallway to my bathroom. If you expect a the quality of a *** cabinet, you will be disappointed. If you expect the quality of this price cabinet, you will be pleasantly surprised. I love this cabinet!", 
    "Description states is wood, far from it. It is pressed fiber product, back is cardboard. Easy to put together, love the size and style. Description misleading. Disappointed would have returned it but would have cost too much.", 
    "I was looking for a cabinet to fill a space in my kitchen. I use it to store and display my dishes. Very pleased with the look and quality of this product.", 
    "Item came with one part mislabeled which caused some confusion in assembly but overall the piece is inexpensive and functional.", 
    "Great bathroom cabinet. No smell issues with mine, took some time to put together, but sturdy and perfect storage for a bathroom. I switched out the knobs for some glass knobs to dress it up a bit, and now it looks even nicer.", 
    "The wood on this cabinet is somewhat cheap. You put the peg in the bottom of the leg and it splits the leg in almost two pieces. What What???? t", 
    "The box was beat up when I received the cabinet, but the contents were intact and undamaged. Having read other comments, I unpacked the box and let it air out overnight before assembling (by myself). Had no problems with assembly, but I have put IKEA stuff together before, so this was a snap. It was perfect for my needs, to hold towels in the master bathroom. Looks nice, the top holds my basket of sheets perfectly. Assembly took me about an hour. I am not a guy, an engineer or a gear-head, and it figure if I can do this in an hour, anybody can put it together. I did read thru the instructions first, and check all the parts to ensure I had everything (experience is a harsh teacher). However, once I did all that and started turning screwdriver and Allen wrench, it only took me about an hour.", 
    "We were looking for some extra storage room in our bathroom and this cabinet was perfect in every way. It was pretty easy to put together, however, there is one side panel that did not fit perfectly and it's a little loose. I think this happens often with furniture you assemble yourself. The shelf space is roomy and you get three shelves with the cabinet. We are happy overall and glad to have the extra storage space.", 
    "I was looking for a small, simple cabinet for my bathroom and was surprised by how some of the material was quite flimsy. From an assembly standpoint, it was relatively easy to put together and it does the job for my overall needs.", 
    "Very nice highly recomend it I got slot of compliments on it", 
    "Although the design of the product is fine, the execution was not great. The instructions were poorly written pictograms, which is fine, I was able to follow them nonetheless. The biggest issue is that the connectors were cheap - the screw heads stripped very easily using a regular (not electric) phillips head screwdriver by hand. The holes were not all drilled well, making it difficult to get the screws and connectors in. After putting it together it is a bit wobbly and rickety. I wouldn't recommend this product.", 
    "easy one person assembly, looks great. I am using it for my cookbooks. not too big or too small, handy for any room for little extras that have no real place to go. looking at more for spare towels in the bathroom. one for in my bedroom for reading material.", 
    "This is a very nice cabinet, exactly as expected, perfect for a fairly large powder room.", 
    "Metal sleeves for screws were missing on one side of the cabinet. Therefore I was unable to secure the side to the shelves. Other partsd were complete.", 
    "needed extra storage in small cottage and this has worked perfect for my tea cabinette. It looks really nice and have had compliments from friends. A great price for the quality.", 
    "Cabinet arrived quickly. I was able to put it together in less than an hour. Works great and looks great in my bathroom for extra storage.", 
    "Perfect size and look for our small kitchen!! Ties in nicely with other free standing cabinet!", 
    "We bought this cabinet for extra storage in our bathroom. My husband remodeled the bathroom when he was still a bachelor and did not think about the space that a female might require for make-up and personal items. We do not have a vanity as we have a pedestal sink. Looks great, but we have zero space. This little cabinet has fulfilled all of our space needs. It looks great int he bathroom, was easy to put together, and after almost a year of use, looks just as good as it did on day one. Held up well under bathroom conditions--humid environment and lots of product sprays and spills.", 
    "The cabinet is perfect size for a small space. My son got pretty frustrated putting it together as there are many pieces and the holes, etc aren't perfectly aligned. Serves it's purpose and I'm happy with it.", 
    "A very nice piece of furniture that I purchased for my Master Bathroom to keep towels and such in it. It was fairly easy to put together and all parts were included.", 
    "The reviews for this cabinet were great, so I purchased 2 to hold fabric for my sewing studio. After my husband assembled them and I was putting them in place they just don't feel like they are \"solid\". I'm obviously not moving them around, but it's as if the hardware just doesn't get the joints tight enough (feel wobbly). They look great, but don't feel solid. If you are using it for display where you aren't accessing it much it would be fine. I know other reviewers have it in their bath. I wouldn't buy again for a cabinet that is used in a high traffic sort of way.", 
    "This product was very poor in quality. Came out of the box with paint already chipped and wood breaking. Basically just particle board. The product broke in two different places as I tried putting it together. I would tell anyone to not purchase this product. After spending an hour trying to put it together, it was a hopeless cause after it broke it two places. I took the product directly to the dump the next day! $***+ right down the drain. I am very disappointed!", 
    "Took a while to put together..four hands would have been better than two, especially when putting the doors on. The pins that hold the shelves up fall out very easily.", 
    "Overall, worth the purchase... looks great and functions well but for light use only. not great materials. handle screws too short so needed to buy new at store. easier to have two people to assemble, but i did myself fairly quickly. IMPORTANT: i suggest you assemble with wood glue. if not, cabinet does not hold together well nor fit tightly. would have been nicer if better quality but looks great. glad i bought!", 
    "Arrived quickly, well packed and in good condition. The instructions are just like all the instructions on assembly required furniture-so, so, but doable. I have it in my bathroom, and it looks really nice. This is of course not a heavy duty piece of furniture, but it is exactly as described and is perfect for extra storage. I put all my pretties in it because of the glass doors, but a few things that weren't exactly pretty, I put behind some frosted paper that I added to the bottom shelf section of the door, I really like the look of the frosted section. I think if you choose this for what it is, an inexpensive little cabinet for \"extra storage\" you will be very happy.", 
    "Ver nice looking piece of furniture. I like the fact that it has three shelves. I wish that they were a little deeper,but I am very pleased.", 
    "My cabinet was delivered the other day. My husband is handy and put it together and complained most of the time. Their was a big gap on one side where the piece was too short. One piece of veneer chipped completely off while putting it together. If it would have been easier to take apart he would have. Once up it looks nice minus the noticeable gap but it is a very cheap piece of furniture. I would buy something with more quality if I were to do it again!", 
    "Cute cabinet. Easy to assemble. The back panel is really cheap material so a bit cheesy but the doors are nice. It felt cheap putting it together but once it was all assembled and in place it looks good and is serving its purpose.", 
    "Too bad they don't warn you, that you must put it together. This in not a bad cabinet but it took me over 3 hours and a phone call to put it together. Instructions were not detailed enough in my opinion. When I spoke to the customer service department regarding some of the instructions which were not clear to me, she commented, that most men know what is meant, well I have no males in my household to help! I am a pretty resourceful person and am 77 years old and put many items together, but this one presented real problems.. A couple of the screws did not work correctly in the predrilled holes and the knobs on the doors needed longer screws. But I got it all together and it looks pretty good in the bathroom, not as nice as I would have liked. But the price is right for immediate storage in small quarters.", 
    "I needed something to help organize my bathroom plus something to make it look less cluttered and more classy. It makes the bathroom look so clean and sleek and rich. I love the look of classy white and the gleam of the glass, plus having more space.", 
    "This is a really great cabinet for the price. We recently remodeled our bathroom and I wanted a small cabinet for towels. This cabinet is perfect and looks great. I keep towels, washclothes and extra toilet paper in it and still have room to spare. I would definitely recommend it to a friend and buy another if I needed one.", 
    "I like the cabinet. It holds towels in our bathroom. Pay attention to the size and how you fold your towels and if they will fit in there the way you want. It's a good cabinet for the money.", 
    "This is a cute cabinet. It was easy to put together. Good quality for the price. I'm using it in my kitchen for extra storage.", 
    "I bought this cabinet to hold towels in my in-laws new apartment. The unit was shipped unassembled. The assemblly took me over two hours, and much frustration. I have assembled many items before, so believe the problems were more with the construction and the instructions than with me. The Unit itself is weak particle board. Some holes were not lined up, some screws over turned and so lost their stability, the doors did not liine up perfectly. Once assembled, it looked okay, for elderly people with poor eyesight and low usage. I wanted to really like this unit, but am glad it is not in my house.", 
    "No issues putting it together...Looks nice in nour spare/guest bathroom.", 
    "Great purchase and although a little difficult to put together well worth the money and time spent.", 
    "I like the look for the finished product, but found the directions for assembly a little lacking. I was not impressed with the back wall of the cabinet--two carboard pieces covered in a white material and a plastic strip to attach the two pieces together. But, for the money, I thought it was a pretty good buy and it serves the purpose for which I intended it -- for the time being.", 
    "Simple to put together. Using in master bath to store towels. Looks great. Perfect height to match counter top. Like having the glass doors with the colors of the towels brightening a corner! Would definitely buy again if we had someplace to use the cabinet!!", 
    "I knew this wouldn't be the best cabinet in the world, but I am very pleased. I store most of my towel in here, so I don't know how it would handle heavy objects. It is nice to look at in my opinion and I placed a basket on top of it. I keep it in the hallway and only touch it to take my towels out and clean it so I don't know if it scratches easily. Assembling was easy and seems sturdy.", 
    "This little storage cabinet is perfect for what I wanted it for. It only took about 30 minutes to put it together which was great. It isn't very heavy so putting it on a solid surface rather than carpet would probably be wise but I needed it on the carpet and taking my chances. There is a canvas strap to attach it to the wall to stabilize it but I don't want a hole in my wall, I move my furniture around to much for that. It isn't very deep but it works for what I wanted it for.", 
    "OK, so this is still flat-packed, put it together yourself furniture, but it's really nice DIY furniture. It is very sturdy. I really liked that all of the pieces screw together. Even the backing pieces are better quality than I have seen at places like Lowes and Ikea. I had help putting this together, but could definitely have managed on my own. Great directions, and it's really helpful that all of the pieces and the hardware are labeled really well. Great value.", 
    "Perfect small cabinet for small area for extra storage. Fits in my dressing for extra covered storage.", 
    "This beautiful cabinet was easy to assemble, it took about 30 minutes, and it looks great in our home. I was very happy with my purchase considering that it was selling for $40 more on another website. Great price, excellent quality, I couldn't be happier.", 
    "This piece was exactly what we needed in our bathroom, fits the space well and compliments the other cabinetry in the room. Assembly was very straightforward and everything fit together nicely. This is a good buy if you are looking for a smaller storage cabinet other than some of the taller tower units available.", 
    "really lovely piece that fits exactly in our bathroom. couldn't have designed it better ourselves. easy to put together, higher quality than ikea. one star off because the consensus was that the price was a little higher than it should have been, but really, it's a lovely high-quality looking piece of furniture that looks like it would even survive a move. has tripled our storage space in our bathroom and holds a lot despite its small footprint.", 
    "This is a nice-sized, sturdy piece of furniture that looks great in our bathroom. Adjustable shelves allow more options for what can be stored.", 
    "it is the perfect size for our bathroom with just right amount of storage that we need. Our freinds and family have commented on it stated it is nice and asked where we got it.", 
    "Easy to put together. The doors hinges were the most difficult for me. I didn't have any help to hold the door as I was twisting. The doors are not perfect even on top. Other than that, they are in my living room displaying my pottery.", 
    "The unit was boxed very well. It arrived in great shape. It was also easy to put together. I was not real impressed with the cardboard backing used. The main problem I had was the left door would not stay closed. It seemed the magnet did not reach or work for the left door although it appeared to be shutting against the magnet. We decided to put in in our office instead of storing my wife's teapots in it.", 
    "Fairly easy to assemble. Instructions are only pictures no written.", 
    "On the plus side, this is a cute cabinet that fit a spot I needed to fill in my small downstairs bathroom perfectly! I like the glass doors(although frosted glass would've been PERFECT) and again, the size was just right for my spot. On the other hand? The quality of this product is dubious; of course, I wasn't expecting solid wood glory at its pricepoint, but comon, the back of this cabinet is two thin boards! It's also rather rickety, despite how much I've tightened those screws on every single side. Also, putting the doors on was TOUGH. Although I'm definitely NOT a handywoman and was able to put this product together all by myself with nothing but a regular screwdriver in a little over two hours. So at least it wasn't too difficult to put together! Overall: decent looking, nice price and great size, just not the best quality of wood and the cabinet itself is slightly wobbly despite how tightly its put together. Go for it if you're looking for a quick-fix furniture piece a'la products, just don't expect this to be a keepsake piece!", 
    "At first I was not real pleased with this cabinet. It seemed pretty unsteady, but we new a couple of fittings had not been installed in the unit, by the manufactuer where they should be, (according to the directions). I called Overstock.com, explained the issue and within a few days we had a new cabinet that had all the parts and now it's very sturdy and I love it. It is the perfect size for where I wanted to use it and looks very nice. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a smaller cabinet.", 
    "great piece and picture is very accurate on size and color.", 
    "Not a great piece of furniture. Had to assemble, not so easy to screw the pieces together, i'm handy so i was able to do it, but it was still hard. and it shakes and feels like it wont last so long.", 
    "Put it together by myself but had to figure it out because directions are not so explicit. Once it's in its place don't move it or it'll loosen up. The hardware could be better but overall the cabinet is a wonderful addition to store things like towels or anything on display. It really was easy to assemble and I'm a grandma. It looks beautiful.", 
    "This is a good looking, functional cabinet, but be careful when using in a bathroom. The legs on mine have become damaged because of water on the floor. Applying \"feet\" under the legs, bringing them off the floor surface, would probably prevent this. Assembly was pretty intense.", 
    "Easy to assemble, and lovely addition to our bathroom. Very pleased! We have had this cabinet over a year and it holds up nicely.", 
    "Cabinets are useable in many ways. I used two of them to give grandsons a place to put things they wanted to leave at my home for use on subsequent visits (pajamas-underwear-laundry bag, etc.) The other one went into my breakfast room where I put snack or grab and go foods that the children can have at will. It gives them a sense of belonging and empowerment while I still have control of actual contents.", 
    "I was a bit doubtful about what to expect after reading some of the reviews and thought about cancelling my order. However, I had my son put it together for me and was very pleased with the finished product. I thought it was going to be smaller but it turned out to be just. I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "Given the price and ease of assembly, it's relatively sturdy and very attractive.", 
    "I needed furniture for the small wall outside the tub alcove to store extra toiletries. This cabinet was the perfect size. I added window film to make it more private and it works perfectly. My husband did have do drill an additional hole during assembly as one was put in the wrong location, but the cabinet was easy to assemble.", 
    "my shipment came without hardware, but I called Customer Service, and they sent me replacement parts, so I'm thinkin ...ok, sounds good. ....then we go to put it together. there are drill holes that are too big for the bolts, pieces that don't join tightly, and the glass doors are (slightly) out of alignment. We're gonna have to buy an L bracket to reinforce the bottom corner (with the mis-sized holes)", 
    "Be sure to note the measurements because it is not a large piece of furniture. If you need it to store alot of linens this is not the right buy for you. As another reader said we were able to store 8 bath towels. I bought the over the commode shelf to hang for hand towels & washcloths, so it works well for a one person bath. It fits well into a small space and looks very stylish.", 
    "What the description doesn't say is that you need a big burly friend (and an advanced degree in Engineereing wouldn't hurt)) to put it together. Looks pretty once it's done, though.", 
    "This cabinet is being used in my nail salon, to store pedicure products and allows me to work right out of the cabinet while doing services. It is pretty and functional and very very sturdy!", 
    "I love my cabinet. It's a beautiful piece and the quality is far superior than I expected. You won't be disappointed with this purchase.", 
    "It looked a bit flimsy and I felt compelled to gentleness while assembling, but now that it's together it seems to be holding up (even w/ our daughter repeatedly opening & closing the doors). I wouldn't trust it to hold my weight, but it's not rocking. My only complaint with the design is that it uses ikea-style srew & lock (?cam locks?) for attaching parts -- I always have problems with those locks falling out after the piece is assembled. All-in-all, we're very happy with this little cabinet - it works perfectly for linens & things.", 
    "I ordered this for a towel holder for my daughter's bathroom, and it is a nice addition, it serves the purpose and adds a touch of class. We did have to send the first one back because it didn't line up to be assembled properly, but O.co was very quick in sending another one thatworked out fine. I like it and would recommend it, but it isn't meant to hold a lot of towels, but it is versatile.", 
    "Not difficult to put together although I needed an extra set of hands. I personalized mine by replacing the glass with architectural glass and replacing the knobs with decorative knobs. It is very cute. I am very satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "This cabinet was a wise purchase for the space in which we envisioned it. It is small but not short or underwhelming for our bathroom. We store 8 full size bath towels, 4 hand towels, 12 wash cloths and still have room for other bathroom items (i.e. shampoo, soap, etc.) It is made of heavy wood and was assembled with ease and clear instructions. We purchased this along with two other 'Classique' cabinets and they provide tasteful, simple storage for space. Highly recommended!", 
    "Good over all product for the price. I should have gone bigger but I bought a medicine cabinet to go over it and it worked out perfect.", 
    "Upon initial sight of cabinet, my husband was upset because he thought it would be bigger. After putting it together, he was still rather upset. However, when we put it into the space we had allotted for the cabinet, he was all smiles. It fit perfectly!! And it has more interior space than we had originally thought. It may look small, but it is bigger than you think", 
    "Very nice product and it was easy to put together.", 
    "The cabinet fits perfectly in the bathroom space. The material is not light and is expensive looking. This is a very good price for the quality of the cabinet. I've been a long-time Overstock customer and will continue to be one.", 
    "easy to assemble, looks great in the bathroom, more like a piece of furniture than a plastic storage cabinet. Perfect for towels when there is not a linen closet in the bathroom. good price also.", 
    "Cabinet is exactly as shown (I think). Only problem, there are NO DIRECTIONS on how to put it together. I am old and ignorant, but I can manage these things with a little direction. There's not even a picture of the cabinet with the pieces and hardware. Egad!", 
    "Very easy to assemble don't tighten down to all assembled then go back and tighten.", 
    "Good product, easy assembly. Worth the money. cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc", 
    "I like the cabinet, it was easy to put together and took less than an hour. its a little wobbly on one of the legs, but i was able to fix the problem. And just like the other reviews stated, the cabinet has a really plastic kind of smell that i have yet to get rid of. Otherwise I am happy with my purchase.", 
    "The cabinet arrived well packaged and in very good condition despite it's weight. It was very easy to put together (did it by myself while my two little boys \"helped\" and I still didn't screw it up). It is sturdy and quite nice looking. My only complaint is that the surface of the top seems like it would damage pretty easily (I scratched it with my ring even just wiping something off the top) so I felt I had to put a cover on it since it lives in our guest bathroom. It seems like even water would cause some ugly damage pretty quickly. Otherwise a great deal!", 
    "THIS LITTLE STAND IS JUST WHAT WAS NEEDED FOR OUR SMALL ODD SHAPED BATHROOM. WAS VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. WITH THE TINY SCREWS I THOUGHT HOW CAN THIS BE STABLE BUT IT WAS AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PLEASED. HOLDS BATH TOWELS, WASHCLOTHS,AND OTHER BATH ACCESSORIES QUITE NICELY .THE SHELVES ARE NOT DEEP BUT ADEQUATE. FOR A TINY SPACE IT IS JUST THE TICKET. COULD USE IN ANY ROOM IN THE HOUSE REALLY. ATTRACTIVE PIECE.", 
    "Very sturdy little cabinet. Pieces arrived well packaged and in excellent condition (no damage during shipping). Cabinet went together very easily. Very happy with purchase and would highly recommend it for anyone needing a small storage cabinet.", 
    "Parts were individually packaged and identified by letters and numbers. Not one screw was missing! The only glitch in the assembly was that the instructions showed two extra screw holes that didn't exist in the shelving. Cabinet assembled easily and looks very nice. It is not very deep, which is why we wanted it, but it wouldn't be very useful for storing large items, like bath towels.", 
    "This small cabinet was so easy to construct. The directions were amazing, with every piece numbered. Price was outstanding also compared to other places I had looked.", 
    "This cabinet is cute, will do what I need it to, and offers the promise of a great piece of furniture. However, the wood product is awful to work with. Particle board manufacture can be iffy to screw together. So, when you screw the wood screws into the panels that require it, you MUST NOT give it any torque, or the wood becomes loose, and the screws fall out. Lots of glue will help. I fear for its longevity.", 
    "I assembled this cabinet in about 30 minutes. The instructions were clear and all parts were clearly marked. I am very happy with the final product - it is sturdy construction and looks great! Highly recommend this for extra bathroom storage. The glass doors are very pretty.", 
    "This cabinet was just the right size for next to my sink in the bathroom. It was easy to assemble and looks good. It is pretty lightweight, but that is fine.", 
    "Just what I ordered. Was easy to assemble and looks great!", 
    "Sturdy little piece of furniture. Husband had it put together in 35 minutes. Fits nice in our bathroom to hold first aid kit, extra rolls of toilet tissue, etc. It did have a few nicks out of it in area that aren't visible. The box it was delivered in was in rough shape. I was amazed that it was packed well enough to keep the glass from breaking. I actually took photos of the box before opening, just in case the cabinet was broken. The box said fragile, but I think UPS wasn't paying attention! All turned out well, and we really like it.", 
    "Extremely easy to put together - everything piece was labeled. Put it together in under an hour and it looks great - Has a solid look and feel to it. Very happy with the purchase - couldn't beat the price either!", 
    "Shipped quickly & very easy to put together. Did need to be aired out for a while. Using it in the kitchen instead of the bathroom & it works great there, too.", 
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND this cabinet. I am using it in my kitchen for extra storage and it is very cute. I am not the right/left brain to read directions and put things together but my brother had it put together in 30 minutes. Everything was there and it was a breeze. My kitchen cabinet are white so it fit in well. It would also make a darling bookcase in a child's room. If I had the room I would order another one. By the way, the \"smell\" was hardly noticable and went away quickly. You will not be disappointed if you order this.", 
    "Very nice bathroom cabinet. Was fairly easy to put together if you have some basic skills - took maybe half an hour to 45 min. It looks much more expensive than it is, and was much less expensive here than the exact same thing at Target - great buy!", 
    "This is a great little cabinet. I put it together by myself in 1.5 hours (on my dining room table) without any problems. It's very sturdy and holds a lot. I would definitely buy it again! I bought it for my daughter's room to put all her extra clothes. I think it will end up in different places over the years. It's very functional!", 
    "The floor cabinet was exactly as it appeared. Very sturdy, appears durable and easy to assemble. I am glad I made this choice. It looks great and serves as an attractive storage for towels in our bathroom,.", 
    "We got this cabinet for storage in our laundry/bathroom. The shelves are a perfect fit for canvas totes to store misc supplies, paper towels etc. It was really easy to assemble and is a great addition to any small space.", 
    "This cabinet is very nice and the adjustable shelves make it easy to display 3 different heights of collectables. The only problem that we had was it was missing one of the small door connecting screws.", 
    "I got this having pretty low expectations after some similar things I had purchased in the past for bathroom storage. However, I read the reviews that were overall positive-so, I decided to take a chance and was VERY please I did. It is an EXTREMELY sturdy piece of furniture and relatively easy to build. It looks great in the bathroom and for the price-I don't think you can beat it!", 
    "I bought this cabinet for my bath towels, it looks very nice and fit my little apartment. The only thing is it is not deep enough so I have to roll my towels instead of folding them for storage. Overall it is a good product and I am glad I bought it.", 
    "i am very satisfied with the piece. it was simple to put together, even by myself. it is surprisingly sturdy and very attractive. the glass in the doors is secure, no rattling. there is a very noticeable odor inside once the doors are closed, which was not apparent when putting it together. as mentioned by other purchasers, it was something i expected.", 
    "This cabinet went together quickly and easily. Instructions were clear, all pieces fit, all necessary parts were included - all I needed was a screwdriver and 30-40 minutes. Predrilled holes line up as well as the doors. Sturdy and pretty, and now in use as our kitchen hutch, standing under the companion wall cabinet. Small enough for our small mid-century cottage but plenty big enough to hold the microwave, cookbooks, and some treasured pottery. Speedy delivery, in the budget - perfect.", 
    "I needed to remove some of the clutter on my countertop. One of my cabinets in the kitchen has a glass front and my cabinets are white. Although this is for the bathroom for towels and storage, I took the measurements and they would accommodate my toaster, small grill and toaster oven. I put it in kitchen corner and it is great. Same color as my white cabinets with nice silver knobs. I checked other sites and saw the exact same product for about $30.00 more. As always about buying on line I was a little nervous. However, good move, quality is great and I would positively recommend this to anyone.", 
    "I actually used this in my sewing room where I wanted a little cabinet and had specific dimensions to fit. This one worked perfectly! It builds easily took me little time by myself. Seems sturdy enough. The only thing that was weird was the back was in two pieces and you have to be really careful nailing the back in or the nail holes won't line up with actual cabinet frame. Both really minor once you put it on the floor and put stuff in it you would never ever know.", 
    "I would recommend this product to anyone! It was very easy to put together. My husband did it in about 20 minutes. And once together, it looks great. It's really nice quality and is solid construction. A nice addition to any bathroom.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for a small bath with no storage. It holds a number of towels and the top serves as additional space. Others mentioned a chemical smell but I did not notice any odor. My son and I put this together in less than an hour. The directions were not very clear, but we figured everything out. The holes all aligned, and with the towels in, you can't see that the back is actually 2 pieces. I would definitely recommend to a friend!", 
    "This was easy to assemble, even without the instructions. It is well made and was just what I needed for extra storage for the spare bathroom. It also arrived in less than 2 days... thanks!", 
    "Came quicker than I thought and was packaged very well. No problems putting together, looks just like picture and good quality. This is the perfect size cabinet for so many areas. I put it in my kitchen to have access to my cookbooks and on top is where I keep the ones I use the most. I love the glass doors to see what is where. I only wish one of the shelves was adjustable but still one of the best purchases I've made. You can't go wrong. Hope you enjoy the cabinet as much as I do!", 
    "The cabinet's quality is much nicer that i would have thought for price. i'm very happy with the overall look of the piece. the door handles are a nice touch. assembly is quick and easy. only suggestion it to keep the doors open for a few days to eliminate the plastic smell.", 
    "Nice size cabinet, holds plenty of toiletries. Easy to put together. Only negative is that it always smells like paint inside.", 
    "This is a good piece, much more sturdy than I expected. Extremely easy to put together (though the instructions sure aren't step by step) and it looks nice too. It is very smelly at the beginning so keep the doors open. We replaced the glass with etched pattern glass, it was easy and looks cool too. Good buy!", 
    "Very comparable to a similar one purchased from xxxxxx, but less expensive. All parts and pieces were there!", 
    "Purchased this for storage in the bathroom. Fits perfectly with decor and was assembled in about an hour.It does have a strong odor probably off-gassing from the paint and mdf wood. It dissipates after a few days with doors left open. You might want to leave it the garage or somewhere to let it off-gass before bringing it into the home.", 
    "Great looking cabinet & an excellent value. It was very easy to assembly. Even came with glue. Besides being great looking, it's very strudy. This cabinet is PERFECT for my needs. I store towels in it. My only complaint , , , when the doors are shut it has a strong plastic-type smell. Not a problem for me since there's an easy solution. I'm leaving one of the doors open till the smell goes away. I highly recommend this cabinet!", 
    "This cabinet is just perfect! It has crisp,clean lines and the shelves are deep enough to hold extra towels. I wish the directions had been a bit clearer but, thanks to a friend, we put it together in about an hour.", 
    "The cabinet arrived with nothing broken and although wasn't easy to put together, it was do-able. Something strange is going on with the plasticky white material - it SMELLS like wierd plastic VOCs. I'm really hoping that the smell goes away in time, and currently have all the doors and windows in the house open. If I had known it was going to smell like this, I would not have ordered it.", 
    "Needed this type of item for mother in laws assisted living facility. Product fit the bill: compact, well manufactured easy to assemble. Good buy for the price. Only problem was delivery - UPS does not deliver well - first order was broken. Replacement was chipped but we used it anyway.", 
    "It is exactly what I want. Size shape and storage capacity are perfect. My husband put it together. The only problem is the odor; I recommend airing it out for a few days because the paint fumes are very strong!!", 
    "Product arrived quickly but bottom corner of the glass was cracked. I decided rather than pay shipping to return it that I would just keep it as going in basement bathroom. Very happy with the amount of storage and construction of the cabinet. However, the smell/odor as mentioned in other reviews is really bad. So bad, even my husband has commented on it a few times. Using Febreze along with an odor eliminating gel that sits in a jar trying to eliminate the odor. Tried keeping doors open for several days but that didn't help. Odor is slowly getting less noticeable. Wondering if their other products ie wall cabinet also has that odor?", 
    "Looks nice, feels sturdy. Good value. Easy to put together.", 
    "no complants about the cabnet; looks great. but it smells like a can of paint. i have cleaned it with mr. clean, i even resorted to giving it a hose down in the shower with joy. still the smell remains. it's been three days and i have it hid in the spare bedroom airing out because you can't stand to be in the room with it. too bad, it really is a nice cabnet.", 
    "This is exactly what we needed for our small loft area. It was easy to put together and is sturdy.", 
    "we bought this for our master bath. it not only is functional, but it is a nice clean look. lots of storage space.", 
    "The cabinet looks just like the photo and looks very nice in person. It's shelves accomodate bath towels and other storage easily, and the assembly was not difficult. We assembled in less than an hour. I would definitely recommend this to a friend if it is their style.", 
    "This is a nice looking piece. Good for a small bathroom. Assembly wasn't difficult and it didn't take to long to put it together.", 
    "Directions to assemble were worthless, but easy to figure out otherwise. Make sure to put the shelves in correctly or the backing board won't screw in easily. Other than that, it looks great and feels sturdy/well-made", 
    "This look very nice...we put it in a corner in our bathroom. It holds a lot of items--3 shelves that are tall enough for holding things like shampoo bottles, towels, etc. It isn't too big and bulky either. It is the perfect size--especially for a small bathroom.", 
    "I loved this cabinet. It was easy to assemble, looks great & was an overall value. The only thing I have to complain about is that my cabinet doors don't line up!", 
    "This cabinet went together pretty well and easily. It's very sturdy and looks more expensive than it is. My only complaints are that it is still a little rickety, and obvious that it had to be assembled, as opposed to coming as one solid piece of furniture, and the doors don't quite meet in the center. Other than that, it's a nice, cleanly designed, piece of furniture.", 
    "This cabinet was a great buy! It arrived within a few days and makes a perfect addition to my bathroom. The instructions to assemble aren't as complex as they first appear. We had it put together within 15-20 minutes. The quality is great and you can't beat the price. Very pleased with this purchase!", 
    "I shopped all around to find furniture to finish my bathroom and everything was either too big or too cheap! I saw this on Overstock and was nervous about ordering without seeing so I read reviews. Most people praised the quality and ease of building but one man said it took forever to put this together. That last ocmment made me nervous. Let me tell you, he must have been kidding. Once I got use to building this from just pictures and not written directions, it was a breeze! And the quality is perfect! I could not be happier!", 
    "Yes, the assembly instructions are a bit difficulty to understand (illustrations, no language and rather complex illustrations) and one of my pieces was mislabelled, but all in all not to difficult. I was able to assemble the piece in about a half-hour, far less time than a less superior piece of RTA that I built, then took apart and returned. Once together, it is solid, with no gaps in the doors or back. It is substanital and nice looking.", 
    "I could have used a couple extra hands when I assembled it, but once I was able to get it lined up, it adjusted right into place. It really is perfect for the space in my guest bath. I can display towels in colors to match the bath accessories. Very nice.", 
    "We love this. It looks expensive but it wasn't and it is definitely good quality. It fits perfectly with some of the other items we have purchased from Overstock.", 
    "The item was very difficult and time comsuming to assemble. The end product looks nice and fits what I had in mind-however, I do not feel the price justifies the quality. I feel the item should be under $100.00 at best. Rather than order this type of product again, I would look for something that is already assembled.", 
    "Directions were easy to follow.Took approximately 1 hour.Almost everything fit together nicely.The 2 panels that make the back of the cabinet fit together poorly. Not visible when assembled.", 
    "I recently purchased this piece for my bathroom for added storage of towels, first of all the directions were not that easy to follow very few instructions,second once we did get it partially together we were putting on the doors one of the screws broke off in the door and another one stripped out so there fore the doors are not on as well as they could have been, overall the piece looks ok but I would not purchased anything of this nature again.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet for a small space in my dining room to display a set of stoneware. It looks very nice. I think the price was reasonable. The quality of this piece is average but suits my purposes. It was a very difficult piece to put together.", 
    "I searched several sites and stores before settling on this cabinet. Overstock had the best price and cheapest delivery.This product is very nice looking. The quality is adequate for my purpose: towel storage in a small guest bath. Although reasonably sturdy, I wouldn't recommended it for daily use. Assembly was relatively simple for someone who has a little experience putting together small furniture items. I put it together in about 45 minutes without the help of my husband.Overall, a nice-looking cabinet for a good price.", 
    "Nice quality and great price. Instructions could have been easier but all the pieces were there.", 
    "IT IS QUITE STRANGE HOW \"OVERSTOCK\" CAN CONTINUALLY PROVIDE SUCH VALUED ITEMS EACH TIME WE BUY. THIS CABINET LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE ESPECIALLY FOR OUR OWN BATHROOM. IT PROVIDES ADEQUATE ROOM FOR ALL OF OUR TOWEL SETS. I WOULD NEVER HESITATE TO TELL ANYONE THAT NEEDS SOMETHING TO ALWAYS CONSIDER \"OVERSTOCK\" BEFORE PROCEEDING TO ANY OTHER BUYING SOURCE.", 
    "Unlike the single-door version, this one had everything I needed to put togeter. It is not a fine furniture, it is just a piece of inexpensive furniture and for what I needed, this did just fine. It takes a bit of adjusting to get the doors to close evenly.", 
    "The cabinet worked perfect for us and seems small, but it actually has a lot of storage space.", 
    "This cabinet is actually very cute and now that I've finally put it together, it will work quite well for me. When I inventoried my hardware, it was very apparent that the item had been shipped to someone prior to me as the package had been stapled together but unfortunately not good enough so that screws, etc. were spilling out of the packaging. That was a problem because the compartments were numbered which is a great idea if everything is in place as it should be. I did have all of the hardware but one screw didn't have long enough threads so fortunately I had one that would work. If you can put together an item using only pictures, good for you but I need verbiage to go along with pictures. The first page showed several steps but doesn't tell you which order to do them in so I had to take it apart several times before hitting on the right sequence. My only other issue was that one of the doors barely latched to the magnet at the top of the cabinet so I had to drill the hinge holes a bit higher and that took care of the problem. I know that this isn't an expensive item and maybe I'm expecting too much... it does look nice now that it's together but don't know if I'd order it again knowing what I do now."
