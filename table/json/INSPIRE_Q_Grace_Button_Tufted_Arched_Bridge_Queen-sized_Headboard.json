    "Great value and price for a quality headboard. The fabric and studs are high quality and it is very on trend. I purchased in the white/cream color and it is so beautiful.", 
    "This headboard is beautiful in person! The picture doesn't do it justice. I was so thrilled when the box arrived and was stunned at the quality and value. I had been looking at local furniture stores for a while, this headboard was exactly what I had envisioned. Best buy of the year!!", 
    "This was a fantastic addition to my guest room. It looks very high end. Ordered the Graphite, true to image.", 
    "Delivered on time and as shown on the web site. We needed help to install the headboard (approximately a one hour job for a handyman) but that is the only negative. It is perfect and quality appears to be excellent. We highly recommend.", 
    "Very easy assembly and exactly what I was looking for!", 
    "I was so impressed with how sophisticated and high end this headboard is and assembly was super easy.", 
    "Excellent purchase. I got it in the dark grey linen and it looks fantastic in my bedroom. I was able to mount it on the wall itself and it was an easy assembly.", 
    "A fabulous headboard that thoroughly made by guest room pop!! My guest feel like their are in a 5 star hotel.", 
    "Upholstered tufted headboards are all the rage right now, but they are usually upwards of $500. This headboard looks great, and you can't argue with the price. The only thing I will say is that the \"nailhead\" trim isn't really made up of actual nail heads - it's more of a metal piece that they've laid down. You can't really tell until you're looking up close, but I think it's worth mentioning. Overall, I love this headboard!", 
    "I was excited to see this style headboard for this price! The light linen (white) was just what I was looking for! However, when it arrived to my home, I found out that you certainly get what you pay for... It's not linen, but rather a polyester with a touch of sheen (not shiny, just due to the fact that it's a POLYESTER). The holds don't match up with my standard queen metal bed frame, so attaching the headboard to my frame has been a royal headache. I'm considering just mounting it to the wall... time will tell. Moral of the story, I'm keeping the product, but it was definitely a disappointment, as the quality is subpar and its just a mass-manufactured product.", 
    "The quality of fabric and stitching is beautiful. The rivets, however, are cheap imitations -- strung together, hollow, and overlapping, rather than solid, individually applied rivets.", 
    "I ordered this headboard for the \"spare bedroom\" and was pleasantly surprised at its high quality at the low price. Very pleased, I would buy it again in a heartbeat", 
    "From reading the description online I thought it was somewhat leather like, but when it came the material is fabric and very light cream. I still love it otherwise and the design of arch is exactly what I am going for. The height is very good, not low for my bed. The only negative thing I have to say about this headboard is that the nail head are link in chains not individual nail head like I imagine. Overall it looks good.", 
    "Very easy to assemble, all the holes lined up perfectly. Would highly recommend!", 
    "This headboard appears to be really nice quality. It is very nice. Probably the only negative i have is that the silver beading looks cheap (the material is really nice). All in all, i love it! The color is what it appeared to be online, delivery and price were great.", 
    "Happy with the looks and the quality!", 
    "Easy to install & the perfect height for bed with boxspring. Found that when the bed was a'rocking (being used for other than sleep), this headboard would bang into the wall. My partner and I put furniture pads in between the screws on the back of the legs. Now the headboard is sturdy (we pushed our existing bedframe up against it but did not secure the two together) and does not make any sounds.", 
    "I am very happy with my purchase! This is the very first time that I've ordered furniture online. I ordered the headboard on Friday, October 30th and received it yesterday (Monday) around 2pm. My estimated delivery was for Tuesday - extremely fast shipping. The box was in good condition. There are only 2 pages of directions, which are somewhat vague because it only displays pictures and not much written instruction. However, that doesn't make it difficult to install. I ordered the cream linen and it's the perfect color. It's not too light (at least for me) or dark. The nailheads are also really pretty! I'm very happy with my purchase and fast delivery. I plan to order from Overstock again!", 
    "Looks just like the picture. Easy to put together. Beautiful.", 
    "Beautiful, well made, color is perfect, shipped on time. We hung it on the wall, that was alittle tricky, but we did it without killing each other. Price was really good . I had been looking for some time when then one showed up, and it was in my price range.", 
    "This headboard is well made, nailheads are straight and it is beautiful if you have a tall bed, it still clears bedding by a few feet. Love it.", 
    "I love this headboard its stunning!", 
    "just what i was looking for.", 
    "Very classy looking. Good quality for the money.", 
    "Looks great! It doesn't fit great onto the rails. I need to either drill my rails bigger or attach it to the wall.", 
    "The headboard is beautiful! Was really excited to get it, but it didn't work with my bedframe. I ordered a \"standard\" bedframe from Overstock and it didn't work either. So, only 1 side is screwed in.", 
    "The headboard is beautiful. Great quality and very easy to install.", 
    "Excellent headboard for the price! It's beens sturdy and has held up well. No rips, no loose threads, looks just as good as the day I bought it.", 
    "Easy to build, so chic and polish!", 
    "This is really beautiful. It looks wonderful in my bedroom. The only thing we have to do is get adapters to attach it because our bed is one of the taller ones and that hardware did not come with it. Love, love, love!!", 
    "Love my new headboard. Great Quality", 
    "This headboard is beautiful! The tufting and nailheads give it so much character and beauty while keeping it both modern and sleek. It is also very easy to assemble. This headboard has made a great addition to our guest room and I would recommend it to anyone!", 
    "decent construction and nice fabric. Took some help putting together", 
    "Perfect size that I can do hook up together", 
    "Looks great but wish it was a bit taller.", 
    "This headboard is pretty, sturdy and looks like it cost more than it did. This is by far the best deal I found. I don't just look for low prices, I also want my products to be of good quality and this headboard has both.", 
    "I love this headboard, which is why I'm bummed to only rate it 3 stars, but I took off 2 stars because of all the hard work I had to put into getting it to fit a standard queen size metal frame that I purchased from Overstock. I had to use a drill to make the holes bigger to fit the 40mm bolts. After several hours I was finally able to get it together. The headboard itself is super easy to assemble. It would be nice if they had a specific bedframe to coordinate with or at least put the disclaimer that it doesn't easily fit a standard metal bedframe.", 
    "Just love this piece! My room looks much nicer now!", 
    "Fantastic! Exactly what I ordered", 
    "Great headboard, looks amazing in my room with all white bedding. Was nervous about attaching it to my basic bed frame, but installation was actually very easy. Delivered on time and is a great focal point of my small room. However wish it was a little taller so more of the headboard could be seen behind my standard pillows when propped up.", 
    "Product is good quality and easy to install.", 
    "Love it. This is exactly what I was looking for. Looks expensive.", 
    "It came wrapped very well and here before I knew it. It makes the bedroom perfect.", 
    "after reading a lot of reviews on a lot of headboards, everyone had great things to say about this particular one and they were right. the material is soft but durable, the design is perfect and it was very easy to install!", 
    "The good: this headboard is gorgeous - a great charcoal grey, excellent height, looks very high end, and I would never guess it would be so inexpensive for the way it looks. The bad: there was no way it would fit on my bed frame. The attachment holes aren't drilled in the right place, and we had to swap out to another bedframe to make it fit. Also, there was some bad language, and it took FOREVER to make it work.But - once it is installed, its fabulous. I would give it 5 stars, except that it made me say bad words in front of my kids during installation.", 
    "I Love ,love my new head board. It's well made and the leather and nail heads adds to it's looks. I couldn't be more satisfied with the packing and delivery.", 
    "I love this headboard. It looks just like the ones for $1200 and more, I see at Restoration Hardware, C and B and all these fancy furniture stores. I got the beige one. Very nice.", 
    "Nice craftsmanship. Color and fabric are perfect.", 
    "This headboard is well made. Beautiful! Price is excellent. Delivered ahead of time. Easy to put together. Need 2 to attach to a queen bed rails (tricky) doable. I'm in love with this purchase.", 
    "The white color is more of a tan, but I'm happy with my purchase. Good quality, easy to assemble, and great addition to my guest bedroom.", 
    "Sadly I ordered this to fit a full size bed frame but it did not fit as a prior review claimed. I would recommend that if anyone is purchasing this headboard to be aware that it is NOT meant to be used with a metal bed frame. You need to buy side rails and a foot board to use it. I just drilled holes to bolt through the legs.", 
    "I got this in white, and it is so beautiful and higher quality than what I expected for the price. It is the perfect color, it was a bit off on the height for our frame, but we easily fixed that by putting some cardboard underneath the frame to raise it to clip in.", 
    "The gray was a little lighter than in the picture which worked out well for me. Took 2 people to put together but was easy enough. Looks much more expensive than the price and is sturdy. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.", 
    "We bought the grey linen head board, but it is really more of a grey tweed. The details are very pretty, the nail head accent is good quality the buttons and stitching are symmetrical and tight. The installation legs make this headboard a little short. We ended up mounting it to the wall because we have a tall slat bed but it wasn't terribly difficult to do this."
