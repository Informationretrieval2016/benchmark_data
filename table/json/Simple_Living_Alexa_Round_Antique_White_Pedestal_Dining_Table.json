    "I chose this table for the economical price. I think it's a good table for under $***. The top is not real wood, but it's finished well. The base and legs are wood. I am happy with the finish, as it's very smooth. I bought a similar table elsewhere, but I was unhappy that it had a brushed paint surface, instead of spray painted. This one is very smooth and feels good to the touch. I am careful to lay coasters on the table for drinks. I also use just a damp cloth to clean the top, as I don't want to eventually wear out the painted surface. I purchased the accident insurance for $50 so that the top would be covered in the future. Other than the fair price point, I do really like the paint job--it's a nice white. It is not a true bright white, but it also doesn't seem yellow, like some antique whites. I also like the size, as it's difficult to find a table that is almost 48.\" The final reason I like this table is that there is no seam in the middle. So many round tables have a seam to add a leaf, and I just don't like that look. There was just a tiny, tiny, flaw in the paint on one of the edges, but It is so small, it's not noticeable. Overall, this table is a good value. A person might choose to spend more to get a real wood top, but I didn't want to spend more for that. I would buy this table again, as it's a good value for what it is. I paired it with 6 grey fabric chairs. I usually keep four around the table at any given time, but when I have guests, I add the extra two. While there isn't a lot of extra room between the six chairs, I find that at least they all fit around the table when they are needed. Thank you, Overstock, for a providing a nice, economical table with a nice smooth finish!", 
    "My husband was out of town and I was able to put together myself. It is beautiful!!", 
    "So, I really loved this table, it came in great condition. When I put it together and set it right side up, the base had totally split down an entire side. I had to use wood glue to keep it from splitting further and had to paint over the crack. . . Not sure how sturdy it will end up being.", 
    "Love this table! It does take a bit of assembly and the fed ex driver wasn't very gentle with the box so I had to tighten some screws that were knocked loose during transit. This comes in two boxes...one VERY large box that requires two people to lift! It looks just as I expected based off the photos. I'm hoping it wears well over time", 
    "Item arrived on time. However, it was damaged during shipment. One side of the bottom part of the table top had fallen off or come loose and the person that put it together for me had a very difficult time getting it to stay on. I didn't report the damage because it was after 60 days before I could have it unpacked & assembled. This was the only item ever purchased from overstock that was not as it should have been.", 
    "Delivery was quick. Assembly was somewhat easy if directions are followed. Color was a little whiter than expected. Thought it was going to be a more creamier white. It looks small. Measures only 28.5 inches tall not 30. Width is right. Finish is nice. Will have to see what the chairs look like when they come tomorrow.", 
    "Delivered on time the table was easy to put together it truly is beautiful", 
    "Great products and outstanding customer service!", 
    "I am very pleased with the quality of the wood and finish. I wasn't sure how heavy the wood was going to be or how nice the finish would feel. It's well made and it took me about an hour to unpack and put together. Hardest part was pulling the staples from underneath the table top..other than that it was a breeze. I am truly happy with the color and the wood quality."
