    "This bookshelf looks like real reclaimed wood. Nice looking and priced very good. It's amazing nobody can tell that it's not real wood. I would order again and again. Looks beautiful in room. I also ordered a cup handle (for drawers) and placed it directly on the front of box and adds so much more character to the unit. I love it!", 
    "I put together two of these - one went together very easily, the second was a bit more difficult and we had to hammer a few of the metal tabs one way or another. Overall, assembly wasn't that bad compared to other various furniture I've put together. It probably took a few hours for both combined. I found the key is not to tighten any of the screws until the very end. I love the look of the end product, it looks much more expensive than they were and you really can't tell the \"wood\" isn't real unless you get super up close. Both of mine also came out decently sturdy. I would definitely recommend this product, especially for what you get at the price point.", 
    "Poor quality for the price. 'Wood' has a greenish tint; doesn't look like real distressed wood. Metal structure is thin. Overall cheap looking. Overpriced for what it is.", 
    "Very nice and sturdy. Well made and easy to assemble, photo is exactly what you get. Really great industrial look!", 
    "Love the look. Not the easiest to put together if you aren't familiar. I'm leaving the middle bottom shelf off and putting a hamper under there.", 
    "The finished product is pretty sturdy and gives a great industrial/rustic vibe. Most importantly, if you bought it on a budget, it doesn't look cheap at all. And the vinyl woodgrain looks pretty convincing unless you're right up to it and touching it. But hey, it's vinyl and will probably outlast most surfaces anyway. Now, the assembly of these things will probably be the true test of patience (and possibly the strength of your marriage). Firstly, most of the metal bars are supposed to be left rather loose until you have them all in place. Follow the detailed instructions and there shouldn't be a problem there. The shelves are the somewhat tricky part. If your unit comes with shelves that don't fit into the square spaces, you may have to do what we did which is to bend the small metal tabs holding the metal bars in place backwards a smidge. We did this with some pliers, on the backside of the unit. That should give enough wiggle room to push the boards in place. Some loosening of screws may also be required. But once it comes together, it looks great.", 
    "my son & assembled this is no time! looks so expensive! love it", 
    "Assembly isn't too hard and they are sturdy nice shelving units. I was happy with the color- the metal is a dark brown and the faux wood painted shelves are a nice distressed shade. Wish they were a little taller, but the price was nice!", 
    "Not very sturdy and the little wooden boxes are covered with wood looking paper.", 
    "This item looks nice, but the quality is very poor. The holes didn't line up in multiple places making it impossible to put together the way it was intended. There is quite a bit of assembly required contributing to the many opportunities for corners to not be square and junctions to not come together properly. The problem was with welded pieces so there was no remedy. Unfortunately I had to force it together in so many places that I can't take it apart now to return it. I would say a person with welding or machining skills would be better suited for this piece, but if you can do all that you should just make your own shelf!", 
    "The shelf is cute and has a rustic look. I ordered two and one assembled with no problems. The other was missing parts.", 
    "I bought two of these to put on either side of the media center. they look great in our office", 
    "Although it wasn't easy to assemble, it it a great look for the money. Perfect for any room!", 
    "Looks great. So far, no issues.", 
    "Great buy - easy assembly and very sturdy. Quality materials. No limits to the ways the shelves can be used.", 
    "I really wanted to like this product. As the other reviewer mentioned, the finishes looked great. Unfortunately that didn't matter as none of the pieces aligned for assembly: holes drilled incompatibly, screws that were too short, brackets that were too small for cross-bar to fit, etc."
