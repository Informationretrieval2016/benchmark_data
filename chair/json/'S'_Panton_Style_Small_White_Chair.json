    "These are NOT even adult chairs. Not in your wildest dreams! Think they can \"pass?\" They cannot.", 
    "These chairs are a great look in my space, not to mention sleek.......", 
    "Great quality kid's chair. We have a set that we bought somewhere else and one of the chairs broke. We bought this one to replace it. It's much nicer and sturdier than the previous ones. It was also a bit more expensive, but worth it.", 
    "I have the original full sized Panton chair and this looks exactly like it but for a kid. One thing to keep in mind is that it's not as stable as a 4 legged chair for children who enjoy making things tip. my 18 month old sits in it fine and my 4 yr old also fits in it (but he loves rocking on it and tipping it on purpose)", 
    "Nowhere in the description does it mention that these are little tiny child's chairs. If you want mini chairs these are for you, otherwise keep looking", 
    "These are good but I clicked too quickly and didn't notice that they're kids' chairs - seat height is 12 inches. If that's what you're looking for, they're great."
