    "I searched a long time for the \"perfect\" table. I wanted something with simple, clean lines that was made of solid wood, not veneers. I also wanted a table that did not split apart in the center for extensions since I have found this to be a pain with spills. This table seemed to have everything I was looking for but I was a bit nervous that it was too good to be true. I experienced a delay in the shipping which was unfortunate, but Overstocks was great about compensating me for the error. When the table arrived I loved it! It is one of the most beautiful tables I've ever seen! The natural color showcases the grains in the wood. They vary from very light to dark, deep colors. The surface of the table is smooth and wipes down well. The finish appears to be durable. I have 8 chairs placed around my table (without the extensions in) It's tight, but it still works. I have to leave the end chairs partially out in order to accommodate the other 6 chairs. If you only put 6 chairs around the table there is more than enough space. With the extensions in I can add another 3 to 4 seats, so this table fully seats 12 people if you squish, 10 if you want to be more comfortable.", 
    "Beautiful solid and durable table. The natural contrast coloring is eye-catching. I have received countless compliments on this table. When the 16 inch extensions are connected, the wood grain runs opposite from the table. I actually LOVE it. This table sits 3 chairs on each side of table comfortably. With extensions, I will place two armed material chairs to offset the other wood matching chairs. It's simply gorgeous! Rather quick delivery which arrived after the 6 chairs due to ground freight. Description and coloring of picture is quite true to actually items! Extremely happy with this purchase!", 
    "Arrived on time. packaged very well (solid wood, 200 pounds in weight). directions good for assembly. I bought the medium brown and it matched with espresso chairs I got from another place. Table is very sturdy. Fully extended, 8 - 10 people can sit comfortably, and 12 if in a pinch. please note it is 36\" wide not 40 - 42 \" usually found. I wanted 36\" and it fits the bill. Its quite cozy for daily use. Wood grain is beautiful. Extensions have wood grain at right angles to main table. ( see the picture with natural wood color), I like it the way it looks on medium brown. I had never made a major furniture purchase online and sight unseen but could not find anything locally so decided to take a chance. I am very happy with the purchase.", 
    "The table arrived yesterday and it is absolutely beautiful. It's very heavy, about 200 pounds, so you'll want to make sure you have a few people on hand to take it out of the box and put the legs on. The legs are easy to put on, just a few bolts. The table is sturdy, beautiful, and unique. It's a very funky and cool looking piece with the wood grain and different colors. The colors in my table are a little lighter wood, with the darker red streaks, and some yellow and gray shading too. I would highly recommend it if you're looking for something with natural beauty and a unique character.", 
    "I have never made such a major purchase, sight unseen, but based on previous successes purchasing from overstock, I took a chance and am very glad I did. This is a beautifully made solid piece and an asset to our home.", 
    "The table is very well built, extremely attractive and quite unique. Striking, yet simple. The extensions have horizontal planks, while the table has vertical planks. Initially, this seemed odd. However, after evaluating the feel of the table with the extensions in, it didn't seem odd at all. In fact, it adds an additional level of depth, complexity and beauty -- but still retains a comfortable - homey feel. An excellent value for the price.", 
    "I have very mixed reviews for this table. The size is just what I wanted - quite large and it is very, very sturdy. The wood grain is beautiful - I ordered the \"medium brown\" table and bench. There are two problems: One is that the color is NOT the color in the ad. The stain used on the wood is VERY,VERY red - not a medium brown at all. Extremely disappointing. The second negative is the holes at either end of the table to accommodate sliding in the hardware for the extensions. When the extensions are not being used the holes are really obvious and unsightly. These holes are not shown in any of the photos unfortunately! I don't think I would buy this table if I had know of these negatives. The bench is great but still the awful red stain.", 
    "First time I ordered this table, it came damaged. I got it a second time. Once put together, the wood does not look fine. It's a strange looking wood. The table looks more flimsy than on the pic. Most importantly, to insert the extensions, the main table has two square gaps on each of its sides, which completely show!!! That is very ugly. I do not recommend", 
    "Love the color variation in the wood. Solidly made, simple design. The side extensions will need a bit of shimming underneath to be perfectly flat with the main table, but that's not surprising.", 
    "We love this table for out large family. With lots of kids in the house we wanted a table that was both functional and sturdy and we have been very happy with how well this table has held up.", 
    "Fantastic looking table. Strong, awesome color tones and finish. I look at it every day and admire it. Underneath it says the wood is from India.Shipping took forever because it was lost in transit. Not sure how you can lose a 300lb table.", 
    "After looking for a new table for 6 months, we finally found this one. The size and look met our desires exactly. We were nervous ordering a piece of furniture online but it couldn't have turned out better. The table was in perfect condition when it arrived and easy to assembly. Be aware that it is quite heavy though.", 
    "So many compliments on this table. It's beautiful and wearing pretty well. Opens easily to a very large size. I've coupled it with modern leather and chrome chairs.", 
    "I have purchased 6 chairs and the table and truly love the set!", 
    "Beautiful wood, beautiful table. Both ends had some little scratches that seemed to be from how they processed the wood. It's sturdy and looks gorgeous and expensive.", 
    "This table is beautiful solid wood, very nicely finished. The packaging was extraordinary, essentially double boxed with lots of protective inner packaging. It is very heavy and will require 2 people to carry. The assembly was simple, attaching 4 sturdy legs. Great buy", 
    "This table is really a quite solid piece of hardware, with a really nice looking set of wood colors. We wanted something \"longer\" than most tables, without being too wide, and this fit the bill perfectly. This is set up in a very strong manner, where it'd be my choice of furniture to hop underneath during an earthquake. We are really happy, and be sure to check out the matching chairs and bench. We also found Overstock to have the best prices, even though other places carry the same table under a different name. Great experience, and very happy with the decision to purchase this table from Overstock.", 
    "Beautiful, solid table. Very heavy. I'm getting many compliments on the unique wood patterns", 
    "fantastic wood tone. With the varied wood colors you can find almost any kind of chair to match. assembly was easy other than the fact it weighs 190 lbs and u need help getting it moved to where you want to assemble it", 
    "This dining table is solid, heavy, well-made. Came amply wrapped, with all pieces (the table, 2 extensions, 4 legs, 9 washers, 9 bolts and a wrench) and easy-to-follow instructions.", 
    "Best buy. Completely accommodates my family. Sturdy and durable. I will be able to pass it down.", 
    "The main table is beautiful. Well made heavy duty and very different. I get lots of compliments. The problem is the extensions. The would grain on the extensions is the opposite of the table and it looks really bad. I will never add the extensions without a table cloth."
