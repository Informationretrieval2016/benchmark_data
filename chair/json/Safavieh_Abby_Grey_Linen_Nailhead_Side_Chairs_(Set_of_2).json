    "These chairs are very elegant, true to color with very firm seats and back. I am 5' 6\" 120lbs and my derriere almost fill the seat area. May not be comfortable for those with more junk in the trunk. Have received many compliments. Still can't believe the price. I am an internet troll and I am yet to find similar chairs for this price.", 
    "The color of these chairs is more grey-green, but still work for us. Make sure to check the box for missing parts. Hoping Overstock can deliver the missing parts or sadly, these chairs will be returned.", 
    "I bought 6 (3 sets) just before Christmas and they arrived on time, undamaged. It took about 15 min per chair for my husband to assemble the legs, and now they look terrific. I have one in a bedroom and one in my living room as a side chair until I need all 6 in my dining room. They look great with my PB table and bench. These chairs are comfortable and classy yet not super formal. I ordered the beige linen color and they look as pictured in person. The texture of the fabric mixed with the nailhead trim is a nice combo with the distressed wood table. I'm very happy with my dining room now!", 
    "These chairs are very comfortable and sturdy but they look greenish grey.", 
    "I would recommend these chairs. Gods price", 
    "They are defineitly gray. And they are amazing. I was nervous because I was buying 6 of them. When anyone comes over they ask where I got them. Totally worth it. I love them", 
    "Excellent quality, but the color is more gray/blue than pictured. Almost a denim color. However, they are very sturdy and are great as an accent chair.", 
    "We absolutely love our dining chairs! The color is a little darker in person but we liked that, the nailhead gives the chair a very elegant look. No regrets!", 
    "Good quality and comfortable.", 
    "I was hesitant about having to put anything together since I am not very strong. The chairs came and I was surprised how easy it was. All that was needed was to screw the legs on. It wasn't very difficult and the legs were real wood and very solid. I only had one problem. One piece that went on the screw came deformed. I thought I had to return the chairs but I ended up fixing it with a hammer and wrench. Not bad for ordering 6 chairs. The chairs came high quality for the price and are very solid. The tufts on the back of the chair seats are really tufted and not just buttons. I am very happy and have already got compliments!", 
    "So happy with my purchased! The chair looks high end and sturdy. It looks well made and for the price you can't go wrong!", 
    "nice accent place for our living room, easy to assemble", 
    "Great chairs !!!! Bought 8 of them. Gray color is deeper then pic.", 
    "I haven't had these long, but so far they are very comfortable. To assemble, you do have to pay attention to which leg goes where otherwise they will rock. If you follow the directions closely, you will be fine (we put together 6 of them, and none rock). We did use ScotchGuard on all the chairs to protect the upholstery, so hopefully that helps them look newer longer. My mother in law is a large person and preferred one of our other wooden chairs to these, and we will be purchasing a couple more substantial chairs for the end of the table to accommodate our larger guests, since we couldn't find any weight limits in the package. Fast shipping and packed really well.", 
    "i find they do have green undertones but are grey overall. easy to put together. well made and have finished off my dining room nicely.", 
    "These chairs were great for the price. I purchased them for my dining table, but found they were too small. I put them in my breakfast nook with a banquette and all is well.", 
    "I'm very happy with these. They're easy to put together. They're very comfortable and seem well-made.", 
    "I am not big on writing reviews but I am in love with these chairs. They look expensive, they are well made and very comfortable. Please wait until they go on sale before purchasing them.", 
    "Thus far I've been very happy with this purchase. Comfy and stylish. Not a blue based gray - a little more neutral/green toned gray. Goes very well with my dark stained table. Very minimal assembly with no issues.", 
    "I hesitated on these chairs for about two weeks because I was concerned that they were more green then gray. After doing a ton of research and realizing that there was nothing else like this out there, I decided to purchase the chairs and live with the color. I was completely wrong about the color of these chairs - they are gray 100% I don't know why they look green-ish in the picture, but my dining area is a grayish green (which I thought would make them look more green) but against the wall, there is no green in the chair at all. Maybe if your dining area was a true gray they would be off? But, I only say that because some people are commenting that they are a little green. We were missing one of the washers and had to get another but that wasn't a big deal. At first I thought that the chair legs weren't made right because the pre-drilled holes were not lining up, but it is a little deceiving how the legs are supposed to go on (for me at least) so I actually had the legs turned the wrong way which is what made the holes seem like they didn't align. Everything about these chairs is perfect, I get compliments from everyone who visits. And it is really convenient that the legs can be removed and stored inside of the chair for moving purposes. You really do need to make sure that you don't tighten any of the legs before attaching the other ones or they will be wobbly, but this is the same for any chair assembly I believe.", 
    "These chairs look fantastic!!!! They were worth the money and overstock surely has the best price I've seen on them. The shipment was wicked quick too like 2 days it took to come from time of my over...INSANE!! They got shipped while I was at work and my boyfriend had them put together when I walked in the door. I was so excited at the way that they looked. They look just like the picture perhaps even better. Really they are the same color as the picture just maybe a slight touch darker. But I am not complaining. Do not hestitate on these. I seriously searched like a freak for these and I work at a furniture store I just didn't have access to these brand or these chairs. I pay cost for everything so it was hard to wanna buy chairs not from work but the price is so worth the $$$ still.", 
    "I have been in the office business for 30 years so I know the value quality in furniture and I was not disappointed. Love the chairs, color was as pictured, construction was good quality! Packaging was great, very impresses..... No damages! : )", 
    "Absolutely love these chairs!! Great price and great quality! We have already received so many compliments on them!! Excellent buy!", 
    "Beautiful chairs. Would recommend them to anyone. THe material and color were of high quality.", 
    "I was excited to get these chairs because they are a nice style and size and I read the other reviews and all seemed good. Unfortunately, the legs for both chairs in the set do not fit properly and can not be tightened enough. The pre-drilled holes for the legs and the body of the chair do not line up and can not be secured. I'm afraid that if guests sat in them they might collapse and someone would get hurt. The chairs are totally useless at this point....a big waste of money. I am very disappointed with this purchase and would NOT recommend buying these chairs ever!", 
    "Ordered two sets for my dining area. Like them very much and easy to assemble. Detailing looks great on the bak of chairs.", 
    "These are beautiful chairs. The tufting as well as the nail heads give them an elegant look. I ordered 8 for my dining room and am very pleased.", 
    "Chair is fabulous and great quality, however its much darker than shown.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful,but the quality is not up to par.", 
    "Love theses chairs! The only thing was the assembly of the legs, yet a beautiful addition to my dining room.", 
    "great chairs! they sit around a game table in our living room. Kids are on them all the time, so happy I ordered them!", 
    "We love the dining room chairs. They finish off the look of the room elegantly, yet are not too stuffy or sedate. It's easy to clean any spots of food or a child's dirty finger marks with mild wipes, and they are very comfortable. We only wish there were accompanying arm chairs for the the head and foot of the table. The price was right, and I would recommend them for family dining.", 
    "We had seen chairs similar at stores such as Cost Plus, but they were near double the price. Coming across these chairs we thought we would give it a try and they are awesome. They arrived quickly and were very easy to put together. I loved that the screws come in a little pocket under the seat. The chairs are very comfortable and stable when you sit in them.", 
    "I bought these chairs for our new home. Upon taking them out of the great packaging the first thing I noticed was that they are a lot darker then in the picture. They are a beautiful chair even if they are darker then expected. The nail heads are a nice added touch. The chair itself seems very stiff but with time I am sure it will soften some."
