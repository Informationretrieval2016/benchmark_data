    "if you want Gray color you will be disapomed it is light green .Very disappointed with delivery service.", 
    "Sage green gray not gray! I'll keep it and introduce a new color to my shades of gray bedroom.", 
    "The credenza is fantastic with plenty of storage. In alignment with other reviews it is more of a sea foam green color than silver as it appears in pictures. Unfortunately the large item shipping company contracted to deliver the item was horrendous. Despite paying for white glove, the delivery men refused to bring the item in the building and no one at their office would answer the phone or return the calls to rectify the situation.", 
    "There was shipping issues that made it a nightmare. But the quality of the furniture was nice, and it is more green than grey", 
    "This piece is quite nice, exactly what I expected and wanted. I ready a review earlier that it was a bit of a green color, instead of gray....and this true. It looks great in my iving room, and I am extrememly pleased with it. I love the storage underneath, and the glass and ornate design in the cabinets look very classy.", 
    "The credenza is well made and beautiful in my lv ..shipped in a well insulated box - no problems at all!", 
    "Love this cabinet! It's the perfect addition to our family room, providing excellent storage with a beautiful design. The cabinet is well made, and I was thrilled with the ease of delivery....it was brought in, unpacked, placed where I asked, and all shipping materials left with the delivery man! The gray color does have a green undertone, but nothing that doesn't work with the main gray and teal colors in my living room. Wonderful purchase!", 
    "First off......BEAUTIFUL! Very pleased. I first read all the reviews and ordered the dark color. You do not have to put anything together just unwrap.....which came packaged great...and bring into your home! It's nice to not have to put doors on and legs! It is expensive looking and everyone justs loves the look. We store (which it has shelves) all our serving platters and bowls and entertainment items that you do not use everyday. I even stored extra Cookbooks inside. I have ordered 2 lamps for the ends and once I receive them I will post a pic!", 
    "Great piece for entry, foyer. Excellent packaging and delivery. Very happy with purchase.", 
    "It is so beautiful. I will put a pic up. Hopefully it will show tru color", 
    "Not great quality and appears smaller than the picture.. Mine was damaged in shipping and didnt even consider having it replaced. I just returned it. It might look better in a smaller space. It is a pretty piece but u get what u pay for....", 
    "The piece looks great. The delivery was fast and it was very well packed.", 
    "item is pea green not gray as shown. Customer service is terrible when you want to return the item. Do not purchase unless you want a bright green credenza.", 
    "Great piece of furniture.", 
    "this item looks gray in the pictures but it's actually a very light sage green color. i love it. it's also huge! and heavy! and really good quality. it's not mentioned but there are cable cut outs in the back which allows you to hide all wiring around the back. it fits all my consoles, cable, roku, stereo amp, record player, wii, and still has room for cable boxes or media storage.", 
    "This really is well made and very beautiful. Like the other reviews it is more green than grey. But very, very pretty. I am happy with my purchase especially since it came already assembled.", 
    "Okay, so I'm going to buy this product but haven't. I order virtually everything from the internet, and lots from Overstock, and have never had decent white glove service so agree with those who had a bad experience. I have a note on my front door telling delivery people not to leave packages on the front porch as they are being stolen and to put them on the back porch, and the loser company that was delivering a three sectional six foot deep sofa thought that applied to them so left the crammed the sofa onto the back porch. I never trust them. However, when it comes to this the color of this particular credenza, it clearly says that it is sage. That means green. For those thinking they were going to get grey, they didn't read carefully.", 
    "I was lucky enough to see this piece in person at a local furniture store. With tax and delivery, it would have been $300 more from the local store. I've never ordered furniture online but I was thrilled with Overstock. Very fast *** shipping and the credenza was packaged so well that I think it would be impossible to have damage. The credenza was already assembled and looks gorgeous in my foyer. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.", 
    "We are very happy with the purchase of this credenza. We are using it as a TV stand in our family room, which also serves as a playroom. This has great storage for the numerous toys we have. The woodwork is very beautiful.This is a very solid piece that arrived fully assembled in perfect condition (we were expecting to have to assemble it because the description states that assembly is required). The only complaint we have is that the color is more of a greenish gray than a true gray. We haven't decided yet if we will have it refinished. However, we are glad that we have this piece of quality furniture.", 
    "My only issue with this piece is the color ...It is more of a green hue than a gray so will have to stain it to get the color I thought it was when I ordered it. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars"
