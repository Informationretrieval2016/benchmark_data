    "Sturdy and perfect for record album collection storage.", 
    "Bought this and the shorter version for my office. Easy to assemble and looks nice put together. Don't be fooled by the wood grain...the \"shelves\" are literally wrapped in faux wood grain contact paper. Not real wood. But I'm happy with it...just don't look too close!", 
    "We didn't have a lot of room to work with and this bookshelf helps a bunch. Easy to assemble if you can look at pictures and figure it out. Sturdy. Ordered it on a weekend and got it within 4 business days. Nice.", 
    "Relatively easy to put together . . . and for the price it looks great. Be warned, the shelves are NOT real wood, but they still look good!", 
    "The top shelf was missing. A wrong size piece was in the box. Twice I contacted the company. They sent the wrong sizes two more times. They blew me off the third time. Don't waste your time or money.", 
    "This item is quality! Even though the boards are not 'real wood' they look like a very cool, distressed wood, and are sturdy. We're really pleased with this product and it assembled really easily!", 
    "You get what you pay for."
