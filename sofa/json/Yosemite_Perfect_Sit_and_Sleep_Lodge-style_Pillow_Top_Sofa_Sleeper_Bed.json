    "We were pleasantly surprised with the whole ordering process. The sofa was delivered before I was notified that it had been shipped. The task of assembly was far more easy than I had expected. Two people had the sofa up and ready for use in about 1 1/2 hours with no problems. Afterwards, the surprise continued. The product had to be used for dual purposes - sitting and sleeping. On both it was very good, especially the sleeping part. Quite comfortable. Thanks for a good product!", 
    "I am very pleased witht he overall quality of the sofa/futon. The log ends are great! It went together okay, must have at least two people and a good half an hour to put together. The little drape thing across the bottom front would not stay on, but probably looks better without it anyway.", 
    "Was having trouble finding a decent couch without breaking the bank. This was a good find. Inexpensive and quality materials. I like that it's long enough for me the lay down on without my feet hanging over the edge (I'm 6'1). It was kind of a pain to put together. Also my couch didn't come with the velcro needed to mount the cover over the front. I got the full which is fine. If you have the space definitely step up for the queen though.", 
    "We got this for a \"mancave\" room off the garage. My husband is very handy and even he had trouble putting it together. We need to call customer service to ask some questions. Not sure if I can recommend this sofa sleeper.", 
    "For the price, this is a good purchase if you are looking for a sleep sofa but can't afford a version costing hundreds more than this! Mattress/seating is a little stiff, but I'm sure that will become softer with use. Each to put together, as well. Looks exactly as pictured.", 
    "Really surprisingly nice. We ordered the Dark Brown Queen size Lodge Sit and Sleep in Leather. The end pieces are very sturdy and beautiful. The mattress is very comfortable and has a lot of coil springs in it. There is a slip that goes over the back of the futon frame and under it so the mattress does not move around and you do not see the metal frame. Overall very happy. Only negative is the holes did not line up on the stabilizer pieces to connect to the wood and it took a really long time to put together.", 
    "The futon was shipped to me within a weeks time, very satisfied with the speed. I read many reviews complaining about the difficulty of assembling the futon, and that the instructions are too difficult to understand. I had the futon assembled in about two hours by myself, it was quite simple and the instructions were quite clear. The fact that are used for many different futons changes nothing, the only difference are the arms, the construction is exactly the same. It certainly doesn't take an engineering student to construct it. Now that being said, the foam inserts within the cover were a bit too stiff for my liking. The mattress is fine, and gives lots of support, but the foam was very uncomfortable. So I bought a king sized, memory foam mattress pad and cut it to the shape of the foam inserts, which each have seperate compartments with zippers for easy access. What a difference! It is now so much more comfortable than it had been, and I'm very happy. It's a good futon, no arguments there, I love the hardwood arms. But if you don't like TOO MUCH support, I would suggest buying a new material to fill the cover with.", 
    "Well I hate leaving negative reviews but it needs to be said that Its extremely uncomfortable! Bottom cushion is to long and your legs stick straight out and i'm 5'8\". The springs in the cushion makes it very firm and stiff, Looks GREAT but very uncomfortable. On a possitive note, it was a breeze to assemble", 
    "Looks attractive and is long enough for my 6'5\" husband to lay on in sofa mode. We have not opened it to sleep on it yet.", 
    "We were looking for additional seating/sleeping space for our cottage. This was exactly what we were looking for. The mattress is very comfortable and being a queen size sleeper, there is plenty of room for 2.Delivery was in one giant box which **** kindly left in our garage. I was able to carry each individual component into the cottage without issue.The assembly was straight forward and took less than an hour.All materials and fabrics are good quality.The mechanism to convert to sleeper does take a bit of an effort, but this is a large queen sleeper.Not surprised. We looked at others with smoother mechanisms but they were twice the price. For the value of this sofa sleeper I cannot complain.", 
    "One of the main pieces (the Back frame unit) was damaged. The hinged joint was misaligned so that I had to loosen the hinge and bend/hammer the pieces to force a fit, then tighten the hinge, and redrill the screw hole so that I could insert the locking bolt... and even then the Back was misshapen. The Seat frame was simple... it fit, lock screw holes aligned... so I KNOW that I was sent a defective part. I would have rated the couch poor except that, when assembled it is comfortable and seems solid (but time will tell).The Back is VERY tall off the floor. I should have ordered the Full Size instead of the Queen size. Unfolded there's not enough support under the Back when the couch is in Flat/Bad mode.... so I will have to make a block(s) to support that edge. All in all I would NOT recommend this Couch/Bed to anyone.", 
    "Comfortable, well constructed, easy to put together and very attractive. Just what I wanted!", 
    "Stains on material plus I thought it came put together already. I had to assemble the couch.", 
    "Great purchase for a spare bed.", 
    "Wanted a sofa styled bed for use with company, saw this, and bought the queen sized as sofa sleepers are always a bit smaller than the \"real deal\". (S0, a sofa sleeper queen is between a double and a queen in reality). The design is good, the assembly mostly easy; my engineer husband says there are a few unclear directions, and one or two instructions that are poorly translated as though English were not the primary language they were written in. But, it was figured out and at completion, looks great. The newlyweds said it was comfortable, and held their weight. Being a \"queen\", the back rest is taller than the picture, but is still a nice looking couch. It pulled out easily into the futon set up, and we are happy with our purchase.", 
    "My son wanted a futon in his room, so I wanted to get a very high quality and comfortable futon for him. He has back issues. Within a week, the cushions started to separate, leaving a big space in between the two cushions (when it is out as a bed.) Also, around the edges of the cushions, it has changed shape, leaving a space at the sides even when in a sitting position. We also had problems putting it together. Some of the holes were not bored in the correct place for the screws to fit and match up. For the amount we paid, we expected much better quality. It is too much trouble to return or I would have.", 
    "I also read all the reviews and ended up buying regardless of negative comments. The assembly was ok. But once we put it together it looked terrible. Didn't look like the picture. We couldn't tuck in the mattress appropriately so we kept tightening the straps under the mattress and ended up tearing them. So the craftsmanship isn't great. It is comfortable to sit on but my parents slept on it and told me on side kept sinking so they felt like they were in a hole. My favorite thing about it is the wooden sides. The futon is for our cabin and fits the look. I wouldn't buy it again however... Just too large to drive back down the mountain for return.", 
    "love its rustic look and the fact I can get reasonable priced colors for new covers to I can change with the seasons. it is very comfortable and I use it as my new living room sofa. Wanting to keep the original cover clean I bought the Blazing Needles cover for it. I have one problem in that my cat insists on sleeping on top of the back cushion and though firm enough for a back this does cause the back to sink down so I am constantly having to \"puff\" it back up. I am also thinking of getting another similar to this for my guest room to replace the bed so I can have a sitting room instead but always ready for company. I love it.", 
    "Looks nice and is comfortable but was a huge pain to put together. The screw holes where the metal frame and wood ends should've lined up did not line up perfectly and made it near impossible to put together. Also the wooden ends I received are different from the ones in the picture. I am still pleased with the overall quality of the put-together couch, but majorly disappointed that the wooden ends don't look just like the picture.", 
    "Great item, but when it was suppose to be delivered on a certain day that kept changing. It took some time to put together but my husband did it. Back is a bit high but all in all very comfy. Needs side pillows too.", 
    "You may want to think twice before ordering this item. Although the look is very catchy, there is not much else to offer. The instructions are awful. The instructions are generic and run for all the different size futons that they have to offer. The cushions are terrible. I had a part of the assembly shipped damaged. I called for a replacement, and that part was sent defective. This futon is used at a vacation home for guests to sleep on. Two weekends of guests in a row and I have not been able to use it. The only recourse they could offer was $** credit to my account. I highly doubt I will by from Overstock.com again. They should remove this product from their website. Not worth the money and certainly the aggrevation.", 
    "The box arrived damaged, but the parts were not. However, the futon frame we received was not the one pictured. It was actually the frame to another futon. The mattress and cover were exactly what was pictured. However, the pillows in the picture appear to be arm rest and what came were 2 small throw pillows. Would have preferred the frame that was ordered because that was the look we were going for, but its too big to return and it appears to be solid. Just not sure about the orange color of the wood. Not natural looking at all. Overall we will keep.", 
    "This futon is pretty much exactly as described. One of the log side arms was damaged, it had a very large scratch/dent. I emailed the company just as the instructions that came with it said to do if we had any issues, and within a week they sent us a new arm. I would but a product from this company again.", 
    "The instructions were for another sleeper, deemed \"close enough\" by the manufacturer, which worked but is a tad disappointing. I don't know how well the lightweight old school \"spring mattress\" will hold up over time, it seems to be a tad light in support as it is. Still, for the price we paid at the time it seems worth it.", 
    "Look elsewhere. This thing is horrible. The mattress folds so well, because it's TWO separate mattresses, so you've got a terrible sharp spring filled gap right in the center of the bed, and if you lay on either side of it, it feels like your going to fall off due to lack of support underneath. All the mattresses are, are a bunch of springs, the only padding from the springs is the \"pillow top\". You'll regret buying this, I have.", 
    "It's comfortable and fits what we need it for. The back is slightly higher than normal so figure that in if putting in front of a window.", 
    "I was pleased when sleeping on it , it was comfortable more then a regular bed", 
    "The bed arrived fast, no complaints there. The major complaint was with the quality. First, the frames for the seat and the back were constructed to fold (I guess, for easier shipping). But this is a major flaw, because both frames fold at the seam during the transition from seated to lying and back. To prevent this, two people should operate - one at the front, the other at the back. Second complaint - the coil piece for the back of the seat was supposed to have holes to push the stripes through - it did not. Third, the holding rails are flimsy, and they slide out from the connector every time I move the bed. Forth, the seat is too shallow, while the back is too tall, and too upright - the back does not get any rest while seating. I hate it. I just had a surgery on a shoulder, and just do not have energy and opportunity to disassemble this horrible piece of furniture and send it back. So frustrated!", 
    "This product is nice and worth the money for a spare room or Man Cave. I must say, the assembly was more of a challenge than I anticipated.", 
    "Great product, put in cabin for sitting and sleeping the guys love them.", 
    "Its fairly easy to assemble as long as your handy with tools, one thing, its very large and very tall, fits perfectly for what we were looking for, the individual coils for what is the mattress are very comfortable, its a nice rustic piece, but its really big, the pics don't make it justice. If you have a small place, you may feel cramped", 
    "We bought this futon because it fit the style of our cabin. It was shipped in a very timely fashion and we received it in good condition. I put it together by myself. I would recommend that at least 2 people be involved in assembly because some steps really needed the extra help. The instructions were straight forward and all of the parts were in the package. It took me about 3 h to completely assemble. I was pleased with the cushioning of the pad. Most futons that I have had in the past were pretty hard. This one is very soft and well supported. I think it will make a great bed as well as a chair.", 
    "I love this futon. It took me a little more than 3 hours to put it together by myself. The mattresses are pleasantly firm and the microfiber cover is quite nice too. The only thing that I am a little displeased with is the level of difficulty in opening and closing it by myself. Perhaps with time it will get easier. I bought this for when family members come to visit and they seem to sleep comfortably on it.", 
    "Needed instructions on how to fit the cover over the mattresses. We eventually figured it out. Otherwise fantastic. Thanks", 
    "This futon was exactly what we were looking for to put in our loft - game room. The futon went together pretty easily with 2 of us working on it and it is comfortable to sit on. No one has slept the whole night on it, but from laying down on it, it seems to be comfortable and would be great for kids to sleep on", 
    "Just what I was looking for for the \"MAN CAVE\" great for visitors in our small home.", 
    "I just received the Yosemite Perfect Sleeper Sofa Bed. Unfortunately the bed was missing a lock washer and the zipper for the cover was broken! This makes it impossible for the coil inserts to fit properly. I contacted the company directly and I am waiting for a response for replacement parts. Not very happy with this purchase, would not recommend.", 
    "Do not buy this product. The picture is very deceiving in how it looks and what it is made of. It doesn't show the metal frame, or does it tell you that the mattress is just springs inside a cover. Fed ex just place this big honking box on my porch for the whole world to see and left without giving me a chance to see what a piece of junk this thing was."
