  "reviews": [
    "CONS: * color more black than espresso * terribly messy to unpack - had to do it over tub, with lots of dust, weird fibers and styrofoam ball fragments * gaps in fit in places PROS: * nice style and design * all parts labeled by letter or number * instructions easy to follow * sturdy, useful cabinet for the bathroom", 
    "It is black - it is much darker than the picture. I purchased it to store sweaters and it's not bad. The boards are a bit thin - and we had to really be very careful when tightening screws so that it didn't crack. It's a good size. I don't know if it would be able to handle books or anything very heavy.", 
    "This is the first time I felt the quality of the product was less than average. It was bad when I took the stickers off with the lettering on them it left marks and when I tried rubbing them out it left them permanet. Not quite the quality I am use to getting. I would rate it a c- at best.", 
    "This cabinet was pretty hard to put together. Used some wood glue on the dowels to add stablility. The photo is a little misleading; the inside of the cabinet is very dark. Anything you put in there will not really show up very well. Got a small LCD light and mounted it on the top shelf, but the light doesn't reach the other two shelves. Looks pretty cheap, but I actually took some sandpaper and distressed it a bit and that definitely helped. This truly is more black than brown. Overall, it looks OK, but I feel it was overpriced. This is the first time I've been less than 100% satisfied with an Overstock purchase.", 
    "needed something in my daughters room for her snow globes. 2 people needed to assemble. Overall just what we were looking for.", 
    "Buying it on Overstock was easy and painless. Good experience. The quality of the product is quite average. I agree with other reviews which say: - Very strong toxic smell inside the cabinet (may be glue) - Very fragile material - Almost overpriced for the average quality It does look nice from a distance. From close, you can see that it is average quality. It works for what I need it for right now, and I'm lazy to take it apart and ship it back, but I will \"not\" recommend it.", 
    "You get what you pay for. Very thin veneers on the wood that scratch easily. Some of my pieces came scratched from rubbing against other pieces in the packaging. Pieces didn't fit snuggly when put together, so piece is wobbly.", 
    "This product is very cheaply constructed. The parts they sent for example; screws for the handles was too short. Structure very weak, and color is closer to black. I thought it would fit in with my furniture from Ashley Home Furnishings but de-class the room. I kept it only because I hate returns and this O.com website is not return friendly. I found a hidden corner and stuck it in. Pay a little more for better quality merchandise.", 
    "Overall, this cabinet looks good and would be suitable for holding relatively small items. We have our DVDs and our son's video games inside the cabinet and it works great for that. The top piece of the cabinet came scratched in the package, but we put a phone an other stuff on top of it - not worth the hassle of sending back for another one. Set-up of the cabinet was relatively easy compared to other cabinets I've put together - partly because of the small size and partly good design. This cabinet is exactly what it should be - ok quality, good looks, good price - perfect for a family with kids who doesn't want to buy expensive furniture that will end up chewed by the dog and stained by the kids' juice!", 
    "This cabinet arrived very quickly. I cannot comment on the assembly. My husband had it assembled when I got home from work. He had no complaints. It fits perfectly in my kitchen and I am very pleased with it. The color is black - which is what I wanted. It's not the highest quality, but for the price I think it is a great deal.", 
    "Easy to put together. Sturdy enough for the price. Fit the space in which I needed exactly, so it's a win for me.", 
    "I love the cabinet it's nice and sturdy. It would be nice if this manufacture made the matching space saver cabinet that stands over the back of the toilet that would perfect. I've been checking to see if I can find something that match or come close to it.", 
    "I bought 1 to store my wine glasses and I loved it so much I ordered another to store my placemats and napkins. Now I have beautiful cabinets and all my things at hand to set my table.Thank you Overstocked. My house is full of items from your site. All I have to do is order and it is at my front door. Being older makes it the best way to buy heavy items.Sue H", 
    "Perfect for my living room.", 
    "Cabinet is a little smaller than photo would suggest. I liked the ease of assembly, but left front door of cabinet became slightly warped after just a couple days. I had to install 3 extra metal washers to get the magnet to keep the door closed.", 
    "Knew it wasn't the sturdiest from other reviews. On mine, the front doors don't align perfectly with each other, but it is tolerable. Woudlnt put anything heavy on or in it, but it looks very nice, and has nice espresso finish.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for bathroom storage and it works great. The only thing I would do differently is use wood glue when assembling. I think it would be stronger than just using the toggles. Not difficult to put together, and it looks nice. Expresso is the color but it it black enough to use in a black/white color scheme.", 
    "Provided extra storage. Modern look I wanted. I added fabric on the inside of the door to hide my storage items.", 
    "Bought this for extra storage in my bathroom. Made very well and looks great!", 
    "very nice cabinet for storing my husbands books, he really likes it and the espresso goes very well with our dark brown sofa, shipping was excellent, received it three days after ordering it,, Carolyn B from Tennessee", 
    "I bought this product a year ago and i located it in a dry area in the social bathroom near my living room (no shower, no humidity, or leaks). I am mentioning this because the legs of this piece of furniture started to deteriorate (peeling off, and chipping off). I am very disappointed because I expected to last at least longer than a year. DO NO BUY, unless you want to start replacing parts within a year.", 
    "This was easy to put together with the help of my husband. Was a great price and looks good.", 
    "I assembled this myself in under an hour. It looks awesome and is a perfect match to my espresso cabinetry.", 
    "So we all have to realize this is not high quality furniture, but for the price, it looks just fine in my guest bathroom.", 
    "Although it is not the best quality piece of furniture I have, be careful of moving it the legs can split. I love the look and am pleased with my purchase.", 
    "This is perfect for the area I had. I love the look of it.", 
    "I really like this as a set with the 2 door wall cabinet.", 
    "was looking for a small cabinet and this one fit the bill. The price was right, yes there are some really cheap components to it, but it works for what I wanted. I put this together myself, took about an hour.", 
    "Looks nice but the finish only lasted a year.", 
    "Using it for a liquor cabinet and it's great!", 
    "pretty decent piece of furniture. there are a few spaces, things don't fit snug but overall looks good. did not take too long to assemble. overall id say a good value. serves its purpose.", 
    "A little smaller than I anticipated but the dimensions were there - so be sure to check those to insure its a good fit. Overall, the quality is definately there - matched my daughter's gorgeous espresso bedroom set serving as nice, new additions.", 
    "The finished product, after unboxing and assembling is attractive for the price. Remember, it's not a high end piece of furniture, and each piece may have individual perfections. Mine has a small scratch on the top probably from shipping, but not a deal breaker. The piece can work well as a bed side table/linen-towel storage for a bedroom piece. I purchased two to be placed on either side of the bed. For a little more, I found similar pieces on CL.", 
    "Love this cabinet-perfect color and size for the space", 
    "I was really hoping the cabinet would arrive in good condition and not damaged. I was excited to find it was in perfect condition and better yet, was super easy to put together. All parts were there and everything lined up perfectly. The color is very rich and the finish is beautiful. I have it in my bathroom. Perfect to hold extra towels, toiletries, etc. I would highly recommend.", 
    "I only had a small space for a \"hall closet\" and this worked perfectly. It was easy to assemble and is very sturdy.", 
    "I bought this for extra storage in our bathroom. I thought the color was true to the picture. I don't think it looked black like what some of the reviews said. I thought it was actually pretty easy to put together. Directions were just pictures and a little hard to figure out at first though.", 
    "Poorly made Cheap materials", 
    "the magnets for the doors to remain shut do not match up close enough for a snug fit. The magnet constantly looses its grip.", 
    "We bought this for our bar and it has been great.", 
    "Cute cab, but not great quality. It sways if you push on it, threatening to fall apart. Looks nice, but made cheaply.", 
    "Very nice piece of furniture especially for the price. Didn't have any issues putting it together.", 
    "I thought it was the perfect piece for my bathroom. It's east to put together if you follow directions", 
    "decent quality for price - fits 9-12 pairs of women shoes", 
    "The product LOOKS great, but no matter what i do, it is wobbly. I put in L brackets, but had to be careful. The bottom washers do not fit in and fall out.", 
    "Bought this for a small bathroom. Perfect size. Very well built. Would buy another one. !!", 
    "The size and color is as described. comes fully disassembled, cheap materials, hardware does not seat tight, one of the side panel was actually cracked, I opted not to return the unit and avoid the hassle and just touch up the panel. used additional fasteners to make a bit sturdier than designed.", 
    "fairly sturdy, works perfect for my needs. cabinet back is made of thin non wood material-wish it was wood. I do like the fact that the shelves have notches where the pins go to keep shelve in place. color is much closer to black but in my case it does look good near my espresso bench. the size is great for tight spaces.", 
    "It looked better than the picture and very study. Great value", 
    "The instructions were easy enough. I put it together within an hour or so. There were a few Knicks and scratches but I used some polish and a furniture marker to fix it up.", 
    "ONe of those kits that has dozens of parts. \"Wood\" is laminated fiberboard. Kind of cheezy - the bottom of one of the legs split just by sliding it across a floor.", 
    "The cams do not line up with the bolts... Bent the cams instantly.... Wood falls apart", 
    "Exactly the size cabinet we needed for the space. Had to paint it black but it works perfect!", 
    "This holds my glasses and bar items just fine. It is functional but will sway back and forth with a little push. Not very well built.", 
    "Had difficulty assembling, but satisfied with purchase.", 
    "This cabinet fits perfect in my bathroom for added storage space. Love the design and the color goes well with my other decor.", 
    "nice cabinet - easy to assemble. Not great craftsmanship but good considering the cost", 
    "Not what I thot it was but beautiful color and qualitytoo short for most rooms", 
    "Again, looks a little assembled but not bad for $104.00. Would recommend.", 
    "Cheap. 3 were broken and the doors of the 2 we purchased don't line up.", 
    "This was the second piece that was sent to us. Both were heavily scratched on the top and the legs did not secure to the 2nd one. When I called to complain again, I was told they were going to send out replacement parts. I wasn't thrilled to wait again for parts. I didn't think that was the best resolution. The parts did come, and the furniture is put together now. I have not called to complain again, but this piece is just not right. The legs are warped and did not assemble easily. You can tell by looking at this that it is cheaply made furniture. If I had paid any more money than I did, I would keep complaining until I got my money back.", 
    "Hard to put together .Door was broken when shipped.", 
    "I bought it to put in our bedroom... I decided to cover the glass door with a mirrored paper, that changed the look totally. I use it for my sweaters that I don't want on a hanger.", 
    "Not great but good... less than expected", 
    "Although this is not a tall cabinet, it is great for storing DVD's which is what I was looking for. It has a nice finish and looks good with other similar furniture as well.", 
    "Easy to put together. Functional and looks great!", 
    "When the cabinet arrived it was pretty scratched up, and the glass was chipped in two places. I was also under the impression I was purchasing the cabinet (per the add I purchased from) for **.**. My total was ***Over all, I was \"okay\" with the product, but I do have some touch ups to do for aesthetics.", 
    "Not as sturdy as I thought it would be but we have it in our office bathroom so it won't get as much use but I wouldn't get it if it was in a high traffic area.", 
    "Exceeded my expectations. Very happy with the product!", 
    "Could someone somewhere tell me the dimensions?", 
    "It looks just as shown, easy to assemble. Very handy cabinet in my bathroom", 
    "Like the look and the quality was what I expected. However, one of the doors will not stay closed.", 
    "If you have experience putting together Ikea furniture, this cabinet will be a snap. I bought two of them and put them both together without assistance. The pieces were labeled well, there were plenty of hardware pieces. One of the cabinets, the doors don't meet in the middle, about 1/8 inch or more gap. The other one, the magnet for closing the doors feels weak. They are not in a prominent place in my house, so I don't care about quality or lack of quality. They are perfect for my extra pantry space.", 
    "Maybe if the person is a carpenter I would recommend, pieces were hard to assemble, and broke easily It seems that some of the piece could have come assembled to make it a little easier. I did have to send back or loose my mind.", 
    "Difficult to put together, parts missing", 
    "I was able to easily assemble and it is a beautiful piece that has a lot of needed space. Love to glass doors and adjustable shelves.", 
    "This item looked so much better in the online pictures, we gave it a try and ordered it. When we opened the box we knew it was a poorly made item but still assemble it and when it was done, it took over an hour, the cabinet was falling apart. The same night we disassable it and put it back in the box and returned it the second day. Sorry, this is the only item we returned from Overstock.", 
    "This product had the worse instructions as well the the holes were not drilled properly. I had to re-drill the holes to ensure all the screws and bolts worked. I will never purchase a product like this again.", 
    "I really liked the style of this cabinet - for $*** I should have known better. The ordering process was easy and the cabinet arrived faster than estimated. I unpacked the parts and pieces and found everything labeled wonderfully and instructions were easy enough to follow. The side panels were broken though. I contacted overstock and they quickly responded. Instead of sending my just the panels that I needed they sent a whole new cabinet. This seemed like overkill but as soon as it arrived I understood why. This was the \"same\" cabinet\" but they were actually different - the final result would look more or less the same but the hardware was different sizes, different hole placements etc...The new cabinet had some damage but not nearly as bad as the first and I went ahead and attempted to put it together. I go all the way to the doors only to realize that they had supplied 2 left doors instead of a left and a right...and I couldn't use the doors from the original order because they were just a little too different...boo.Overstock supplied UPS label for return and full credit. I get that this was a cheap cabinet but it's unfortunate that I couldn't even get the right pieces to put it together.", 
    "I have mixed feelings about this cabinet. After assembling it, I was very pleased with the appearance. I bought two Classique Espresso cabinets. I began to assemble this, but the directions were hard to follow. Assembled the smaller cabinet first and from the clear directions, was able to figure out how to assemble the two door cabinet. This cabinet was older model than the one door. The holes were out of alignment and some too small. It took the better part of a morning to complete it. After assembling, the cabinet looked great. When reading this review, keep in mind that this is the first time I ever assembled furniture and that may have made it more difficult for me to figure out the directions.", 
    "great item for the price very easy to assemble. lovely in my bathroom", 
    "With every piece we put together the phrase was \"man the seems like poor craftsmanship\"... The doors still don't line up correctly and to be reconfigured so many times just to get the doors to connect correctly to the magnet. Upon delivery the front doors were scratched and the tools pack was open and the screws/ nuts/ bolts were scattered everywhere.The item is a lot smaller then I thought it would be, hoping to return this item... Although it is more affordable then some, not worth it!", 
    "Great unit of you need more storage for extra linens like i did.", 
    "Product not well made. Holes that were predrilled did not match up and doors would not shut. Top of the cabinet was bowed. Overall, poorly constructed. Nice color but darker than it looks in the photo. Item will be returned.", 
    "I like the product very much but my only surprise was that I didn't know that I had to put it totally together!...I may have missed it but I didn't see the word \"unassembled \" in the description!....My suggestion is please make that very clear in the product description area....I would have given the product an EXCELLENT in every area if it had been assembled or if I had known ahead of time, because I loved dealing with your company in every other aspect,", 
    "The product is ok but not great especially for the price. The instructions were not easy to following when assembling. This product should cost about $75 - $80 at the very most.", 
    "The quality of this unit was good. one piece of the back was broken when it arrived but could be glued together. The doors would not stay shut when closed so had to adjust the magnet closers. The unit looks more expensive than it was so it added a good touch to a room.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet to store towels in, as my master bathroom does not have a linen closet. It's really great. I love it. The color is exactly what I expected it to be from the \"espresso\" description. The cabinet arrived faster than I expected and was very easy to put together. My one complaint is that there are little magnets at the top of the doors that keep them closed and one of the door magnets does not line up properly. It stays closed but as a result of the weak magnetic connection my one year-old son is able to open the door, pull the towels out, and throw them all over the floor. This more of a toddler problem and he'll grow out if it, but if the magnets lined up properly, the connection would be better and he wouldn't be able to open the door.", 
    "These worked out great for what I needed and I got what I expected because the pictures were great.", 
    "crap looks good just dont touch it. cardboard with glass", 
    "This the first time I have been disappointed Assembly would have been easy if the cam bolts didn't keep falling out style and appearance are great but this piece is not worth the money", 
    "Great little cabinet. Fits perfectly in my small entryway. It had to be assembled. I was able to put it together in 45 minutes with just a screwdriver. Quality is excellent. Value is terrific. I got it within 3 days of ordering it! WOW!", 
    "This cabinet was the perfect addition to the bathroom. It's a great place for small items, just as shown in the photo. I have candles and flowers sitting on top of it, and it makes the bathroom feel more like a spa, rather than just a boring bathroom. The reason I gave it a 'good' rating rather than an 'excellent' rating, is because when I put it together, it was missing a couple small parts, but I made due. It was pretty easy to put together. By myself, it took about 40 minutes and I just went step by step on the instructions.", 
    "The turn around time of receiving my package was quick and easy, however the product came with a huge scratch right down the middle of the door making the entire piece look like a piece of hand-me-down furniture. The front right leg also made this piece look torn apart as it was dinged beyond repair. As others have said, the piece is very wobbly, so wood glue is a must. After using wood glue, I'm sure the piece would look great - just make sure your pieces aren't has torn up as mine were.", 
    "Cheaply made and once constructed barely able to stand on its own", 
    "This item is really poor quality it looks ok after you get it together but don't waist your time or money", 
    "This is a great multiuse cabinet that can be used for many things. we are using it in our bathroom.", 
    "Fast shipping, easy to assemble and decent quality for the price paid.", 
    "It's a nice cabinet that fits perfectly in the space I wanted it for in my master bath. The door closure isn't as tight as I wanted, I guess I could change out the magnet, but overall, i was pleased with this item.", 
    "The cabinet looks very nice and modern. It is just as shown in the picture. The quality is average, but for the price is ok.", 
    "This product is just what I wanted , the only thing that could be improved is the assembly of the cabinet. The instructions were not good and until I finally figured it out myself, I was ready to send it back. Now that it is all together I really do like it and would recommend it to anyone.", 
    "About what I expected-- a packed flat box of veneered MDF with the usual assortment of IKEA-style cam&post connectors. When completed, the pieces look great, but they are pretty flimsy -- i had to upgrade/augment some screws in order to keep things from wobbling/wiggling. Given that they are mostly for display and not pieces that will be meddled with daily, I have no worries, but these would not be the best choice in a high-traffic application (kid's room, bathroom, etc). Good style, perfect fit, nice price, average build quality.", 
    "Deep color adds to the rich design of this cabinet, perfect for our Ipod collection, easy to assemble", 
    "Very easy to assemble and fits great it tight spots, like a little bathroom. The color is rich and the wood is better than the average self assemble stuff you find in the big box stores.", 
    "The overall look of the finished product is nice. I was disappointed with the quality and craftsmanship. It\"s tricky and time consuming to put together. I found that one of the doors didn't align properly and it will not stay closed in place. I have to fastened the door in place with a dark colored twist tie. I would only use it to storage small light weight articles. It works well as additional storage in a corner of my bathroom.", 
    "Too small. Photo gives impression that this item is larger. I couldn't find dimensions on the box when it arrived. It's quite small after you get it put together.", 
    "I thought I would be the one who would receive the quality product like some of the other reviewers and, that did not happen. My product was the latter. Not happy at all but, it will work for now.", 
    "i assembled it myself, but find that it is very cheap materials and wobbles easily when cleaning", 
    "This a great little cabinet. We just found that it wasn't very sturdy and may have needed some more screws. I would recommend it though.", 
    "I bought this piece to hold sheet music and books for my living room. The size is nice and it is very attractive. It needs to be reinforced with wood screws in order not to wobble.", 
    "It is exact to what I saw when I chose it and very happy with it!!", 
    "For the price, I probably could have gotten an actual nice piece of furniture from a furniture store for just a little bit more money. The instructions were very minimal and I could see if someone had never put something like this together before that it could be extremely frustrating and difficult. My cabinet wobbles quite a bit and the doors are not lined up well. I am keeping it, but will probably never order something like this again from Overstock. You can probably get the same type/quality piece from a big box store for less than half the price.", 
    "a perfectly serviceable cabinet - smaller than expected", 
    "Wobbly, doors don't line up well. Double checked the cam locks and they are tight, it's just junk is all.", 
    "I got this for my bathroom and its perfect. I put my towels and wash cloths in there and they look good.", 
    "This piece is nice for the price. I did not know it was going to come in 100 pieces. It definitely takes some time to assemble (it took me about 2 hours by myself because I'm not handy). Now it's together and I'm very happy with it. It's a very versitle piece. I'm using it in a bathroom right now for storage but I feel like it's a great purchase because you can use it in so many rooms.", 
    "I really do like the look and utility of this cabinet purchased for my master bath. The color and finish was a perfect match for my existing vanity, which we had professionally refinished. Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "The back did not provide any support and the quick lock parts did not tighten well. No metal plate was provided to allow the doors to connect to the magne to keep the doors closed, The packing material was sticking to the pieces and had to be vacuumed several times plus wiped with a cloth, The glass is held in with screws and small washers and the glass rattles the doors when you open and close them. There were reinforcement plastic corners that did not do much to make it stable. I installed additional metal corner pieces to helpstabalize the unit which improved it greatly. The rear pieces should be made as one piece and the back should be nailed to the sides pieces and top and bottom.", 
    "Would never order this product again. Definitely not worth the money.", 
    "This cabinet is being used to house the dvr and other components for our new big screen tv. It fits in a small area next to the fireplace and helps keep the tuner and direct tv box and blu ray player neatly out of the way but still available to the remote signal.", 
    "Bought this cabinet in hopes of storing some towels. Unfortunately, it is too small. That, however, is not the reason why I gave it 2 stars.... it is not great quality for what you pay for. The doors use a magnetic closure, which really doesn't work very well. Had I had any other use for it, I would try to fix the magnet closure and work with it, but it doesn't work for me.", 
    "This looks nice and fits into small spaces. The entire cabinet sways back and forth, however. We put in L brackets but this didn't really help. The doors close, but there is not a closure to keep them shut. There are many pieces to put together, so this is not a good choice if you don't like assembly.", 
    "I am always leery of buying on line and being disappointed. But this cabinet came EXACTLY as I expected. It was easy to put together, and looks so lovely in my dining room! I put my wedding china in it and the color really sets of the china! The glass seems to be thick enough to not break when my granddaughter banged her head on it, which was nice! And it isn't made of flimsy wood. It is nice and sturdy - feels even a bit heavy, which is a good thing. Over all, this was MORE than a five star experience! I am going to see if I can figure out where the companion pieces would fit in my home! :)", 
    "If I hadn't already unpacked everything and started putting it together, I probably would have returned it. The quality of this product was below average. The doors don't quite align despite many efforts to try and get them to. One of the wooden parts was broken, but is not obvious. Even for the price, this cabinet was not a good purchase.", 
    "I'm very happy with this cabinet. It wasn't hard to put together, and I was able to do it without assistance. The cabinet looks much nicer and higher quality than it actually is. Nothing about it says \"I came in a box and had to be put together and I'm not heirloom quality\". It is a very, very dark brown. When I was putting it together, I thought it might be black. But in the light of day, it is just an exceedingly dark brown. I would recommend this to a friend who needed a small nice looking cabinet to show off dishes or some other collection, and who didn't want to pay more than this.", 
    "This went together easy enough but the top part where the doors close is lose and can not be tighten so you have to hole when you shut the door. It does not stay tight a fell like it will fall apart when you move it. It is cute but not durable", 
    "Took my husband and I less than an hour to assemble, and the pieces fit together as they should (no misplaced holes). The color looks good with both black and dark brown, as we have both colors in the room. After putting it together, we realized that it was sturdy enough to serve as a temporary home for our china. Considering the price I paid for this, I am very satisfied with the product. I would have paid more.", 
    "Assembly is impossible. the directions are minimal, and Overstock is of no help in connecting me with the manufacturer to get better directions. So disapointed. I buy for the O all the time, never had a problem assembling, I'm very handy. I still haven't put this darn thing together. I have even scratched it attempting to do so. Save your money, buy something else.", 
    "I love the size and appearance of this cabinet. It was easy to assemble (did it myself in about an hour - I am reasonably handy). It is not fine quality furniture, but for the money, it really does the job. I had been looking for something with these dimensions and am very happy I found this piece.", 
    "I purchased this for my cookbooks - I have a similar cabinet for china in black - it tones inn well with my wine holder that is black and brown - it took me a while to get things unpacked but I got it together last night and would recommend it to any one - the price was great!", 
    "I bought this cabinet from another store, actually. It looks exactly the same but was just a bit cheaper. I put it together myself. The assembly is by pictures, letters and numbers only, but it was fairly easy, and I am a female (a fairly self-sufficient one, though). Once put together, the unit seems sturdy enough, but one of the shelves is either cut too short, or the little dowel pin to adjust the shelf height is too short, because if I just pick up the cabinet to move it over a little bit, the shelf falls down and the pin falls out. If I don't touch it, then it seems fine. Not worth taking it apart to return it, since it's going in the bathroom to serve as a linen/toiletry cabinet. The color is a good match for my wenge vanity, though, but the finish looks kind of cheap, I'm sure. It's made in China, so the qualtiy -- or lack of -- is no surprise.", 
    "Purchased this for my work place bathroom. It is a high traffic bathroom. The cabinet looked great going in. Pretty easy to build. The top surface is not really wearing very well, but I attribute that to how much use and abuse it is getting.", 
    "This is a very nice little cabinet, perfect for the spot I wanted to use it in. It does arrive in parts, but all parts were there, directions were fairly simple, and it was built and placed in one evening. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small cabinet which is quite nice looking and the price was good.", 
    "THE DIRECTIONS ARE IN PICTURES, NOTHING IS HOLDING THIS PIECE OF BLEEP TOGETHER LIKE SERIOUSLY NO NAILS NOTHING IF YOU LEAN ON IT, IT WILL COLLAPSE, WALMART HAS BETTER QUALITY", 
    "I needed a small cabinet with an elegant color to hold the little delicate glasswear I own. Not to mention it doubled as my telephone landing. It does a geat job of keeping my glases clean from dust and showcases everything nicely through the glass doors. The finish is sleek and elegant, although due to my cat i need to dust the top regularly but all furniture of this color will require that. The doors are smooth to open and close. No magnets or spring loaded hinges - just regular swinging cabinet doors. Real happy with it.", 
    "Once assembled, this is a nice looking unit to the quality is now what I expected. It was, of course, dirt cheap, but still. My problem was that one of the four pins that is screwed in to support the base would not go into the slot at a right angle. This meant that the circular grip meant to hold that pin did not work. I fixed it by screwing in additional L-shaped brackets from the hardware store, but this should not be necessary. There was also a problem with a hole for a dowel not being fully bored out but this was easy enough to fix with a drill. Final result: This unit is nice enough looking but should not be mistaken for first quality.", 
    "I had been looking for a decorative storage cabinet for quite a while when I luckily stumbled across this one. It had the perfect amount of shelves/space, wanted something with windows and the size was just right. I have mine in the living room not the bathroom but it is a very mutli functional piece it can be used anywhere in the house without looking out of place. I assembled it by myself with no issues and it came out just as pictured I have not experienced any problems at all and love it.", 
    "The color of the cabinet was perfect but one of the front doors wont close all the way and the shelves wont stay put. The little pieces that hold the shelves keep falling out (not a tight fit) and so the shelf goes crashing down. I will have to put some kind of tape around the little pieces to make it fit tight before I attempt to put anything on the shelves.", 
    "I was very pleased with my order it was exactly what I was looking for. The shipping of this product was very fast I ordered it on Thursday and it was here on Tuesday. It was easy to put together and the color was just right, I've ordered products from you before and hae been very pleased", 
    "Classique Espresso Double-door Floor Cabinet I recently purchased, satisfied my requirements. The assembly was very easy and its appearance is good to stand in any place of my home. The 5-stars I gave it, summarize all my satisfaction.", 
    "I live with my cat, and could assemble this by myself in less than one evening. All you need is a phillips head screwdriver, and maybe a rubber mallet for the pegs. I'm over 50 so if your a senior like me you can do it if I can.", 
    "Ecellent cabinet for a small space Putting it together was not difficult Am pleased with the purchase but wish it was a little wider in width Arrived in excellent condition and quickly", 
    "When the cabinet was shipped the first time, the top piece had a scratch in it and the finish on one of the doors didn't look completed. I called and Overstock sent me the replacement pieces within a few days. It was pretty easy to put together and looks great. Perfect size for my bathroom. Not to small and it looks more expensive than it is.", 
    "Great product for the price. It was easy to assemble & looks terrific in my bath with multi-colored pastel towels on the shelves. I'm not big on ordering but was very pleased with this product. Wish everything I ever ordered was this true to the pictures you see on line.", 
    "Just what I expected and received! No surprises. I changed out the knobs and handles of all the Classique pieces I purchased and frosted the glass.", 
    "We bought this cabinet to actually use as a small media cabinet in our family room. All of our electronics are wired in the wall, or wireless, so we just needed something small to hold our cable boxes and receivers. It works great! Although we could use an extra inch or two for some of the wires, the cabinet is great and looks fabulous in our space. The quality is really nice and the glass doors give it a more expensive feel. We stuck some pictures and a lamp on top of it and couldn't be happier with the way it turned out...and the price! Great piece for a great price!", 
    "i was looking for something to store artist supplies in my small apartmnt....so my expectations were low...the packing was a mess,..little foam balls are stull showing up tow week later,..but not really a big deal..mine arrived in excellect condition however,..no scratches or dents or imperfections in the finnish. the assembly was easy, it took about an hour to put it together myself...use the supplied glue on the dowls if you want the cabinet to be \"sturdy\"...follow the instrctions (dont over tighten the screws for instance) and you wont have an issue....ignore the instrctions and you will have issues....pay attention to how the cam locks work...if they dont seat properly the cabinet wont line up right and the doors wont be aligned.once put together the cabinet looks quite nice...its sturdy,..no shaking or rocking...all the cam locks are hidden inside the cabinet, which is great...it actually looks like a much more expensive piece of furnature to me....even though its not solid wood....no hand carved details, no dovetail contruction...you would pay much more for those. i understand that some people might have gotten a faulty product,..but if everything was in the box, and there were no flaws in the finnish or in the screw/dowl hole placement this cabinet should look really good when assembled...i put some handmade paper behind the glass to conceal the stuff i store in it, and i changed the knobs to a bushed silver to match other hardware in the room,and it looks like a million bucks...great value.", 
    "This is the perfect little cabinet for a small space like a bathroom. It is simple and nice looking. It takes a little time to put together but it is worth it for the look and savings.", 
    "I order furniture and home goods online all the time and this is by far the first time I have been this dissatisfied in a purchase. The overall quality of this item is very very poor. We disassembled this product twice to try restarting putting it together and still ended up with doors that were mismatched and did not meet the magnet to stay closed. Also the entire piece sways. We checked to see if we were missing pieces or screws and everything was as described in the instructions. We will undoubtedly be returning this item as we are so nervous to set anything on this with our toddler around. I doubt it will even withstand the slightest pressure or mildly heavy items on the shelves. Additionally, if you are dissatisfied with the product overall, it will cost $$$ to ship it back. Unfortunately, even though I have heard a lot of good things about the deals you can find on this site, this was not one of them in my opinion and I doubt I will be returning and ordering anything on here anytime soon.", 
    "I love it! It was easier to put together than I thought.", 
    "Very pleased with the 3 cabinets I bought. Easy to put together, looks good. Just what I was looking for.", 
    "When I received the product I was very pleased with the rich look of it. The ease of assembly was a surprise to me, thank you! This cabinet looks very good in my bathroom. It is a lovely addition and has more storage place than I had imagined. I would recommend this product to family and friends.", 
    "I had some problem getting the right parts. The original shipment had wrong parts. Overstock was wonderful they first sent me replacement part for missing part but the side parts had holes in the wrongly drilled. But they just sent me another cabinet and a return label. The new package was fine and easy to build. It is really pretty but was not as sturdy as I had hoped. It will work for storing light linens. I did use glue on wood dowels based on other reviews. I think that will really help.", 
    "Perfect for what I needed it for. Good quality for the price. Would recommend it to a friend.", 
    "My husband put the cabinet together. He had no problem. The only thing that would be beneficial for the cabinet if it would have some kind of latch so the doors don't open so easily.", 
    "It looks great, but I have no idea how there is a tarnish on the top of it already. I'm not sure if just setting a glass of water on top of it made the mark? In any case I baby it now and don't set anything on it.", 
    "This may not be a solid wood item but it is very nice and easy to put together. The hinges are a little on the weak side but overall a great value and a wonderful addition to our home.", 
    "I bought the cabinet for my bathroom and they look great in there. Simple clean lines with a lot of storage. Love them..", 
    "The door magntetic catch is not heavy-duty. The cabinet is priced appropriatley for light usage.. I am not sure if the heavy use that I intend for it to be used will withstand the wear and tear.", 
    "cabinet is what was described and fits my space accurately. It looks elegant and serves the purpose for which it was purchased", 
    "Very easy to assemble and looks great- the pieces are sturdy so it has a nice weight to it.", 
    "I was very pleased with this piece. It was relatively easy to put together as well.", 
    "I purchased this cabinet to hold my martini and wine glasses in it. This cabinet was smaller than I expected. The only good thing was the color was perfect. It matched the surrounding furniture, but I was very disappointed in the quality. Unfortunately since my husband is deployed, I had to put it together myself. What a pain. I may change my mind in what I put in it now that I know how poor the quality is just in case someone knocks into it.", 
    "We purchased two cabinets. After assembing the first cabinet we noticed that it contained numerous defects on the top and the sides. The cabinet is very cheaply made and extremely flimsy. I would not recommend this product. I didn't bother opening the second cabinet. I immediately returned both to Overstock. The good news is that Overstock accepted my returns and provided a full refund (they even covered the return shipping charges). I will use Overstock again but I would never recommend this cabinet.", 
    "I love mine. I have had so many compliments on it. It fits perfect in my guest bathroom and holds just enought towels to look elegant..", 
    "I bought this product to put our cable box, x-box, router and modem in. All of it fits perfect. I drilled holes in the back for the cords. We have to leave the doors open to change channels, but that was expected. Great product, and very sturdy if assembled correctly. Took about 45 minutes to assemble.", 
    "This was a great cabinet Perfect for what I wanted it for", 
    "Not at all happy, but its a lesson learned. very cheaply made , Hard instructions to follow, very small cabinets. I bought because of reviews, but now I will be very wary of the reviews on overstock.com. I cannot believe anyone would rate this product over a 2 star.", 
    "You get what you pay for. This floor cabinet looks great and fits the space in my small bathroom perfectly, however the cabinet is flimsy expecially the doors. The glass on the doors is very thin. For the price this is still a good deal. I use the cabinet to store towels, tolilet paper, curling irons, etc. I have had this cabinet for almost a year now and it is holding up well.", 
    "This cabinet arrived disassembled but was quite easy to put together, only requiring a screwdriver. Directions were clearly illustrated. The cabinet is a little more shallow than I had thought, but the depth does create a great deal of visual space in the bathroom and is deep enough to hold folded towels.", 
    "For the price I should have received a cabinet that was wood. I am not happy at all, it makes me wonder if I should even consider ordering anything else from your company.", 
    "I bought this cabinet for my living room as a small DVD shelf. It's the perfect size! The cabinet seems quite sturdy and is actually heavier than I expected. It was relatively easy to assemble and looks great with my other furniture. I'd recommend it to a friend.", 
    "This is a great little cabinet for holding extra bath towels. It was fairly easy to put together and looks great!", 
    "This looks good in the room that I wanted it for.It is not too big so it doesn't take up a lot of room.It is a kit that you put together.I think it is a little expensive for a kit.But I am stasified with the results", 
    "This is a good height and has a decent amount of internal storage space. Wasn't too difficult to put together, but the hinges are a little tricky (however, they do come half assembled). The door fit on the one side isn't perfect, but not too noticiable. This is a good buy for the price.", 
    "I am very disappointed in this piece, for the price you could find a better piece at a lesser price at Wal-Mart or Target. The piece came out of the box with scratches and that was a huge let down, also the holes for the door hinges where not properly drilled.", 
    "Got everything assembled except the doors. I was shipped two of the same doors and am now in need of having one sent to me by the manufacturer. They are all lettered, apparently quality control was lacking this day as I received two \"I\" doors and not an \"I\" and a \"J\". May add more when I find out how long it takes to get this fixed.", 
    "Assembling took a while, with many pieces and parts, but it was fun to put together. I used a muffin tin to sort the different hardware pieces, and the instructions were easy to follow. Once assembled, it looks great in the room.", 
    "I have been looking for something stylish and functional for our bathroom. I have a ton of product that didn't fit in the drawers of the bathroom cabinet, so it was always left out and made the bathroom look junkie. This was the exact height of our bathroom counter top. It fits all of my extra product and gives an entirely new look to the bathroom...I can't believe I waited this long to get something. My husband easily assembled this and I love that all the shelves are adjustable...something I wasn't sure of before I bought it. This allows me to put extra tall hairspray or other bottles in there. Now everything looks neat and orderly like you would find in a spa:) The expresso color is dark, almost black, which is exactly what I wanted. I would buy again and again....you're not going to find a better piece for the price. I shopped around online and you can see this exact piece on amazon and even walmart for more money.", 
    "I read the reviews and was a little hesistant with buying this. I decided to ignore them and buy it. The product is great! Great quality! Very easy to put together and the doors align. The only negative would be the packing. The packing crumbles and thus attaches to the item. It is very hard to clean up. Otherwise, it is a must have!", 
    "I bought two cabinets for my living room/music room. They look very nice on both sides of my clavinova. They were easy to set up, I was able to do it by myself pretty quickly. They are not perfect at closer look. Wood is not flush at base or top, back panels do not line up with all of the holes (especially the top), doors have gaps at base and between. With that said, these things are not noticeable to someone who didn't set them up and still look very nice. Especially for the price. These look BLACK!", 
    "Shipping was fast and the cabinet is exactly the size I was looking for. It is very dark, I would call it Black rather than expresso which is fine with me, I was actually looking for black. It does take a bit of time to put together and does seem sturdy once it is completed. I put different knobs on to make it look a bit richer. It does have a bit a scratch on the front, however too much hassle to take apart and return. Overall happy with the item for my purpose.", 
    "Looks expensive when put together, however , much smaller than picture advertized.", 
    "The product looks great in our bathroom, and wasn't to bad to put together.", 
    "For the most part, I'm happy with this cabinet. It took me one and a half hours to unpack and put together myself. The directions were a little confusing so I would suggest laying all of the parts out first and reading the directions thru before assembling. The dowels on the furniture did not match up to the pictures in the directions. Everything went together pretty well. Putting the back on was the hardest part as not all of the nail holes line up. The doors do not line up either, one door is higher than the other. The wood on one of the back legs is split. Be careful to not tighten the screws really tight. The overall style and finish of the cabinet are really nice. If you can live with the uneven doors, you'll like this product.", 
    "This piece was a super find! Beautiful dark brown color, almost black. The pieces were labeled for easy assembly... My husband and I assembled it in less than 30 minutes. Sturdy cabinet, very high quality. Perfect size for holding DVDs. Overall a spectacular find!", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks great. I needed addtional shelving space in my kitchen, this little cabinet does the trick without being too big/bulky. The style goes with most anything...", 
    "we use the cabinet as an office's entertainment center... although it wasn't made to function as one, it looks real nice in my small office... The consoles bulge out the back, but I got it to look nice... i love the cabinet's style...", 
    "It's very simple, beautiful, and looks classic! .It's very sturdy and easy to put together! We are using it for a TV Stand in our living room and it fits perfectly with the rest of the furniture! It is kinda small, but we have other furniture around it, so it looks great!", 
    "This cabinet was actually much smaller than I anticipated. I was hoping for something taller, and even after measuring using the dimensions provided, I was rather disappointed. I didn't bother sending it back because it meant that I'd have to dismantle it, re-box it, and ship it back which was far too much of a hassle and I was in need of something to hold some kitchen items in my pantry so I just kept it. For it's size and quality, I felt that it was too pricey. It's made out of MDF so it's not as if it's even solid wood! The cabinet will serve its purpose, but I'm rather disappointed with it. This was an \"ok\" purchase, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone else. You'd be better off buying something from Ikea--similar quality and effort to put it together, and you'd probably spend less.", 
    "Product arrived quickly and in good condition. It is good quality for the price and easy to assemble. Very happy with item and Overstock!", 
    "I love the look and size of this cabinet. I am using it to showcase and store texts in my home office. It was easy to build and fits together rather well. The item looks as good as it does on the site and holds up just as well! Other rooms in the house could also use this for a variety of storage options and still look pretty.", 
    "The cabinet is very sturdy, and it was easy to assemble. The glass doors line up surprisingly well, and it is also a bonus to have the magnetic closure at the top. The only negative thing I would say is that it has a little bit of a smell inside of the cabinet, but other than that, it's a great little piece of furniture.", 
    "Great color, good size for for the foyer in my apartment. Seems durable and the instructions are easy to follow. Shipping was fast. I give it 4 stars because the holes didn't always line up for assembling (there are a few screws I didn't use when putting on the back panel for this reason) and as a result, all the parts don't seem completely flush and tight to each other. For example, the top panel doesn't sit completely flat and gap-less and there's a narrow but visible gap between the doors when shut. Of course, that may also just be the particular one that I received but overall, it's a nice cabinet.", 
    "Constructed of solid materials and has a nice finish. Assembly instructions are vague, but a nice piece of furniture that will work in any room without taking up too much space.", 
    "This is a nice product, but came with a chip missing out of the wood (luckily was hidden by the door). I tried to put this together but had to have my husband because the directions are very unclear. Nice overall product and looks great in my bathroom.", 
    "I'm using this cabinet as a small china cabinet in our kitchen. It is very contemporary and beautiful! We added recessed lighting inside to make our crystal ware shine and it looks great! Beautiful wood, great price, and a very versatile piece!", 
    "I was expecting a larger cabinet with more storage for the price. It looks very nice, nice finish, but will not be very useful for storage. Assembly sequence was unclear in the instructions and consequently it took some time to put together.", 
    "This cabinet is a bit smaller than I expected. Not based on the dimensions but he design. The shelves leave very little space for items, there are 3 inside and 2 prob would have been better, and since it is close to the ground it is not too easy to get into. The packing was very good, the assembly wasn't too bad, and it looks great. It is just small. It really needs a little corner or area to be appreciated or it will be swallowed up by any other larger furniture you have around it.", 
    "This is the nicest cabinet!! I've assembled several pieces of furniture already and this is by far the best yet!! It is such a rich looking quality!! All of the screws and such were packaged separately......a dream for anyone assembling furniture. The finish does give off an odor at first but a few pieces of charcoal placed in a dish and put inside the cabinet worked wanders for that!! Definitely recommended. I just wish all the furniture pieces you assemble were this nice at this price!!!!", 
    "This cabinet is as advertised and was quality material. Worth the money. I mounted my TV on the wall and wanted a small cabinet to put my DVD players and DVDs. This worked great. I had to cut out the back for wires and because my one player was a little bit bigger, but if you do it right it's barely noticeable.", 
    "I am using this as a bookcase and for some other random pictures, etc. in my living room. This is the perfect size for me, considering I live in a small apartment. It definitely looks more expensive than it was. I am slightly obsessed with glass cabinets, and this one is great for storing books, dvds, etc.", 
    "Nice piece, fits perfectly in guest bathroom. Looks great with right accessories. Overall very happy, fairly easy to put together, nice dark color, pretty sturdy, nice price point. Only issue I have is there are a few very tiny little nicks on front. Most people wont even notice, may have even happened while putting it together....I would still recommend. Looks great!", 
    "I love the cabinet. I was able to pick up 2 matching baskets to contain gels and lotions... it's a tight fit on teh top shelf, but since i don't access them all the time, it will work. we've had the cabinet a couple weeks, and it still has a very strong odor. i'm hoping that goes away soon, but it has transferred onto the towels I'm storing in there. i'd still recommend, it looks perfect in the small corner near my bathroom", 
    "Seemed a little bit smaller in person, despite reading the dimensions. I did not put the middle shelf in and turned this into my liquor cabinet/mini bar. All the booze is on the bottom shelf and glasses are on the top shelf. I even put some of those wine glass hanger racks under the top before putting the thing fully together. This furniture brought a touch of class to my living space and has served well for entertaining guests!", 
    "I purchased two of these to use as bedside tables in a guest bedroom and to display some collectibles. They were relatively easy to assemble, although the instructions on how to attach the backs was confusing, and I had to redo them. They look very nice and are solid pieces--a good value for the money.", 
    "This cabinet looks beautiful in our newly refinished bathroom. The color is true espresso. It will work great to keep decorative towels, washcloths, and other bathroom necessities. My boyfriend put this together and said it was rather simple but some the screw holes were difficult match, but this seems to be standard with any furniture one has to put together. The quality is great! I would absolutely buy this cabinet again or anything else from this manufacturer.", 
    "I love this piece. I suspected I would, as I have never been disappointed with anything purchased through Overstock. This piece is Espresso, and I was hoping it would be black, and it is. It is just the right size in my dining room to store my beautiful pottery, cookbooks and hand towels. I LOVE it!!", 
    "I was looking for a cabinet for a bathroom, this was perfect. Some others I looked at are so narrow, ten inches, you couldn't fit anything in it and seems like it would be wobbly. This has nice storage space, is very sturdy, easy to put together (though a second person to help hold is very useful!), it shipped very fast and in good condition, and it looks great. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be as solid as it is, so I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like this purchase.", 
    "I have never been disappointed in the furniture items ordered from Overstock. This cabinet is no exception. It looks much more expensive than it was and I love the low cost shipping policies that Overstock offers. Way to go Overstock.", 
    "I found is product to be exactly what you see. It was very easy to put together and all the parts were there. I loved the way this item looks, although inexpensive, it is very rich in color and style. I should have gotten two of them!!!", 
    "I bought this for halway but it looks cheap ! Its hassle to return it ! So I'm stuck wit it ! It doesn't worth this price , wast of my money :("
