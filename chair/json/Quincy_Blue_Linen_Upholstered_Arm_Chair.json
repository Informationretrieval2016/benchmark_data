    "We got two chairs and we love the look of them, for the price they look very sharp. I love the color as close as it can be with the picture. But they are not chairs to watch TV or to have a long conversations on them. As accent chairs they are perfect. More in the hard side. Still like them since we have a very comfortable sofa and we are not using the chairs that much. All depends what used you want from them.", 
    "I ordered two of these chairs for my living room and I am happy with my purchases. The chair is a great price and has a modern look. The fabric has a linen/canvas appearance which gives it texture. The color is true to the picture. It\u2019s more of a dark blue or light navy; it\u2019s not a dark navy. The chairs are more for sitting and having conversation than lounging, as the cushion does not have a lot of give and is definitely firm. I would recommend getting a large full pillow for back support, probably 18x18 or 20x20, as the chair is deep. I really focused on the measurements of these chairs, because I wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t trying to pass off an office chair for an accent/side chair. I ended up taking the measurements with me and going to stores with side chairs to see how the dimensions compared. Doing this confirmed that the chairs were the right size with a great \u201cOverstock\u201d price. Good luck finding a side chair this size for under $350. It took me 30-45 minutes to remove them from the packaging and screw on the legs, but the instructions were easy to follow and can be done with one person. I would recommend getting this chair, as it has a modern appearance, but nothing too crazy, and works great for any living room.", 
    "We have had these for about 6 months now, and we love them. They seem to have gotten more comfortable with some use, as they did seem pretty firm in the beginning. They are comfy for both my 6'4\" husband and 5'2\" me. They are roomy enough for me to curl my legs up and read by the fire, and I do it often!The look is a stylin Indigo Blue, a little lighter than the picture. The material looks like a linen. My cats have occasionally been caught using them as a scratch post, and luckily there have been no pulls in the fabric or damage that I can see. Very durable. Very simple to put together. My only complaint, which I almost forgot since it has not cause a problem, was that upon screwing the legs on, one side of one chair was missing one pre-drilled hole for a screw. I called the number provided, left a message, and not no call in return. Instead of drilling ourselves, we went without that screw and all has been fine. Highly recommend for a more formal room setting. We get compliments on them all the time", 
    "We really love these chairs. They are very comfortable - not too soft, not too firm - and are super sharp looking! We ordered two to go in our living room. When they arrived, the first one did have a manufacturers defect in the back support of the foam padding, so we had it shipped back and it was replaced super quick. Just love them! =)", 
    "Didn't live up to expectations", 
    "I bought 2 and they are comfortable and look great", 
    "very nice - only problem is that with these chairs made in china - you just never know if the legs are going to fit properly etc. all the screw holes were different and it took a bit of back and forth with getting them to feel sturdy and not wobble. I needed to buy little felt circles to go under each one so that they do not move around. but cannot beat the price. we bought 4 of them for an office reception area.", 
    "These fit perfectly in my living room & add just the right touch of color. As other reviews stated, they aren't slouch all day cushy chairs but my couch is like that so I really like that the chairs are more firm & help you to keep your back straight when sitting in them. Legs are very easy to assemble and chairs look very polished.", 
    "I received this chair within 3 days of ordering it. The legs are easy to attach and the chair is comfy. It looks great in my small living room.", 
    "Pretty chairs for the price. Not the best quality but the price was right. Had one issue with a bent screw. Purchased 4.", 
    "much better than I could have imagined. Very comfortable and look great", 
    "This chair has blown me away in the comfort department. It sits nicely and allows me (a bigger girl) to really pull my knees up, twist around, and sit in different positions. The color is spot on - I only wish I had room to have more than one!", 
    "I love the chair. I recommend assembling the chair where you want it to go. Once the legs are on, it's was a bit of a puzzle to get it through the guest bedroom door. It may just be my doorway layout. I recommend it. If you like the color and style, don't let anything else hold you back.", 
    "If you want these to be cozy, I'd keep looking But, they are nice looking chairs. I like the color, which is slightly more indigo than it looks online. They worked for me, in an office, but I would want something more cozy for a living room.", 
    "very stylish chair good color. Only reason 4 instead of 5 stars is because legs were a little trouble attaching properly and the seat is rather Very firm.", 
    "I have had success previously buying chairs for my living room from Overstock. 7 years and two cats later I tried again, fearlessly. Unfortunately this time, I was met with disappointment. These chairs smelled of chemicals and either the instructions or labels on the chair parts were wrong, because what should have taken 15 minutes, figuring out the correct leg positioning took four times as long and the chairs wobbled initially. The fabric is also poor and thin and is already showing pulls. I'm sure I won't get 7 years out of these, and I don't know if I'll give Overstock another chance with furniture.", 
    "Very stylish and easy to assemble - arrived quickly"
