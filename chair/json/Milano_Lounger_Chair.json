    "Great chair for the price - comfortable but not a lot of cushion. Blanket can be added to inside of cover for extra cushioning.", 
    "This chair was ordered for my son's room who is in elementary school. My husband and I take turns reading with him each night and needed a chair comfortable enough to sit in for less than an hour. This is a great chair and isn't too bulky/heavy. Sturdy enough for my 6' 1\" husband who weighs just over 200 pounds. Had a strange odor when we unpacked parts from shipping box but by the next morning, it had dissipated. Happy with purchase.", 
    "When these chairs arrived in a flat box I was surprised given the look of the finished product. They accomplish this with a very clever use of push fasteners, meaning the frame of the chair is in 5 pieces that easily go together/come apart without tools. This is great because it can travel easily, and while the directions are clear and the pieces are very clearly labeled, it probably isn't even necessary as it is pretty intuitive. I wanted these for extra seating for a college apartment and they are perfect for that and look better than expected for the price.", 
    "I was not sure what to expect with these chairs, but i was purchasing them for my kids game room to play video games and these are perfect for that. they have to share with our cat who has claimed them for himself but great chairs", 
    "This product looks better in the picture on overstock than it does when we actually saw it. It is not sturdy or strong enough for anyone over 170 lbs. it will not last long on average everyday wear and tear. Too bad", 
    "Using this as an accent chair for my bedroom. Not the most comfortable chair but serves it's purpose as an accent chair and the price was right. '", 
    "We bought two of these chairs to supplement seating in our living room as needed. We recently had guests and had set the chairs up while they were here. The chairs were comfortable and attractive. I kept the boxes they came in and disassembled the chairs, placing them in storage in the garage until needed again. Very pleased.", 
    "Comfy chairs. 12 year old put one together in 5 minutes.", 
    "This chair is perfect to fulfill my needs in a new chair. I am a senior citizen on a fixed income who lives in a studio apartment. When I saw this chair as I was browsing through what was available on line, it only took about 2 minutes for me to read about it and find that it met my criteria perfectly for a new chair. When it arrived, it only took about 5 minutes for me to put it together and see it in the spot I had picked out for it.", 
    "Bought this for my son. Easy to assemble - very comfortable. He loves it!", 
    "Nice for my teen daughter's bedroom!", 
    "This chair is not the most comfortable, but it is very stylish and looks great in family room. I did take someone's advice on here and added extra fleece padding to chair.", 
    "This chair was very simple to put together. Took all of 7 minutes and sits well in my daughters room.", 
    "Nice accent chair for my oldest room. It's wide, sturdy and comfortable. Not a lot of back support if you have issues, but pop a accent pillow for added comfort and a thin throw for warmth and you'll snooze maybe.", 
    "Chair was delivered quickly and easy to snap together. Perfect for an accent or extra chair, firm, not very soft, but adding an accent pillow helps with that. Definitely serves its purpose and looks good in the area.", 
    "This was so simple to assemble! Not cushioned much but comfortable. I put a large pillow in the seat for longer periods (like watching a movie). The price is unbeatable.", 
    "It's Cool, Chic and Casual... all at the same time!I love it!Don", 
    "I ordered my first milano chair from ****** in beige. The chair is easy to put together and serves its purpose well. I needed another one in black and they were sold out but you guys had it! Awesome-sauce! Your site is the best and you have a new customer here. Thanks!", 
    "Great chair! Easy to put together and comfy. The back is angled back a bit, so you do feel like you are leaning back, but if you prefer to sit more upright, a throw pillow helps.", 
    "Great as an extra seat in my teen son's bedroom. Then everyone isn't piled on the bed when he has friends over. He loves it! Easy to put together - great buy for the price.", 
    "pawfurrt! another chair for the paw friends to take over", 
    "Great buy. Put it in a guest room used by my grandchildren on their visits. The gave it their stamp of approval. Looked good and is comfortable seating. Great buy for the price.", 
    "Love it. So easy to assemble and soooo comfortable.", 
    "A pair in our guest room look great and I love that the fabric is washable.", 
    "This chair was good for my back.", 
    "Works for the assigned space", 
    "Great addition to my apartment and fits right under my desk", 
    "THE chair was delightful for about two wks, then the underbelly material pulled apart at the seams. Cheap. So sad.", 
    "I love this chair! I was looking for a cheaper chair for my living room to play video games in and after looking through so many chairs and so many reviews, I found this one! My main concern was the sturdiness, since reviews for other chairs tended to claim the frame broke not long after purchase. This one is really sturdy though, and it's really comfortable! It looks nice as well, it doesn't look like a cheap chair. My only complaint would be that the \"beige\" basically is tan.", 
    "I love this chair. This is my casual corner chair.", 
    "Nice height and padded enough but not too much.", 
    "for the price its fine . kind of cheaply made tho", 
    "My bedroom is small so space was an issue. I needed a chair that was light weight in appearance, but still comfortable. This one was perfect - very easy to assemble, light enough to move around and very attractive appearance!", 
    "Was exactly what I expected. Not too flimsy but nothing to jump up and down on. Animals love it and took over as a bed right away :)", 
    "Looks really cool and is pretty comfortable. Not as \"cushy\" as it looks, and there is a bar underneath the seat that you can feel, but not terrible. It's good for an extra chair for occasional seating.", 
    "purchased this chair in black for our daugher's room. it's a great size and is comfortable the way it hugs your sides. Not too comfy on the rear end. She uses a pillow to sit on when she sits in the chair. For the price, its fine", 
    "My daughter loves this chair! Perfect for a small bedroom.", 
    "Really like this chair for a room needing a fun chair when you don't want to spend a lot. It won't last forever but that's not what I was looking for. Would buy another!", 
    "impossible to sit upright.....just a little too much \"recline\" to be confortable", 
    "Great chairs to pull out when you have extra people stop by", 
    "Totally cute! Put them in my massage waiting room. Comfortable, modern and relaxed style. You assemble and very easy to do. Less than 5 minutes.", 
    "Perfect. Just as pictured.", 
    "This chair was fairly easy to assemble. Unfortunately it did not work out for our use and we sent it back. It appears that it would be suitable for occasional use. With continual use, I think it would begin to wear and end up tearing at the corners that hold the weight of the person.", 
    "And hard to vacuum cat hair off of (the cat has taken it over and she can have it). Not bad to look at, but God-awful for sitting in.", 
    "It's ok. Not used for daily use. The cover can be washed. The sling on the frame ripped pretty easily. I had to take off and sew. Really wouldn't buy again.", 
    "Great chair for my bedroom and easy to move anywhere.", 
    "This chair is just as advertised. It is simple to assemble, with the caveat that I required help with the last connection because I am a senior and it needed a little extra strength to push the parts together. For additional seating comfort I added a small pillow inside the removable cover. This is not noticeable to the observer but makes a big difference.", 
    "The strap underneath the cushion broke. My son only weighs 150 lbs", 
    "Basically bought it for the cats and all three approve!", 
    "I am really enjoying this chair. I purchased two and they are very comfortable and very relaxing.", 
    "a very nice chair for my preteen grandson's room. It went together fairly easy and not a bad price either.", 
    "Using these in a Library setting for a reading area, the students love them.", 
    "Perfect for watching movies and relax!", 
    "Needed a 3rd person chair for my small living room. This filled the bill. It was easy to assemble. The color is perfect and it's pretty comfortable. I would be happy to offer someone this chair to sit in.", 
    "I ordered two chairs and the stitching on the seat ripped on both chairs on the second sitting.the chairs were designed to handle 250 pounds.No quality.", 
    "Very easy to assemble. Adds a little style to the room.", 
    "I held off writing this review, and I'm glad I did. I got this several months ago, and it's already falling apart. Well, the sling part of the seat is. I was wondering why I felt like I was sinking, and I removed the cover. The sling part of the seat that is under the cover, which actually holds you up in the chair, is almost completely frayed. I'm sure I can take the whole chair apart and sew it back together, but how long will it be for it to fray again? It's a nice looking, light-weight chair, but for a $$ lawn chair essentially, it sure didn't last long.", 
    "Adorable, stylish chair. Easy to put together, and delightful to sit in. I bought this chair in black for my 12-year-old who painted her room turquoise and painted her furniture chalkboard-black. So the chair is a very nice accent--and useful too. She sits in it, she puts her clothes on it. I love how it adds a touch of chic to a tween's bedroom. And the quality is very good for the price!", 
    "Nice little chair for my guest bedroom. Very easy to assemble. Comfortable to sit in", 
    "Very easy to assemble. Great price for the quality of the chair. Very comfortable and love the zip off cover for easy cleaning. Bought it for my son's college apartment. Size is perfect.", 
    "I bought this chair for extra seating in our new trailer with a slide out. It looks great,is light, isn't too large and with a little extra padding...pillow under the cover, it is reasonably comfortable, even more so when you use a footstool. It also looks more like a living room chairthat you can take apart than anything else I could find under $**. The dark brown melds perfectly with the existing decor. Very happy with my choice.", 
    "Bought this chair as an accent chair and guest chair. Love the style, it is light weight and easy to assemble. Also love the fact that the cover can be taken off and washed. Highly recommended.", 
    "Bought two for the bedroom. The size and color work beautifully. The cats absolutely love curling up in the chairs. Now, they stay off the bed. However, they are not well-constructed. After seeing the fabric cover, I don't think it will be as washable as I had hoped so I covered them with the fleece throws the cats like. I don't think a tall or heavy person would be at all comfortable. The basic sling under the fabric is a vinyl/plastic sheet. Not that sturdy for heavy people. Doubt if it would hold up over time. Assembly was very easy for one person. These might be OK for a kid's room. I highly recommend them for people with cats and small dogs. They're sturdy with no tipping or shaking for small animals. I don't recommend them for big dogs and people. There are better chairs for the price.", 
    "I was looking for a neutral colored comfy collapsible chair for my dorm room. This chair is perfect. The price was the best I found.", 
    "Love the chair and love the size...but it's more of a chair for a teenager to sit in. Weight limit is about 150 or so.", 
    "This product Looks cute but hard to sit for more than an hour", 
    "I was looking for a small chair and this fit the bill. Wish it came in more colors", 
    "Chair was listed for a lesser price online. Color was not a dark chocolate brown as show online. Based on some reviews, I need a more stable small chair for the living r.oom. I was fooled by the name \"Milano\"", 
    "I've only had this chair a little over a week and I love sitting in it, simple to put together and comfortable , I use it in my den so whether I'm reading or watching TV I'm very relaxed, its sturdy just what I've been looking for.", 
    "This is a great chair! In terms of comfort, it's not too soft but you can put a pillow (nobody will be able to see it) under the seat, and it makes it much nicer. I love the fact that you can take it apart at any point and put it in your storage area. Great", 
    "Originally got this for my adult autistic son...he doesn't like it, but I sure do. It is soft and cozy. When I sit in it, it feels like the chair wraps around me and it is really comfortable. Chair is great for additional seating in a small space.", 
    "If you want a cheap, comfortable chair in your Den or children's room this is the perfect addition for that. It is easy to assemble and it is quite comfortable. It is a good price also. I bought one from amazon and then I saw it for a good price here on Overstock.com. Sears sells these also but it doesn't have the colors that overstock has. This chair fits right in if you don't have a lot of room to spare also. I am definitely pleased with my purchase of this chair.", 
    "When I received the first chair, the frame had bending issues. Contacted Customer Services to exchange the chair and kudos to them. With a little extra padding this chair is fine.", 
    "these chairs are such a great deal..got them for my \"tween\" girls room she loves them ..", 
    "It's just so-so. Not the most comfortable chair in the room, but for extra seating I can throw in a corner, or completely take apart and store in a closet, it's not too bad.", 
    "Bought these for my son's apartment in Denver and he loves them. His place is small an these fit great for the space. We are tall they are a tad low to the ground but comfy.", 
    "Easy to assemble, good material, surprisingly firm, too firm to sit on for any length of time.", 
    "Bought this for a bedroom. Good value for the price..looks good and was very easy to assemble.", 
    "The seams came apart on the first day of sitting on it. Glorified camp chair - not very comfortable.", 
    "Very easily assembled, this chair has clean lines and cushy comfort all in one. Be careful of color selection - online swatches are much lighter than \"in person\".", 
    "Not a comfortable chair for adults. Put in my 9 year old granddaughter's room and they are just ok. Not what I was hoping for....was disappointed.", 
    "Love this little chair! So easy to put together, looks great, good price and is quite comfortable. Perfect size for my needs.", 
    "chair looks nice, but not very comfortable. more of an occasional chair.", 
    "I purchased this for my personal assistant. Not a few minutes went by after the one second set up and trial by sitting via my personal agent...THE CAT WAS VERY PLEASED WITH BOTH OF US!!! this is Horetio's new and perfect sleeping, napping, and on the edge dreaming. we are thrilled! Dr Foley", 
    "as stated in other reviews, there really is no seat padding, so i was prepared and used a broad, flat pillow of my own. it's quite comfortable and makes for an appealing contemporary accent piece in my room.", 
    "I ordered this for my daughter's college dorm. It arrived quickly and assembly was a breeze. It's sturdy enough for a teenager of 110 lbs, I would not recommend this for heavy people. The pad is a bit thin, it gets a lot better with an additional thin pad in my opinion. My daughter likes one way or the other. It's been most enjoyed by my 3 cats at the moment.", 
    "It's the only thing I have to \"PLUNK\" in when my back is so sore even my medication is not working!", 
    "I bought this chair for my 11 year old son's room. It's modern looking and comfortable. It's not a snuggle up and get comfy chair but it will be good for some reading, especially when used with an ottoman.", 
    "I absolutely love this chair. It arrived several days than it was supposed to. I was really surprised. It took me about 5 mins to assemble and put together. This makes a great extra chair or a bedroom chair (the way that I am using it). Strong and sturdy.", 
    "This Milano Lounger arrived ahead of schedule. It was not damaged at all, and was easy to assemble. The Lounger is comfortable for awhile, but after an hour of sitting in it, my legs began to hurt. It is very stable and I like the design. It is similar to the \"buterfly chair\" be much more stable. I would recommend this chair, but it is not for long periods of sitting.", 
    "I put the chair together in about seven minutes. Chair pretty cozy. I am very pleased with it.", 
    "I really like this chair. It looks nice in my living room and since I like to change my furniture around a lot this chair is easy to move around.", 
    "I love sitting in this chair! its really comfortable! The reason I gave it a 4 is that it could be prettier but that's just a personal opinion. Great for sitting and relaxing.", 
    "These chairs were ingeniously designed!! The frame pieces slide into each other and lock into place - no screws. The fabric piece is well-made with a zipper up the back of the chair. You slide it onto the frame and zip it up. They are fairly comfortable as well. Kind of funky and modern looking. I am in love with them!!", 
    "I gave this chair 3 stars because I feel like for the price of the chair, the seat pan shouldn't be so stiff...maybe overtime after the seat pan material stretches it will loosen up."
