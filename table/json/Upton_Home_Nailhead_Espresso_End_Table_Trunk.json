    "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this table for the price. I have paid more for lower quality, that is for sure. It has a strong hinge that holds the top open, a nice feature. One caveat: get out your measuring tape and try to get an idea of the actual size. To me, it seems larger and more squat than in the photo. This is my own fault, of course, for just going by the photo and not using a measuring tape to get a better feel for the actual dimensions. Measure twice, buy once!", 
    "This end table is absolutely gorgeous- very classic and stylish. It makes a very rich statement in a room and also gives you storage. Can't beat that! It took me about an hour to put it together- I would suggest maybe some wood glue when you put in the dowels. The look is stylish and will go with transitional, traditional, west indies, bombay, etc. You won't be sorry if you buy this peice. I am taking 1 star away only becasue it is pine and mdf- not the good stuff! But having said that- i am not sure that my friends will even pick up on that when they see it. I ordered it on a Saturday, and it was on my front door step on Tuesday. So glad I ordered this end table. Also- one reviewer said it was larger than what they thought it would be, but I did not find that to be the case. It was perfect!!", 
    "We were hesitant, despite the excellent reviews. Yet, once we assembled it (easily) & placedit alongside our sofa, I immediately went back online to order another! This is my 3rd Overstock furniture purchase and I do believe I've become a permanent customer!", 
    "The box seems well made. All the parts went together well - EXCEPT that the assembly hardware is TRASH. I have assembled a lot of furniture in my day and usually have no problems. But the cam locks that are included are useless. I broke 3 out of the 8 by \"overtightening\". One bent, so I tried to straighten it. It broke too. I don't know what metal they used for these cam locks, but it's shamefully cheap. I went to my local big-box hardware store (the orange one) and bought 15mm by 14mm replacement cam locks and they worked great. So just count on spending about $12 per table on replacement hardware. Still sooo worth it. Now that the table is assembled, it looks terrific and I think will last. (I also used wood glue on all joints - not included in package or directions - to make it stronger for the long haul.)", 
    "If your looking for a table with a storage area this is the table trunk for you. It is very nice and elegant. Looks nice with dark wood. Highly recommend this product. Easy to assemble.", 
    "I actually bought two of these trunks so I could use them (side by side) as a unique coffe table. I just didn't put the legs on so they wouldn't sit so high. These were very easy to put together. I had an electric drill so it was easier to put all those screws in the wood. I also didn't bother with putting the hinge for the covers on. I'm very pleased with how they look. It's nothing you can find in furniture stores!", 
    "This table looks far more expensive than it is. The finish is beautiful. Quality is excellent. I am very pleased with how it looks in my home. We did have some trouble figuring out how the inside table latch attached to the table top. Instruction picture is not clear enough to should show direction. We eventually figure it out.", 
    "This end table is nice to look at, but don't look too closely once you put it together. The pre-drilled holes for the hinges on the back do not match the hinges, thus the table top doesn't line up with the table if the hinges are screwed in tightly for use of the storage area. The screws are small and cheap, and two of them broke off when I screwed in the front hinge. (I did not even get them all the way screwed in before they broke off). I love the looks of this table, but am so very happy I didn't order the matching coffee table. No matter how carefully these put-together furniture items are packed, there are still scratches and marks when you get them out of the wrapping.", 
    "Before you assemble this trunk, make sure you open each bag & count all of the parts. The manufacturer sends the item with missing/damaged parts. The item is also much darker than it appears on screen. On screen it appears to be a cherry wood, but it is actually a dark brown, espresso color. Once assembled it is actually quite nice looking & much bigger than I thought.", 
    "The table was very easy to put together and the instructions were spot on. Its the right size and adds touch of quality to the room.", 
    "I had some trouble getting it together because holes were in the wrong places or tacks were, but it's very pretty now that it's together. My wife loves it", 
    "this has been the hardest piece to put together so far because the screw heads kept breaking. but not a deal breaker and the piece works well in our room. you get what you pay for...a decent accent piece but no show stopper by any means.", 
    "This is the first item from Overstock that hasn't been perfect and it was almost perfect. We were short one screw to the hinge and the hinge doesn't have instruction on which way is the top. We are both educated people but could not figure it out. We had to go to xxxxx and buy a screw. Would it kill them to put another in? I know you can always call and get one sent to you but who wants to take the time to wait halfway through the assembly? It is put together now, has great storage capacity, is quite heavy and looks nice. I don't regret buying it but the hinge needs a little better instruction and count your screws before you start. Overall, I am usually very satisfied with Overstock and know I will shop here again.", 
    "Looks great. The only thing I would change (from a customers' perspective, I guess) is to have the manufacturer provide Overstock.com with an assembled product delivered to the warehouse so that Overstock can supply their customers with this product already assembled upon delivery. At the very least, have everything already assembled except the legs (e.g., the Button-tufted Creme Leather Bench and the Hand-painted Antique White Drum Table I ordered from Overstock.com in addition to this Nailhead Espresso End Table Trunk). The Overstock.com online product description explains that assembly is necessary and it only takes approximately 45 minutes to assemble but this product is small enough to insist that the manufacturer assemble it themselves beforehand. Other than that (as you can see by my overall rating) this product is great and looks good with just about any furniture piece (I actually have it in the same room as the Button-tufted Creme Leather Bench, the Hand-painted Antique White Drum Table and the Slate/Glass/Steel Coffee Table I purchased on Overstock.com -- along with a futon ordered from another company and other home furnishings). I've read other reviews commenting on size. FYI to all online purchasers -- read the descriptions and MEASURE comparible products already in your home first. Happy Holidays, good health and good fortune to all Overstock.com employees and their families as well as to all others who read this review. Peace, Shalom, Salam, He-Ping, Heiwa, Paz, Paix, et cetera.", 
    "Good product needs to be good with tools to assemble this table. Looks very elegant.", 
    "Very stylish. Perfect for my need.", 
    "I love this trunk. I was a bit nervous to order it based on some of the reviews about how difficult it was to put together, but I did it all by myself and it was easy and fast. Glad I ordered it!", 
    "Just the perfect end table to match our coffee table!", 
    "Looks wonderful in my family room.", 
    "it was easy to put together and looks expensive.", 
    "Darker than pictured, but heavy, sturdy piece of furniture!", 
    "I bought two to go on either end of my sectional in our newly finished basement. The storage inside is great for extra blankets and pillows. They look fabulous! Don't hesitate, buy one or two!", 
    "This is such a unique looking piece. Provides extra storage if needed. It was a little cumbersome to put together (needs two sets of hands at one point) but otherwise a very sturdy and unique piece. I would buy another one.", 
    "I got this trunk end tsble at a great price so I was happy. It's bigger than you'd think and has a good storage space. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars because it's hard to assemble. The last two steps aren't very clear (pictures or instructions) and none of the screws fit in properly! I had to borrow a drill to install all the screws.", 
    "Works great as a end table", 
    "Thanks overstock, we love it!", 
    "Storage is an added bonus. One of my favorite pieces.", 
    "Love the look of the Nailhead End Table but the finish on the top is very poor. It scratched off within the first two months.",

    "Very nice!!! It is great for storage of small blankets in the Den in case someone gets a cold, but also serves as an end table.", 
    "These chests are easy to assemble; a fine value for the price!", 
    "I bought two of these as side tables in a den. Very attractive and can store pillows and blankets. Great quality", 
    "This is by far one of the best pieces of furniture I have ever purchased. It looks super expensive but it's actually priced great. It was a little difficult for my husband to put together (and he puts a lot of things together quick) but it looks so good I can't complain! Definitely buy this for your living room addition.",

    "The instruction was bad. The top cover doesn't line up to the table. Not a good quality.", 
    "As advertised. Good value. Quick delivery.", 
    "I ordered this to go with a new couch with nailhead accents on the couch and ottoman. It is really pretty and I love the hardware. It took a while to assemble and the holes were not drilled in the right place so my husband had to get out his drill and fix it in order to get it to align properly. I could not have assembled it myself. It is very handsome and unique.", 
    "Easy to assemble, very heavy and pleased with appearance!", 
    "I purchased this item to go in my guest bedroom, it compliments the wrought iron bed that I purchased from Overstock. It looks very nice and expensive glad I bought 2. Very easy to assemble. SI in Kentucky",

    "Great table looks fantastic and very well built. A little difficult to put together. Love the built in storage!", 
    "It looked as good as pictured. Love the functionality and the look. I put it together by myself, I like doing that type of thing. If you don't have the patience for it, then this isn't the product for you. It is a beautiful conversation piece and durable. Added benefit, heavy wood.", 
    "I use this table at the end of my sofa in the den. Not only is it a good value, it is very pretty and I stores sofa throws in it. The assembly was not difficult but did take a couple of hours. My husband is a perfectionist and he may have worked slower on it but everything lined up perfectly. I am very pleaded with this table and would highly recommend it.", 
    "Beautiful, easy to assemble Great end tables and extra storage", 
    "Pleased with this purchase, the wood is solid & provides ample storage for games, pillows etc. The tables are also quite stylish, a perfect addition to my family room",

    "Very functional and well constructed. Have used it in the Den and Living Room. Sturdy and fits in well with any decor.", 
    "The table needed to be put together. My son had no problem with that. It looks beautiful and much nicer than i had anticipated. I don't remember the description before i bought it, but it's actually a storage container. The top lifts up and holds quite a bit.", 
    "The end table was easy to assemble and I love the color. I also bought the larger matching piece I use for a coffee table. Both have lots of storage too.", 
    "What a great set! Very pleased with them.. quality made and looks much more expensive than what I paid for them.",

    "I love my End Table Trunk. It was easy to assemble and it looks great with my furniture.",

    "Solid piece of furniture. Easy to put together. Looks more expensive than it was and is exactly as is pictured. Love it!",

    "Huge !!! Space for storage", 
    "The uptown nailhead espresso end table trunk is a solid and stylish piece of furniture with the only complaints being loose fitting wood dowels and a chemical odor which only dissipated after several weeks even after airing it out the first day I received it.", 
    "Came broken. Built cheaply. I would not recommend.", 
    "Good quality, unusual design. I get lots of compliments on this trunk.",

    "Love it. Took some time to put together.", 
    "it is a good looking piece for the price. It makes a good addition to the living space. We had a bit of a problem putting in the elbows that hold the lid up. I am not sure if there is a defect in one of the elbows. I have not contacted overstock.com as yet about it. I am sure they will resolve the issue immediately. My experience of them has been extremely favourable. They obviously rank customer satisfaction as a high priority", 
    "Adds a lot of charm to a room! Great price a delivery was fast.", 
    "I bought this to match the Cocktail Table Trunk. Excellent quality Love It!", 
    "This end table is stunning and my guest never fail to compliment how beautiful it is. Sturdy and stores three large pillows easily.", 
    "I really don't like the finish on this piece. Should have sent it back, but I didn't. I was impressed that it came with two complete sets of hardware. One in black and one in the antique brass.", 
    "Got two of these and love them. Good looking and great storage.", 
    "very good hidden storage unit in plain sight", 
    "Great little table. Looks great.", 
    "Bought two, for bedroom, or other, and they assembled with patience, lady and gentleman each did one. They were so beautiful i put them in my living room beside my TV as lamp tables, highly recommend as occasional furniture.", 
    "Looks like it costs more than it really did. The assembly instructions were good. Nice solid heavy furniture.", 
    "Went together quickly and serves us well.", 
    "This is an awesome piece of furniture.", 
    "easy to put together,top scrathes easily.", 
    "Great storage for my curtains & throw blankets for the living room. I can't wait to get the coffee table chest too.", 
    "This looks just as it does on line, maybe the actual wood is a bit darker. It was a bit difficult to put together, but finally it was ready. It is really heavy, but adds a nice elegant piece to our living room.", 
    "Gorgeous but took about 5+hours to put 2 of these together. Be aware.", 
    "I ordered two of these end tables to go with the matching coffee table which I ordered earlier this year. They are very easy to put together. I really like the Nailhead Espresso coffee table and these matching end tables.", 
    "very nice , sturdy good material .is a little big no too much but it served the purpose, I love it so iam keeping it. when ordering ,take measurement of your space.", 
    "easy to assemble, beautiful wood and the nail heads and handles enhance the overall look", 
    "Looks great but the quality is not what I expected. The wood seems rather thin and not sturdy.", 
    "Ordered and Delivered in excellent shape! Put it together myself in about 2 hrs...It adds such beauty to my family room! Storing Throw blankets inside it..Very Excellent Quality for the price !", 
    "Ordered two for our new home! They are absolutely beautiful and very functional! Time will tell to see if they hold up to 3 boys. Instructions were not included in one of the boxes, but my husband put it together without it (why he didn't get it out of the other box is beyond me, but dare I suggest the obvious). Shipping was super fast and the price was what I wanted to pay! Overstock rules!!", 
    "Love this item. I bought 2 using as end tables holds lamps very stylish. Noone would know that inside are all my grandsons toys! Out of sight. \ud83d\ude0a Definitely a 2 person assembly but all parts labeled. Easy instructions. Would recommend.", 
    "Great size and quality. It's a nice accent to any room.", 
    "Solid a very stand out piece of furniture.", 
    "This table is unique and looks great, but is a bit fragile. When it arrived, several of the pieces has small dings that exposed the veneer. Assembly instructions could have been clearer, but everything was well marked. I think this is a nice decorative piece, but I wouldn't rely on it for regular usage as repeatedly lifting the top and/or placing things on and off it would likely cause the veneer to chip.", 
    "Got these ans matching cocktail table. Very pleased.", 
    "I love it looks good in my living room..", 
    "Love this. Made it a stool by not putting the legs on. Put a pillow on top so I can sit on it and put my boots on. The top stays open without holding it, and it closes gently. It's a very nice piece. Very happy with it.", 
    "very sturdy and looks exactly like the pic", 
    "Easy to put together. Really nice quality.", 
    "It really looks very exotic and good quality solid wood. The buttons adds lot of character to the box. I love it.", 
    "Quality for the price. Great storage. Super easy assembly. One extra handle not to spec. Could have been a shipping mistake. If your missing a handle, I have it.", 
    "Very nice! with storage so needed!", 
    "I love the way these look. I originally bought one and liked the look of it so much I purchased a second one.", 
    "I ordered this piece to serve as a nightstand. I'm pleasantly surprised at the high quality of this piece. Its very sturdy and heavy and will hold up for many years of use. Its looks just like the pictures. Assembly went fairly quickly and easily. This piece has both an old world feel and a funky eclectic air. It blends beautifully with my modern decor. Love love this piece; it's a great deal for the price!", 
    "Bought two of these for end tables in bedroom, looks great adds character !", 
    "Another excellent value - we purchased this for the lobby of a medical office and it looks great. Only issue is the handles are movable and kids LOVE slam them against the metal. Other than that, would absolutely recommend.", 
    "I live these end tables, I got the matching coffee table too. It is great to have the extra storage and I get lots of compliments on them", 
    "I bought two of these tables to use as night stands in a spare bedroom.I love the hardware and the trailhead trim. The bed I got also hastrailhead trim and it really tied the look together.They are a little difficult to assemble and you have to have two peoplebut we got it done and I couldn't be happier!", 
    "Eyes are drawn to the unusual design features creating a feeling of richness and satisfaction. Very attractive, functional and usefull for storage to boot.", 
    "I was a little leery because I never brought furniture online. We got it,put it together and have a beautiful piece. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "Lovely and good storage for pillows and throw.", 
    "Beautiful accent table with capacious storage inside.", 
    "Nice! Gave them away but quality is great and compliments any room", 
    "very nice forniture and fine finish.", 
    "Great trunk with large storage! Golden brass nail heads compliment wood tone which is true to picture", 
    "I love it, I love it, I love it!", 
    "Table is very attractive. It is large so you need to have room. The table is heavy. The assembly took a while, but the table is very sturdy. Good quality.", 
    "I bought 2 of these end tables, they were easy to assemble and look great! They are very sturdy, excellent quality and a very good value for the money.", 
    "Had difficulty putting the hinge on inside lid, otherwise beautifully constructed. Adds a lot of pizazz to the room.", 
    "Love these tables. They look beautiful and are the perfect addition to our family room. Easy to assemble. Excellent value for the price!", 
    "LOVE IT, everybody that visit me talk about howw beatiful it is", 
    "A great addition to my guest room, excellent choice for quilts and more.", 
    "Arrived in a shorter time than expected. Absolutely met all my expectations. Simple to assemble and looks very classy. The brass hardware sets off the look of the table. I am completely satisfied with my Overstock purchase.", 
    "Just loved this piece! Was very true to color! Was not that hard to assemble.", 
    "Nice piece of furniture at a good price. Wasn't too difficult to put together.", 
    "The way it looks in the pic....it looks in my living room. Just perfect! The nailhead give it a little extra something. It's a classic piece!", 
    "Just as pictured. Top lid is flush and lines up like a quality piece. Heavy.", 
    "It is a beautiful piece. I needed an end table with a lot of storage. So it is perfect. But when it arrived, one of the corner was not finished and was light brown. So we have to hide this corner. Otherwise it is a great addition to our living room.", 
    "Excellent buy. I want five more.", 
    "This piece is very solid, with burnished brass nailheads & really sturdy hinges to hold the top open.Color?....the color in reality, is a little lighter than expresso, but fits well with other expresso decor.Easy enough to put together, as long as you take your time, and don't get flustered (about 1 hour). All the bolts are packaged in separate slot bags to keep process straight-although diagrams were confusing at times.Just be sure to review the measurements before purchasing, as this thing is larger than a side table. I purchased it to store lap blankets & throw pillows in.", 
    "I had bought the coffee table and end table earlier and decided to buy another end table to complete to look. Plus it offers extra storage.", 
    "Love it! My husband hates put together furniture but he said this was well made.", 
    "Really lovely and large side tables! They store all of our guest sheets/towels and the finished look is great. Each table did take 20-30 minutes to put together, though, so be prepared to work for them.", 
    "Good price and good quality", 
    "I bought the matching coffee table, and couldn't be happier with either item. Great, great, great for storing guest pillows, magazines, sheets, blankets, etc. Easy to put together, and made of nice, solid quality wood. We're very please with this item.", 
    "needs a removable tray inside for better storage", 
    "So stylish and cute. Not a small end table (has storage) This was a 2hr project.........lots of part. Used electric screwdriver to make it easier. Seems to pretty heavy in weight.", 
    "Such a beautiful piece and very easy to put together", 
    "I bought these because they looked so good in the pics and was not really sure how they would look in my home. They are so well made and look so awesome, I decided to purchase the coffee table also. Can't say enough about these !!!", 
    "This trunk is beautiful and easy to assemble.", 
    "I decided to use this chest as an end table and it's perfect. Not a boring end table in the living room.", 
    "This is a beautiful end table. We purchased 2. They were easy to put together and are very sturdy. I am very impressed with the quality of this table. Don't hesitate to buy them!", 
    "Highly recommend this product. Easy to assemble.If your looking for a table that looks great and the price is right. I put it in the living room between two chairs and it looks fantastic.", 
    "Really think this chest looks much more expensive than it is. It is solid and it's nice to have additional storage.", 
    "Nothing special, just nicely made and pretty.", 
    "Bigger than what i thought it would be. But in the end it went well with rest of the items in the living room", 
    "takes time to put together but worth it.", 
    "I get so many compliment on this end table. And it has storage...............", 
    "These are larger than they seem in the picture. I think they are absolutely adorable. Has a smell on the inside, kind of a new smell but I think it can be left open to air our or will dissipate with time. These look absolutely adorable in my living room and the storage space is ample! I would highly recommend. These look very classy to me!", 
    "Made of hardwood and good quality manufactured wood. Heavy but easy to assemble. Provides good storage space. Color is exactly as pictured. Looks great as an end table despite the hinges on the back of the lid. The only flaw I found. The design is stamped on the wrong side of the hinges so that when assembled you see what looks like the back of the hinge that should have been against the wood, unseen. I called customer service and immediately received replacements, Unfortunately, the replacements had the same problem. My table is placed with the back against a wall so the hinges do not show. Placed where the hinges would be seen, it is unlikely that it would ever be noticed. But I would know, so it loses points. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and proud to add it to my living room decor.", 
    "Excellent Piece - still love it after a few years.", 
    "Good with color, shape and design", 
    "Heavy, thick and high quality. Very satisfied.", 
    "I would actually give this 4.5 stars if I could. Nice looking once assembled, but assembly is cumbersome and takes around an hour. I would have gladly paid extra for a fully assembled unit. The box was quite bulky so I can't imagine there was much saving on the shipping. The hinges were a bit difficult to align and the pilot holes were not deep enough. All said and done, though, I am pleased.", 
    "I was unaware chest was in so many pieces. Hard to put together", 
    "I needed a little help putting it together but it was worth it. Furniture and storage, you can't beat it!", 
    "This end table trunk replaced another trunk end table that had outlived its usefulness...this piece is a nice sized end table, looks great, and was easy to assemble.", 
    "This striking end table/storage chest looks great in my contemporary great room. Very heavy, nice wood, and unusual upscale appearance. Highly recommended. I love the nailhead trim.", 
    "I was very surprised by the beauty and quality of this piece. It is very classy with nice quality.", 
    "Although it had to be put together, my husband did a great job, and I love this piece of furniture. I have it in my study, and although I haven't stored anything inside yet, it would be a great hiding place for keeping little gifts from my granddaughter! It looks really great, and I love the nailhead accents! Also a great value for the price!", 
    "This is not hard to put together, and when complete looks expensive...a real eye catcher. I use it for a bedside table with a daybed, but it would be just as nice in the living room. Beautiful. Inside can store blankets, pillows, games, whatever.", 
    "I wanted something different than the usual occasional table. The nail head harlequin design complements the chairs in the living-room. Easy to assemble and has a good weight to it. Has a Pirates of the Caribbean flair.", 
    "the hinged front piece was the only thing that didn't match up all the way on this prefab- off by a little - not too noticeable when shut. Functionality and style are exactly what they say!", 
    "beautiful piece , color, and great quality", 
    "PLYWOOD AND WOOD CONSTRUCTION", 
    "Looks just like the photo and was an exceptional value.", 
    "It matches the large table perfectly. the inside storage is a plus.", 
    "These End Tables are so attractive and they are made of real wood. I had no problem assembling them, instructions were easy to follow. They are great conversational pieces. I use Wood Milk to clean them.", 
    "I bought this and the coffee table. There is storage in both of them and they look wonderful and more unusual that most.", 
    "Perfect for storage and as a table. Fits both living room and hallways. Very multifunctional.", 
    "we use this as a blankets storage and a night stand. excellent quality.", 
    "we LOVE these 2 tables. Low profile so they do not obstruct the windows and looks great next to our platform bed. Easy to put together but a lot of parts", 
    "easy to assemble - high quality - heavy duty - great piece!!",

    "thought it was solid wood when I purchased but it's not. It's now a year old.. some wear and tear but still looking good. so far two of the brass buttons came off. But I can say they're beautiful and sturdy.", 
    "I brought these to use as bedside tables. They are very versatile. I recently moved them to a rec room and placed them side-by-side to use as a coffee table. I store games in one and small pillows in the other. They are very sturdy and look great!", 
    "Well made. Heavy. Holds lots of stuff. I use it as a side table and keep all of our throws in it. I like it so much that I bought another one for my office. You definitely won't go wrong for the price. Easy to assemble.",

    "Look great as end tables in my living room", 
    "This is a great piece and so nice looking but like several items we've received from Overstock the bottom piece was not cut to fit the rest. It took hours to put together when it became obvious that it just wasn't going to work. We finally got a new bottom piece but it was like pulling teeth from the warehouse. The customer service reps were very attentive and just as frustrated as we were.", 
    "I love the rustic look and the storage it provides :-)...a win win no doubt",

    "I looked, and looked, and looked for a decent looking end table when we recently remodeled our family room. Most furniture stores all have the same, cheap looking stuff. THEN, I found this on Overstock and was drawn to it. I love the styling and added details with the nailheads. It's a bonus that it has storage in it, too!!! My husband found it not too difficult to put together and did not use any wood glue on the dowels as other reviewers commented. It's a beautiful solid piece. Only had it a few weeks so I can't comment on how it will hold up to scratching, etc. It's a good value. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "the instructions were not right. All the parts were not labeled and so while I was putting it together I interchanged the left and right side and after I put the whole thing together I found that I have to go back and undo a lot of work I did. It took me over an hour to put it together alone. Also parts are heavy.But when put together it looks very stylish and rich!", 
    "the look of this table is excellent, and it's also a storage piece but . . . difficult to assemble; the instructions were a bit off as were the pieces; we had to use a drill to make new holes to make it work", 
    "I purchased two of these end table trunks and love them. there is a lot of storage space. easy to assemble and look very nice and quality is good, even better than I thought.", 
    "I had the room decorated in modern-classic with hint of Venetian theme. The piece just fit perfectly.", 
    "The table is gorgeous. A little work to put together but well worth it.", 
    "I can't say enough good things about this table. We bought two and use as night stands because the pattern really complements the tufted headboard. Wood product. Very heavy and sturdy. No particle board anywhere. Great storage. Classic yet offsets our contemporary bedroom. About 30 mins to assemble so be patient. It's worth it.",

    "Nice piece used as a bedside table", 
    "Love it!! Very nice quality and bigger than it looks!",

Would highly recommend.", 
    "Absolutelly love this chest. Using it as an end table and it looks great. Arrived right on time. Packaged well, Instructions are easy to follow except you want another pair of hands helping when putting the sides altogether, to steady everything. Took about an hour to put together and have had a ton of compliments on it;s appearance. Thank you \"O\" for another lovely addition to my home.", 
    "I loved this piece the first time I saw it,know I had to get it.", 
    "This chest is not a quality item for it is made of particle board and veneers, yet I do love the look of it. I think it will help update my home...a well needed venture. It took my husband some time to put it together yet he had no problems. I think it is a great buy for the money.", 
    "Nice size end table for our family room, looks more expensive than it was. The wood top has faded slightly, I did not notice until I moved a lamp that is on it and the wood is darker under the where the lamp sits. But it does the job and looks good in the room.", 
    "Can not put anything in it, because if you put a lamp or anything on top, you can not open it. You have to take everything off first. Its beautiful to look at. But I wish it had a drawer.",

    "I love it! My friend had no problem putting it together. Just as described.", 
    "This is a good looking side chest. It was easy to assemble, I did it without help with just a screwdriver. As long as you support/brace the pieces, you can assemble it solo.. It holds a lot - I keep spare linens in mine. The nailhead trim looks very nice and the color is warm and looked the same as it did on my computer.",

    "was difficult to assemble, could not get bottom attached", 
    "These end table trunks are so attractive. They look like expensive little trunks. The table top is large enough to a hold lamp and leave plenty of room to handle the cocktail or whatever. One of my favorite purchases from Overstock.",

    "Just what we were looking for!! Works great and looks the same!",

    "I love it. It is great quality.",

    "Fabulous! I bought two end tables and the coffee table and they make my living room. The brass hardware on the tables is excellent quality. The wood color perfect and the storage!!! I swap out my pillows and throws as the season changes. Highly recommend!",

    "A really nice piece of furniture. Well made.", 
    "Beautiful.....easy to put together", 
    "VERY pleased with this product. I am removing one star because I cannot stand the smell of the product (smells very chemical-y upon opening box). I am hoping the smell dwindles as time goes on. BUT, I REALLY like this piece. It adds some nice flair to our living room, large enough to comfortably hold a wide based lamp & phone base. Assembly took me ~45min (female, on my own). I recommend using a power screwdriver it will speed the process up a ton. Also, might recommend an extra hand when conjoining all the pieces together as the pieces weighs a good amount. It's honestly one of the sturdiest pieces of furniture I've bought in awhile- I'm very impressed!", 
    "It was easy to put together. Sturdy and very nice looking. Sits beautifully at the end of my couch. Looks just as pictured. Right now it is holding 3 sets of my weights (15 lbs, 20 lbs, and 25lbs, as I work out in the morning, in my living room) so that tells you it is pretty sturdy.", 
    "These are so beautiful and they are not made with cheap looking material. Not hard to assemble except hinges were not indicated to be a particular side so when we tried to install we discovered the side with holes was put on wrong, instructions weren't clear. I left them off. Because i didn't want to take it apart. You will be happy with the purchase", 
    "These night stands hold alot inside and go great next to the metal framed canopy bed I bought.", 
    "I wanted to change my living room style and this worked out great, I also added the trunk that complete the set, although the color was not a true espresso it all blended well.", 
    "actual furniture even better than it shows in the picture - very nice finish!", 
    "Very sturdy. My husband was impressed with the quality of this table when he was putting it together. I have had many wonderful compliments on this trunk table.", 
    "Beautiful, but takes awhile to put it together. The detail is nicer in person. Receives many compliments. Bought two end tables and compliments the living room well. Love the extra storage, but haven't put anything inside yet. You need two people to carry it because it's really heavy or just one man to carry it. Overall, its great item to have.", 
    "We love this trunk - as a bedside table or to tidy up papers in a home office. Recently shopped Overstock to buy a 2nd one and can't find. Will definitely buy another if it becomes available!", 
    "Everyone that sees this comments on how nice it is.",

    "We have enjoyed this piece. Wasn't very hard to put together. Great place to store those seasonal things.My buy another!", 
    "This is a fantastic piece of furniture & the price is great. No one would ever guess it was so inexpensive or even that it needed to be put together. I put it together by myself and the only tricky part was the back hinges - just a little tough to get them lined up right with the pilot holes (which means I probably spent an extra 2-3 min on that part). Well worth the money!", 
    "I have purchased 6 - 12 pieces of assembled furniture of varying qualities. This is the best. It is the most attractive piece by a long shot. The piece is constructed of wood materials with a wood veneer. The metal nail heads and other metal is good quality and attractive. The color is very nice and has a nice wood grain. I do not give 5's easy, but I liked this piece.Concerns: I did not realize how large it is. The dimensions provided were right, but it is bigger than what I perceived. The directions were Ok. Some aspects of the directions were wrong, but I could figure it out as the piece is pretty simple. Use glue on wood dowels. I purchased for about $*** and this review may change if the price was *** or more.", 
    "Went together very easily, initially I was a little disappointed because it looked so much smaller in pieces- together its substantial, study and looks great. The handles and clasp on front are really nice looking too!! Very pleased with purchase", 
    "Very well built piece of furniture looks great in my bedroom u will be very happy with this.", 
    "LOVE IT! Great quality and good color.", 
    "This thing knocks it out of the park. I almost don't want to give a positive review because I don't want anyone else to have the same beautiful and unique end table/trunk as me! Super high quality and just looks amazing in the living room.",

    "The assembly was easy requiring two people and it is a wonderfully looking item.", 
    "easy assembly but pay attention to instructions!..I found the a small electric screwdriver made assembly so much faster!", 
    "I get so many comments on how cool this is. It is the centerpiece of my guest room. It is perfect as an end table and great for storing extra blanket and pillows (or whatever you need storage for). It was a cinch to put together.", 
    "This piece is a show room stopper! However it comes in pieces and it literally took me a long time to build. But when it's done... It's gorgeous. No major tools needed. No man needed :)", 
    "fairly easy to assemble and go with the rest of the d\u00e9cor. like the nail head feature and great for extra storage in an apartment", 
    "It is a very nice piece. Sturdy and fairly easy to pit together.", 
    "Nice end table for the price.Fast delivery.Quite a few steps to put it together.Thank you my son.Lots of storage space.Did have an odor as others have mentioned.I put a piece of bread on a plate with some apple cider vinegar and left it for a few days and that took care of the odor.", 
    "This table is a beautiful addition to our den! It was a bit tough to assemble, however, the end product is great! Very unusual and beautiful!", 
    "Very pleased with this table. It is a great accent piece in my den. The directions for assembly are flawless..... it took me 1.5 hours by myself. I do suggest a cordless screw diver instead of a manual one. Goes much fast. Good purchase.", 
    "Looks good. Hardware could be better quality. Must be assembled.", 
    "Absolutely more beautiful than I thought, had no idea how too put it together... lot's to do in that department, so I ask my neighbor if he would, men love to feel needy anyway :) , going too order another real soon, my plan was to only have something nice too store my blankets in, but now I want to use it in the livingroom for end tables. Definitely a show piece.Great price too.", 
    "Quality table-needed to be assembled with easy instructions. Looks great!", 
    "Love this end table. It's big enough to hold the lamp, tablet and more. I'm very pleased with this purchase", 
    "After visiting numerous furniture dept stores and leaving with disappointment because the end tables were all over priced and not even unique , my fiance rec just checking overstock. I entered in specific info and within 5 min found this gorgeous table. It's great quality , unique and classy. A must buy", 
    "18 year old assembled...it's great", 
    "great little chest, no problems, looks good", 
    "Took a long time to assemble!", 
    "Wonderful end table. Assembly was fairly easy. The only issue is I wish one of the side panels were designs to open as a door would to have more convenient access to store items in the inside. With only the top lid opening, any lamps or decorative items on the top must be removed to have inside access. But again, the product is very beautiful.", 
    "Good value, good looking table. A bit of a hassle to assemble, but I'm very happy with the end result. Looks great in our home theater, makes an excellent end table (we bought two).", 
    "Pretty sturdy, heavy piece of furniture. Lots of assembly required. Essentially the only thing that is already done for you is the nailheads and hardware place holders. Pretty good instruction. Once assembled, it is beautiful.", 
    "Once put together this trunk is large and very sturdy! I did not realize how much it had to be put together but it was worth it. The trunk is very spacious and it is very nice quality. Nothing was damaged and all went together but it took two of us to do it.", 
    "This is a very pretty trunk/table especially for the price. We did however have to do some adjustments to put it together as the holes on one of the panels were drilled incorrectly.", 
    "See my post on the matching coffee table. These end tables are of equal quality and beauty! Assembly is a piece of cake! Very happy customer!", 
    "What a piece of junk, had a hard time assembling and found it was made of compressed particle board. Kept chipping and falling apart. Do NOT buy this product!!!_", 
    "Very happy with this piece. Didn't realize it had to be assembled. Was very easy and the quality is good considering the price. Great storage for throws and pillows.", 
    "The table is very attractive and well made. It is VERY heavy, and although I got most of it together by myself (about 45 minutes), I needed some extra arms to finish up the job. All the pieces were clearly labeled and the diagrams easy to understand. The interior had a varnish type odor, but this disappeared quickly, and we have used it to store throws for our TV room.I did wonder why it stated to the maximum weight was 20 lbs, because it is so heavy, but my husband thought some of the screws/nails were a little flimsy and wouldn't support much weight. Overall, and excellent product for the price.", 
    "We were pleasantly surprised at how beautiful and well made this chest table is", 
    "I read many reviews on this item before purchased it and compared it to others similar products. The only concern I had was a review that said they purchased different hinges. But my son put this together relatively easy and it looks fabulous next to my creme-colored chair.", 
    "It is exactly what I was looking for and cheaper on Overstock than other internet offers.", 
    "I purchased this end table for my son and he loves it. It does take time to assemble. I used wood glue on all the joints, that should give it more strength. Thanks Overstock.", 
    "Nice sturdy end table-- easy to assemble--unique style", 
    "This is a great end table for the price. I love a product that looks good, functions well and is not so expensive that if my style changes and I want to replace it, it is not the end of the world. I have had many compliments on it's style, and it provides a place to hide my books. It is a very good purchase!",

    "I bought two so the trunks for end tables and was very happy with the quality, ease of assembly and the amount of storage space. If you need extra storage these are the answer. I purchased a third one a couple weeks later. Thanks Overstock! db1960", 
    "Love the look of this end table, Its placed in my living room paired with a leather sectional with nail head trim. The ONLY complaint I have are the screws that are used for the handles and hinges are SUPER annoying. They were stripping left and right...the quality could have been better with those annoying screws. Other than the cheap screws, everything else was great! :)", 
    "This is a well made side table with storage. I watched my husband put it together and helped him alittle. I researched the MDF before deciding to purchase and we are very happy with the quality.", 
    "Love this in our living room. Good roomy storage for out of season living room items.Hubby said it was easier to put together than IKEA products. The hardware is good quality and the hinged top stays up when you want it to.", 
    "Very beautiful and stylish trunk for the price. Trunk has room to fit some thin blanks and a couple of small decorative pillows. The quality of the wood is not the greatest but the trunk still looks high end. Overall I recommend the purchase of this furniture piece.", 
    "Difficult to put together but once completed they are beautiful. No one would ever know they were such a bargain!!!!", 
    "Been looking for some end tables to match the style of our living room for quite some time but everything I 'fell in love with' was well over $400 per table at local furniture stores. This table is the perfect style, amazing price, and though not the highest quality materials, you really can't tell. They're heavy, well made, and feel very solid. Hubby assembled them in less than 15 minutes each.", 
    "This cute \"end table\" offers storage for tall vases that won't fit in a buffet. It is small enough to sit beside an overstuffed chair without blocking the walk way. Went together quickly without requiring alot of strength to assemble.", 
    "I love this table/trunk. I order so much from Overstock and am most always 100% very pleased with my purchases so this is another 10 in my book. My husband put together and thought it was quite simple and quite nice as far as quality goes for the pieces he assembled. I ordered not even knowing it was a trunk so you can imagine my surprise. Very pleased and would order it again.", 
    "This end table trunk is very versatile and looks great in any room s an accent piece.", 
    "The only complaint I would give ( we ordered 2 end tables and 1 coffee table) is that the corners arrived with color off them and it looks like they were warn on some of the corners ( all 3 pieces). It was upsetting because other then that they are very nice pieces. I was saddened that they look like we abused the corners when we didn't. Would have gave it an excellent review if not for the poor corners.", 
    "It's a unique piece. Nice to have storage. Easy to assemble.", 
    "I would recommend this Espresso End Table Trunk. It was shipped well, easy to assemble.. The piece is well constructed for an excellent price. It looks great in the TV room. I think you would be very happy with this purchase", 
    "I am so pleased with my purchase of the Upton Home Nailhead Espresso End Table Trunk. No one could pay me to take it back! I love it! I have it sitting by my couch. Inside the trunk, I keep my blanket, pillow, and back massager that I use while I'm sitting on my couch whether I'm praying, talking on the phone, resting, etc., and then when I'm done with these items, I can just place them back inside the trunk. It work perfect for what I bought for. I am so glad I made this purchase. My nephew put it together for me and he didn't have any problems whatsoever. It arrived in good shape. I am one happy camper!!!! Thank you, Overstock!", 
    "Cute table for the price! Took a minute to put it together but not hard.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance and value of my new end table! It arrived in perfect condition and is making a true statement in my living room. This is definitely not a cheap piece of furniture..... It's very well built and is heavy .Don't hesitate in ordering it, you won't be disappointed.", 
    "Ok, so I was not too cool ordering furniture without seeing it, but I bit the bullet and went for it. I must have missed the part where it said \"assembly required\"; so I was a little miffed about that, but oh well. I took my time, making sure all pieces were there and went to work. Everything went pretty good. There was a small issue with some discoloration on one of the handles, and the instructions also neglected to tell you to install one of the side handles. But that is pretty self explanatory; obviously you need to install it. The end table itself had some slight marks here and there, which I am not crazy about, and on one of the panels it looked as though it had split while putting on the nail heads. But it was fixed in the proper manner and sort of blends in and isn't too noticeable. The marks that I can see are not too noticeable, but I know they are there. My biggest bitch was at the very end when I went to attach the hinges to the top and back panel. The screw hole pattern on the back panel where the bottom of the hinge would attach WAS MISSING. Instead of a screw pattern for the hinge, it was a screw pattern was for another handle, which does NOT go on the back of the table. I will have to add screw holes with a small drill, no problem, and I pray to God the wood wont split when I do that. I certainly wont drill all the way through...just enough to get the screw started. But I am very upset that there are small holes on that back panel which SHOULD NOT be there! The holes are not huge mind you, and your guests probably will never see them. It's just knowing they are there after paying this price for a table. I ordered TWO of these tables, as well as the matching coffee table. I am done for today and will write reviews on the other two as I get to them over the next week. The color is very nice though and it looks just like the photo, and it is a sturdy table. The flyer inside states it can hold up to 100 pounds inside and 80 pounds on top. Not sure about that but it will surely hold your throw blankets, magazines, etc. I do love the look, and it goes well in our log home, I was just hoping for perfection, but hey, it's made in China right?", 
    "Assembly is a major and not straightforward task. And so the pieces sit in a corner, after 3 capable family members who have assembled other furniture started assembling it and gave up. Will be a nice-looking table if it's ever put together. Wondering about reviews that rated it \"easy to assemble.\"", 
    "This piece is sturdy, easy to assemble, and great! It is larger than it may seem. I've kept my clothes in it and used it as a seat for over a year and it still is sturdy and like new.", 
    "Very good looking piece of furniture...no one would ever guess what I paid for it. Great place to store winter bed quilts! My friend liked it so much when she saw it we got on my computer and she ordered one!! I highly recommend this product !", 
    "beautiful looks great in my living room easy to assemble have received many many compliments. will pruchase 2 more", 
    "easy to put together. looks very nice has some weight to it and very sturdy. well worth the money and they hold allot in side", 
    "It was just like picture very happy with it love it thanks", 
    "These ended up being really attractive. They did take a lot of time and patience putting them together.I enjoy shopping through Overstock because I can get a full spectrum of the styles of things that I am interested in. Many choices.", 
    "My husband assembled the table. When he stood it up it wobbled like crazy. Since he's an engineer, he brought up his tools and found all four of the legs are different sizes. They vary by 5/32 of an inch, a considerable amount. The body is square and pretty but the uneven legs are a big disappointment. We are either going to have to use washers or take the shortest leg and make the others the same size. Thank God for my husband or I'd be putting match books under it! Ugh!", 
    "I managed to assemble this table/trunk by myself, but still haven't attached the inside latch/lever that allows the top to close slowly on its own - cannot figure out exactly which end of latch attaches to lid, and which attaches to back of table. i emailed the company though, and did receive a reply and a number to call for assistance! Haven't called- I'll get the latch on- will figure it out when I need to. :) This is a very nice looking table - the board in bottom of table only holds up to 20 pounds, so nothing really very heavy can be stored inside trunk, if using trunk for storage. I thought all the nailheads on the furniture would really make it the centerpiece of the room ( and didn't want that) - the table is actually very understated in design, is not \"busy\" -looks great but not overwhelming in the room. This is for the side-table, (can't speak for the coffee-table size trunk which is larger). As I said, I managed to assemble it solo, but help would have been best for me. Electric screwdrivers would also help, I had to enlarge some of the holes with manual screwdriver first before placing certain pieces/bolts/screws. The wood is a darker brown than pictured - actually blends even more closely with other wood colors in our home. You'll probably be quite satisfied with this selection. I am happy with the purchase, love the table.", 
    "Super easy to assemble. I love the quality. Its absolutely beautiful!", 
    "Far better quality that I expected. A bit of a challenge to assemble but it's well worth the effort. You wont be disappointed!", 
    "I bought 2 of these end tables to use with my dark brown leather furniture and couldn't be happier. They are very well made and look expensive. I like having the additional storage . With the top opening up, I am able to store blankets inside. My husband was able to put them together in less then 15 mins., I love ordering from Overstock, as I receive my order in no time.", 
    "one of the best pieces i have bought from you, quality, looks, everything! i absoloutely love it!", 
    "Ordered Monday, arrived Friday - what a surprise! Currently watching my husband assembling end table in our Living Room - seems to be going well, haven't heard any bad words. He is very impressed with the weight - I am impressed with the unique beauty.", 
    "been eyeing this for awhile now for my new house it is just perfect! exactly as pictured easy to assemble, very sturdy. Get it!", 
    "We are using the table as a bedside table in the guetroom it is a beautiful addition to the room and the extra storage is wonderful.The table arrived in perfect condition and was not too difficult to assemble.", 
    "I purchased this end table and the matching chest. Being my first time ordering furniture on-line I was hesitant but went for it after reading these reviews. I am so happy with both items. They are sturdy, good quality and will suit the purpose well. I put both of them together in just over 2 hours by myself with a rechargeable drill. I would recommend using a wall or something to prop up the lids when you are attaching them so they don't fall backwards. Price was right and the look and quality of the items is wonderful! Very happy customer here!!A++ for this product in all categories.", 
    "I bought it for my bedroom but it looked so nice that we are now using it as a coffee table in the living room.", 
    "Absolutely beautiful! I just finished putting this together and it was a breeze! I used a small 6\" drill on all the screws, so it only took me about 30 minutes to assemble. The table is much lovelier than I imagined and the quality is excellent. I had been hemming and hawing about purchasing this table for at least 6 months and I'm so glad I finally did. My only regret...I should have purchased this months ago!", 
    "I have a leather chair and ottoman with the nailhead trim. Since they are such a large scale, most tables I've tried to pair with them for a nice grouping ended up looking cheesy. But this table is the perfect complement. A couple of pictures hanging above the chair and a gorgeous lamp on the table and a couple of accessories make my living room look like a million bucks! It went together pretty easily also and is very sturdy! I'm really impressed with it for the price.", 
    "So as I mentioned before the color is a dark espresso, darker than the picture shows, but that was what I was looking for read other reviews that stated that so went ahead and ordered it. Needs assembly took my husband about 15 minutes, it looks really nice so worth the money, I love it.", 
    "This product is very nice better than expected. Thick wood , great design and hinges are very nice as well. Look of greater value compared to cost. Very satisfied. Although you have to assemble wasn't so bad, Its something I hate doing. Everything marked easy to follow. Just do as they say do and you will be fine. One person can put together as I did, but if a female, two people would be fun.Hinges screw holes marked on wood. They make it easy with pre-drilled holes. I think you will like it as much as I do and I like nice things and this piece work.", 
    "Really a nice looking piece. Very well constructed, true to the color and looks much more expensive than the cost. When you go to put the last piece together, the top, you need two people. Impossible otherwise.", 
    "Excellent quality end table trunk, took about 90 minutes to build. Larger than expected (check measurements before buying) but it works for the room.", 
    "Perfect for the room I bought it for. It isn't cheap looking at all - very classy - I found the exact table on two different online well-known sites and it was much cheaper on Overstock - LOVE Overstock!", 
    "I bought this table for my guest bedroom as a bed side table and it's amazing. First of all, it looks much bigger than it appears, so it works great as a nightstand. Secondly, it really holds quite a bit of stuff, including pillows, books or whatever else you may want to put in it. I like it so much, I might get a second one for my bedroom!", 
    "The table was exactly as shown in the picture. It is stylish and very different looking. It was also easy to assemble. Looks terrific in my english country style living room.", 
    "Perfect for extra storage and the style is great! Took a little time to assemble but after the first one I could have easily assembled a second one in no time.", 
    "lovely storage and end table box but not so easy for one person to put together ... instructions need to be more specific about the screws and assembly. I needed help to assemble the box and once put together was happy and pleased but I ran into assembly problems and prevailed upon a friend to help and another one to put the final closing hinge on the underside of the top - as I could not do it.", 
    "Purchased one, loved it so much that I purchased a second. This is a heavyweight quality piece of furniture. I use it for an end table at either end of my sectional and the the storage is a big plus! Easy to put together, if you follow the instructions.", 
    "good quality tables. I bought the end tables. bought a different coffee table to match other furniture in my living room. I think, money well spent. I seen others, plain ones, but these with the buttons, diamonds studs are more jazzy !!! I SAY RIGHT ON VERY COMPLIMENTERY !!!", 
    "We purchased two tables. The products arrived promptly and in good condition. However the instructions for attaching the base were undecipherable. We damaged one unit while trying to install the latch provided Fortunately we can have the table against the wall so the damage doesn't show. We ended up not using the latch at all. We still look at the latch trying to figure out how to attach it. We will not be using the storage space. The tables are very good looking but we can't recommend them because of the poor instructions.", 
    "We had a hard time putting it together. The table was beautiful but it took quite a bit of time and team work.The directions had some pictures and it was not very helpful. The pictures were poorly drawn.It takes two people to do this job. One has to hold the wood in place while the other one screws the screws.We had to use the electric drill to make things tight.This should not be put together with simple hand tools.", 
    "This thing is huge! Great quality but takes some time to put together.", 
    "Assembly is easy:) The trunk is very sturdy and attractive. Great value!", 
    "I was not expecting the trunk to come completely unassembled. It did take some time to put together. One piece was missing but I phoned the manufacturer and they sent the missing plastic piece promptly. I love the way it looks. It is a beautiful piece of furniture.", 
    "Easy to put together, they look nice with my livingroom furniture. Great value for the price and free shipping on top of that. Happy customer!", 
    "Just as advertised, and just what I wanted. Description was very good; good quality for the price.", 
    "I am not particularly handy and yet I put these together by myself. The color and quality is very luxurious. I get complements on them by everyone who hasn't seen them before. It's great for keeping throw blankets in for when the kids are home from college and lounging with friends. Very happy with these!!!!", 
    "Used as a TV stand at my chair and has storage also. Looks good.", 
    "I love this end table trunk! it is decent quality and will last. very pretty and looks very high end.", 
    "Really neat piece of furniture. It looks high end. It took a while to put together, but I am enjoying the end result. I ordered 2 of these.", 
    "I really like this table and the quality was very good. It has lots of storage room too. One of the nail heads was missing and I contacted the company and they sent one out very quickly. I have had lots of compliments on the table.", 
    "This table is well made and looks great!!! Can't believe the value here!!", 
    "i love this end table ...its so unique..its just the latch is hard to get it but its ok without it", 
    "Very nice table. One area had not been stained but very small and not noticeable.", 
    "I bought this table for my basement and liked it so well decided to keep it for my family room upstairs.Putting it together was a challenge using some kind of hex screw to hold the sides together that I have never seen or used before but after about five hours I figured it out and I can say its never too late to learn.Love the table", 
    "Our order arrived quickly and assembly went very well. One issue we had was the hinge - may be defective - so we did not install it. Should probably contact *** and let them know. The table is of very good quality and is a perfect end table to complete our living room ensemble. We are very happy with it!", 
    "The top broke off while putting it together. There is an interior piece you have to put in to hold the top. I went to put the top back so I could work on it and the piece broke off. Not usable at this point and I was told it was non-returnable. Maybe it could be a toy box????", 
    "I love the rich color of the wood. The metal handles and trunk closure hardware good great. I love the nail heads and the slight taper of the trunk. There is a lot of room for storage inside.", 
    "I like that one piece doesn't exactly match the others while carrying the theme.", 
    "Was A little worried because I had to put it together but it is beautiful and I love it! It's good and heavy to.", 
    "Nailhead Espresso End Table trunk was stylish and good looking. Looks great as bedside table. Quick shipment.", 
    "I was surprised by the quality and heaviness of this product. Great puchase. Looks just like picture.", 
    "This is an exceptional value - high quality and fairly easy to put together. It is a perfect size, and although I haven't used the storage space yet, I plan to. You won't be disappointed with this purchase.", 
    "Love Love Love it....Even nicer than in pics....very stylish...a liitle difficulty with the hinge part but we managed...So many place I want to put it in my house so I might have to buy another one...", 
    "This is very heavy quality furniture piece . I put it together easily.it looks great in living room & is great for storage", 
    "It is good side table but the support hinge is not working. There is a parts replacement form but I didn't have time to mail it so far. So for now I am just using it as side table but not as trunk.", 
    "This piece is well made and very stylish. Matches perfectly with my chairs in the living room. I have to order a replacement part for the hinge piece that keeps the top from going all the way back. Overall, I'm very satisfied.", 
    "Assembled it myself! The only tricky part was trying to get all four sides attached to the bottom of the table while at the same time trying to get the corners (front to side, side to back, back to side, side to front) in place. I used wood glue on all the wood-to-wood areas that connected to each other to make sure that it remained sturdy (and together). Very happy with the purchase and happy that I accomplished the \"build\" all by myself!", 
    "Putting the parts was a challenge but I got help from my father. After it was done, it's very beautiful and looks expensive, and very perfect as a side table. I am very very pleased with this product. The delivery was pretty quick. YOU WONT REGRET BUYING THIS!!!", 
    "Great looking pice of furniture. Easy to assemble. Really classes up the room. Has a very high end look for a very low price.", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product. I shopped several stores and didn't find any table comparable to the style of this table. It was not hard to put together. I am very pleased and would recommend to my friends..", 
    "Received very well packaged. Instructions were easy to understand. Highly recommend to add a stylish look.", 
    "Great product, but quality and assembly is challenging.", 
    "Looks nice, easy to assemble, lots of extra storage for guest linens.", 
    "This was a little difficult for me to put together but then I am a female senior citizen. Once together it was more beautiful than I expected. Be sure to get the measurements as it is larger than I had planned for but fortunately had room for it in another spot. Know you will love this item.", 
    "Love this nightstand. I have an antique bed that has nail heads and this looks like they were made for each other. Nicer than the photo. It is a very nice size. Very nice. Thanks for another great product. Delivery was on time.", 
    "Easy to put together. Love the designer look it adds to a room. Great to have extra storage also. Love the details in the handles, hinges.", 
    "This really is a beautiful table. It was easy to assemble (it took about an hour), the instructions are fairly good and easy to follow.. Although I had a bit of a rough time with the safety hinge on the inside of the table (the predrilled holes seem to be too high on the one I received - making it impossible for the top to close completely), but with a bit of ingenuity and thought, I was able to get it placed correctly). The table is sturdy, heavy and seems very durable. Make note, the color of the wood is not truly 'espresso' - it is more of a warm cappuccino with espresso variations, so if you are looking to match any espresso pieces you already have, it will complement not match exactly. Overall, this is a great purchase. Shipping was fast (I ordered it Sunday and got it Wednesday) and the packing was adequate. There were a few marks in some minor/unnoticeable spots (when assembled) but it doesn't detract from the beauty of the piece. O.co comes through again. Highly recommended!", 
    "Item was just as it appeared, very attractive item. Shipping was fast. Happy with quality and price.", 
    "Very frustrating..did NOT provide a sufficient number of screws to complete assembly", 
    "Love it. Stylish with storage. Easy to put together.", 
    "I am so satisfied with this table. It was just what I was looking for. Thank you very much.", 
    "These table are gorgeous and very well made. They have a large amount of storage on the inside. You won't find a better value! I've already had someone ask if I would consider selling them. The answer was no, of course!", 
    "I HAVE TO SAY WHEN THIS END TABLE ARRIVED I WAS A LITTLE SKIPTICLE. I WASNT THINKING I WOULD HAVE TO PUT IT TOGETHER. I FIGURED HOW STRONG COULD IT BE? MY HUSBAND AND I ARE COMPLETELY AMAZED AT THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT. LOOKS GREAT AND IS TOP QUALITY . NOT A BAD PRICE EITHER!", 
    "I'm not very skilled at putting furniture together but I was able to do this one on my own in about 2 hours minus the inside hinge which I just could not figure out! The instructions leave a lot to be desired, I just left the hinge off and asked my boyfriend to finish the assembly for me later. Overall the trunk looks great. The color is a dark, rich wood color not really an espresso and the nailheads add a nice modern style. The wood is very solid, the piece is heavy and a lot larger than I expected even having laid out the measurements before ordering. It's a good piece of furniture and worth the price. I'm glad I waited for it to come back in stock so I could order. If I had a larger living room I would probably order another so I'd have a matching set of end tables, but for now it works great in the corner.", 
    "Beautiful, classy, chic, expensive-looking and all those other designer words! This trunk/night stand is well built, the lid lifts easily and holds a considerable amount. I originally purchased the plain trunk without the nail head design for my family room. It is absolutely stunning. I like the design so well I am buying this one for my bedroom. It's a great find, super design that is versatile enough to go with almost any design style. Can't the manufacturers enough praise. This is a steal, don't hesitate.", 
    "I absolutely love this end table! I bought two of them. They are so unique. Once put together, you can't even tell that I had to assemble them myself. They look like a nice piece of furniture. Also, The extra storage inside is a bonus!", 
    "I love this table. It is the perfect size for in between two accent chairs. A little difficult to assemble and definitely need two people at some points. A lot of people have commented on it and asked where I bought it. They were amazed that I got it on the internet and assembled it. Really good quality.", 
    "Two nails were missing, having never been attached, but a call to Overstock remedied this. They went the extra mile to send the nails to my son. He and a friend easily put the chests together and later hammered on the two nails. They look great in his living room.", 
    "The trunk looks good. It's a little bigger than I anticipated. The interior is roomy -- a good place to store extra blankets, throws, pillows, etc. Otherwise, it's not very useful storage. Solid wood. Heavy. Easy to assemble. My only complaint would be the hinge. The instructions are not well written, or well illustrated. I'd like to think that I'm a reasonably intelligent person, but I could not for the life of me figure out how to attach the interior hinge. After trying to puzzle it out, and a few false starts, I finally opted to go to my local hardware store and rig up a rustic rope hinge for the top.", 
    "This table matches the coffee table trunk of the same style. Easy assembly for my hubby. I can't wait to see it with my furniture when it all arrives at our new home.", 
    "I love this table/trunk! Couldn't find anything like this in my local furniture stores and for the $$ it is great quality. My 15 year old son put it together for me without any major problems. I would purchase another one if I had a place to put it!!", 
    "very hard to put together the finish is not very good so it scratches and stains easy might need to put a more durable surface on it the look of it is awesome tho", 
    "I love these tables. Not difficult to put together.", 
    "My one complaint is the instructions to put this together. They are only illustrations and 2 of them were not clear at all. I am very good at following these kind of do it yourself put together things but I did have problems with trying to figure out the instructions in the last few steps.", 
    "Looks great, but does not assemble well. No matter what you do, it's loose. We finally superglued one 'foot' so it would stay on.", 
    "Just 6 major pieces to put together, instructions were easy to follow & overall good craftsmanship, value perfect size for the space I had envisioned it in; & the look is so right on. I matches my leather sofa perfectly ! Love It !!", 
    "I got it in a timely fashion and could tell by the weight of the box it was a quality piece.. but as a 50 something year old woman.. putting it together was not easy. Either I wasn't doing something right or some of the holes weren't big enough.. I ended up needed to drill some of the holes despite the fact that you were only supposed to need a screwdriver. Once together (a couple hours later).. I have to admit.. I like the look and the fact that there is plenty of storage for all my music books.", 
    "I love this trunk! What a great value! For the price, I really didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. Forewarning though: you have to completely assemble it yourself. Nothing is done for you and it will take a partner to help get it done. But when you're finished you will know it was worth the effort!", 
    "Gorgeous gorgeous piece! Love it! Completes our living room!", 
    "This is the first time that I have put assembled furniture.....What a great experience to put these tables together, stand back, and really feel good about it. They are beautiful....big....heavy...and functional.They look and feel like they cost so much more than what I paid for them. I am using two as night tables on each side of my bed. Thank you Overstock.", 
    "I ordered two of these little trunks to use side-by-side as a coffee table (without the legs). They arrived in two days and were incredibly well packaged. Nothing broken, nothing missing. They ARE really hard to put together. Lots of tiny little screws. Got blisters from my Dollar Store screwdriver so enlisted help from my neighbor. Power tools make all the difference in the world. They're very rich looking. The color is exactly what I expected. Have received tons of compliments on them and the extra storage is a bonus.", 
    "Very unique and beautiful piece! You definitely need two people to put it together but worth every penny.", 
    "Received much faster than expected. assembly was required but was really easy - no missing parts and easy to follow instructions", 
    "I purchased this trunk/side table to go with my husband's chair & floor lamp It worked out great since I wanted to be able to store pillows & blankets, by not having a lamp on top of it. The quality of the wood & hardware is pretty good, and it took me about an hour to assemble. A power drill was helpful with the small screws that secured the hardware. It's a great addition in our family room.", 
    "The beautiful tables arrived quickly one was damage I called customer service they were so nice and apologetic. My new table arrived in two days I love my tables. The price and quality are too good to be true.", 
    "Excellent product. Strong, beautiful finish. Exactly as described.", 
    "Very pleased with this end table. Looks very expensive & well made. Color is beautiful & rich.Matches the picture exactly. Easy to assemble. Will be purchasing another in the near future!", 
    "I love my tables!! I purchase two of them. The quality was more then I expected for an excellent price.", 
    "I like this item very much ...It fits right in with my decor....It is a trial to put together....but srurdy and attractive once finished.", 
    "This piece is very versitile...functionable and fabulous looking! I have it in a siitting area off the kitchen and I store extra blankets in it...It can be used for so much and looks great! Two of my friends ordered the same trunk.", 
    "This was bigger than I expected! And even this single mom was able to put it together all by herself! Beautiful trunk!!", 
    "This table is very nice, the color was exactly as pictured. It was difficult to put together just follow instructions. cons: Just wished the bottom panel was more sturdier. Otherwise I would recommend this to my friends.", 
    "Hmm, let me see how to start writing the review! The trunk is a cute little piece of furniture. It sits nicely in my little tea room, and blends in well with the two chairs that are there. The finish is clean and the price is right on! However, it's not made of pine wood as stated in the listing description, but of plywood! One thing that leaves me feeling a bit unhappy is that the lid does not sit right on top of the trunk. It's crooked because of misaligned hinge screw holes on the back panel! Assembly is not a BREEZE! putting together this thing took me close to two hours. It needed two people to get the job done and I was alone! Overall, it's a good piece of furniture to have in a small room. The price as I mentioned earlier is great. I gave it 4 stars because of the misaligned lid and the degree of difficulty putting the trunk together.", 
    "Hinge is stuck.. Have to go to Home Depot and purchase one that will work.. Quality is less than expected", 
    "It's actually a nice heavy piece of furniture, attractive design. It went together fairly well, holes lined up. I was able to do it alone. I just hate putting furniture together!", 
    "The table looks great, easy to assemble and exceeded our expectations. I was afraid to order a table on line however,it is true to all the comments! Super cool!!!", 
    "This is a very classy truck!!!! I purchased this piece to go with a chair I purchased on overstock as well.. Both pieces looks good together....Truck is simply stunning and easy to put together....", 
    "This trunk was perfect for our studyroom. The color and the design was great ! Took an hour to fix this trunk. Nicely packed. Looks bigger than shown in the picture.", 
    "Really like the quality and look of this end table. I have tufted long ottoman for a coffee table and wished I would've seen the coffee table that this matched to. Has a very cool look to it and doubles as storage for whatever.", 
    "I couldn,t believe how terrific this looked in the den! So many people asked where did you get it. It looks much more expensive than I paid.", 
    "You have to be handy to put this table together. It was sturdy and just as interesting as the picture. I love it because its a unique piece that serves as our end table.", 
    "Although it's a little big for our purposes, we loved this trunk too much to return it. So we simply took the legs off so we could still use it! It's a sturdy, solid piece that will last us for years. We are very happy with our purchase!", 
    "Love everything about this table! We get many compliments on it. Most of our furniture in the room is walnut and it blends in perfectly. I don't know why it's listed as espresso? I think the color names on the website are confusing--cherry chocolate, espresso, cappuccino, etc. sounds like a restaurant menu. Whatever happened to good old mahogany, oak, cherry, walnut, maple, etc.?", 
    "I wanted a unique piece to add to my living room tables and this table did just that. I put it together myself and it was pretty easy. It is a fun piece but fits into my formal setting. I love it.", 
    "I am redecorating my den and this piece goes perfectly !!!!! I would never have looked at this twice normally but it was \"suggested\" as something I would like by overlook and sure enough. I love it. Well made. Easy to assemble. The hardware is very classy. Two thumbs up on this item.", 
    "These are very substantial end tables. Bigger than expected. Needed the storage they provide When you open my bedroom door they stand out nicely. Provides a very different feel to the space. However the lamps and other accessories ensure they blend in without taking over the space. I think they make a very impressive and classy statement in the space.", 
    "It's a great looking piece of furniture!!! Nice, sleek and expensive looking.", 
    "I love these tables. Solid wood. Great for the price.", 
    "This is a really stylish end table and looks exactly like the online photo. It's a good thing we didn't buy it for the storage because the hinge makes the top sit awkwardly. Without it, the top sits flat. This is a big end table and actually quite heavy. You will also have to assemble it (not my favorite thing to do) but the instructions are pretty easy. I love the look it adds to our formal living room.", 
    "I used to own a small business & I can tell when a company truly has their customer at heart! IT SHOWS HERE! The engineering of the pieces & the exact ease of the fit together was top rate. The piece really looks like a much more expensive table & it is heavy, sturdy & made of real wood. I am impressed with this little company.", 
    "It doesn't fit together tightly, there are gaps in the sides and top that could not be tightened properly but it was relatively easy to put together and it actually looks great. I think once the legs were attached it gives a bit more support. The style is great!", 
    "The table took a while to assemble, but the instructions were good. It's a beautiful piece of furniture and a great value.", 
    "I absolutely LOVE this end table! I purchased the matching coffee table, and they are so great. They match each other perfectly and complement each other so well. They are made of great quality, and I love that the hinges inside on the lift-up tops stay up on their own--such a classy touch! I can't testify to how easy (or difficult) they are to assemble because my husband put them together while I was away on business... he did say they ship in flat boxes, though, so know that everything you see must be assembled. Overall, I'm extremely impressed with how these tables look, and I would expect to pay closer to $*** for the set (rather than the $*** I paid with coupons). Thanks, Overstock!", 
    "people are going to try and take this out of my house!!!!love this, took time to put togeather but I did it myself. very heavy. I will get another one for the other side of couch!!!", 
    "I love this piece. It looks even better than the photo. Very sturdy and not too hard to assemble. The only bad part is that the hardware I received was very bad quality and the parts that you turn to hold in the anchors crumbled and fell apart. I went to Ace and spent less than $2 to replace them with quality parts. I know Overstock would have shipped out new hardware for free, but I was in a hurry. I still give it an excellent rating because it looks awesome!", 
    "Love it! great storage space. Easy to put together, great quality!", 
    "This product is of high quality. I love the elegance of this end table and trunk. I can't stop admiring it.", 
    "This end table is different and elegant. I have nothing but praise for this item.", 
    "This is the first order we've placed and we are very pleased. We bought this end table for our family room and it is exactly what we wanted - very sturdy-looks nice and a little different from our other tables--interesting--and while it coordinates-doesn't look all \"matchy-matchy\". Love the storage too--which we can always use.", 
    "lots of room larger than what I expected. Looks great!", 
    "I loved this item and other stuff that I have bought from overstock. I have never been disappointed with my purchase.", 
    "Great accent table-quite heavy, not flimsy. My husband and I aassembled it, all the pieces were there. Great table for the money.", 
    "Need two people to assemble the piece but it was fairly straightforward. The piece that was to make the top lower slowly was totally unworkable but we didn't feel the need for that apparatus so we ignored it. Table looks great.", 
    "I love the piece it is exactly as pictured and was not too difficult to put together.", 
    "This is a nice sturdy table. Once assembled, it is a classy looking piece. It also has a good amount of storage space. This is a high quality piece and a great deal.", 
    "I was very pleased with the quality of this table and most likely will order the matching trunck. I did start to put it together myself but got my husband involved and it went much better. However I could have done it myself. Looks exactly like the picture and discription.", 
    "Nice looking trunk but I had a difficult time putting it together. Definitely a two person job. The cam locks I originally received were bent & I had to call for new parts. I did receive them pretty fast.", 
    "Looks beautiful!! Great accent piece, you won't be disappointed", 
    "Love the end tables. I purchased two. They are heavy and look just like the pictures. The construction is dark stained pine laminate over MDF and plywood. The hardware is an antiqued burnished brass. Become an O-mail club member and wait for a 10% or more coupon. They send them often! I'm a very \"handy\" lady and found assembly to be easy...took me about 40 minutes per table. Required a Phillips screw driver to attach the handles and camlock screws. The sides go together with camlocks and little wooden dowels. I used wood glue on the dowels for added strength. The feet attach with Allen screws, wrench supplied. The reviews about the lid hinge spring piece being a pain are true. The directions are not clear on which end goes where. After a couple attempts and a broken screw, I gave up and skipped it. There are two regular hinges you can see from the outside (that match the rest of the hardware) so I really didn't care that about an added spring loaded hinge thingy on the inside to keep the top from flopping back. I might decide to put the winter afghans in there which would require two openings per year and think I can manage to hold onto the lid without the help of a pressure spring hinge.", 
    "Sturdy piece good quality and heavy. Nice color. Well worth the price", 
    "This was my first ever purchase on Overstock. I get compliments all the time on it! Heavy. Looks amazing. Not so much fun to assemble but not much different than other some-assembly-required furniture. Heads up: the hardware that is used to put it together is cheap and actually bent, and if I recall, there may have been a little bit of swearing from the husband. I would buy this again. But one is enough because it is a stand-out piece.", 
    "This is a show stopping accent. Always getting compliments. And perfect for stashing extra pillow and throws", 
    "I have been looking at this table for awhile and decided to buy it. The table is beautiful. Looks exactly like picture and very easy to assemble. Liked it so much I bought another", 
    "It was not hard to put together, but it was a little time consuming and tricky. I did it by myself with a power drill for the screws (which there are a lot of) and it took me about 45 minutes. Of course, I'm not a rusher and I do read instruction a couple times before following them. Once it was assembled I stood back and said Wow. The nailhead design makes this piece pop, without it, its just a square. I love the storage room inside this little jewel, because clutter and me do not get along.", 
    "I'm so pleased with the table. My home has the old world feel to it and the piece fits right in. I love the way the table is beautiful from any view. The nail heads and hinges go completely the table. Make sure yo ave one of the electric type screw drivers...makes it much aster to assemble. Very easy assembly.", 
    "Wonderful accent table. Could use by couches, chairs whatever. I wouldn't use it for storage as the lid is pretty big.", 
    "this trunk arrived with no feet but I contact overstock and they quickly sent me some. It went together easily and looks really good for the price.", 
    "perfect for end table or night stand nailhead decor adds to its 'classiness'", 
    "the truck tables are good for storage, I love them and the look good", 
    "This item is very heavy, sturdy. It took me 1.5 hours to assemble. It was quite a puzzle, though, yet rather unique how the pieces all fit together. The instructions were clear but the pictures were not. There was a measure of guessing involved. Reminds me of something from Bombay Company. I am very pleased and feel it was worth the money.", 
    "beautiful side table, not at all a lower quality product. very happy with the trunk. putting it together was not very easy. would definitely recommend it.", 
    "It is a nice end able if you are looking for some asian style decor. I love it. The storage is very useful.", 
    "Love this table. Bought one as side table for chair and loved the way they looked, ordered another and put them at the ends of couch. There were no instructions with first table, and I would have never gotten it assembled if it were not for my husband. Gave them a four star because of lack of directions.", 
    "Love them they look and complete the look I was wanting. Nice to have the extra storage.", 
    "The table is nice and looks great in my living room. It took a while to put it together and we really had to make the pieces fit together without any large gaps. Once we worked out the \"kinks\" it all came together nicely. It is a unique piece and seems to be made well.", 
    "I bought two of these tables and although putting them together is not fun and time consuming, they are great. They are heavy and the details are what make it appear expensive, though they are not. I am using these as a bedside table and they look fantastic. I recommend these.", 
    "Liked this chest very much. Solid construction, nice soft close top. I use as side table. Need power tools to construct, but fairly easy to put together.", 
    "Very nice trunk added a touch of class to the room.", 
    "its a cool style. love the way it looks in my living room. bought the whole matching set.", 
    "the table was great and easy to put togeather looks great in our living room.", 
    "Lovely end table, just the right height for my arm chair and you can even store things inside. Easy to put together. Overstock rocks.", 
    "The only thing about this product was my hubby had to assemble it. He was happy with the quality and construction on the tables.", 
    "Love these so much. They're rich and elegant. We use them as end tables in our media room with lamps on top, so really won't take advantage of the storage feature. They were a little cumbersome to assemble. You have to figure out that the screws don't need to be screwed in very far, because the round screws need to \"catch\" onto them.", 
    "Easy to assemble and look great with our other pieces.", 
    "I'm pretty particular when it comes to furniture pieces, but this is really a neat piece of furniture. Looks great, easy to assemble and been thinking of getting another one before thy're all gone. If your in doubt, fon't be!!! You'll love it!", 
    "This table trunk was the perfect compliment to my furniture. By following the directions, it was very easy to assemble. It also turns out to be the perfect place to store my couch blankets that I do not want displayed all the time and only want to use when I want to wrap up and read a book or watch TV. I would recommend this trunk to anyone.", 
    "I bought two to use as nightstands for my bedroom. They add nice touch to my bedroom. A lot of storage also is cool addidtion. I also wanted to share that if you buy a matching lock, you can even protect your belongings from eye of a stranger if they happen to be in your house, and also will look decorative. Very nice furniture! Solid, sturdy, the studs look awesome. It took me about an hour to assemble each, but I am a female without much experience of assembling furniture, so it was ok. very happy with the purchase. I am definately becomming regular customer of overstock.com!", 
    "Definitely the nicest piece of furniture I've ever gotten through Overstock. Great value. My only complaint is that it had to be assembled and there were so many screws. I actually had to purchase an electric screwdriver to tackle the challenge. With that said, I'm still glad I bought it. It looks live a very expensive piece of furniture and it only cost me $.", 
    "I bought 2 of the trunks to use as side tables in the living room. Pretty easy to assemble and arrived in great condition for boxes that are quite heavy. The trunks were bigger than I thought, taller than expected with the legs attached but a good size if you are planning to store goods inside. Very happy with the purchase overall, good solid quality wood and they look great!", 
    "This is a good little piece for the $$. It was easy to put together and appears to be very solid.", 
    "This is a very nice and heavy table. It was easy to assemble - with the exception of the inside safety bracket that insures you don't over open the lid. I couldn't figure out how that went on but it's not necessary if you don't open and close the lid very much which I won't since it's primary use will be for a table. I only ordered one because I wasn't sure how nice it would be but I really liked it so I have ordered another one to match!", 
    "These were bigger than I expected but so glad I was off on that. They are easy to assemble. I did it fairly quickly with the exception the back (very last) pre-drilled holes did not align with the hardware. Other than that its a snap to put together. Good quality. All the studs are perfectly aligned. The color is a beautiful brown just as shown in the pic. I ordered two. Very glad that I did. I love O.com.", 
    "Very nice piece of furniture - good quality, very sturdy and is a beautiful piece of furniture. Plenty of storage for blankets, etc. Ordered on Sunday, had it by Thursday. Was a great deal and I love it.", 
    "was fairly easy to assemble and look much more expensive than they were. I am drlighted with them", 
    "You could never find this in a furniture store, anything remotely similar would be in the 250, 300 dollar range. Take your time and follow directions on assembly which is not difficult as long as you pay attention. You will need a extra pair of hands with one step where you are trying to hold all four sides and the bottom together and install screws at the same time. Other than that, it is a breeze and you will be rewarded with a great looking piece of furniture. I did not install the latch on the inside of the lid as we will not be using for storage but as a end table with a lamp and a couple do-dads on top. We will not be opening it up and even if we did, just watch and not let it slam. This trunk/table looks fantastic and is very unique as a accent piece. My wife and I made a good choice.", 
    "Did not take much time to assemble, once you figure out the directions. It looks great put together and looks/feels like a much more expensive item.", 
    "Very sturdy and well constructed piece! It's so beautiful and looks way more expensive than the price I paid! Inside storage was bigger that I anticipated, which was a good thing!", 
    "Very happy with this table/trunk. Very nice quality.", 
    "This match perfect with my nailhead tan sofa set in my living room. I'm glad I got these I waited because they do sell out.", 
    "This is a beautiful table that I bought for my husband's home office. It is nestled between two brown leather chairs. The style and color are perfect! My husband is now able to meet clients in style.", 
    "This piece works great as an end table. It's beautiful and as a bonus is a great place to store blankets to cozy up with on cold nights!", 
    "Loved the product, I ordered two coffee tables but was only able to use one and had no problem returning the second one. The coffee table has a masculine feel to it so I put it in my husbands cave he loves it.", 
    "I have been shopping with OverStock for over a year and all of my orders have come promptly and been exactly what I was expecting.", 
    "I would recommend going to the hardware store and getting better screws.", 
    "This trunk was so much more than I imagined. The picture does not do it justice. Easy to assemble. A very high quality piece of furniture worth more than the price I paid.", 
    "I ordered two of these and they really jazz up my family room. I have received many nice comments from people on how nice they are!!", 
    "disappointed only with the fact I had to build the whole thing myself! i would understand some assembly but this was too much especially for the cost", 
    "I am very happy with this purchase. It was fairly easy to put together, however, use an actual screwdriver- not the one sent in package. Every piece was clearly labeled with very easy to understand directions. My only complaint is that the lid doesn't match up perfectly, but it is close enough that I didn't feel the need to take it off and do it again. I am sure with a little tweaking I could get it aligned if it bothers me. The color is exactly as pictured. I am also very happy with the amount of space inside. I have three blankets in there and could fit another one in there. Overall it was exactly what I was looking for and exactly what it was advertised to be.", 
    "Pretty easy to put together but definately need to people when it comes to putting the sides on. Absolutely love, love, love the storage!!", 
    "I love everything about this table trunk! It is very stylish and different. I am redoing my teenage daughter's room to a \"lounge theme\" I bought this to put next to her bed. She loves it!!!! The only bad thing I can think of is...that you have to assemble it. But other than that it is a 10 hands down!", 
    "This table was great. It was easier to put together than I had planned and looks great in the room.", 
    "I was very pleased with the Truck. It looks great once it's put together. For someone with no mechanical skill you have to have someone do it for you. I did!", 
    "The least little bump or scrape will damage these tables. They are not built for everyday wear and tear. Lovely tables, though, for the money.", 
    "Excellent trunk table.Lots of storage so if you have less space in the house , a perfect table for you.Can put your extra blankets.Thankyou overstock As Always", 
    "This piece is wonderful! I purhcased this with the intention of using it as an end table in my livingroom. However, I had an unfinished guest bedroom and wound up using it as a night stand and it looks amazing! I love it so much, I will be ordering another one! The quality is excellent and the storage space is really great! I recommend this product highly!", 
    "This piece is amazing the color is great the pins are darker which is even better it looks even more high end than the picture great for storing bedding blankets it is vey sturdy very solid again very happy with my purchase instructions were not complete but i have a very handy friend who put it together for me i have the seen the same item on other websites and it is aroung $$ more overock has the best price for this one i guaratee it love it love it even my husband loves it and he always gave me trouble for ordering furniture online great wraping too", 
    "Love this end table. Looks great with my other furniture and looks more expensive than it cost. This table is functional too. There is quite a bit of storage room inside of it.", 
    "Once assembled trunk looks great. Color is warm and nailheads and other hardware not brassy and cheap looking. Uses it as center table in living room. Loves that it also functions as storage.", 
    "I really like this table. I like the color which was as described and I like that it is a storage table. The table looks lovely next to my couch. I wasn't prepared for so many pieces that go into putting it together but as a female DIY wantabe I did it all myself. It took me awhile but I love the result.", 
    "Assembly was fairly easy, once the table was put together it looked really great! Love the nailhead decorations really makes the table!", 
    "All it takes is team effort and this table can be assembled in no time! It is a great piece for the price; I am very satisfied with the look and feel of the table next to my distressed leather **** couch. It looks great.", 
    "Very happy with my new nailhead trunk. Demensions are accurate, color is somewhat darker than picture but 100% espresso. Easy to assemble. Wish they had more matching items.", 
    "I was dissappointed that the trunks would have to be assembled. As I opened the box, I noticed there was damage from shipping. Because they were particle board, I did not want to exchange them. They looked great in the picture, but the quality was not good at all.", 
    "Not the best piece of furniture you will ever buy but a decent piece for the money. It does require assembly but not very difficult or time consuming. Biggest complaint would be the thin base for the bottom.", 
    "Bought it for my 10 year old daughter's room as a side table. She stores her books that she reads at night, has a lamp on it and the lid closing in slow motion is perfect and give me peace of mind. Looks elegant and unique.", 
    "I got my table yesterday and it is just beautiful. I love the rich, opulent color. It matches perfectly with the color of the rest of my furniture in my family room. I only have one \"negative\" if you can even call it it that. I just wish the table could have been at least 1.5 to 2 inches higher. Besides that it was very easy to assemble - no hubby needed. I know I will get years of use and enjoyment from it. No more stuffing my blanket behind the couch. I now have a fashionable, beautiful piece of furniture to store it in. I absolutley love my piece. Thanks O.Co for your great pieces and the most affordable prices.", 
    "Item looks great in our family room. We went to several furniture stores and outlets trying to find something like this but could not. Other items seemed inferior or were about 50% more costly. We are very happy with our purchase.", 
    "This is a great product. It looks very classy when put together. Installation was fairly easy, if you are reasonable handy at putting stuff together. It took me about 15-20 minutes to put each of these side tables together. I purchased 2 of them. They arrived in perfect condition. They are dark brown/walnutty in color - the brass fittings are very dull, worn out gold color so it blends very nicely with the wood, giving it an expensive and class look. You can't go wrong with this purchase. Go for it!", 
    "This is a really pretty table that I open and close infrequently. I store the lap robe blankets for winter couch use in it. It is attractive, but not the strongest kid on the block. I am considering re-assembling it, adding carpenters' glue to the holes and long sides, as the \"tap in\" method will work, but isn't strong enough to move it around without pulling apart. One of the hinges was defective, and the company immediately and cheerfully sent me a whole new assembly. I would buy this again, as well as any other product from this manufacturer.", 
    "Bought this for a gift....easy to assemble and very attractive. Good end table for cramped spaces and looks more expensive than it costs.", 
    "They are beautitful. I love them. Only gave them 4 stars though because the finish has worn a little on the edges after minimal wear. Also, one of the nailheads has popped off.", 
    "This table was a little bit difficult to put together, but I was so worth it. It is made of quality material and looks so good between the two chairs that I previously bought. I would recommend this table to anyone.", 
    "great product. looks as good as it does online. assembly is pretty easy too-just wish I didn't have to do that part. :) thx", 
    "This piece has a more 'quality' appearance in person than it does in the pictures. The nailheads are a tasteful antique gold (I was concerned that overstock's definition of 'antique' and mine weren't the same...that the nailhead would be a brighter gold) and the wood stain is more of a mahogany than the walnut exhibited in the pictures. I know the description says that the stain is espresso, but I tend to think of espresso as a near-black stain...and the color of this piece in no way qualifies as that. It's a dark brown stain with a red hue and blends right in with my other mahogany-stained living room furniture. I was hesitant to purchase this because my other end tables (and former coffee table that has since been replaced with an ottoman) are in the Queen Anne style and I didn't know if the trunk table would be a good companion piece. Instead, I think it works well as an accent piece *because* it is different (distinguished by the nailheads, I think)... and the similar stain color adds a bit of continuity, making it the restrained nonconformist in my living room. :)", 
    "This table is beautiful and matches my couch and recliner to a tee, your website is best and your shipping is excellent, if I ever need anything and can get it from the web, your site will be the first that I check . Thank you so much for having such good products.", 
    "Exellent table. Looks like alot more money . Numerous favorablr comments. Thanks! HYBO", 
    "My crafty husband had it put together within an hour. It is bigger than I expected. Very unusual. Fits perfectly in my guest room.", 
    "Love this end table! Looks wonderful in our home. The only draw back to this item is you do have to assemble it. The directions are clear and labled. All the items needed are there to put it together. It does take time to assemble. The look is worth it and its fun the way they have it so easy to put together. I didnt realize I had to put it all together...but if I can do it, anyone can!", 
    "Trunk is somewhat time consuming to assemble. Noted small chip in the veneer on one corner just before completing assembly but can't be bothered to send it back. For the price, it is a solid piece of furniture. I'm using it as a night table.", 
    "This piece is absolutely fabulous. It is much larger than I expected. I was worried that it would be too small. It is a really rich dark brown. The hardware and nailheads are just beautiful. This is a really expensive looking piece. Easy to assemble-takes only minutes if you have one of those power screwdrivers. I purchased this for my great room to hold books and throws. It could easily hold a lamp but I have chosen to let it stand on its own. It blends beautifully with the nailhead trim on my sofa.", 
    "2nd one is easier, good quality, quick shipment, very pleased with items.", 
    "I love absolutely love this item! It's somewhat easy to put together and it's really sturdy. It looks great in my living room - perfect size!", 
    "These are great. Be patient while putting them together. Color is solid walnut brown. In the picture it looks like light may be showing on them??? Anyway...buy them- they are great for the money", 
    "This endtable is so adorable and so affordable! It took 30 to 40 minutes to put together, looks high quality (and actually is high quality for a self-assembled piece of furniture), has far more storage capabilities than it looks like it has in the picture (seemed a little smaller to me in the picture than it's actual size), and really adds a touch of class to any room. Overstock did such a great job getting it to me quickly. I probably received it within 4 or 5 days of ordering it. I highly recommend this site.", 
    "This is my 2nd purchase through Overstock. I'm very pleased with both items. The beds I ordered didn't have all the hardware included, but my handy hubby was able to use other hardware to make them work. These end tables are exactly as pictured. I love them! I would have preferred pre-assembled, but what can you expect for the price?", 
    "Absolutely beautiful...high quality, heavy wood, easy to assemble. Unique piece of furniture you would never find at a furniture store and never get anything like it for the price! Buy it, buy it, buy it!!!", 
    "Being a single women, putting it together was a bit hard for me, takes some common sense to figure out some of the fittings,that being said,I DID IT. I'm happy with the outcome and the table is extreamly good looking...Thanks Overstock", 
    "Looks nice, good quality and price. Just don't like putting things together. : )", 
    "We purchased 2 of these and they took about 1 hr for both to put together (relatively easy) The second one went much faster than the first. It is easier with 2 people working on this but one person can do it with the assistance of a power screw driver. This product is sturdy once put together, and is pressed wood with a pine veneer. these match our couches perfectly.. A few very minor imperfections on the inside.", 
    "Loved the end tables.... very solid, and easy to assemble with help to hold pcs in place. Great buy!", 
    "This product looks exactly as pictured. It is as sturdy as you would hope. The storage potential is fabulous! We had one damaged nail head and the replacement part arrived in just five days.", 
    "Ordered two tables for my livingroom and they were very easy to assemble by myself and a screwdriver. They look expensive and make a unique and bold statement. LOVE THEM!", 
    "We are very happy with the Nailhead Espresso End Table Trunk. It was relatively easy to construct (I say this because my husband put it together with very few expelatives) and it looks \"just right\" in my living room. It was what I was looking for, just an accent piece. Thanks, mpuccini.", 
    "The product arrived ontime with perfect instructions and workmanship. It went together quickly and looks great. Highly recommended.", 
    "When the box arrived I was skeptical - however it was quick and easy to assemble and the finished product was a genuine wood, heavy, high quailty, beautiful piece of furniture. I LOVE it. You wont be disappointed with the rich color and substancial feel of this table. Thanks again Overstock for another great product.", 
    "We bought this for our study room. It is such a nice contrast to blue walls in our office. Highly recommended.", 
    "I have never ordered furniture from Overstock before. I am glad I ordered this piece. It is a nice compliment to my chaise lounges in my sitting room. It was simple to assemble and was very sturdy once all hinges were attached. I am a single woman and had no problem with assembly by myself. I wish I had assembled it upstairs in the room it was purchased for. It was quite heavy!! Overall I could not be happier with this end table.", 
    "I am happy with the table, the price and the assembly. It will go in my family room next to a sleep sofa. I especially like the ample storage for blankets and a pillow.", 
    "Received on time and is not compilcated to assemble, I am very pleased with the order and ordered coffe table too.", 
    "This table has tons of style. Looks perfect between two club chairs in my living room. Was a bit tricky to put together by myself, could have used an extra set of hands, but I managed. The table is very heavy and solid. Mine arrived securely packaged and there were no scratches or damage. I am very pleased.", 
    "This end table trunk adds style and function to any room,especially to my design clients. They have been extremely pleased.", 
    "We're really happy with the appearance and quality of the tables. We were a little surprised that they came unassembled! After assembly we are very satisfied with our purchase.", 
    "We love this table! The quality is superb and the table is absolutely beautiful!", 
    "I really liked this table. I mainly bought it because it would store the throws we all use when we watch TV in the winter. It also makes a very nice looking end table. The assembly took a little longer than I thought it should have and at times it was hard to hold everything and put the screws in by myself. But all in all I would recommend it to a friend and may consider purchasing another one myself. I was pleased with the quality and workmanship.", 
    "This table is so beautiful and rich looking. The quality is outstanding, and the color is really great. Love the copper bullets that are on the outside of the table, it makes this unique and not something you see everyday. My husband loves it as well and likes the fact that you can store things inside. He did the assembly and said it was a little time consuming, but otherwise a great buy!Thanks Overstock!", 
    "great overall product there was a few missing screws but overall great product.", 
    "The chest arrived promptly as promised. While it took a little effort to assemble the hinged top it was certainly worth the effort. The table is beautiful and the nail head detail is far prettier than the illustration. Great job OVERSTOCK!", 
    "I purchased two of these tables and they are absolutely beautiful. They arrived very well packed, without any scratches. The color is richer than it shows in the picture and they are a little taller than I expected, but I am very happy with the ample storage room they provide. The tables look absolutely amazing in our living room. You would be very pleased with this purchase!.", 
    "I saw this item & new I had to have it looked better in my home than on the website,very easy to assemble & excellent qualityl .I have purchesed several items from all catagories & never been dissapointed,I find the customer service & quality of you products excellent,i have recomended your site to several of my friendsThanksR. Evans", 
    "This is a WONDERFUL piece to add to your home. The quality is truly top notch. You will not suffer from buyers remorse if you purchase this piece of furniture.", 
    "I wanted these for bedside tables - useless. They are too large for the purpose, and the fact that you have to remove the lamp and alarm clock to open them makes them highly decorative and extremely impractical. Expensive waste of money - but that was partly my fault since they do look exactly as the pictures. Did better shopping at Costco for end tables.", 
    "I purchased 2 of these tables months ago to complete my greatroom. My leather couch and loveseat are trimmed w/ the metal nails. One would think they came as a full match."
