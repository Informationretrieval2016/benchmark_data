    "Sadly, though it was packaged extremely well it arrived damaged. The carrier clearly ran into the carton with something and broke the mirror in one door. It is beautiful though and OS is working to get a replacement mirror. It looks exactly like the online image. I hope to put it in my bath for storage. :)", 
    "The quLity of the piece is outstanding. It fit perfect in our entryway. The colors are true to the picture on the site. The knobs are a great accent."
