    "The color and fabric were as I hoped for. The workmanship was not good. The cording was uneven around the arms of the chair. The sides were a bit puckered along the sides. I would return It if it wasn't such a hassle.", 
    "Nice quality and color was exactly what I envisioned.", 
    "Packaged poorly. Construction shabby. Had several areas where the interior was pushing the fabric out. Leg insertion point was nothing more than ridiculous.", 
    "Chair was easy to assemble but very uncomfortable seat is hard on edges Material is not smooth buckled in arms back and seat.", 
    "color was perfect, items exactly as described, great customer service", 
    "not comfortable. Seat of chair is hard", 
    "average comfort not a daily sitting chair....legs need tightening if daily use"
