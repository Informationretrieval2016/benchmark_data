    "My home office does not have a closet, so this combination of shelves and a filing cabinet was exactly what I needed. It immediately helped me get organized and my office looks much better with it. Assembly was easy and it looks like a nice solid piece. My only complaints/disappointments: it is smaller than I expected. I thought it would be a few inches taller and a little deeper. Just make sure you review the dimensions and get out your tape measure before buying and you can prevent that misunderstanding. Here's the bigger problem. The file drawers are built for the files to go long-ways instead of horizontal. In other words, when you open the drawer, they are not going left to right where you can read the file tab names - they go front to back. Also, the drawers do not pull out far enough for a standard size piece of paper or folder to be inserted or pulled out. You have to maneuver it out with a temporary bend. If the drawers were stuffed full, this would become very difficult. This also makes reading the file labels/tabs difficult. I actually hung all my files before inserting the drawers...much easier that way. Generally, I expected the file cabinets to be wider and offer more storage and easier accessibility. In conclusion, if you are going to be in and out of the filing cabinet a lot, this is not be the best bet. If it is primarily for storage and organization, then this is still a good option.", 
    "File drawers do not glide very well. Unit looks nice and offers good storage. I put it together ALL by myself in less than 3 hours. Fits my needs for home office perfectly.", 
    "The draws are not functional, they don't extend enough.", 
    "PROS: The quality of the packaging was great. The instructions were almost great, but if you are familiar with flat-pack furniture, you will be able to get through it with no problems within a couple hours. All the pieces and hardware were there. The unit is solid and sturdy and the color was accurate (I bought the Espresso version). CONS: The unit was smaller than I expected, but that's because I'm a bad judge of measurements. There wasn't enough glue in the tube to glue all the dowels, even when using just a drop for each dowel. My only real complain is in the adjustable shelving. The unit was designed for six storage areas. If you are like me and want to use it for books, there are no drilled holes to mount the shelves in the middle to create four equal storage areas. If you are handy (and very careful), you might want to drill extra holes prior to assembling the unit to ensure you can place the shelves where you desire.", 
    "Looks nice when put together. Easy to assemble. Quick delivery", 
    "This cabinet fit perfectly in my home office. Very nice style.", 
    "I knew the dimensions prior to ordering, but was still surprised at how small the piece was. I was also shipped the wrong piece of furniture so that didn't help with the rating of this product.", 
    "Exactly like the picture. easy to assemble.", 
    "Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the drawers don't come out far enough rendering them fairly useless, can't a get file in and out easily. The slim fit of the whole unit though makes it a perfect fit for the office, home or otherwise.", 
    "This was somewhat of a pain to assemble but the final product looks great. One complaint, it's difficult to get folders in and out of the middle sections, because the drawers don't come out far enough. Fine for occasional use - might want to rethink for everyday use.", 
    "It is a pretty piece of furniture, especially for the price. Some of the pieces fit funny and it is hard to get papers in and out of the file drawers. Overall I do like it though.", 
    "A little challenging to assemble, but gives perfect home office storage.", 
    "It is wonderful. It suits my filing needs and looks good displaying pictures and knickknacks.", 
    "I shouldn't have to read all the other customer reviews, or buy the product, get it delivered, and assemble it, to figure out that the FILE cabinet DOESN'T hold FILES. You can't market a product as a file cabinet if the one thing it doesn't do is fit standard files. Let's face it, it's a desk with drawers and shelves. Call it a storage desk, an office cabinet, a shelving unit, whatever. File cabinet, it is not. I don't care if it's pretty, I wanted a FILE cabinet.", 
    "I ordered two of these cabinets, and they were just what I needed. My only complaint is that the drawers are not deep enough to pull hanging files out of the drawer ... I must actually remove the entire drawer from the cabinet to take anything out of the files.", 
    "Ordered this piece for my office, as a copy station. Color is beautiful, and quality is very good. Easy to put together, however a bit smaller than expected. Will work well in our office anyway. Happy with it.", 
    "It is just as pictured & matches our other office furniture perfectly. Other reviews complained about the actual filing cabinet functionality, which I have to agree on. The table looks great but does not function very well. I think someone was sleeping on the job when they designed that part. In order to take out folders you sometimes have to remove the whole drawer, if not you have to bend and twist and hope your files don't fall out all over the place. It does hang letter sized folders which is great, but they should have had a little bit of spacing in the back for ease of use. That is my only complaint though and the reason for my 4 stars.", 
    "I guess I didn't do my research, but it claims the drawers are for files. But they only fit SIDEWAYS, and the drawers don't pull out all the way to fit them in. BAD DESIGN.", 
    "Its a great cabinet. I thought it would be bigger, but I am still happy with the size of it. I did notice that files are loaded the opposite direction as someone mentioned in a previous review but I can live with it. It will take some getting used too though. Its a great purchase for my small home office and it doesn't make the room look cluttered. I put the cabinet together by myself. It took about three hours altogether. the styrofoam was horrendous! ugh!! that was separate time allotted for cleaning. All in all its a good purchase.", 
    "Great piece of furniture! Assembly was fairly easy (especially if you own a power drill) and quick (a couple of hours by myself). This piece is attractive and sturdy. The file cabinet drawers looked small to me but turned out to hold quite a bit. I think one panel had a small nick but it was on the inside anyway. The Styrofoam packaging, however, makes a god-awful mess and is really very frustrating.", 
    "This was our first experience putting together \"flat box furniture\" It was a fun project - it went together perfectly and it was just what we wanted! There were no problems at all. It's so much better than waiting for months when ordering furniture at a store or paying twice as much for something that you could order online and put some time into putting it together. Well worth it! The wood is good quality and the knobs are great quality. We found that they shipped extras of the nuts and bolts and nails. We highly recommend it!", 
    "Was easy to put together, if you read the instructions. Was very pleased with the quality for the price . And, was thrilled it fit the purpose we needed it for."
