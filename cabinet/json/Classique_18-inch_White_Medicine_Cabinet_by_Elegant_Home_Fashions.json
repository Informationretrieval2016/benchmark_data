    "Finished product exactly as described. Two complaints, however. The product arrived in a box large enough to hold the assembled product (which got my hopes up) and opening it up to find it needed assembly was a bit disappointing. It would be great if the required assembly were included in the product description. Assembly was rather simple (~30 minutes) and the assembled product feels very sturdy. The second issue is that the template provided for drilling the holes for mounting was off by a full inch. Luckily I held the template up to the holes in the cabinet to check before drilling. I recommend you do the same. Overall, though, a very nice product. I would purchase again.", 
    "My bathroom is pretty small so this petite cabinet fits perfectly. I can understand the discontent of others with larger bathrooms as the mirror is squared, not rectangular. All I have to say is, take better planning steps and measurements and visualize each product you buy!! My only problem was that the holes for the screws that hang the cabinet up were in an awkward area, so was hard to put up. The assembling part was VERY easy however, because of the awkward angling, two people were needed (one to hold it up and one to drill). Lastly, I put my own spin on it and added two extra screws behind the divider since the backing is a bit thin and the first two holes were way up top. This is an inexpensive product, so work with what you got! Overall, I am pleased with this product!", 
    "Three years ago we bought this medicine cabinet and loved it so much we decided to use it again in another home renovation we are working on. We are very disappointed that they have changed some of the materials since that time. This cabinet has a two part cardboard back while the older version had a nice pressed board solid back. Also several of the pieces broke while assembling it. Unfortunately this is an inferior product at the same price.", 
    "We ordered this and the corner floor cabinet. That went together easily, but this has taken the better part of 4 hours to assemble and it is a bit more challenging. It also looks terrific, but be prepared to set aside some time.", 
    "pieces have too much leverage so they get too loose, you\u00b4ll need some glue", 
    "Nice cabinet especially for the price but it came in 412 pieces (not really that many just seemed like it) and took me about 1.5 hours to assemble it. No problems in the process and all parts were in the box - no suprises. Cabinet looks nice and is a great fit for a small hall bath like ours. Good buy for a nice cabinet.", 
    "Nice piece. Assembly was super easy - and so was mounting it to my wall. WISH it had two shelves and WISH it was bigger, but that is not a fault of the product. Very sturdy and appears to be a solid piece. Mirror is nice too. Magnet for \"clicking-close\" of the door is VERY durable and strong. Latch is also solid, not plastic.", 
    "We bought this for our bathroom, because the size worked and I like the design. It was simple to put together and all the pieces fit. The materials are poor, the screws striped. I painted it, otherwise the finish looks real cheap too. I still like it and its serves it purpose, I just wish it was made of better materials.", 
    "Poor quality, sub-standard hardware. pre-drilled holes don't line up very well. Once together the fit is below par.", 
    "Input it together and could not get the joints tight enough for it to be square. Might take it apart and use glue when reassembling to see if that helps. It's made really cheaply.", 
    "Low in price, but still not worth the money. Look elsewhere.", 
    "I would recommend to a friend with some caveats. On the one hand, the quality of the materials is low: it is basically densely compressed cardboard, painted gloss white. This product would be orders of magnitude better if it was real wood. On the positive side, it worked well for my particular application. I needed a medicine cabinet that came fully disassembled so I could change the dimensions to fit an unusual space that I could not modify because of studs/electrical wiring, and plumbing. I was able to keep the height as it was intended and change the width to fit my space. The price was competitive but I would rather pay more for better quality materials.", 
    "This is not a viable cabinet. It is just a collection of cheap panels barely held together by almost 100 screws of different shapes and sizes. The rear board is 1/16\" thick and just wobbles. No way does the item match this photo.", 
    "I was under the impression that you couldn't get much worse quality than Ikea. This product proved me wrong. TERRIBLE quality, came damaged, kept falling apart while I was building it (the parts don't fit together snugly), just all around BAD. I cannot stress this enough, do not buy this cabinet. It seems like a great deal until you get it out of the box and start building, at which point it's too late to get it back in and return. Spend a little more and get a LOT better quality.", 
    "The pieces don't fit very well and there are 2 pieces that just spin and spin. I would spend more money for a nicer one.", 
    "I wasn't happy with the quality and it really does not look like it will hold up.", 
    "OK product. Way too much assembly for what it worth/cost.", 
    "It took approximately 1-1/2 hours to put the darn thing together, only to discover that it had only one shelf and not much storage at all. We were going to order matching cabinets but quickly changed our minds after seeing the quality of the product and difficulty in assembling. Couldn't imagine how long it would have taken us to put two additional, larger cabinets together!! We could not send it back because we could not take it all apart and re-ship it back for a credit. Very disappointed!", 
    "This was an exceptional value. The cabinet was so easy to put together and took under 30mins.The quality was superior.. definately not junkie or cheap. A welcomed addition to any household.", 
    "I purchased this to go in my daughter's small bathroom to store her toiletries and such. I love it because it can store plenty of stuff, but does not protrude out into the room much at all. It is well made, goes together easily, and is designed to attach to the wall securely. I did modify it a tiny bit. It comes with a latch on the outside of the door to hold it closed, and a magnet on the inside of the door also to hold the door closed. I removed the magnet because I felt it was not needed.", 
    "Nice and valued piece, easy to assemble. You will regret if you do not get this piece", 
    "Love this cabinet but so hard to assemble. Be sure to take your time and be ready to take it apart a few times and reassemble. The instructions are not clear.", 
    "perfect size and somewhat stylish compare to other similar medicine cabinet.", 
    "Great cabinet for the price, easy assemble.", 
    "My husband and I are extremely disappointed with this item. Hinges were rusty as well as a few other metal pieces. The backboard was ripped, but we assembled it anyways. The pieces would not match evenly and the door latch did not hold the door. It sits in the garage because it will not be used in the house.", 
    "This was the perfect size cabinet for the wall space I had available after a reconfiguration of my bathroom. Easy to assemble, very sturdy and reasonably priced.", 
    "Looks perfect for my small bathroom", 
    "This medicine cabinet was exactly as I expected and easy to assemble.", 
    "Had to be returned. Did not fit my area.", 
    "I purchased this as part of a bathroom restoration I did in my early 1930's house. It was easy to assemble and sturdy enough for everyday use. It looks a lot more expensive than it actually is. Trust me I looked at a lot of other sights and walked away with a fantastic bargain! I get lots of compliments on it and I will tell you what I tell all my friends and family: If your looking for something ALWAYS check Overstock.com. They carry quality stuff and are there to save you $.", 
    "Too many pieces. Took along time to put together. Looks good but would of preferred something already set up", 
    "Recieved this item timely put it together no problems it's going to be part of a total bathroom remodel where 99.9% of the items came from overstock , get doin buss ness with them !", 
    "Just a great little cabinet but don't be discouraged when you have to put it together... completely. Absolutely nothing is assembled.", 
    "Kind of a \"***\" feel. It is fine for my needs, but if you are looking for a quality cabinet this not your choice. It is quite flimsy.", 
    "Looks good. Easy enough to put together. I like the adjustable shelf inside. Good quality mirror.", 
    "Before I purchased, I would have liked to have known that there's quite a bit of assembly required and that the instructions are complex and written in mandarin. I would have purchased a different product.", 
    "poor construction. will not withstand the daily opening and closing of a medicine cabinet.", 
    "I thought this was a wood cabinet and it is not. The faux wood split when the screws were installed. I never could get the mirror to hang straight.there is no stop for the door either so it pushes to far in.not happy.", 
    "Extremely poor quality cabinet.", 
    "This is the worst piece of garbage I have ever purchased....I wouldn't even give it a 1 except I wouldn't be able to give a review. Every screw head broke before you could get them close to tight leaving me with nothing but a scrap pile of junk.", 
    "Not the most sturdy cabinet but works great for a small, hang anywhere mirrored medicine cabinet.I'm not the handiest of people, but I was able to put this together with minimal effort in about an hour or less. Overall, not the highest quality, but a great quality for the price.", 
    "Not expensive. For the price it's what I wanted and expected.", 
    "We bought two of these, and the first one went together DECENTLY well, although there are gaps between the pieces where the little dowels just barely show. The second one, however, was a nightmare to construct. The holes were drilled incorrectly which made it so there were HUGE gaps between pieces which made the little dowels show, and there was such a huge gap where the door closes that the cabinet wouldn't latch! My husband had to buy some metal plates, disassemble the cabinet, screw the plates in under the hinge in order to bump the door out enough to make the latch functional. Now, the whole thing just looks cheap because the dowels show and because the door hang crooked so that half of the latch is lower than the other half. The worst part about this, is that the box was clearly opened, as was the package of screws and stuff. Some screws were missing, and replaced with improper ones. Someone had clearly returned it (probably because it was terrible), and Overstock still sold it to us and made it OUR problem. Final notes: There are LOTS of pieces. Also, they put letter stickers on all the pieces, and they're the lovely stickers that don't come off cleanly, so now we have sticky gunk all over our cabinets. Another thing to battle with. Displeased.", 
    "The cabinet came ready to assemble and wasn't too hard to put together. The quality for the price is right and fits all my medicine products nicely to help free up some drawer space. My selection of this cabinet was based on the simple clean design that can go in any bathroom. There are many more medicine cabinets that may be solid wood throughout, etc..., but this one will do the job at the right price.", 
    "Cute cabinet - would've been perfect.... BUT, the door isn't sized correctly! It has a 1/2\" gap and never hits the latch! Also, when attaching the latch, the paint cracked and then the wood behind it split. It's a hassle to return this thing since it's assembled and now won't fit back in the box. Still deciding what to do.", 
    "This was a great purchase. I love how the apothecary/antique look of this makes our old bathroom look good. Good buy.", 
    "Easy to put together. Need a little stronger anchors if holding heavier items.", 
    "This is a very poor quality item, the corners are banged up, the pieces don't line up correctly and the back is a cheap cardboard like material. Would not purchase again. Very disappointed.", 
    "This was exactly what we needed in our 2nd bathroom. There was no medicine cabinet and we needed one to take all our stuff out of the linen closet. A wall hanging cabinet served our purposes to a tee.", 
    "Missing two important parts in the package when I first get it. Then have to call in to ask for replacement. It took them another one week to send me the two parts. Trying to put them together and realized that they are poorly cut into the size therefore, it is very difficult to assembly. Will not recommend this product to anyone. Definitely over priced for the hassle and what you get. Expect a discount offer from overstock but nothing happened.", 
    "This is such a unique cabinet. It's a bit small but that is what we needed for a small bathroom.", 
    "You get what you pay for. The style is great. It's nothing less than I expected for this great price. (I ordered 3!). The quality is less than stellar...cardboard back (but against the wall...no big deal) and a ding on the frame (but reversed it so it wouldn't show)...hoping the others are no worse. This style cabinet is usually 3 X the price of this one, so a few faults are OK with me.", 
    "Loose parts of this cabinet were thrown into a huge box. I would have bet the mirror would have been broken, but it was not. There were several dings and scratches on cabinet.", 
    "The round holding fastners are crap the broke,no bottom support if you fill this medicine cab, will sag in time", 
    "This is a great product for the money! It was well packaged and exceeded my expectations. The finish is great and size and color were just as described. One of the reviews complained about having to assemble so many pieces. It was so easy to put together! I would recommend putting a dab of glue in with each screw for added strength. This is a versatile product that can be used for many things besides a medicine cabinet. I will be using it in my office for stapler, pens, etc. above my desk to eliminate clutter but keep supplies at my fingertips. Overstock does it again :)", 
    "This was a great piece and the size and style we wanted. It's just too flimsy...ex.there's nothing that stops the door from closing past the hitch so you have to just pay attention and it doesn't feel like you can put a lot into it but it is great for now and until we decide what to put there permanently. Good price for something that we'll use for a year or two.", 
    "This was advertised as needing assembly but I was overwhelmed by the 12+ pieces and over 60 screws. Even when assembled it is not sturdy and one of the unusual screws is missing. I have made quite a few purchase from Overstock and this is the first time I've been disappointed. I will continue to make purchases from Overstock as I know they stand by their products. I can return it but I don't have the energy to go that route -- packing, etc,", 
    "My husband and I just renovated our master bath and since we couldn't fit the one I wanted in the budget, this was a perfect fit. It was affordable and had the style I was looking for. All in all, I have no complaints. It was easy to put together, I did it myself, and seems to be made well. There is plenty of room on the inside for all our things as well. I would highly recommend it.", 
    "During assembly a piece broke when tightened by hand, due to cheap material, making it un returnable. Decided to keep after I made some improvements to make it usable.", 
    "Bought this as a temporary solution. It is not quality made. The door hinges are crooked and missing a screw but it worked for a temporay solution until the bathroom is remodeled. It is OK.", 
    "I am returning this product. It seems flimsy and I am worried it will not hold together. Complete assembly is required. Back of cabinet is cardboard.", 
    "We ordered this medicine cabinet and 2 bath cabinets as our first order from Overstock. Merchandise arrived in 5 days and in excellent condition. My husband put all items together with no problem. There was one small chip which we touched with a dab of white paint and it is invisible. Our experience has been very good, we will order again from Overstock.com", 
    "I love this cabinet, both for it quality of manufacture and sturdiness of the materials for it's production. It is a breeze to assemble and took me only 20 minutes! I would recommend this cabinet to anyone looking for storage room for the bathroom also.", 
    "I needed a medicine cabinet for the wall to the left of our sink. Since space was limited I needed something that was smaller in size and depth. This cabinet fit the bill. It was easy to put together and has held up well. We have had this product over a year. I would recommend this product.", 
    "I just hate these kind of pieces I know unless you spend a lot on this kind of stuff you really get crap. I LOVED the style however. It is going in a rental home. I dont imagine it lasting long, note to self: SPEND MORE NEXT TIME get a better product", 
    "great addition to our newly painted/decorated bathroom. The only down fall was the latch broke immediately and we had to disassemble that and bend a few things to get it to fit right. May have just been faulty in mine, but other than that- it was perfect.", 
    "The product was as advertised and exactly what I wanted. However, there was a defective hinge and I never did get a matching replacement. After waiting and finally receiving a mismatch, I returned this item.", 
    "The price is right. but I havent install it, so I cannt comment on the quality.", 
    "The holes/hardware didn't match up exactly in every spot, so the door is just a little askew, but not easily-noticable to others or bothersome to me.", 
    "From reading other reviews, I thought I would be putting product together for hours. Not true. had my teenager help me and we put together in under 1 hour. If you identify the parts and lay out before starting, things will go smoothly. Haven't hung cabinet yet as our bathroom is still under renovations. But looks good and plenty of space inside.", 
    "Just what I was looking for. Old fashioned looking with the top molding and vintage design. The directions were quite clear...but it does have a lot of pieces and will take you some time to get it put together. Reasonable price compared to other similar models on other websites.", 
    "For the price I could have went to Walmart and saved some money. Sadly the biggest issue I have is that it was made in China. I am in the middle of a garage conversion (adding 900sq feet to my home) and I have spent hours making sure I bought a the necessary supplies made in the USA. I find it extremely important to support people who manufacture items in the USA; I am supporting the economy in the USA. This was my first time ordering from Overstock and I can clearly see that if I do decide to order from here again I have to do my homework a little better. Very disappointed!!", 
    "As others have noted, a lot of assembly is required, and the instructions are a bit vague. Fortunately, I have experience with assembling similar products, so I was able to complete without too many issues/re-dos. The finished product is handsome and sturdy, and my wife loves it.", 
    "I always read reviews before I buy from any website this purchase was no different. I was looking for a vintage style medicine cabinet for a relatively small bathroom but still wanted something that wouldn't break the bank. This cabinet was perfect. I had read the other reviews before I purchased it and so I was prepared for a difficult assembly, but it went together quickly and easily. Having two sets of hands did help when holding it together early during assembly. It hung on the wall easily, the mounting guide for my cabinet was accurate and made positioning the cabinet simple. It looks great in my bathroom, just the style I was looking for but still very affordable, well built and functional. I do agree with other reviewers that the board backing is a little disappointing but I plan on replacing it with a piece of veneer and until then it still looks great and functions beautifully. Overall a great purchase.", 
    "Although the cabinet is cheaply made, I think it looks great in my bathroom and it meets my storage needs. Since I'm not adept at assembling things, I had to hire a handyman and it took him 1 1/2 hrs to put it together and hang it on the wall.", 
    "Can in a timely manner, was easy to put together, and the price was reasonable. I should have realized at that price that some part of it would have cheap materials(The back of the cabinet is made of fiber board). Of all the places to go cheap I guess the back is the correct place to do it. I would recommend to a friend looking for an inexpensive medicine cabinet.", 
    "cute little medicine cabinet for a small bathroom. easy to assemble even without written directions....just follow the illustrations. recommend adding a bit of wood glue to the dowel joints for better hold. glue was not included in the packaging.", 
    "Bought it to add storage space to a small bathroom. I was pleased with how well it looked after it was assembled, doesn't really look like a flat pack item. I've had it up for a while and it still looks good, it seems to be wearing very well.", 
    "Shipped quickly. The cabinet looks great. Easy assembly (took just a few minutes). The enclosed wall anchors are too wimpy. I used some heavier duty wall anchors that I purchased at a hardware store that were rated for 50 lbs. instead.", 
    "This medicine cabinet is VERY small. Definitely not for you if you actually want to store any items inside of it! I didn't even look at the dimensions, I just assumed it was the size of a standard medicine cabinet...a mistake on my part. It is also cheaply made. It comes in a bunch of pieces as well. I bought it for our 1/2 bathroom, and it will be fine for awhile, but it is definitely a product more for looks than function. I wouldn't order this again.", 
    "Small and cute medicine cabinet. Good for small bathroom. Only thing is it opens only from the left. Cannot be tuned upside down for right opening. Nice buy. Saw it on Home Depot online for $15 more. Assembly is a pain though. Took about 45 min.", 
    "I had my bathroom remodeled and had an oval mirror above the sink but wanted a small medicine cabinet for a different wall. I was able to assemble it myself, taking my time to follow the instructions carefully. I am very happy with it.", 
    "I put this together myself in about 30 min. Instructions are easy goes together fast.", 
    "It was somewhat simple to assemble. Looks great in my bathroom.", 
    "The instructions for assembly are a little frustrating because they're only illustrated with no written instructions so it took me a few attempts at understanding what the instructions were actually telling me to do. Overall, it was fairly easy to assemble and hang and looks good in our bathroom with our other white cabinets with chrome handles.", 
    "Bought this cabinet for a 20-foot RV as it did not come with a medicine cabinet. I needed an inexpensive cabinet with a latch, and light weight - oh yes, required a mirror. This cabinet fit my criteria. Rather easy to assemble and install, although I had to use screws other then the ones that came with the cabinet to mount on the RV walls - I knew I would have to do this before I purchased the cabinet. All in all, good basic cabinet for my purposes.", 
    "The cabinet was a joy to put together.It was done in minutes and mounted to the wall easily.Having bought many items from Overstock I knew it would be.", 
    "Our bathroom is very small so it was nice to find a proportional medicine cabinet,. It was super easy to put together- all you need is a (non-electric) screw driver! I love the hanging guide it comes with to make sure it is mounted where you want it! Note: this med cabinet would be too small for an average to large sized bathroom.", 
    "Easy to assemble, and it looks nice. A nice addition to a small bathroom.", 
    "Great cabinet for the price. My only complaint is that the knob seems cheap and I'm afraid it may not last long. The directions were easy to follow and all the parts are neatly labeled.", 
    "Great quality-a little time consuming to assemble but the quality is just fine.", 
    "This product arrived promptly and was easy to assemble/install. It turned out to be the perfect solution to a small bath that lacked storage. We could not be more pleased with the finished product and its impact!", 
    "I ordered this with the classique double floor cabinet. - they look great together in my bathroom This also was very easy to assemble (a lot of parts, but the instructions were well-written and the parts were clearly labeled). I am very happy with the finished product - it is sturdy and was easy to hang on my wall.", 
    "This bathroom cabinet has all I am looking for. However, I need it to open from the right side not the left side. It is available with hinges on the right or left side? Any suggestions?", 
    "Once you're able to put all the parts together, which is easy, but takes some time, you've got a lovely solid cabinet. It looks great on the bathroom wall and seems sturdy enough to last.", 
    "So the medicine cabinet came in a box large enough to be shipped completely assembled; unfortunately, that is not how it came. I was dissapointed that I had to asseble the medicine cabinet once received. Furthermore, the packing material is rather messy and clinges to everything around it. The glue that is supplied with the assembly instructions is way too thick to \"fill the dowel holes\" half way. I would not recommedn this product.", 
    "Good piece for the money. Has the look of more expensive cabinets. Close inspection will reveal the cheaper materials, but this was overall an excellent buy.", 
    "Along with 2 Kingston wall mirrors we mounted this lovely, functional medicine cabinet on a wall over dual sinks in the master bath. They are beautiful and extremely appealing. The 3 pieces stand out against the taupe paint and it is a very striking display. Every single person who has seen this wall collection loves it! All of this beauty at a very reasonable price! Thank you Overstock.", 
    "was pleasantly satisfied, good quality, even on the heavy side so needed two people to screw into wall studs. clear assembly instructions, everything labeled well. so much nicer than what you can get on craigslist or ebay, for nearly the same price!", 
    "This medicine cabinet is small, but very nice. Make sure you check the dimensions before you order. It worked for me.", 
    "I love this cabinet. It was easy to put together and looks great!", 
    "We really like this medicine cabinet. The mirror is small, but it is very very cute and very functional. It did take a while to assemble, but it wasn't hard. The pieces were well labeled. We love it!", 
    "What a beautiful little cabinet. I love it! I was afraid for the price it would look cheap but it is very expensive looking, nothing cheap about it! All of the reviews I read were spot on. It fits perfectly in my bathroom and is an added attraction and a very useful one! It was very easy to put together, instructions were understandable. The little bottle of wood glue was a great idea as it gives an extra bit of stability to the cabinet. I highly reccommend!", 
    "The cabinet is attractive and the right size but it was not easy for me to put together so I had to hire a handyman to do it. Still took him an hour and so I would add $20-25 to the total cost. I bought it even though I feared it would be a problem putting it together because I could not find the right size at the several stores I visited. If you are handy, shouldn't be an issue.", 
    "The overall quality was very good. The instructions for putting the cabinet together was very easyto understand. The cabinet was very easy to assembly and hang on the wall. Overall very satisfied and am thnking about purchasing another one for the other bathroom! The price was reasonably compared to what I found at local stores.", 
    "We used this as a catch all in the kitchen for keys, etc. Looks great", 
    "Comes with glue to really hold everything together, and it really is nice quality and sturdy. I got this cabinet and the matching wall shelf unit for the price of just a medicine cabinet at some of the local stores here, so that is a fantastic savings. Really sleek piece, everything fits together and lines up as it should.", 
    "I was pleased with this product. It was easy to put together and everything I needed was included -- even the glue -- YES -- glue. Glue is probably why this product will last. You don't only use cam-locks to hold it together -- you use dowels that you glue into the pre-drilled holes. Even the hanging hardware that was included was appropriate and it worked -- this rarely happens for me, so I'm pleased. A friend saw it and thought it came from Pottery Barn!", 
    "After looking for a reasonably priced bathroom cabinet in my local home improvement stores I decided to give the \"O\" a shot. Great looking cabinet at a really great price. Assembly was easy if you take your time and read the instructions. An added bonus was there were actually instructions and not just illustrations as has been my experience with a cabinet from Bed Bath and Beyond. I was pleasantly surprised!", 
    "perfect for our small spaces, as other reviews have stated assembly was tricky and with little direction, awakward to mount on wall due to location of top screws... however, i love the look and quality of the cabinet.. my husband put extra screws into the mounting - ..", 
    "I like the cabinet, the appearance, very easy to assemble is now installed in my bathroom.", 
    "I like the piece, I didn't realize I had to assemble. It wasn't too hard to asseble, but for the price and size I expected it to be ready to go when I got it.Looks great once I was done.", 
    "This smaller medicine cabinet was perfect for our small bathroom. Very stylish and lovely, yet nice room inside. It matches the white wainscoting I installed in the bathroom, also. Overstock.com was the best price for both my medicine cabinet and faucets. Both look great and the shipping was so low it did not affect the great prices!", 
    "I think I'm to blame in thinking it would be higher quality. The price is right and it's a good cabinet, but nothing exceptional and assembly was trying at best and I'm a handy guy. It's a melanine cabinet and unfortunately I thought it would look more vintage and well built.", 
    "The cabinet was actually pretty easy to put together but I agree with the other reviewer, the glue supplied is inferior so I chose to use my wood glue. Other then that we are very pleased with the cabinet and the size is just right for our small bathroom.", 
    "Unit arrived promptly and in excellent shape. Looks nice installed.", 
    "This cabinet ended up looking smaller than I thought it would, but it works very well in my small bathroom. It only has two shelves, but they're wider than the three shelves that were in the cabinet we replaced so it holds almost the same amount of stuff. It was really easy to put together and I really like the style. We're very happy with it and would definately recommend!", 
    "This is a beautiful cabinet - it looks fabulous in my son's bathroom. I was a pain to put together!", 
    "This piece was fairly inexpensive, and it reflects the price. It looks OK, but is that thin particle board on the back and assembles with tiny screws for that part. It went together OK, but the screws to mount it to the wall are a little inconvenient since they are up and behind the front edge. It could be a little better design that way. But it looks fine up, and I hope it holds up well. It should have no trouble holding cosmetics,but I wouldn't put anything heavy in it.", 
    "Perfect fit for my powder room", 
    "This is a very nice item for the price, pretty easy to put together. Color was as represented and the mirror is a good quality mirror. The only additional feature which would be really nice would be the ability to have the door open right or left, instead of just on the left side - my reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I knew and understood the dimensions before buying. So, no problems here. But, understand that the mirror is small. Placing the cabinet at the right height for me leaves my husband having to bend down to see his full face (we're 5 inches apart in height). The quality is good."
