    "My table came today. It is much more beautiful than the photo can show. I ordered the 84\" and it will seat 6 with lots of space, and 8 comfortably.We could even squeeze 10 on a holiday if needed. It's perfect. I combined ivory linen side chairs and two complimenting high back keyhole- wood back end chairs with ivory linen seats. Better than I imagined. Modern Rustic!", 
    "I've been wanting to buy a live edge table for my condo since I came out of grad school but between student loans and high rent in NY, I didnt want to spent the thousands that stores want for this product. I am not saying it is not worth it, just saying I didnt have the $$$. I wasnt sure what to think about the table when I first saw it online but let me tell you, the table is fantastic! The top is solid wood and it has a live edge that is obvious but not too pronnounced which I love because I've seen some tables with this design that have very pronounced edges that make them unusable. Not mine! It also has a carved detail on the edge that I can't explain how it is but it is exactly as shown on the picture. All in all, I am so excited with my new table. No money for the chairs yet, that comes in a few months!", 
    "Hi Guys .got the table. It is exquisite. I am very very detailed oriented and have nothing bad to say about the table", 
    "Was very concerned about ordering this product online with no reviews. Got the table delivered and IT IS DROP DEAD GORGEOUS. I am still trying to find out what is wrong with it and cant find anything, haha .This table is live edge but has a subtle carved detail on the edge that makes it very unique. The finish seems durable and of very high quality medium sheen.I absolutely love it.Thank you!!", 
    "Great table - thick wood all the way through, not the usual thick on the outside and hollow in the middle trick. Color is more brown, not the redish that is shown in the picture.", 
    "1) Table is not as big as it looks. But dimensions are accurate as stated.2) Table surface is not totally smooth. A few dimples here and there. I guess builder wants to show character of the wood. But I hoped the surface is totally smooth, but surface is not rough because it is lacquered.3) Legs are not as dark as pictured. They are painted with a greyish-silvery color.4) Table is NOT built with 1 single piece of wood. It is made of conjoining wood planks. You can see the long and thin metal plates screwed into the underside of the table going the width of the table (one on each side of table), providing support and connecting the individual wood planks together. This fact should have been clearly advertised like so: Table is 100% wood, but not constructed from one solid piece of wood. Hence the reasonable price. If it were made from 1 single piece of wood, its price would be in the thousands of dollar.", 
    "The table looks better in person than in the picture. The construction is outstanding.", 
    "Beautiful detail on this hardwood live edge table. It fits six people in the 84\" option.", 
    "I love this table! The wood is beautiful, well made.", 
    "Great deal on a great table!", 
    "we get compliments all the time on this table, it is easy to clean and very good quality", 
    "Looks great, came assembled and good finish,", 
    "This is stunning and just perfect in my space. Took a while, but well worth the wait.", 
    "We ordered 2 of these tables 1 for the kitchen and one for the dinning room so that we can put them together to make a very large table. That worked great. Love the legs and live edge, BUT the dark stain is like Paint and you can not see to wood at all! And it is BLACK. So we had to have the top of the table sanded and refinished and it is nice but not what was pictured. I do love these tables but order the lighter color and hope for the best.", 
    "I get lots of complement about this table. Glad that I bought.", 
    "Very sturdy and elegant! I love it. It is made up of 4 wooden boards, but you can't even see the seam. I love the craftmanship.", 
    "We searched around for a dining room table for a while and wanted a live edge look. We kept coming back to this table after visiting other websites. It's very sturdy and comes assembled. My only and biggest issue with the table is that the color IS NOT TRUE. I ordered the chestnut finish thinking it would look great with our other furniture. What we received was more like an espresso finish. I wasn't here when it was delivered and my husband didn't realize the color we received didn't match the color we ordered (I had done the ordering). I realized the color difference a few days later when I compared the color shown online with the color we'd received (something just wasn't right and it ended up being the color). Long story short, contacted customer service and they sent a new table and timed the delivery of the table so we could just exchange tables (didn't want to be without a dining room table for six weeks). That was really great of them. But, when we received the second table - it was still the ESPRESSO color. Ugh. Just want to seriously highlight that the \"chestnut\" option isn't really chestnut. It's definitely an espresso color with some black threads in it. There are no lighter chestnut colors coming through on the table - at all. The construction of the table is superb - hefty, stable and durable. I wish the living edge wasn't so smooth and glossed though as a slightly rougher look would provided more of that nature, slightly rustic feel. Anyway, great value for the price. Just know that the colors are not true to what's shown on the website.", 
    "Great quality table! The wood is real, not faked and looks even better in person. The base is sturdy.The only issue is that the base makes it impossible to place three chairs on each side. I can fit two between the legs and then one chair on each end. Seats 6.", 
    "It took 5 week to deliver. The delivery people were very nice and careful. The table is big and looks nice. It's not heavy as you think for a huge table and that makes me think it's not a solid piece, but time will tell if it's a quality piece.", 
    "I purchased the 72\" table for an apartment dining room. I just love my table. Now I'm trying to decide on chairs. The table is a perfect fit!", 
    "For the price, this table is beautiful. The finish and metal legs look great. It shipped fully padded and put together. The only thing is the top is not solid, or else it would cost way more. When you knock on the table, it sounds a bit hollow. If that doesn't bother you, then this table is the way to go!", 
    "The only reason I did not rate this table with 5 stars is the fact there was a small chip on the edge of the table that looked like it had been repaired prior to delivery, unfortunately the repair is very noticeable.", 
    "We really love the size of the table. It isn't too wide, but the 84inch is a great length for 6 people.", 
    "We like this table, we don't love it because we were looking for a single slab of wood, a true Live Edge table, and this isn't the case. The table top is pieced together, it's not super noticeable but it isn't what we expected. Great table other wise, sturdy and love the color. We chose Chestnut and it definitely has gotten several compliments.", 
    "Beautiful table... looks expensive. My only concern is if they have let the wood dry long enough. There are two cracks across the table on both sides. Overstock offered a credit - I have to figure out how to hide the cracks. Still loving it!", 
    "Love the table....nice quality! It took a long time to get and was shipped to wrong address but Morgan S. was great helping me locate it! She was great to work with and always kept me updated!", 
    "Like any Overstock shopper, I rely heavily on reviews. With 4.5 stars it's probably a pretty great table. Upon arrival, the table was perfect...beautifully made. We got the Chestnut color and it's a little darker than depicted- not as golden/red as depicted. All went well for about 2 weeks. But then a crack started to show and we thought it was just part of the distress. Unfortunately, the crack kept growing and is now over a foot long. Looking underneath the table, it seems the source are the screws used for the legs. Also, we can barely fit two chairs between the two legs. We wanted to seat 6 which will be extremely tight. The 72\" table is more comfortable for 4. Overstock has amazing customer service and will resolve our issues. Just wanted to provide a fair warning to potential shoppers. The table is exquisite, but keep an eye out for those cracks!", 
    "This is a gorgeous table. Heavy, beautiful wood. The only flaw is that the metal base is hollow. Would be happier if this was solid.", 
    "I am so happy bought this one after going through all the reviews. The table looks so solid,beautiful and classic. I got the chestnut color and it is a deep rich brown color. Get compliments from friends all the time. Highly recommended!", 
    "I ordered the 96\" table finished in Aged Maple. It is darker than the picture, for which I'm thankful. This is a beautiful medium brown and the natural edge is very eye-appealing. We've had the table for 5 weeks and the patina grows prettier every day. The table is not too heavy to move but has a nice, solid feel. It is distressed perfectly for the look I wanted; it looks old and rugged, just like our ranch house on the bank of the North Umpqua River in Oregon! The 2\" thick top is not solid alder; about 3/4\"-1\" of alder has been laminated to about an inch of some other kind of wood. It is laminated well and you have to look hard to see it - this does not detract from the table. The live edge is not part of a long plank; instead, it is an an 8'x2\"x2-3\" strip that has been skillfully attached to each side of the table. The result is very natural looking. Only 2 of my chairs will fit between the table legs, but the legs are set in enough to allow 4 chairs on each side. We are enjoying this 8' table and think it is an outstanding value. It arrived within 5 weeks of when my order was placed and was brought into our home and placed where we wanted it. Many thanks to Overstock for outstanding service and a quality product.", 
    "It took awhile to receive the table do to its size and weight but worth it. Love love love it! A great value and awesome look. Purchased the 72\" table. Definitely you could seat 8 at it. Wanted to purchase something different over the normal dining room tables. Our style is contemporary/modern even though this table is more on the rustic side. Paired it with 4 light cream low back barrel leather chairs and the Crystal Z-lite-4. Put down a stubby metal vase on the table and WOW! Very hip and stylish!! Wasn't sure on the color of the wood when ordering online but it is a nice medium brown with some darker brown markings. Legs are a grayish black metal-very cool but the attraction is the live edge top. I'm a very fussy buyer and I give this 5 stars! Would recommend.", 
    "Table quality is good for the price. Solid wood and sturdy. The color is totally off however. The chestnut which I order looks red in the picture but in person, it's more of a light brown, honey color. The 72\" has legs that are a little close to each other which will prevent you from sliding 2 chairs side by side underneath. Also mine arrived with a small dime size chip on one of the lower corner.", 
    "We love this table. Delivered by a professional delivery company. You need to baby it though. It will scratch and the stain will come off if you're not careful.", 
    "My wife and I have been looking for a table like this for over six months but because we were on a budget we could not find anything we liked. For the most part, tables in this price range are bad quality or bad design or even both. We loved the table at Overstock when we saw it and decided to purchase it. It arrived safe and sound a week ago and I must say that this is one great value product. The table is made of solid wood 100%, it is sturdy and the design is very nice. Someone wrote the table is made of planks which is true but it does not bother us, as the table looks very nice.Thank you", 
    "Have got several positive remarks from whoever saw it for the first time. I got the 84\" size and I use rusteoleum metallic carbon gray spray to paint the legs a consistent color. It actually looks better now. Would recommend to check with overstock on the item quantity before placing the order as their online quantity is not accurate. They cancelled the order twice before I could actually get it through the third time. Had to wait a total of 2 months before it was finally delivered.", 
    "Great product. Great price. Not too \"raw wood\" like but not too perfect either. Just right look for a formal dining room that's up to date. Legs well secured to top but slightly wobbly. Easily corrected with felt sticky pads. I have not used the table because I never go in my dining room anyway.", 
    "This table is beautiful and very well made. It looks great in my living room and I have gotten numerous compliments on it.", 
    "We are totally pleased with the table. It seems to have a very solid build and is indeed very stylish.", 
    "Gorgeous table. I have a real table like this in my home and I was looking for something similar for another house without spending the custom price. This table is gorgeous. I wish I could post a photo. Its even better in person.", 
    "Love this table! my only wish is that the legs were not quite as wide so more chairs would fit around it. Two chairs fir fine on each side, but the third and fourth person on each side will have to straddle the legs. Beautiful thick top.", 
    "Please let me know why I am unable to order this table?"
