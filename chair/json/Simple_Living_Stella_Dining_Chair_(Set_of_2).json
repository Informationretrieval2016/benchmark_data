    "So comfortable! Enjoying.", 
    "I just bought 10 of these chairs back in 1/11/16, and one of them already broke. The chairs are beautiful but the quality are horrible.", 
    "love the chairs. very stylish, sturdy, and the color and fabric is exactly as described. excellent accent chairs for my dining room. unfortunately one of the chairs I received had a stain on the fabric. I contacted Overstock.com customer service who sent a replacement part within days. mistakes happen and they were very quick to remediate the problem.", 
    "I put these together in under an hour by myself. They are very well built and sturdy and the coil seat really does make a difference in comfort. But most of all I love the teal color. It is a really nice accent chair in my living room and just in time for my holiday get togethers.", 
    "We bought these chairs to use as captain's chairs on each end of our dining set, and they work perfect. They are super comfortable, solid and over-sized (they look much smaller in the picture). They'd also work great as accent chairs in a corner or on each side of a buffet table; I'm thinking about ordering another set for that purpose. The color and the pattern of the fabric is very modern and stylish."
