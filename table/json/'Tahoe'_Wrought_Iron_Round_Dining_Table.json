    "I have no words to thank Overstock for this table. First of all, it arrive in one piece. I have no idea how that happened!! Secondly, it an absolutely beatiful piece of furniture. The description and picture dont do the table any justice. The base is beyond sturdy, feels hand made, feels just right. In my case the 60 inch was perfect and we have had thanks giving dinner and sat 8 people. I would say it is ideal for 7 but can have 8. The finish is not distress but neither a fine, dont touch me type of finish. It just feels durable to me. The only thing I did not like was the fact that it did not come with pads and if you have hardwood floors like we do, you need to have pads on this table or it will destroy your wood floor. All in all, amazing quality at a price that is very hard to find.", 
    "Was on the fence to buy it because the picture on the site is not that great. The table is gorgeous. The metal work is very artistic and well done. The wood work and the finish are of extreme quality. All in all I am very happy with the table. The delivery crew was very nice too!!", 
    "I have had this table almost a year now, and use it daily! It is beautiful and very solid! I did have a glass top made to protect it from all the use it gets at our house. I also purchased mid century Sonore chairs and they match beautifully!", 
    "I am more than pleased with this table, which just fit my space at 54\" in diameter. It easily seats 6. It looks like designer furniture - very high end. The table top is thick, and the finish is beautiful .", 
    "I ordered this for my company's small conference room in the grey finish. It is unique and sturdy. It easily fits 6 rolling chairs around it. Really happy with this purchase.", 
    "I love this table! It was made to order so it took a little longer than I expected but was so worth the wait! It is very heavy, sturdy and makes a statement!", 
    "Wanted a casual dining table for our vacation home. Looked at this on line several times and was hesitant about buying without seeing in person. It arrived within 6 weeks and I love it. Just beautiful in person and because it has some very light distressing if it gets dented or scratched it will just add to the look. BTW the delivery guys were great and let me put on some adhesive felt tips to protect my wood floors.", 
    "Very sturdy table and very heavy. Nice wood color. We ordered the 72\" round table since we could not get the 60\". It is very large but looks great in our dining room. It did come with one thin crack in it but it's not too noticeable so we are keeping it. I'm glad it was brought into the house for us."
