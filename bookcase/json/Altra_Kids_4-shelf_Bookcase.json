    "Great piece, esp for the price. Great value. Instructions were great/easy. One type in there but easy to figure out & correct before went too far along. Piece \"D\" & \"E\" were opposite/swapped. Otherwise, took and hour to do by myself. Woman and a power tool :)", 
    "I bought this in White for my daughters room. It is a sturdy bookcase and the shelves are pretty deep, especially the bottom one with the cubby. However, I did find the shelf to look more cheap than I anticipated. Before I filled it up with her things, I was disappointed with it's look, but with all of her books and stuffed animals sitting on it, it looks pretty cute.", 
    "The bookcase looks nice and fits my sons legos and books very well. It's a bit flimsy, not as sturdy as I'd hoped. When I was putting it together some of the finish came off. For the price I paid I am very pleased.", 
    "I purchased this item to help organize my kid's toys, it is a very well built product and has a lot of room.", 
    "This is a great addition to my granddaughters playroom!! its sturdy and looks exactly as shown.. pretty easy to assemble also. I'm waiting for overstock to restock this item, so that i can purchase another. You won't be disappointed.", 
    "The style is great, but the quality is not the best, I guess you get what you pay for so I did not expect grat quality. I purchased it so my son could get all his Lego and books off the floor, and it worked perfectly. If you have a child that likes climbing on shelves, you can attach it to the wall. I bought the white one and the painting is not perfect, but all the boos and toys hide it. The box at the bottom is a nice feature. To summarize, not great quality but very nice style and will serve it's purpose for sure.", 
    "My hubby put it together, he found out there's 2 pieces that was mislabeled with alphabet. Just need to be careful when assemble it. It's a nice looking book shelves, and the cost of it is reasonable for the quality of it.", 
    "The install on this bookcase was easier than many such products I've bought over the years. I'm fairly handy and did it myself in about 90 minutes but would have gotten it done even faster had I had an extra set of hands about. The quality of the MDF boards was tenuous but as long as you're careful and follow the instructions you should get it done without any of the weaknesses of the wood showing up. Once it's together it feels solid and looks as in the picture. Overall it's a very good value.", 
    "great shelf. I really like that it can be bolted to the wall (and comes with the parts to do so). Looks very nice in my son's room. Excellent value. It was not difficult to put together either.", 
    "We really like the design of this book case. The color is nice and the shelving is great for books and toys (bottom bin). It will work well in my daughter's room. However, after assembling, we have 2 stripped screws and one of the decorative wooden strips is loose. If you touch it, saw dust falls out. I knew we were buying MDF but did not expect it to be poorly constructed.", 
    "I put the shelf together on my own. It wasn't too difficult, but the curved front design does not allow you to rest the unit on its front to screw on the cardboard backing. This made it difficult to finish/line up. The unit is sturdy enough for our purposes (a bookshelf in my daughter's room), but it is only particle board and won't last forever. For the price that was fine with me, but if you're looking for something more durable I would invest a little more for a higher quality piece. It looks kind of cheap when it's empty, but once you put books and items on it, it was pretty nice. Like I said, great for the inexpensive price.", 
    "Is it of quality materials? No, but I ordered what I hoped would be a good product and that's what I got --- therefore, the excellent rating in value. I knew what I was getting and, it is going to be a good choice for my grandson's room. The style will grow with him and if it last through that time, I should have to call it excellent. It's a 2 person job putting it together. My husband must have missed an instruction for the back veneer and put it on upside down making a bit of a booboo on the front side trying to match holes for the numerous little nails that secure it. I guess he thought the manufacturer messed up on punching out the nail holes. Well, no they did not.", 
    "Well built. Love the box instead of a bottom shelf", 
    "Great product for the price!", 
    "Getting ready to buy a second one for my oldest sons room (4 years old). Bought one for my baby boy's room. Easy to put together. I put it together, by myself, a week before my due date. Toys & books are stored in it. It's used A LOT. Climbed on ( bolted to the wall), used as a mountain for action figures, etc... No scratches, chips, etc... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this bookshelf. It still looks brand new.", 
    "I ordered this bookshelf to complete my nursery. I was surprisingly impressed at the quality- especially given the price. The shelves are sturdy and the bottom bin area is great for toys. Highly recommend it for your kid's room!", 
    "Very good quality and looks as picture. I love it!", 
    "I love this bookshelf. It was exactly what I expected after reading the reviews and considering the price.", 
    "I bought for my daughters room. A bit of a pain to put together. Directions said no tools but would not have been able to get it together without my husbands power drill. Overall Looks great for the price.", 
    "We needed storage space and ordered 3. Wonderful!!", 
    "Love this bookcase however back piece is flimsy and if shelves aren't filled you see the seam to the back piece down the middle. Otherwise The shelves are well built and the color is beautiful looks great in my toddlers room", 
    "Sturdy, functional bookcase. Purchased in white for my daughter's room.", 
    "This is a good, inexpensive bookshelf for a kids room. It isn't as tall as I thought it would be but bc I'm using it in my son's room, it's ok.It was relatively easy to put together and quality is decent.", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks great!", 
    "I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter. The bottom space is great for all of her stuff animals. She displays hER artwork on the top and plenty if room for lots and lots of books.", 
    "Great piece of furniture. Well made and rich color", 
    "I purchased this for my granddaughters room it matches her bedroom set she loves it she is 3. I am very happy with Overstock's service, products and prices.", 
    "Very easy and quick to put together. Fits perfectly in my daughter's room and looks great holding all her toys and books organized.", 
    "Nice, nothing to brag about. They really should be cheaper and they aren't real wood and are a little cheap looking. Easy to put together and they hold a lot.", 
    "great bookcase/storage unit for the price. Fits well in the kids room.", 
    "We ordered two and really like them. One had damage on two pieces. OS got us replacements quick. We have had them for over a year and they are holding up great.", 
    "Fairly easy to assemble, looks nice in playroom", 
    "This is great little bookshelf. Love how the shelves narrow in depth as you higher. It's attractive and sturdy. The cubby at the bottom is nice to stash away all the stuffed animals.", 
    "I am pleased with this, the shelves are deeper than most bookshelves in the mid part of design and the bin on the bottom is nice", 
    "spacious and easy to put together", 
    "Great piece of furniture and for the price, a phenomenal deal!", 
    "This bookcase is beautiful and perfect for kids. It was also super easy to assemble...especially if you have an electric screwdriver. I did it all by myself and it took me a total of 20 mins to put together....you do need 2 people to lift it up from the floor though. It's pretty heavy. Highly recommended.", 
    "This item is great. I bought it in white. It's like no shelf I've ever seen. It's so cool in my granddaughter's room. The \"toy box\" bottom shelf is genius! It holds a ton of stuffed animals. It's really a two person job to assemble. When you put the two sides together with shelves attached to one side it's very difficult for one person. It's like a piece of art which would easily work with modern furniture. I have it next to a 120-year-old child's white wood 5 drawer chest and it looks great. My granddaughter is not two yet so I was glad to see it had an place to attach it to the wall. Be prepared for comments. It gets all the attention from visitors.", 
    "I ordered this for my granddaughter's room. It is very cute and love the storage bin built into the bottom.First one arrived damaged bot Overstock made the return easy and immediately sent a replacement. Second one was perfect. For the money this a sturdy and attractive boockcase.", 
    "Easy to put together and looks great!", 
    "Bought this for my granddaughters room at my house. It is great. I bought a couple decorative baskets for all the miscellaneous small toys and put larger books on it and stuffed animals in the bottom bin. It is great. It did not have holes for cords, so I just left the back section off which is fine as it brings in the pretty color of her walls. Very happy I purchased it.", 
    "This shelf is great to organize books and toys. The only down side is that the instructions say each shelf can only hold 20 lbs. We had to split up the piles of books on each shelf so we didn't overload it. However, the tapered shelf looks great, so it doesn't overwhelm the space and the bottom space acts as a toy box, to keep all the loose, random things inside. We are pleased!", 
    "Got this for my new baby and it is perfect! I love the extra storage on the bottom and it was east to assemble", 
    "Little shaky, but gets the job done well.", 
    "Love them! We bought three of these for my son's playroom. They fit all of his books, board games and random toys perfectly! Plus, they add such elegance to the room. One of the bookshelves was shipped without any hardware so I did have to wait for Overstock's customer service to figure things out and ship me a new bag. But, the customer service people made every effort to rectify the situation and I can honestly say I am satisfied overall. Would highly recommend them!", 
    "This bookcase is fantastic! I have 3 2 boys 3 and newly 9. They have books, cars, costumes, masks, super hero stuff, etc... everywhere, all the time! This has worked to keep things away and neat. I Put it together myself, single mom here :) it's up right haha. Great bookxase, sturdy. I didn't mount to the wall but I didn't have to either way, my kids don't climb up on things they shouldn't. I like it and it works for us, it's a nice size and color!", 
    "I really love it and like how it look like and it is easy to assemble together, it takes a good amount of books.", 
    "Not happy of the quality of it, the bottom shelf was very warped. I will not be buying any Altra products. Not happy.", 
    "It took some time to put together, but it looks great.", 
    "This is a great bookshelf for my sons room. The only thing that would make it better would be if it were solid wood but for the price it is very sturdy. It took my husband about 35 minutes to build- that was with a 2.5 year old \"helping\".", 
    "When I saw this bookshelf, I knew it would be perfect for my daughter's room and would help remove the clutter of her stuffed animals by providing a nifty storage space on the bottom. My husband put this together in what took longer than I thought, being that we've put together *several* of similar units in the past. It was worth the wait, with some minor disappointments at the end.Time aside, from afar the unit looks great. But, as I got closer and started to put books on the shelves, I noticed some imperfections. The edges where the \"trim\" is attached is bubbly and wavy- not smooth. There are edges on almost every shelf and down the length of the whole unit. This was disappointing. Even though the unit is very affordable, you don't expect it to come with imperfections such as these. Also, a plus is that it comes with a wall anchor. This is so important for when you have kids! The only disappointment was that the screw that came with it was too short and didn't account for the baseboard, so we have to go get a longer screw. Not really a huge deal, but it just meant that the first day it wasn't secure and we had to explain to our daughter not to climb.Overall, it's a nice looking piece. There are some flaws, but for the price point, it gets the job done and still looks nice.", 
    "Did not take long to put together and it is very sturdy. Holds a lot of stuff. We did not put the back panels on, we liked the way it looked better and it added light to the shelves", 
    "Easy to assemble, good quality", 
    "bought this for my daughters room, she is a reader and has lots of books. She loves it and it was easy to put together and looks great", 
    "I have missing holes for the screws. The wood is warped.", 
    "I like shelf,it looks great. But it has a lot of pieces. A couple of the screws didn't fit probably", 
    "Good sturdy shelves at a can't beat price", 
    "Great bookshelf for playroom.", 
    "Nice looking piece, just as in the picture. Good size storage in the bottom....", 
    "Good quality, great looking. Sturdy.", 
    "I bought two for my daughters playroom. they are the perfect size and very easy to put together -did it myself although one step in the directions was wrong but it was pretty easy to see it was a typo-think it had one of the shelfsin wrong place but it goes big to small so was not a big deal. Would def purchase again and came in quickly.", 
    "I love this bookcase. The only problem is that one of the shelves had the finish chipped. Because of where the chip is, we just covered it with books. We decided that it wasn't worth the trouble of trying to get the shelf replaced. It's easy to assemble for two people.", 
    "Husband set up the bookcase for our babies room and everyone loves it. Its the perfect compliment to the crib and dressers. Very happy with the purchase so far. Seems like good quality too .... heavy and sturdy.", 
    "I purchased this bookcase for my twins room (boy and girl) and it looks wonderful. The decorate baskets and books and there display toys are beautifully arranged and there is more than enough room. It was very easy to put together, it only took my husband an hour and that is was a miracle it self. Love it, love it and I also got it a great price - that's overstock....", 
    "Easy to assemble and this piece is large. I wanted it for my son's room (he's 1) for toys and books. I like that the shelves are spaced far apart so taller books and baskets can fit in it. Most kids bookshelves are too small for taller books. I wish I could find the white version of this piece because I want to order one for my daughter's room too!", 
    "Nice bookcase. Back piece was missing but great customer service handled it!", 
    "This bookcase fits a lot of stuff. It took me about 4 hours to put together but I am terrible at assembling furniture. I love it and might buy another one.", 
    "I thought that the assembly of these bookcases were simply the easiest I've ever encountered, and I've put together many pre fab pieces of furniture in my day. The first one I probably finished in 45 minutes, the second less than 30, and I'm 8 months pregnant/did without help. A good drill with torque control is a must. The pieces C and D are still reversed as other's have mentioned but its pretty easy to figure that out bc of the # of wooden pegs on the directions. Overall I'm very pleased with these, the only thing is I wish the white looked better. It was very dingy and had lots of dirty marks on it from the factory. Also, the edges where the thing cover over the board is grimey looking if you look closely, so just don't look too close!! The brown looks very nice, far nicer than what is paid (ever priced those silly 3x3 cubes?). Ours had a chip missing from the underside of one of the shelves but its the second from the bottom and no one will see it. My kids' rooms have stayed clean for the first time ever since I bought these, and its been 2 weeks. Last note: the backing has an arrow for the right side up, if you do it right its wayyyy easier to attach! :)", 
    "I bought a second bookcase because I liked the first one so much. The shelves are big and deep. perfect for children's toys. Looks great in the nursery with the more expensive baby's room furniture. Nice and heavy. No worries about it tipping over.", 
    "This bookshelf was a little much to put together but once it was finished it was served a purpose well and it looks good", 
    "Arrived in decent time, easy to assemble and good quality", 
    "I really like the look of the shelf but i have to say putting it together was rather frustrating! The back wall needs to be screwed in and a lot of the wholes didn't line up with the back wall so they came threw in the front of the shelf! Once it was finally put together it really looks nice!", 
    "Got this for the playroom. It was easy to put together. 2 of the boards were mislabeled. Just make sure that the narrow board goes on top. I will probably get one more and put them both side by side. This hold a lot of toys. I like the bottom shelf. I put the balls and dolls in there along will stuffed animals.",
