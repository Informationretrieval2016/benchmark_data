    "I am a pretty good weekend carpenter/cabinet maker and bought this cabinet because i was in a hurry to finish a room that I was working on. The doors are maple, one door is pretty straight, one door is warped. The warped door was not assembled on a flat surface. There were (2) \"bungs\" missing from the assembly screw holes in the cabinet side. One door was missing the hardware, hinges, screws and knob. There were \"dings\" in the side frame and chips missing at the screw holes. Other than the items described above, the cabinet was perfect! The workmanship was awful, and that is being kind."
