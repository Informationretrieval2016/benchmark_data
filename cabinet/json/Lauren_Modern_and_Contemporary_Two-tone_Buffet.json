    "Even for an experienced furniture assembler, the instructions for this buffet were difficult to follow and assembling it took several hours, which is unreasonable for an item of its size. Moreover the overall appearance is cheap and the alignment of the drawers is slightly off. The particular piece we received had chips in the dark brown board and so it is going back. Definitely not worth the $*** price.", 
    "If you can read stick figures of a postage stamp then you'll be fine. Otherwise plan on spending WAY too much time deciphering hieroglyphs in order to assemble this product.", 
    "Decent cabinet. Not high quality appearance. You can see the press board from the top and sides, should've been painted to match top (dark brown) and sides (white). Met expectations at this price point.", 
    "Perfect for what we wanted and size. Very cute", 
    "I should have put the tape measure to the wall to see the height of this buffet, very small and short for my liking. When buying pay close attention to the dimensions.", 
    "Almost everything I expected..drawers smaller than I expected but it is so beautiful!! And it works!!! That's all that matters!! Stylish..classy an it works so great in my home!!!", 
    "I am truly pleased with the great quality of this buffet. The price can\u2019t be beat. A wonderful experience from checkout all the way to the finished product. A+"
