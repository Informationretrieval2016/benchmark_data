    "Best sofa i have owned in a few years. Nice color. Very organic looking in color distribution. Has held up to the incredible digging chihuahuas and unfortunately the kid says it's the best sleeping couch we have owned since we had grandmas hand me down Ethan Allen", 
    "I couldn't be happier with this soda and its comfort. The price was great and quality seems very good. Wonderful value!", 
    "The back of one of the end seats seems like it's sitting in a bent track, it's wonky and wiggly. Plus there is a very flimsy piece of wood in the footrest between the cushion and the coughm which can break if someone climbs on it.", 
    "Really nice quality,comfortable set. Perfect for our finished basement!"
