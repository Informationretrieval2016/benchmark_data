    "After searching everywhere for a wall cabinet I found this one on another site it was exactly what I needed for my small bathroom, but it was way too much money for it. So someone told me to go to o.com and there it was, not only was this cabinet a perfect fit for my bathroom, but the price was a perfect for me. The cabinet is great its just what the description say. it was shipped so quickly I couldn\u0092t believe it. Now I\u0092m in love with the O yeahhhhhh!!!!!.", 
    "No magnet for shutting door, this whole collection fails in this feature. Doors won't shut, keep swinging open, so frustrating!", 
    "The cabinet was easy to put together. It is exactly what I was looking for to display my late mother in law's collection of jewelry boxes. The detail is very nice. I would recommend this product.", 
    "This is a nicely put together product. The glass front doors and the design make it look like a much more expensive item.The color is accurate to the descriptioin; Expresso, a nice dark brown almost black but it blend in with dark brown furniture well. It is a great bargain.", 
    "It took me about 2-3 hours to assemble and hang it. Great looking and very pretty . It is a solid really well made cabinet, its very nice- so glad I bought it.", 
    "I like the look of these cabinets. I put them together myself. Wasn't to bad to do. A little confusing on the instructions but I like how they seperated the components and labeled each of them. They also included extra pieces just in case.", 
    "Great quality, beautiful design, and superb delivery service. I have three of those units, and I love them. They look sophisticated, expensive,and very delicate.", 
    "Just what I needed. It sits on my dresser to hold cosmetics upright. Could mount on the wall and may do so in the future", 
    "Beautiful addition to my bathroom that had minimal storage. Well constructed and easy to hang.", 
    "bought to use as a head knocker over a commode in 1/2 bath. looks nice as is and with a few tweaks can be made to look more high-end. 2 shelves are nice and it was very easy to assemble. would also look nice as a piece sitting on counter in bath, or elsewhere as display cabinet. recommend.", 
    "The color matched perfectly with my accessories in the bathroom. After my husband and I built it, it was beautiful.", 
    "Not as big as I'd thought...but adequate for guest bathroom. Really easy to put together. Looks great.", 
    "love this cabinet...beautiful style, easy put together ...using this and the base as a mini china cabinet....would buy again", 
    "Very Nice! I think I'll order a couple more for my other bathrooms", 
    "I made a mistake when I placed the order but after I got it. It beautiful and really nice looking. So I ordered the floor cabinet. :)", 
    "This cabinet looks much better in the picture. Hanging on my wall it looks cheap. I won't return it. It is together and on the wall. Disappointed.", 
    "Very difficult to hang when the holes in the wall don't line up with the mounting hooks because of using the template.", 
    "A perfect cabinet for my bathroom. Very satisfied, just wish for once items would come assembled and not \"light assembly\".", 
    "We redid our bathroom and this was one of the items that we purchased from Overstock. Everything was a perfect match. The cabinet is really nice. Holds lots of items.", 
    "Not pleased with the measurements of the cabinet, measurements were not correct,", 
    "Not worth the price - looks good in the picture, but the reality is disappointing.", 
    "This cabinet had several things wrong with it. Had to re order new parts twice. I would not recommend it at all. The doors do not line up and it is made very cheaply.", 
    "This is a very nice cabinet. Easy to assemble, very sturdy. I have no complaints.", 
    "We were looking for a small cabnet for our 1/2 bath. It was to large for our use. The return process was very easy to do. The return associate was very helpful and efficent. We will buy from O.co again."
