    "I was a bit afraid to order this since no one else had done a review and I've gotten burned lately on a few things on overstock that I had to send back and I told myself that if this shelf didn't work out, I wouldn't shop here anymore.... The hassle of sending stuff back just isn't worth it. But this shelving unit is fabulous. Even better is that I got it on a flash deal which is what made me take the leap. It was out of my range before that. But at what I paid it was a great value and I am so glad I bought it. The directions could be a bit better but you can figure it out if I can :). I think it is overpriced at full price, but if it goes on sale, grab it! If they ever offer it again on a flash deal , I might order another.", 
    "This item was the finishing touch in my living room. It made it look professional decorated. Everyone asks where I got it. I will keep it forever!!", 
    "This bookshelf is always the highlight of our living room. I love this unit and would recommend it to others.", 
    "This piece looks great in our lanai.", 
    "I looked at these shelves for a few weeks. They are a little pricey but,well worth the money. They were easy to put together. Look amazing. I used it to put all my husbands sports memorabilia on display in a spare room. I would highly recommend this shelving unit.", 
    "The design and parts were all very good - except for one very serious issue! The shelves came with white splotches of mold and a very moldy smell. We returned them all.", 
    "Love these. Perfectly rustic and industrial.", 
    "I was iffy about buying this because of the price tag, but this is one of the best pieces of furniture I've ever purchased. I love the appearance, and the pictures do not do it justice. It feels remarkably stable, and I put it together by myself in just under 15 minutes. It really was that easy. It's sturdy, and it holds my cookie jar collection with space left over.", 
    "This is a great buy for the price? Very solid piece of furniture. Easy to assemble, but you definitely need at least 2 people just due to the size of the unit. Love the style of this & the fact that it's rolling!", 
    "Good purchase looks great. The 2 top shelves were mislabeled and didnt fit so I was ready to call to get replacements, but I realized the manufacturer had reversed the tag for shelf 4 & 5. And after the switched them they fit perfectly. Apparently the top shelf was one piece that was notched then cut into 2 pieces leaving half notched and whole notched on the ends. I only mention all this for anyone who may encounter this same issue during assembly. Also the shelves will go easily into place if u don't tighten the screws on crossbars until completion. The directions were laughable just a couple of pictures. After all was done I stood back and admired my work and laughed at all my cursing.", 
    "Worth the money! This is a very nice design and looks great in person!", 
    "The item came with two bottom shelves, I had two carefully re-drill the second bottom shelf to get it to fit. I had unloaded it all, unwrapped it the weekend before and discarded all the packaging.", 
    "Fanstastic, sturdy and easy to assemble. My favorite shelving unit in my home. Highly recommended if you are looking for a modern industrial look.", 
    "We LOVE this piece. It's even better looking than we thought it would be. The wood shelving is gorgeous and rustic. It's sturdy but also easily moved with the casters. It's given us the shelving space we need while also adding beauty to our living room.", 
    "This item looks great and has held up great. 5 star item. Well worth the price.", 
    "I love this shelving unit! It looks great and was easy to put together.", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks beautiful in my living room.", 
    "Arrived quickly and intact. Husband had no trouble putting it together and it fits perfectly in my art studio. I would highly recommend it.", 
    "When I saw this item on flash steal I knew I had to get it. Pricing out a DIY option it was going to be about $$$ more so when this showed up as a flash steal with free shipping I ordered the shelving unit. It came in two large boxes and the assembly time took a little over an hour while trying to wrangle a 1 year old. The wood shelves are amazing they have so much character exactly what I was looking for, they had bumps and ridges and looked like they came from an old barn. So if you want something sleek and smooth just be aware of the imperfections in the wood pieces. I thought it made the piece better. Overall it was easy to put together, seems sturdy and safe. I would recommend this product to anyone .", 
    "Love everything about this wall unit. Took my husband and daughter about an hour to put together. It's modern without being too trendy. The boards are not completely flat, so don't expect to put fine glassware on it unless you place them on a flat tray first. Other than that, I can only say good things about the quality of the piece.", 
    "Really nice looking , sturdy & very functional , Industrial style Bookshelves . It appears to actually be constructed of real darkened gray steel plumbing pipe & the shelves are a weathered gray rough hewn wood . It also comes with locking casters so it can be easily moved or they can be left off. Also , very easy assembly . All in all a great Bookshelf, but a little pricey.", 
    "I have been looking for a shelf like this everywhere and finally found it on Overstock. It is exactly what I wanted. I love the wood. It is rustic and weathered yet very smooth and soft. It was pretty simple to put together too as long as you have a drill. Comparing prices to other shelves this one was a good deal.", 
    "This Ludlow unit covers a lot of wall space, which is just what I needed. It's sturdy, easy to put together (30 minutes with a helping hand) and readily maneuverable when unladen. Stylistically, you can't ask for more if looking for a shabby sheik or loft styled piece of furniture. Compared to other units of a similar size, it is affordable. Nonetheless, I find it to be overpriced as a function of the going rate for shelving at large. Buy it with a discount coupon and you'll be happy for the purchase!", 
    "A little spendy for something that looks like you could make it yourself from old farm remnants, but looks really great with that industrial, rustic style. The unit is very sturdy, wheels along easily and is simple to assemble. The instructions aren't very detailed but really there are not too many ways to go wrong. I assembled by myself and also stood up the unit on my own. It looks awesome!"
