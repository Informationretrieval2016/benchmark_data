    "I bought this to use as a vanity in our master bathroom and couldn't be happier with the quality and overall look of it. Very solid piece that didn't need any assembly other than the feet which is a bonus. Used a vessel sink to try to limit the damage to it in case one day I want to use it in a different part on the house", 
    "We just received this piece, very easy to put together. It is on the heavier side so you will need two people to lift and such. It adds a great look to our living room."

  "description": "The Industrial dining collection recreates the improvised, utilitarian look of early 20th century factory furniture. Rough-hewn planks crafted entirely from solid pine bear the characteristic saw marks, dents, pits, and random knots of logs milled on the steam-powered circular and sash saws of the era. A rustic black pine finish balances transparency and opacity to showcase these natural imperfections.  Exposed bolts, hammered metal pulls and cross-braces evoke the ingenuity and earnestness that characterized the turn of the century.\n \nBuilt with convenience in mind, the Industrial dining table is offered in rectangular and round configurations. Each design is constructed with an 18\u201d or 20\u201d leaf extension and features mortise and tenon joinery, tongue and groove table top framing and angled cross-bracing. Dining chairs are available with upholstered and wood backs, and feature solid wood legs, individual nail head trim, linen upholstery and full web suspension for hours of dining comfort. The 65\u201d sideboard completes the collection with three levels of storage behind glass-paneled doors and three spacious drawers with hammered metal bar pulls, ball bearing glides and English dovetail joinery.  \n\nEqually suited for an industrial downtown loft or a suburban farmhouse, the Industrial dining collection blurs the lines between contemporary and rustic.  The collection\u2019s black pine finish works well with concrete or dark hardwood floors and plush neutral or bold rugs.  Zinc metal accents complement nickel or chrome kitchen accents and contrast well with bronze color tones.  Neutral or bold wall colors provide a great contrast to the wood finish, making this collection a perfect choice for any lifestyle.\nMaterial: Pine, WoodStyle: ContemporaryAssembly: AssembledColor: BrownStyleContemporaryMaterialPine, WoodAssemblyAssembledColorBrown"
