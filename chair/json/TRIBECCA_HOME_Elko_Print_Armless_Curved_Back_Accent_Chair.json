    "The photos online accurately depict what the chair looks like when it arrives. The quality is good given the price point (i.e. there are a couple of small imperfections noticeable when you have OCD or are starting at it while assembling it). The colors brightened up our space without being overpowering.We did have some challenges finding the legs and hardware for the chair. There was an empty box inside the main shipping box that looked perfectly sized for those items. It turns out the bottom of the chair has a velcro back that you need to lift up to get the legs and hardware. Sadly, we returned the first chair for missing parts and didn't figure this out until the second chair seemingly arrived with no legs and hardware. Thankfully the customer service person at overstock clued us in to the hidden compartment.", 
    "I got two of these chairs to go in my master bedroom next to our fireplace. Out of the box I love the swirl print... they really look unique and romantic! You have to really push the chair back into the seat... it feels like you might break it but keep pushing until it seats into the large groove. It looks like it won't fit, but it does... it took me about 30-minutes per chair. Kind of a pain but well worth it because they are so perfect and relatively comfortable.", 
    "This chair was easy to assemble: all parts included, simple written directions, pictures. It is stylish & comfortable for an average sized person. It fits well in a small spot. The earth-toned stripes are \"soft\", not bright. I am very happy with this chair...just what I was looking for :-) I also love Overstock's \"free shipping\" policy. Delivery went without a hitch. Overall, I have always been happy with my Overstock purchases!!!", 
    "Was in good condition when arrived, a few threads underneath that I removed with a scissor. Look nice in corner of guest room, easy height to sit up and down easily. Pretty fabric and easy to put together.", 
    "still on site but not in stock for 3 weeks", 
    "Great chair for the guest room just sits to low", 
    "A little low to the ground but comfy chair at a low price. Took a while to figure out the legs were hidden inside the bottom of the seat when it was shipped. One leg cracked during assembly and o.co Cust service was great about sending me a new leg.", 
    "Was so pleased with this product! Great build quality and very comfortable.", 
    "I love this chair. Perfect price, perfect fit. I thought it was going to feel too close to the ground, but it looks and sits amazing.", 
    "Within a month or so, the seat of the chair was no longer firm, taking your sitting height down by at least a few inches. The chair looks great - but I would not recommend if you're going to sit on this regularly.", 
    "Love it, perfect size, vibrant color but a little difficult to assemble, need a little muscle. I like it so much I think I'll buy another. Comfortable little side chair, good,value for the money.", 
    "I was expecting better quality. It's made pretty cheaply and the are smaller then I thought. The color is true and they match my living room perfectly so I'll keep them.", 
    "poor quality, glad I did not buy more than one of this chairs.", 
    "I bought this chair for the upholstery. Its exactly what I wanted. Makes a nice sitting area with an interesting topic.", 
    "Was so excited for this cute chair. It arrived, and sadly, it looks like it was constructed by my 4 year old. The fabric on the top portion is stapled on with all the loose fraying ends hanging out and bits of foam are popping out as well. Returning. Very disappointed."
