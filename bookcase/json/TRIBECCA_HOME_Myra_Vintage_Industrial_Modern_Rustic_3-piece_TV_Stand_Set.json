    "These came in easy to assemble and looked just like the pictures!", 
    "It was just what I was looking for. The assembly was simple and the product is very sturdy. Worth the money.", 
    "The pieces in this set are cheaply made in China. The metal is hollow square tubing with ends badly tack welded on. The finish on the metal is a very rough, gritty powder coating, and up close the welds are quite obvious.The boards are solid wood, 3 boards each fastened (glued?) side by side, but it's a very light weight, very dry wood. One of the cutout ends snapped off as I ran my thumb gently over what I thought was a seam (it was a crack).The finish on the exposed side of the shelves is lovely, although out of the box they smell strongly of wood stain. Once assembled the pieces are extremely lightweight and lean badly on the carpeting. We are using the fasteners to fix them to the walls for fear they may fall. I have my TV mounted on the wall above the middle shelf. I don't think I would trust it to hold the weight of my 47\" tv.Quality aside, the set looks nice against my wall. If you're looking for the illusion of a nice set and you don't plan to put any real weight on it, this might work for you. If you want quality for your money, or if you want something heavy enough to hold some weight and sturdy enough to handle a home with children, pass this set by.", 
    "Very pleased with this set. I assembled it all myself (and I'm a 50 yr. old, semi-handy woman; just needed the help of a bench to prop up the taller pieces as I screwed them in place) in less than 2 hours & it was a breeze. All of the holes lined up perfectly, the diagram instructions were easy to follow and the pieces are sturdy and well made. It looks great, and as many other reviewers have mentioned, much higher-end than the price I paid. I like this set so much that I've decided to get the matching desk as well.", 
    "Great value! Easy assembly and constructed well, for the price.", 
    "looks great and very pleased with price!", 
    "looks like it's from restoration hardware. my husband put it all together quickly", 
    "This would look great in a rustic setting but I happen to live in the South and love it anyways. My 55\" TV sits well on stand with no wobbling. Because of the height of the bookcases, they will move but you have to physically push them for that to happen, Overall really solid sturdy set. My only complaint, the shelves are not one piece of wood and the stain of the woods sometimes don't match very well. Had a delivery person commented how nice the unit looked. I was surprised but said \"Thank You, I love it too\".", 
    "These items are just what I was looking for and they fit my living room wonderfully. Easy to assemble in less the thirty minutes. Look Great", 
    "these were just what the doctor ordered. great vintage industrial look. good quality too for the price.", 
    "Very easy to put together which was a huge plus. The wood looks exactly as pictured, very rustic. The welds could look better but it's just a stand. Although made in China, the wood is at least real and again very nice. I am happy. I only wish it was USA.", 
    "Quality construction and simple as pie to put together. Love, love, love.", 
    "This is a very nice ensemble, plenty big for our 60 inch TV and the side shelves are ideal for displaying photo frames, art, books etc... We managed to camouflage the electronics wires by using black zip ties on the metal frame, these are easy to assemble as well. The blend of wood and back iron gives this set a cozy yet modern contemporary look, we ordered it after seeing an identical one in a high end model home. Good choice. Works in traditional or modern decor.", 
    "Love the look, easy to put together", 
    "Love the look. Matches description, color well. Easy to put together. I'd recommend to anyone wanting open shelving.", 
    "I love this set -- it's industrial, but not over the top (no wheels or rust), and happened to be the perfect heights for my needs. I separated the set and use the two tall shelving units on either side of an oak armoire, and the lower unit sits behind a leather sofa as a console table. Love it all!", 
    "Shelving went together easily. Finish is good.", 
    "These shelves are really beautiful. And the picture on Overstock is quite accurate. The wood is stained a beautiful color and it looks old and rustic. The stand is quite study and relatively easy to assemble.", 
    "Exactly what we expected. Clean lines with a rustic look. It was the perfect finishing touch to the living room!", 
    "Excellent piece of work looks great", 
    "These pieces were the cherry on top of my living room. I put it together by myself! It was so easy! Thanks!", 
    "very rustic looking but they brought a fun update to my decore", 
    "This entertainment center looks great but there were some hiccups. First, only 1 tower was delivered instead of 2. Overstock Customer Service is great and sent me the 2nd tower and I had it in 2 days. The chemical smell of the wood was a little over powering when the box was opened but disappeared after a few days. A few of the shelves on the towers are a little wobbly but overall it's good construction at a great price. I got it on sale so I'm overjoyed at the quality and look for the small price tag. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a rustic entertainment center.", 
    "Open and looks very nice. Just what we wanted. Also very easy to put together.", 
    "The package smelled of chemicals, glues, finishes. We had a matching desk that came warped, stunk and was wobbly. We got dinged by Overstock to return the opened desk. So we learned our lesson when this matching package smelled the same. Online reviews can sometimes be unfair as we technically did not set this item up. Based on the quality of the desk we bought, I'd give this TV stand 1-star. But since I did not open this package, only smelled it, I'll give a 2-star rating.", 
    "These are great shelves for storage in a small space.", 
    "We really like the look and feel of the set. It was simple to put together and looks great in our living room.", 
    "I had bought 2 of the book shelves a few years ago and loved them so much I had to get a few more!", 
    "Great purchase. My husband assembled this with only a screw driver and minimal help from me. It's sturdy furniture that's not big and imposing.", 
    "Easy to put together and looks great. However, do keep in mind that you'll have to do something about those wires hanging out :-)", 
    "I bought this for the living room and also a matching TRIBECCA HOME Myra Vintage Industrial Modern Rustic Bookcase (what a weird name, honestly). As I mentioned for the bookcase, these three separate pieces were fairly easy to assemble, look exactly as pictured, and seem sturdy once assembled. The packaging kept the item snug and nothing was damaged, however the styrofoam used left white flakes in my living room and sticking to the pieces of furniture. Else wise, it is great and I hope it lasts a long time.", 
    "This product literally took 30 minutes to assemble. It looks very high end, and it's extremely sturdy. I love the industrial look and the wood is a very nice contrast to the metal frame. Great product!", 
    "very nice . very good quality", 
    "Sturdy, attractive and not too difficult to assemble. Well done!", 
    "Looks great and it's easy to put together. We love it! got so many compliments on how it completes our living room.", 
    "High quality and stylish, definitely recommend", 
    "Easy to assemble, holds an appropriate amount of weight, feels sturdy, and looks great with our TV!", 
    "Great quality product for the price & really easy to assemble. Real wood product with a nice industrial/rustic look."
