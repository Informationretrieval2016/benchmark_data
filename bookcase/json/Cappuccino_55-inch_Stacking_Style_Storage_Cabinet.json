    "The look of this cabinet is very nice but the quality is just not worth the price. The skin of one of the legs has already come loose after assembly. Dropped one of the doors while putting it together and it got a dent in it. The wood under the laminated skin is very soft.", 
    "The cabinet was easy to assemble and the perfect size for my foyer.", 
    "This product is not very well made at all. It chipped while being put together. It was not easy to assemble. Once fully assembled I was afraid to move it thinking it was not sturdy enough."
