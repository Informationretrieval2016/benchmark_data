    "These curtains let in the perfect amount of light. I was looking for a pair a curtains for my living room for months. I have Browns and blues in my room and the indigo ones were perfect. The pattern complemented my pillows and rug. They don't look cheap at all. So happy!", 
    "very expensive looking - embraoidery is great- very true to color on screen; material is nice- not cheap voile that is shiny and snags easy- highly recommend", 
    "Light and airy curtains, go well with light tan as well at grey paint/accessories. Love them!", 
    "Love these, nice quality and they look great.", 
    "THE DIXON EMBRODERED SHEER CURTAIN PANCEL PAIRS ARE GREAT.", 
    "Pretty, sheer and good quality", 
    "very satisfied with the item. description about the sheer curtains are very precised!", 
    "Great value! Look great and arrived right on time!", 
    "These sheers look great in the Family room. Better than I expected.", 
    "Far exceeded my expectations!!!", 
    "Beautiful curtains that were a wonderful price for the value", 
    "The curtains are great. However, it took over three weeks to receive them and overstock seemed to think it wasn't that big of a deal they didn't ship until I had to call to tell them. It must happen often.", 
    "We bought these for our 3-panel sliding door which is much wider than a traditional window. The measurements described both curtains combined instead of each curtain. So instead of being wider than a regular curtain, these are skinnier than a regular curtain."
