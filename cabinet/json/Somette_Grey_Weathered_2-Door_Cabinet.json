    "Purchased the Somette Grey 2-door cabinet as an accent piece for my living room. Shipped quickly and arrived well packaged. The piece itself is gorgeous. Color and description were as stated on Overstock. This piece is solid and well built, not to mention gorgeous. The color compliments my weathered grey hardwood and I couldn't be happier."
