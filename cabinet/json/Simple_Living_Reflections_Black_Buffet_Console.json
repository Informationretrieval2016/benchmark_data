    "This cabinet is beautiful. The directions for assembly were the best we have seen.", 
    "We needed extra storage in our kitchen and an additional area as a serving place when we entertain. This piece meets all of our needs, looks great and is of good quality", 
    "This was the best piece of furniture that we have put together. Everything was labeled even the hard ware. It was super easy to put together. It was packaged great so nothing got damaged. We love the look of it. Can't say enough praise about it. Love love love it.", 
    "Nice cabinet, pretty easy to assemble. They say you need two people,but I did it by myself. Be sure that all grooves go in back. Not too clear on that in beginning. Only complaint was that after I took everything out of box and started assembling, I noticed some fairly deep scratches on one outside board and on a few others. Felt as long as the mirrors were okay, I could live with the scratches. Didn't want to take apart or box up again. A little permanent felt marker and you can't see a thing. Overall, perfect size for what I needed along with good price. Not too wide and not too long.", 
    "This is a pretty sharp buffet. My only complaint is that the spacing on the cabinets doors are uneven and they have little gaps between the door and the frame", 
    "love this, easy assembly and looks great in my dining room", 
    "Shipping was an issue. I kept receiving damaged / broken parts. It took a few tries to get it shipped correctly.It was a hassle and took a while. Product looks better in the picture.", 
    "These arrive flat in a box, ready to be assembled. One of the mirrored door panels arrived broken. (Overstock quickly did it's thing and made it right) after assembling the unit, we decided that we needed more storage than the 1 shelf per cabinet. We were easily able to buy the necessary wood and shelf brackets at the local home improvement store to make our own. The cabinets come with pre drilled holes, which made it easy to add the necessary shelves. The hidden hardware doesn't detract from the clean design - and we absolutely love the \"push touch\" open and close feature. These are durable, sturdy cabinets. Great for storing all types of the things we need only a few times a year, like the crystal. They're long, and a perfect height for the top to double as a serving or display area in the dining room.", 
    "The buffet adds great detail to my kitchen area. It is also excellent for storage.", 
    "I love my new cabinet , it had a few scratches on the doors and one spot on the side . But I was able to fix them . It took my husband a few hours to put it together but he didn't have any problems . I would have given it 5 stars if it had not had the scratches . Looks beautiful!!", 
    "Beautiful piece looks like it's worth much more money", 
    "Easy to put together. Love it. Looks wonderful.", 
    "The mirrors in this black buffet, gives a beautiful accent", 
    "Takes a couple hours to put together (if alone) but looks beautiful for the price", 
    "This is the perfect buffet console. Looks even prettier in person and very heavy duty and sturdier than I anticipated. Carried all my dishes and cups and beautiful design in the hall way.", 
    "I love it although it has not been assemble, I had been looking at this item and when I started to order you were out of stock so then I ordered the White and was going to paint Black but weeks later I checked and the Black was back in stock. I ordered right a way and since I never open the box of the White I returned and reordered the Black - - ALL IS WELL THAT ENDS WELL , THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THE RETURN. BEVERLY ***********", 
    "Most buffets work best in dining rooms because of their lower height. This is perfect for an entry/foyer or any room with tall ceiling.", 
    "One of my favorite pieces from overstock. Excellent quality and adds such an elegant touch to my family room", 
    "Not the easiest to assemble, but looks nice once it is done. They sent me white doors the first time (we ordered black), but customer service got the right parts sent to us pretty quick.", 
    "It looks nice on the picture, ok from the distance but poor quality, **** style.I paid over $$$. Definitely overpriced!", 
    "I get a lot of compliment looks beautiful. down fall is it gets chipped a lot and the black comes off. I bought paint to touch it up.", 
    "Took about 2 hours for my husband to assemble without any major confusion. Seems sturdy. All parts arrived in 2 boxes with no breakage. Looks great!", 
    "This was for my mother to replace an old cabinet, so it does look much better than her old piece, but there are some marks on the doors that we did not see until it was almost fully assembled. One mark is about the size of a quarter and looks like it was touched up or painted over. She is still happy with it, so we are not going to try to get replacement doors and it does look good for the money spent.", 
    "Came in two boxes; lots of pieces but they all fall into place. My Husband put it together in about 1 1/2 hours. Looks great, not as long as I thought, just double check your measurements.", 
    "Very high end looking at a great price.( as long as you don't mind assembly ;))", 
    "Easy assemble. We put it at front entryway, look stylish!"
