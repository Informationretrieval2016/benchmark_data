    "Exactly as pictured. Perfect", 
    "I bought two of these and couldn't be happier. A bit of work putting them together but well worth it!", 
    "I bought the entire set of Inspire Q Nelson furniture and it looks amazing in my new house. It was a breeze to put together and is super heavy duty. The only thing with the bookshelf is to make sure you don't put any of the pieces on backwards because once you get to the cross bars in the back, you'll be cursing yourself for not paying closer attention (lesson learned).", 
    "This bookcase is huge! Luckily my space is big enough to accommodate it. So measure out closely before you decide to buy. I gave 4 stars because one of the screw that is for tightening the cross bar behind the bookcase is really short so it can not tighten it at all. I need to contact the customer service for replacement and hopefully they will get me one. It'll be a hassle to repackage and return.", 
    "I ordered this for our kitchen area to be used on a temporary basis, until we can get additional cabinets added in the kitchen of the house we just bought. But after getting it, it really is very nice and will probably keep it in the kitchen for additional storage and display. Purchased nice fabric boxes and used them on the bottom 2 shelves for food storage. Wider than I expected but still looks great", 
    "These bookcases are beautiful in person. They are a great value & easy to put together. Quite deep, too. I've gotten a lot of compliments on these. The only reason I have given it a 4 is the bottom (metal shelf) seems dip in the middle w the weight of my books. In their defense, it is a lot of weight ...but best to put your heaviest items on the very sturdy wooden shelves. I'm pleased w my purchase.", 
    "Restoration Hardware quality", 
    "This unit is very solidly built and assembles pretty easily. The shelves are very solid and are supported by the metal frame on all four sides so they are unlikely to ever sag. The shelves are deeper than a typical bookcase but they're the perfect width for what I was looking for (good for a variety of items: plants, books, lantern, etc.). The wheels have one small area that is flat with a pad to keep it stable on the floor (I don't think the wheels turn anyway, they're ornamental).When assembling, they tell you which order to install the shelves but they neglect to tell you to ensure you have the bolt holes for mounting the \"X\" frame on the same side. I had the middle shelf backwards so I had to flip it around. It only took a few minutes but would've saved me a little extra time if they mentioned it.Overall I'm happy with the purchase."
