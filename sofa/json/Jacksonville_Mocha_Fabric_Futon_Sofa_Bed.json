    "Assemblage was a snap with help from clear illustrative intructions. Very chic, modern, and comfortable futon sofa bed. Love the mocha color and style, easily fits with any decor, except traditional and country. I bought three throw pillows to give it a softer, finished look. Just wished that this **** had matching pieces in different colors, and was part of a collection. Then, I would add a chaise and two chairs. Will happlly recommend this attractive and practical piece of furniture!", 
    "I agreed to the other good reviews this sofa bed is a good bargain. The material used was good in quality, the fabric has very nice feel and look to it. I can pretty much tell that the material is durable. After all, this is one of the best looking contemporary sofa bed that I can find. So I am very pleased with it.", 
    "Fantastic piece for the price. Seems well made and will be a perfect fit in our home office!", 
    "Excellent little sofa for my studio apartment. Like most other people have said, it is really easy to put together. You get it folded up in the box, and then you unfold it, with both sides connected by the hinges. Then you attach the legs with an Allen wrench. Pretty comfortable; I put a blanket on mine to make it softer. Very nice.", 
    "The padding is very light you can feel the frame underneath. When it folds open to bed, the center fold is hard to sleep on.", 
    "The middle part is kind of annoying to sit on, but the compact nature of the thing and the look is great. It folds down as a bed, which has saved us for lots of guests, and you can't really beat the price.", 
    "The sofa bed is functional. It does convert into a flat position, however it is not the most comfortable thing to lay on and also to sit on. For prolonged periods of sitting it can be quite uncomfortable but if you need a sofa bed to house extra quests on occasion and are on a budget this is a piece that will function for you. If you want something that's more comfortable and to last much longer time I would recommend another piece as this one is pretty good for a short/temporary term", 
    "I am pretty indifferent with the product. I like the color of it and it has a modern look but it's not that comfortable and it's quite small. I bought it for guests to sleep on but it seems like it could only fit a child.", 
    "This is a great way to have a guest bed. Put this in our study and it looks good. Even pretty comfortable to sleep on. We are happy with this purchase.", 
    "The brown is really ugly. Just EWWW. Not at all what I saw online. Now I'm stuck with this ugly brown thing.... I'm very disappointed! I understand that I only paid ****, so I guess \"you get what you paid for\" is definitely true in this case. I'm never buying a piece of furniture online ever again; learned my lesson! :(", 
    "I don't understand why there are so many excellent reviews of this product. I've had the sofa since May this year and already the padding is crushed in one corner. Also the bed is extremely uncomfortable to sleep on since you feel the metal. I always put a layer of memory foam when I make up the bed for the guests, but you can still feel the frame.The design is cute but if you have a lot of guests (that aren't children) do not purchase this product. If you insist, I suggest you purchase the overstock warranty because the company has no warranty on this sofa bed. There are other attractive sofa beds on Overstock, maybe up to $$$ more that offer a one year warranty.I would also like to add that at this point the sofa is no longer comfortable to sit on as a couch. If I say this as a 125lb woman, I can't imagine a heavy person sitting on it.", 
    "An attractive futon sofa-bed. This color is the right choice, low maintain and stain free. Requires easy assembly; necessary parts and tool provided, directions easy to follow. Will sleep one adult comfortably, two would be tight, unless small in stature. But that's the normal sofa bed are supposed to be - compact. Very pleased with purchase.", 
    "We like the look of the couch. It is not a very comfy bed but we bought a twin size foam mattress to put over it and it helps a lot.", 
    "I'm okay with this futon. It's a bit cheaper looking than I thought and it took a few weeks to \"break in\". You can only sit two on it because the middle is very hard and uncomfortable. I have not had anyone sleep on it yet, but it can comfortably fit one adult over night.", 
    "This couch is great looking. It is small and very low to the ground. It is comfy to sleep on, however, if you are looking for comfy to lounge on, this is not the couch. It is very firm. Not for sitting on to watch a movie.", 
    "The product was easy to unpack and put together. However, the delivery notification was very poor. I would have liked the option to pay more to have it carried into my house rather than finding it on my porch with no warning."
