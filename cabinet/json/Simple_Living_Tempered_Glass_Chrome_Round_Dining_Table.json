    "We ended up returning this table because there was a gouge in the glass top and it did not match the room. The table looked ok, but it was not particularly sturdy. I thought the quality was ok for the price.", 
    "Everything about this table is lovely. The style is lovely, sleek; the chrome is lovely, shiny; the glass top is lovely, thick and durable. If a sleek and modern look is what you want, this table is what you need.", 
    "My wife and I were wanting a smaller table for our dinning area and this table is exactly as advertised. For the price it is stylish, sturdy and was easy to assemble.", 
    "We are updating our kitchen and dining room and wanted something modern yet practical. This table looks great, and is very stable. It goes together pretty easily, but you probably need a helper or a third arm to make it easier. The feet are adjustable for height, which is great for our uneven dining room floor.", 
    "My table creates most space because it's glass and round it doesn't take much space but yet it's big enough to sit 4 people. I love it, great price, great deal, love love love the look \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", 
    "Had 4 hammered chrome expensive chairs given to me by my son. Hard to find a small round table that would go with the chairs for my studio, then found this. The assembly instructions weren't with the table and I had no idea how to assemble. Got in touch with Overstock customer service and the instructions were sent via email. Was able to assemble by myself and love it, Perfect size and looked exactly like I had hoped for. First time buying from overstock but won't be the last.", 
    "Excellent workmanship and easy to assemble", 
    "No complaints, just like all the other reviews say this table looks modern and is reasonably priced.", 
    "Great table for a small space. Easy to put together and excellent quality components.", 
    "very classy and solid table for small area. very steady!", 
    "I got this table for my breakfast nook area and it fits perfectly. Make it look airy and modern. Simple to put together. Looks great with Christopher Knight Home Kensington White Modern Chairs (Set of 2).", 
    "The table looks great, but... the recessed legs mean that your legs will rub against the table legs. Also, chairs will not go fully underneath, which adds a lot to the overall size/space of it. And it's incredibly hard for one person to put together -- you have to hold all four legs at the same time and lower them on four bolts, while they're wiggling free like crazy. The table will seat four, but no more than that.", 
    "although I had some one else put it together....he said it was easy....it is soooo cute in my new \"granny flat\" it was packed just fine and no problems", 
    "Very stylish, great price and only 15 minutes to put together.", 
    "I need to have table not more than 40'' in diameter. All glass tables on market have diameter 42\" or more.I pleased I found the table such size.", 
    "Excellent table, good looking, easy to assemble and quick delivery. good value for money.", 
    "Fabulous table for the money. GREAT value. It was deliverd promptly, is a great table, and the set-up was a breeze (they even included the tools needed). Super find!", 
    "I received this table and immediately fell in love! It looks exactly like the table in the picture. Great quality and looks amazing. Made the dining space look stunning. Definitely seems like it should be more than ***.", 
    "Love it. looks way more expensive than it was.", 
    "Heavy and durable. High quality feel. I'm using this in my breakfast nook. Can change the look by just changing the chairs.", 
    "Very easily assembled,, I did it all myself!! I have a small cottage style home so this round table is a perfect fit & adds a classy style!", 
    "Love it. So elegant and shiny.", 
    "Perfect round table! Sleek, easy to assemble, thick and strong. A+ all around and you can buy without hesitation", 
    "moved into my first apartment and needed a table, worked perfect in my space and is a great size. SO EASY to put together.", 
    "Love this small table it fit perfect 4 up to 5 people", 
    "Just what I expected, easy to assemble, just the right size for my kitchen nook", 
    "This table looks so elegant in my dining area. It's easy to put together and pretty sturdy. Like another reviewer, I received a chipped glass top. Had to make a few phone calls, disassemble the table and ship it back to overstock. the replacement table was perfect but this whole process as you can imagine is a bit painful. I would inspect the item carefully before installing. Otherwise, great piece!", 
    "assembly was fairly easy and quick with no special tools required. I did it on my own in about 20 minutes and the table looks great. It is perfect size for a small dinning area", 
    "The good: very easy for one person to put together and I was even able to turn it over by myself (5 foot 8 inch-woman), super modern elegant style -perfect for my apartment, my legs fit under nicely with no rubbing against anything. Legs look sturdier in real life than in photo, in my opinion. Glass is nice and thick and came well cushioned with foam and arrived very quickly. I am keeping it but...The bad: The glass is not crystal clear and that should be part of the description. It has a very light blue tint and the tray table beneath is frosted on one side and is even more bluish. Perhaps that is what was meant by \"Glacial\" I was looking for clear untinted glass, however, in varying light it looks anywhere from like the photo, to grayish green to blue. It doesnt clash with my furniture so I am keeping but was a bit disappointed as my chairs are crystal clear and I wanted an \"invisible\" look overall.", 
    "I just assembled my table. Really nice for my small place, tempered glass makes my place looks spacious. Easy to assemble, did it myself.", 
    "Looks great; easy to assemble; prompt delivery. Couldn't be happier!", 
    "Love the table and tempered glass is important. Great value for the money.", 
    "nice looking for the prices", 
    "Very pleased with this table...", 
    "This is a neat little table fits in the corner and is a good value for money", 
    "Perfect for our dinette area. The glass top takes up less visible space and it's plenty of room for two of us to sit around and spend leisurely mornings over coffee.", 
    "great table, pretty stable, chrome not too flashy --worried would clash with brushed nickel in kitchen but looks great", 
    "This table is beautiful and easy to put together. I easily did it myself in about an hour.", 
    "I love my table, it's very sturdy and looks very nice with the chairs I bought.", 
    "Love this table. My clients model dining room is going to look great with this table and the four white wireleg chairs", 
    "It arrived on time and in perfect condition. It looks very nice. Thank you!", 
    "Cool, retro, perfect for my lanai", 
    "Well made, sturdy and better looking than the picture.", 
    "Great product for the price, sturdy & easy to assemble!", 
    "Suprisingly nice for the price.", 
    "Table is not the most stable. Price was right.", 
    "This table was easy to assemble and very sturdy.", 
    "Expands the illusion of our kitchen by virtue of being glass. Very stylish and updates our look.", 
    "I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. The table arrived in only two days was easy to put together, and also easy to level on my old crooked floor. Great quality for the price! Highly recommend.", 
    "We had a pedestal table on BO via another website. After multiple delays we ordered this one at half the price. Very strudy. easy to assemble. Super value. Extremely happy for price. Normal size chairs do not slide fully under the table because legs are recessed from table edge. Looks like picture. Much more sturdy than I expected for price.", 
    "I brought our whole porch from Overstock.Com. We are thrilled with everything. Didn't have to go to a store. Read the reviews from previous customers. The table was easy to assemble. Looks great with chair I bought from Overstock.com two years ago.", 
    "Very nice look, but not sturdy. Returned the same day.", 
    "Easy to keep clean and looks great. Gives the area some visual space.", 
    "Nice looking with white chairs for our show room. Its modern, sleek and fits well with our decor."
