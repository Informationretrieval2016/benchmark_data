    "It took us few hours to put it together and it looked beautiful! However once we put it up, one of the doors opened and the hinges broke out and the draw dropped. Didn't even get to use it. Very poor quality. Would not buy or recommend this product.", 
    "We bought this to house our shoes, since our puppy started going through a shoe chewing phase. Overall, it looks great and holds everything we need it to. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because the screw securing the tip-out drawer for shoes comes out with light, daily use (2-5 x opening/day), making the shoe storage unusable. This also scuffs up the piece around the inside of the affected drawer opening side. It is fairly easy to put the screw back in, but it takes time. We've had this happen twice now, since buying this piece earlier this month."
