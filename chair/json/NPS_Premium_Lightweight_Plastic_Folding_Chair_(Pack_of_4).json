  "reviews": [
    "Excited to receive - opened box & ready to go. But I found the sit was a little small - I am 5'4\" and 125 lbs, and it feels like the seat is not deep enough. We are using them for our guests in a pinch, but I'd try another chair if I were to order another set if you want people to sit for more than 30 min. Light enough and feels sturdy.", 
    "I received the chairs two days before an event I was doing. Used them with two card tables and the guests raved over how comfortable they were", 
    "Love these light weight chairs", 
    "Received my chairs two was broken called the company and they replaced them with no problem", 
    "These chairs (in burgundy) are extremely comfortable and well built. They are very smooth to open and close and offer plenty of comfort for longer seating periods. The burgundy color matches beautifully with our redwood-stained decks. I recommend these chairs 100%. A real no-brainer.", 
    "These are a good very basic chair. Use them for extra guests for parties. They are not super comfortable but quite functional. At the price they are a reasonable value and do the job.", 
    "Chairs just what expected . Were used as planned and they worked well.", 
    "i enjoyed working with the sales rep/ to help i had a small problem but they helped to get it all worked out. thanks a lot", 
    "I ordered 4 black chairs for my childrens playroom, they are well made and durable. I would definitely recommend.", 
    "I needed the chairs in a game room used by teenage football players and they are wonderful chairs. The boys are not gentle with them. The construction is super. I am really satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "Works well for what I need for events, good chairs."
