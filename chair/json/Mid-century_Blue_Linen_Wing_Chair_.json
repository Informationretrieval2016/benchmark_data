    "THE COLOR BLUE IS TRUE TO MY COMPUTER. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A 5 STAR BUT THE CHAIR IS VERY STIFF TO SIT ON. I KNEW THAT BEFORE BUYING IT, SO IT DIDN'T DETER ME. I'M HOPING IT WILL SOFTEN OVERTIME. IT IS SMALLER THAN I EXPECTED, BUT FOR AN ACCENT CHAIR THAT'S FINE.", 
    "Perfect and easy to put together. Hard seat but looks great. The color is amazing.", 
    "I like the look of the chair. However, the cushion doesn't seem like it fits very snug/flush to the back of the chair.", 
    "Beautiful chairs to look at but very hard and not cozy at all.", 
    "This chair looks awesome in our living room. The color matches the picture and it was simple to put together. It is a very very FIRM chair.", 
    "Very uncomfortable to sit on and the color is very dull. As bad was the way the chair was delivered. left on the front of my property on top of a plant in a neighborhood where there is a lot of burglary. Couldn't carry the box in by myself. Had to take it out of the box on the lawn and drag it into the house."
