    "I'm not sure this will ever get listed but, here goes .... this is the CHEESIEST piece of furniture I have in my townhouse. I bought 2 of these side tables because they are narrow and have storage space and fit perfectly on each side of my red couch. They arrived when I wasn't at home and my darling hubby surprised me by having them all assembled when I got home. BIG MISTAKE! I would have sent them back the second I opened the box, had I been here. They are made of PRESSED WOOD, not REAL wood; some of the pieces (maybe ALL) are covered with PAPER that sticks against the \"wood\" and is already peeling at the slide out shelf; the corners are pointed and sharp; the color is described as cherry ~ NOT EVEN CLOSE, more like an oak/walnut mix; the \"wood\" is shiny like a plastic finish. We are stuck with them, since NO WAY would I even ASK hubby to disassemble , repack and send back to O/S. I will say, on a more positive note, that the tables LOOK decent enough, but knowing what they are MADE of, I would NEVER have bought them. There was a review made from another buyer who gave these tables a 5 ... uh uh, no 5 here. I'm sticking with my 2-3.", 
    "The table is very solid and pretty. I love the finish, and the color and style blend with the furniture I already have. I had a problem putting the table together. The instructions are for someone who is talented in assembling the table. I have to reassemble the table as I put it together wrong. I wish they were more explicit with their instructions. Too much trial and error for me.", 
    "I needed a sturdy magazine/table for my husband by his rocker and when I found this one I knew it would do the job. I am so pleased with it and he loves it; it holds all of his magazines on the shelves inside and I put the new ones in the rack in the back of table. I put it together myself (so I could surprise him with it) and it went together beautifully. It's a very sturdy table so it won't topple over on the carpeted floor it's on, that's a plus for me. I highly recommend this table if you are looking for something sturdy and beautiful.", 
    "Unique size, shape, and utility. Perfect for my needs in an office / den space. Assembly tough......poor instructions.", 
    "Very disappointed! Holes were not drilled where they were suppose to be. Did not get all the hardware. I tried calling to get missing knob but never able to reach anyone. Just gave up!:Would not order this unless already This is the first thing I have ordered from Overstock I can't recommend! I would only order if already assembled!!!!", 
    "Perfect for us ... Just as described", 
    "Excellent, sturdy, heavy fits narrow space available", 
    "I LOVE THEM!!!! Easy to put together, plenty of storage, good looking!!!!!!For a side table that does not take up much room it holds a lot of stuff!!!!!", 
    "This is one excellent side table. It can hold a great deal of items, but the shelf slides out and extends the top surface. I use it daily and it meets all my needs for a side table. The size is great, multiple use is excellent and the side table has a very nice finish.", 
    "Work perfect in the spot I needed them", 
    "The side table fit perfectly in the location I selected. Delivery was timely. The only issue is that the instructions were not as clear as they should have been. I had to put together a couple of times to make it fit properly and yes I did go by written instructions and diagrams. I am usually very good at putting together furniture pieces, but the instructions were a bit confusing. Over all - very good product. Sturdy wood construction. Very pleased!", 
    "I really like this side table. It is a nice height for someone having a drink on the couch, and yet slim enough so as to not take up too much room. Though it is made press board laminate and not real wood, it is still a heavy piece of furniture. My only complaint is that there were scratches on the sides of the top pieces (I purchased two) and there was no touch-up paint included.", 
    "I have had many compliments on this little table and already have a cousin that wants it", 
    "This space-saving side table is a great place to set my coffee cup.", 
    "purchased for my wife and meets all requirements of hers.", 
    "Pretty easy to put together and good quality. We are very happy with our purchase of this product.", 
    "We purchased two of these nifty economical little tables. They fit perfectly on either side of a loveseat on a small wall. Love the storage in addition to the pull out top tray. The only complaint I have and it is minor is that there was a bit of a scuff mark on each of the side of the table tops. A little brown shoe polish and it disappeared! Perfect for a play room and great for the price!", 
    "They are very nice, but very difficult to put together. Some of the screw holes are not lined up. Some of the screws are missing. But once you get passed that and get them put together they are very nice.", 
    "the only good thing about this table were the instuctions.I thew it away. the screws were not long enough and the other fastners did not line up with the holes they were supposed to fit into.a complete waste of money!", 
    "This storage side table works well with my d\u00e9cor and doubles as a magazine rack. It's a great \"all in one\" addition to any d\u00e9cor.", 
    "Took about 2 hours to assemble this side table, a couple of the pieces didn't line up exactly but my son managed to get it together. The color is exactly like the picture and it's a reasonably sturdy piece. It is narrow so the storage is limited.", 
    "Thank u I love it already", 
    "perfect for what we needed", 
    "Easy to assemble, I dd it in less than an hour.", 
    "I do detailed beadwork and the pullout is perfect!!!!", 
    "These tables are great for your couch or love seat,good price and easy to put together.", 
    "These tables are absolutely beautiful. I got free shipping and they were delivered quickly. Love them!", 
    "This wooden side table is the perfect size for the space it is used in. We had a little difficulty putting it together. Not all the pieces were labled and the instructions were not quite clear. The piece for the shelf was not pre-drilled correctly, so we had to redrill it. Finally got it together and like it. We picked this piece for its size and storage and that's great.", 
    "I would recommend but with a caveat. The predrilled holes for the door hings and door stop were drilled in the wrong place and were completely off plumb from top to bottom. I had to drill new holes so the door was even and level.", 
    "too a little time to put this together. but it serves my needs, holds a lot and takes up very little room. I was dissapointed at one thing, I thouight it had a drawer but it's a pull out shelf instead.", 
    "product is cheap material--and not easy to put together", 
    "Bought for my mother for a Christmas present.. Not to bad to put together.. I wish they came put together.. Very heavy in the box.. Just what she was looking for!", 
    "I've been looking for a side table by my recliner. This table met all my requirements. The magazine rack is very helpful and takes care of my clutter. There's plenty of storage inside the cabinet and the pull out shelf is nice, although I don't really use it. The only downside is that it would be nice if they gave descriptions in the assembly and not just pictures. It can be confusing, so take some time to figure it out. The table is heavy and having 2 people to put it together would be helpful although I am a female and assembled it by myself. The style is really nice and would go with almost any d\u00e9cor. I have seen similar tables for a lot more money than this, so even though it's made of heavy duty particle board, it was worth the money.", 
    "We ordered one and were so happy with that one we ordered two more. Even though they are small and fit well at ends of the couch and between our recliners. Having a pull out shelf, closed in storage and a magazine rack at the back makes them very unique end tables.", 
    "Great functional table and very attractive. When space is limited this table fits all requirements. Pull out shelf can hide TV guide or nicely holds food plate or dish. Inside door has 1 shelf which provides plenty of storage for all sorts of items. The magazine holder in back holds plenty of magazines or book. The height is perfect for ease of access in reaching for items. Also, the length also allows display of plant or candle etc and still have room for remote & drink. Instructions were somewhat vague, but still only took 35 min to assemble."
