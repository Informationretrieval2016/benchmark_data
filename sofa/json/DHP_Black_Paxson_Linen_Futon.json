    "I would give I stars if posdible! Two legs are cheap plastic that will likely break because they are connected at the middle points to hold the piece from collapsing in the middle. This is sure to break! Fabric is a cheap shiney outdoor type not even close to the soft linen in the description! Horrible!", 
    "Can fit three people. I have had the couch for a month and the cushion is starting to indent already the cushion is very thin and will give way very easily.", 
    "Really nice modern style. Well made and sturdy. Easy to make into bed . Only negative I would say not too comfortable to sleep on. But a great piece for the price and small apartment"
