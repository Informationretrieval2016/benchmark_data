    "This cabinet is just as pictured & serves a good purpose for storage in the bathroom.It can hold toiletries,towels , small appliances like hair dryers, curling irons etc. The shelf in the upper cabinet is adjustable. The drawers are handy for small bottles like vitamins, makeup ,perfume, soaps etc.Assembly is not difficult, but takes time. The illustration for drawer assembly is not very good. Over all this is good value for the money , looks nice & is convenient .", 
    "I purchased this for the laundry room. It's small enough to not be in the way, but big enough for things like a sewing kit, lint brushes, etc. It went together easily and seems pretty sturdy. Only design change I would make would be to have the option of installing the door either left-opening or right-opening (it only opens to the left).", 
    "i was very excited to get this as I had been looking for a long time for something that fit what I needed. I was very sad to see it was damaged, not just in one place but a few. It has a scratch on the side and the bottom front drawer. One of the feet was crushed and it was missing some important hardware. I called OS and they were great, offering me to send it back and get a new one, I opted for a partial refund and I \"fixed\" the issues myself. The construction was very sturdy, so if it wasn't damaged I think it would have been great!", 
    "This item was a good size for the limited space in our bathroom, so we tried it. It didn't take too long to put together, but my husband and I worked on it together and it took maybe an hour. Attaching the door worked better with 2 people to make sure it was straight. The alignment of the drawers is slightly off (some drawers have more space between than others), and unfortunately with this particular item there is no way to adjust this like there is with other drawer units we have assembled, but it isn't so bad that you notice on casual inspection. The end product looks as pictured, maybe a little more like off white than white. We are putting it in front of tile, so did not anchor it to the wall, and it is a tiny bit wobbly, but mostly we only notice when moving it to clean the floor underneath.The drawers were very loud when closing, so we added felt pads, and that seems to work well. Overall, has a surprising amount of storage space, looks nice, so we are pleased.", 
    "Decent product with the modern look I wanted to match my vanity. -Putting together is a bit of XXXX....about an hour per cabinet -paint is bit of dirty white...not bright white if that's what you think you see - the cams for loving unit together are very cheap...broke one and they send no extras -all in all you get what you pay for....just think a little more quality would be expected", 
    "This linen cabinet was just what I expected except for the color. The color was not a deal breaker. I installed it myself and it took longer than other reviewers indicated. Only one (1) drawer handle was off centered and gorilla glue fixed it. It looks great!", 
    "Overall this is an Ok item. The product came missing important pieces but overstock was able to get them out to me quickly to get it assembled. The paint on it is not very good, you can see place where it had been chipped and painted over. It seems fairly sturdy and was very easy to assemble, I put the cabinet together myself. The only reason I won't be returning it is that its the size I needed and close to the right color. It is it is off white NOT white.", 
    "Very difficult assembly. The bottom drawer will not open. The magnet does not hold the door closed, so it is slightly ajar. The side panel arrived with scratches from rubbing against the door panel during shipping.", 
    "It was very difficult to assemble and the quality is terrible. When you close a drawer, the door on the cabinet pops open. The legs are uneven. The color is a murky, off-white, not a bright white as shown. The drawers are shallow and don't fully open. You can get something better from****** for less. Even the plastic white drawers you can get at ********* for *** work better than this.", 
    "This product is time consuming to assemble and the directions are unclear. Additionally, some of the pieces were not numbered. The other issue I had with this product is that when assembled some of the pieces are not flush creating gaps in the drawers.", 
    "This is my first negative review given on O. These (I bought the small cabinet as well) are flimsy and cheap. They were a nightmare to put together. Some of the holes were not drilled properly. The screws/bolts that held the drawers together broke with the least amount of tension. The color is not a bright white, but instead a dirty white. The glass on the doors rattles even after tightening. I would recommend spending a little more money and getting something of decent quality. I guess you get what you pay for, but I never expected such poor quality. I guess if you use these pieces in a bath that does not get much use, and they are for aesthetics only, they might be OK, but I can tell already (after a few weeks) that they will not hold up very well. One of the drawer fronts has already come lose. Maybe others who purchased this are not having the same experience. I hope that is the case.", 
    "Very cute but had more assembly involved than I expected (about 14 separate pieced) and smaller than I anticipated. Looks cute in the bathroom.", 
    "It's always a gamble to purchase something sight unseen. This cabinet is a disappointment. The paint was marred on the exterior of one panel and the shelf wasn't constructed for proper assembly. Guess that is why it was discounted.", 
    "screws are very small and phillips head strips very easily. i had to drill out all the holes to get the screws in.", 
    "Like all reviews say, it is a pain to put together.", 
    "my husband complained the entire time he put these cabinets together. said he would rather get something from ****. poor quality product and the drawers lose the screws all the time.", 
    "Not everything lined up right and the drawers a kind of wonkey. It's fine for what it is but not the best quality", 
    "not easy to assemble and quality is not really good but you get what you pay for it", 
    "This cabinet was very nice it was just taller than I had expected. But it looked very good and went together very easily.", 
    "Perfect cabinet for a small bathroom. Holds quite a bit as the shelf is adjustable. Drawers are large too. It fits any decorating scheme. Love it!", 
    "just what I was looking for to store a few items in for the guest bathroom.", 
    "It's a bit smaller than I had anticipated, but overall it's a great fit for a smaller bathroom area.", 
    "My master bathroom doesn't have traditional medicine cabinets and this is perfect! Considering all the pieces it wasn't difficult to assemble. It even has holes and screws to attach it to the wall. A great purchase that looks good too!", 
    "Fits well in our bathroom. Quality is good, but not superior. We're still happy with the purchase.", 
    "So disappointed. It's really small and virtually useless.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Looks great. I wish it were a little wider, but makes a nice addition to my Mum's room.", 
    "Bought this for a bathroom with zero storage. It suffices for most bath products, but the drawers are shallow and it's a bit cumbersome to access items on the back of the shelves. Works fine for smaller bath items.", 
    "Very useful in new bathroom.", 
    "I built in a 4-piece bathroom, whirlpool tub, walk-in shower, contemporary vessel sink and pedestal, but lacked a storage space. This fits the room perfectly., In combination with the small wall-mounted cabinet, the bathroom is perfect.These are in the main bath in a rental house.", 
    "It's a little wobbly when you put it together, but it is a good bathroom piece for storage and decor.", 
    "The cabinet came with some dings/dents that aren't the end of the world. After it was put together, most of the imperfections couldn't be seen. Fits very well in a small bathroom where you need more storage and seems sturdy. I think it is overpriced for the value you get, but, everything is nowadays.", 
    "I needed a cabinet for my grooming room and this one works great for me. When I received it There were 2 drawer handles missing. I called overstock and they were very nice and were great in helping to get me the handles quickly. The bottom drawer sticks a bit but other then that I love it.", 
    "In spite of all the parts, it was relatively easy to put together. A couple of things didn't line up, but it was easy to deal with. The drawers are a little small, but it's a great cabinet.", 
    "Easy to put together; the directions were clear and easy to follow. Cabinet is sturdy and very pretty. too small for linens though- I'm using it for assorted bath products i.e shampoo & toiletries that won't fit in medicine chest.", 
    "Looks super great. One drawer turned out a little cattywampus but we switch drawers around and it worked out fine.", 
    "Took a couple of hours to assemble with lots of experience. Very frustrated because the bottom drawer will not open and close. Keeps jamming and I'm now seeing other comments about the same. No matter which drawer you try on the bottom, same problem. Looks good but down one drawer.", 
    "A lot of work to assemble ! Company put two front panels in the box instead of a front and back . Had to improvise and final product is not perfect", 
    "This cabinet is exactly what I expected based on the previous reviews. The materials are inexpensive, but the overall look is nice. Assembly isn't too difficult - took me about an hour from start to finish. It looks nice in the bathroom and it works well. The drawers slide in and out smoothly and the door opens and closes well. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase.", 
    "The door arrived slightly cracked. Overstock were very responsive about shipping out a new one and updating me on its progress. It was difficult to put together. Screws were unmarked and loose in the box so I left it up to my handy husband to figure out. It frustrated him. Some of the screws are too short to make it through the magnet that holds the door closed, so we had to buy longer screws. The piece looks good and sevres its purpose. Not too expensive, so it's what I expected.", 
    "This piece looks pretty good, but it is not the color in the photo - it is an off white almost pale yellow/cream color. The drawers as so tiny, they can't hold much.", 
    "Just what I needed in a small bathroom. Perfect .", 
    "This is a fairly priced, nice looking piece for the bathroom. Finish is sloppy in some places which is unfortunate. Instructions for putting together are very easy to follow.", 
    "I was looking for a white cabinet to hold all the things that I had on my bathroom counter as it looked very cluttered. I only had 15 inches to work with and this cabinet with the frosted pane at the top was the perfect fit. I attempted to assemble it, but it was wobbly. My husband reassembled it and it became very sturdy. I purchased little plastic shelves to hold items that were very thin such as lipstick, eyeliner, etc and that slips right on top of the drawer without interfering with the drawer movement. It was the perfect solution. My husband did say that assembling the drawer movement portion was not easy.", 
    "This was very easy to put together. Came with all parts. I have a very small bathroom with no storage so this worked very well. Great storage for a great price.", 
    "This is a sturdy, attractive unit that adds a bit of character to a bathroom - reminiscent of an old-fashioned doctor's office with it's frosted front. The drawers are not deep, keeping the unit a reasonable fit for a bathroom, and there is plenty of room in the two enclosed cabinets shelves. Be forewarned that this is not a bright white, but an off-white. Otherwise a great storage and accent piece;", 
    "Put it together, instructions were good. well packaged. Really like the cabinet. Works well for extra storage", 
    "I would not recommend. You have to put every little piece together, even drawer sliders. The screws don't fit properly, so it doesn't function correctly!", 
    "I have a large bathroom with a dated vanity that doesn't offer much storage space. So I purchased the 4 drawer, 2 drawer linen cabinets and the medicine cabinet. I now love my bathroom and these pieces have enabled me to get organized. The pieces look expensive and the frosted glass gives a great look to the furniture. I highly recommend these pieces and am thrilled with my purchase. One piece of the glass had a mark that I couldn't remove but Overstock immediately sent me a replacement. THey were great to work with.", 
    "This is a great piece that i think looks more expensive than we paid for it. I will say that it took me and my partner over 2 hours to put this thing together, but it was worth it I think. It looks sharp, it\u0092s sturdy, and functions well (especially good drawers).", 
    "I purchased this for my daughter's college house. We needed something inexpensive and compact. My husband and I put it together in about an hour. We added wood glue just to be sure it stayed together better. However, instructions did not suggest this and it is not included with product. The drawers are smaller and will not hold anything large or heavy. We just purchased this 2 weeks ago, but so far so good. We were pleased with this purchase."
