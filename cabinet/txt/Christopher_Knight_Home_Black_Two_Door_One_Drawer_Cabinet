A single drawer tops a two-door cabinet with a middle shelf within. Eight ring pulls and a beautiful rub-through finish in Magee Black are a striking combination.Materials: PB/MDF with Birch veneer, Poplar, PolyColor/Finish: Magee BlackDimensions: 32 inches wide x 12 inches deep x 36 inches highStyleCasual, Contemporary, Traditional, TransitionalMaterialMDF, WoodTypeAccent Tables, Cabinets, Console Tables, Sofa TablesFinishBlack Finish, RubbedShapeRectangleAssemblyAssembledColorBlack
