    "I used this tower in my bathroom with very tall ceilings and it looks great! I have several of the Elements collection tables (also from O.co) throughout my home and this piece fits right in although it has more of a \"rustic\" appearance. Metal is textured and slightly bumpy...solid as a rock. Might want a helper to hold the legs in place while setting on the shelves and lining up the next pole. It's large...so measure your doorway if assembling it in another room. Love it and will add to the collection soon. Thanks for another nice repsentation of the \"reclaimed\" look Overstock!", 
    "Very pleased overall; has the industrial look I was after. I was surprised to find that instead of four floor-to-ceiling rods supporting the shelves there are 20 individual poles-- which made for a very wonky and dubious assembly. Also, poor assembly instructions-- it should have been straightforward but I had to backtrack. Not important to me, but the caster wheels do not swivel. In the end, though, it looks great.", 
    "I saw a tower at al high end national retailer and wanted it, but was dissuaded by the price and the need to be at home for delivery and set up. This appears to be the exact same thing which I assembled myself in 20 minutes and was delivered without my being home. Much better price.", 
    "I bought this to go with a reclaimed wood and metal desk from a high end retailer. The shelves on this appear to be made out of a wood composite (like you would use on an outside deck) so on close inspection, you can tell it is not wood. However, because the shelves are so deep, you can place books facing to the front and then place some books on each side facing toward the sides (like a U of books). That means for the floor space, you can store a large number of books.", 
    "I ordered 2 of these towers. once put together the tower is crooked and one section sticks out one way and the next section the other way. Not even close to straight. I thought I may have just gotten one bad one so I put the other together and found the same problem. Its too bad because the towers were very cool material and color but if they are not straight they look like junk. I want my money back.", 
    "Have this in a family room--wanted an industrial look---as we have decorated with Harley Davidson items---also want a piece of furniture that you we didn't have to worry about spills or grandkids.", 
    "I had to return it. It came out lopsided and an extremely rustic look. My husband thought it belonged in the garage. I really wanted this to work out but I had to return it.", 
    "While it's not horrible, and was easier to put together than expected, the metal is not terribly high quality, and the finish is back/rust and very textured- almost crusty. The wood is passable when items are placed, but it has a definitely artificial feel if viewed up close. It suits the purpose, but I would not have bought if I'd viewed before purchase. Other items in the line are much nicer looking.", 
    "I was very excited to find this tower for our storage needs in our living room and was encouraged by the positive reviews. I too had seen a similar tower for much more money at a large national retailer and was very hopeful that this would be comparable for much less money. Unfortunately, after we put it together, the metal posts holding up the shelves that telescope on each other were not all straight, so the overall effect was that the posts looked bent, or leaning at slightly off angles rather than parallel to each other. It looked horrible so we had to return it. Given the above unevenness, it did not seem at all sturdy. Overstock was very good about taking it back but it was still a hassle to put it together, repack it, and ship it back.", 
    "Loved this. I restained the wood in a matter of minutes to get a more red color and that made the dark metal really pop! Looks great.", 
    "I loved this tower, however, my husband thought the look too industrial. The piece is made with very heavy metal and the shelves are a composite wood. Worked perfect for what I was looking for.", 
    "We purchased two of these shelves for my husband's home office. Installation took a good amount of time, which was fine, but they are leaning. The pipes aren't all straight when they twist into each other. It's very frustrating. We are too lazy to break them both down and return them.", 
    "Looks like the photo, but is cheap looking laminate over some composite product. It is NOT wood. Pipe sections between shelves do not screw in equally, so the unit is slightly crooked when completed and is IMPOSSIBLE to square up. I will NOT take it apart one more time to try to amend the problem. Wheels are essentially decorative, rolling only side to side and not forward and back. Are sharp, unprotected metal that I'm sure will soon gouge my wood floor. I'm very, very disappointed given the substantial price. I feel ripped off, and would let Overstock come pick it up and give me a refund in a New York minute. But I won't even try to get the mess back in the box. TERRIBLE purchase. Be warned.", 
    "this is a very good look for a fraction of the price. i am happy with my purchase", 
    "Love the color and the fact that it can be rolled.", 
    "I have gotten several pieces of the Renate rustic furniture for my bonus room, and I love it! My only concern is that it is a little uneven between shelves because of how the poles screw in.", 
    "As mentioned in other reviews, the towers were not straight vertically. I ended up rigging them with spacers under the wheels. They are heavy and nicely made, aside from them not being level. The color will go with a gray or beige colored room. They are in my husband's man cave, so as far as he is concerned they are perfect... We also purchased the TV stand and had no problems with it. They are a little time consuming to put together, but no more bothersome than expected.", 
    "Overall a well-made and sturdy piece of furniture....I loved the colors and modern look of the bookshelf...Definitely a good value for the price, I was thrilled with how it looks in my space...it compares well to more expensive pieces that look similiar.", 
    "This is a gorgeous piece and looks like that expensive piece at that expensive store (you know!). The wheels to not really work, which doesn't bother me, but is good to note. It's a great height and I always get compliments. This is a great piece!", 
    "& hard to assemble. Still pretty nice", 
    "Love the sturdiness and wood finish with weathered grey hues.", 
    "Looks great! I love the industrial feel to these. Unfortunately they're not the sturdiest of shelves, but they were quite simple to assemble. The wheels on them are 100% just for decoration. The wheels don't rotate at all, so wheeling these large things around isn't the easiest thing.", 
    "Missing pieces, not gray at all, does not stand straight", 
    "It's a little bit of effort to put together but very solid and attractive.", 
    "Very simple to put together. Appears it will be very sturdy.Looks great in the bathroom.", 
    "Aesthetic industrial feel with nice material and a sturdy build.", 
    "I needed this for a small space to hold my TV and music components, looks just like the picture, easy to put together, considering buying more from this line if I can find a place to put it.", 
    "The tower I received is not grey, more of an expresso brown. Shelves are brown with a grey wash. One of the legs had a solder plug in the female part of the screw, preventing the insertion of the combining leg. As there are no extra legs, my tower is now shorter by one shelf. Too much of a hassle to get all this stuff back in the box to send back.", 
    "If you are OCD about things, this is probably not the item for you. The vertical bars screw into each other and have the tendency to not perfectly be vertical. If this doesn't bother you, it is a great piece.", 
    "The shelf tilts ever so slightly to one side no matter how to try to adjust it.", 
    "Heavy well built bookshelves to go with desk and console. Nice to have coordinating pieces. The gray goes well with gray in my room. Just what I was looking for.", 
    "Great looking, great price,easy assembly! !!", 
    "We bought 2 of these and they both were lopsided when you put them together. Very disappointing!", 
    "Fits right in with my modern goth chic aesthetic. Love the size and wheels for added functionality and versatility. Don't hesitate. Lovely", 
    "Durable/heavy for the price", 
    "Perfect restoration look shelf to display my restoration look style without the restoration or pottery barn price", 
    "I purchased two of the Renate Grey Towers, I also have the desk and end table. I use then in my spare bedroom \"Office/Changing Room\" for additional closet and storage space, I purchased 2 heavy duty 6 foot metal rods and simulated a rolling rack effect...I LOVE IT! All the shelving lends tons of storage, I use different styles of baskets (woven and wood) to add to the rustic feel. GREAT PURCHASE and the towers are VERY WELL BUILT!", 
    "Looked for this style of bookcase at several places at triple the price. Pleased with the style and look.", 
    "These takes a while to put together and a lot of elbow grease. Not difficult just that there are many pieces to assemble. Looks great in our great room, the wheels make it easy to move around when you want to rearrange the furniture in the room.", 
    "They are perfect for my home office. They are 100 pounds each, so very solid and nice to look at. The only small concern is that because each pipe is individual between the shelves, if you really looks, they don't look as straight as they could be. Overall, I'm very happy with them and they are definitely a nice solid piece in my office.", 
    "These shelves are very heavy. They look a little inexpensive. They are hard to keep in a straight line when putting together so mine are a bit wobbly. One of the boxes was previously opened and was partially put together.", 
    "I purchased the book case and two side tables for our guest room, and I also purchased two towers for our master. My husband assembled all of them this past weekend and, while they look good and seem to be sturdy (they are very heavy), they have a very strong odor to it. It smells like wet paint/spray paint. I'm hoping it will eventually go away but the odor can be very bothersome to sensitive noses. We are letting it \"air out\" in our living room before placing them in the rooms which are small and enclosed and will hold in the odor. The pictures of the products are accurate although I would not describe them as \"grey\" at all. The shelves have streaks of grey/silver which you cannot tell from the pictures but overall, the products are dark brown. We have dark brown wood floors, so the products match a lot with the floors which is why I was hoping there would be more grey to them. If these products did not have a strong odor, I would have given \"quality\" a 4/5 star.", 
    "These were easy to put together. Love the weathered grey wood. They are very sturdy and have substantial display and storage space. They are very industrial looking with no refinement at all, so be sure that is what you are after.", 
    "Looks nice. Looks great with matching pieces I bought. Holds a lot without taking up a lot of room.", 
    "The renate series is perfect for an industrial chic decor. I read the reviews before buying and was somewhat skeptical at first, but now I know how great this series truly is. Some of the bad reviews are consumers who don't know what industrial chic style is - or aren't prepared for how specific the style can be. But for those of us that are truly going after this type of decor, the Renate series is perfect. I moved into an industrial loft with exposed beams, exposed brick, and stained concrete floors. The renate media console and the renate tower looks great in my space. When people come over, they automatically assume it's a piece from that high end industrial chic retail store (RH). Little do they know I scored these pieces for a little more than 20% of the cost!!!!", 
    "I got the Renate Tower to go along with the media center and love it!!! It is very sturdy and super easy to put together. I am going to buy a 2nd one to complete my media wall.", 
    "I was forced to take it to a specialist and fix the problems, extra cost.", 
    "I would only recommend this if the box you receive is unopened, to try to insure that at least most of the parts will be there. I ordered this bookcase for my daughter's new house..she was thrilled to get it and began to assemble. She noted that the box had obviously been opened before she got it. first, the washers were missing which were necessary to begin the project ..I c ontacted Overstock and they were quick to respond to my email and offer to send out the washers. We received the part, began again and soon realized that the coasters which were supposed to be on the bottom of each leg were missing also. Same thing, they mailed the other missing parts quickly...again. just a pain to deal with what is supposed to be a new item that was obviously opened and robbed for parts.lt wasn't inspected at all, just grabbed and shipped out. This is happening more often than not lately ,"
