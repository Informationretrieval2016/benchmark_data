    "I purchased this sofa for a den. I needed something smaller than the full sized sofas and this was the perfect size. There is some assembly but it is very easy to do. The seat cushions are vacuum packed and fluffed up as soon as we took them out of the packaging. The color is a light beige and the fabric is soft but feels to be good quality. I am very pleased with this sofa."
