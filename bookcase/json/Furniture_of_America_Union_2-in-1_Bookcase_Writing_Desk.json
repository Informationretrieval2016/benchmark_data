    "I don't think I have ever received a box that had as many pieces and/or hardware as this desk/bookcase. I opened the instructions and one of the only sentences on the page was that two people are necessary for assembly. I planned on assembling the piece alone because I live alone -- I wish it had said that on the website! All that being said, three evenings later I had the bookcase/desk put together and it works well. All of the drilled holes and the hardware do not match perfectly but they match well enough and any screws that don't go all the way into their place are not visible. The piece is sturdy. I would only recommend this to a friend if I told him/her about the building process, and maybe I would offer an experienced hand as well.", 
    "We got this for my teen's room, because we needed to organize a study area in a small space. This will do the trick, but it is barely large enough for a laptop. The shelf space is also limited in terms of the books and materials that she can store on it. But, all in all, it will work for the space and it LOOKS good!", 
    "It is self assemble but **** furniture is much easier than this. Many of the holes were not drilled properly if at all. It required a lot of reworking.", 
    "I just needed a small desk for my apartment, something that looked good and wasn't intrusive. This was a perfect fit & didn't take me very long to put together myself.", 
    "I purchased this desk because I don't have a lot of room and needed something practical. I am very happy with my purchase and it looks great.", 
    "great space saver. quick desk when its need. other than that, makes a great display case/place to store some things. didn't have a problem assembling it and got to my place in a few days.", 
    "We looked at similar products elsewhere and this is by far the best deal for the money. It is vey sturdy. Directions for assembly good have been better. They do not include enough color disks to cover all the screws on each side. It is nice.", 
    "I was thinking to replace my traditional computer desk with this fancy bookcase/desk. However, my PC monitor doesn't fit and the table is not strong enough for taking the pressing when writing or typing.", 
    "All parts did not fit exactly together. Had to be glued in some areas. Would not buy again.", 
    "Needed to dress up and empy corner and this works just fine. Put a low padded saddle style stool with it, looks nice.", 
    "Great desk and what I was looking for.", 
    "I don't imagine it would work well for an actual desk if used regularly. The quality is as expected for the price. It looks nicer than it is and has been great for my vanity over the last few weeks. I have it on carpet and it is not wobbly. Bit of a bear to put together but I was able to do it by myself. The stickers provided to cover the hardware work well and blend in nicely with the piece.", 
    "Nice piece, took some effort to put together but functional and fits in a small area..", 
    "Packaged well for shipping, except for instructions to assemble, One call to Overstock and full assembly instructions were emailed. As stated in other reviews assembly is not easy, and is very time consuming, unless you are familiar with assembling furniture. For sale price good value! Be familiar with the cam lock instruction page...that was hard to figure out. MUST HAVE TWO PEOPLE TO ASSEMBLE AND CARRY. Perfect for your laptop and printer in a small space.", 
    "I only opened the box to see that the color was not true to the picture - it was almost black. I sent it back. Fortunately, Overstock accepted the return.", 
    "This is a very nice unit for small spaces and it will blend with many decors.", 
    "Super space saver meets both needs to keep my laptop and office nececities", 
    "I was worried the fold down shelf would be too small but it fits a standard laptop It's great for small spaced. Sturdy enough. Satisfied :)", 
    "The shipping was quick and product was delivered with no damage. The directions could have been better - no words just pictures & arrows indicating what piece of hardware goes where. Assembly was challenging due to the pilot holes not drilled deep enough. Unfortunately, you didn't know that until you had stripped the screws. Some of the finish was scratched and chipped but overall looks ok and hopefully will get much use out of it.", 
    "We have been very pleased with the Union 2-in-1 bookcase/desk. We had a large desk in the guest room that was primarily used for monthly bill paying and an occasional conference call. We were looking for something smaller and this is perfect! When we need it, we have enough workspace for a laptop, notepad and small phone and when we don't it only takes a small amount of space in the corner. This has really opened up the room and makes our use of space that much more efficient. If you are going to spend hours at the desk, this probably doesn't work, but it has been perfect for us. It was a little bit of a pain to put together (about 60-75 minutes doing it myself) but the directions are easy to follow. The color of the wood was as described and the desk is sturdy for the limited use it is designed for. I am not sure I would fill it with textbooks but it does well with all of our desk accessories and whatnot.", 
    "Would not recommend buying this if you're thinking of using it for a leaning bookcase/desk. It's about a foot shorter than the one at Crate and Barrell, which is a big problem because the space between the shelves is not big enough. In particular, the space between the desk part and the shelf above is not big enough to fit a computer monitor. Also seems flimsy because the ladder part of the bookcase is in two pieces that are held together with brackets."
