    "Like it says in the title - I could not be happier. I read all the reviews (yep all of them) and thought I knew what to expect - perhaps \"a knock-off that wasn't quite the real thing but, hey, its cheap\"! In fact it is a reproduction of the much more expensive French original, a reproduction that is all but perfect. (I also bought the counter stools - and have the same view of them - so the reviews are pretty much a cut and past copy!) They are slick, comfortable, attractive and sturdy. The white powder coating is perfect with a very nice shine. They stack - but I don't want to stack them - they are so cute in their new gloss straight from the box! No dents, scratches or flaws at all. The white paint job is crisp and bright. The packing was through and secure, I just loved them from the moment I unpacked them. And the price - what can one say except - sorry France, the design for these chairs may have originated in your land some 100 years ago but the current place to have them made is China. (Sorry, but its true). [You can check the French prices online vita *** dot com or at the French manufacturer's website) If this style suits you (and its not for everyone - Grannies and certain suburbs - I mean you!) then you shouldn't hesitate, snap them up. I have mine in a minimalist - loft style place in the country in Northern California and I would post pix if I could.", 
    "Arrived quickly - no damage, very well packaged. Nice simple design, feel solid. Paint was almost perfect - on close inspection there are very minor imperfections but nothing to fret about. I use these on my patio - stack & cover after use to protect from UV damage. I also like that I can use indoors - the rubber feet are great will not scratch floor. When sacking there are rubber \"bumpers\" on the underside of each chat to protect from scratching. I like to live pretty minimal furniture wise - these are perfect since they work & look great indoor & outdoor. I imagine if you let them sit in the rain the welds will rust - but these can also be repainted easily years down the road - another plus. Seat size I do not end small and I'm 190lbs. Very please overall.", 
    "I just received my white chairs and I love them! They are kind of industrial/country/French all at once, and came without a scratch on them. I have been loving the Tolix chairs, but can't really afford the splurge at the moment. I really love the gunmetal vintage look, but the grey ones in this chair are smooth grey and not the antique look I want. I don't regret going with the white - they are sturdy and lovely! They will match my reclaimed wood farm table perfectly! I can't comment on their durability since they were just delivered, but don't hesitate to buy these if you are after the metal cafe chair look and want a bargain! Another score from Overstock...", 
    "THE PROS: Nice design, comfortable for someone who's 5'8 and 135 lbs, fully assembled one piece design. THE CONS: 3 out of 4 chairs have defects in enamel paint in that there are worn spots or large chips, may not be comfortable with someone with a larger frame as the sides are rather narrow. Overall, I'll use them, and if they hadn't arrived damaged I'd probably give them 5 stars, but just know that you are taking your chances and may have to send them back.", 
    "I loved everything about these chairs...until I sat in them. I am 5'8\" and of average weight, but my hips hit both arms of the chair. I really wanted to keep these chairs, but I had to return them because I knew I would not be able to eat my meals in them every day. So, unfortunately, because of this, I cannot recommend these chairs. Cute, but uncomfortable.", 
    "If you're a woman who wears size 12 pants or larger, or a man who wears size 36 or larger (again, due to hips, not due to tummy)... then chances are that where the arm rests angle down to meet the seat... well, you'll be pinched. That's my size and though I could barely get my bones in there, my flesh was squeezed, and I'm sure if I tried to sit in there even for five minutes, my circulation would have been cut off. Even if you're smaller than this, if you have guests who are this size, they'll be looking to sit somewhere else. However, if you and everyone you know is smaller, then go ahead and get them, because they're well made and look nice.", 
    "I love these chairs....they went perfectly with my kitchen table. I have gotten so many compliments on them. They are comfortable and sturdy. The white is a soft white...not glossy. I am very happy... not regrets.", 
    "I am giving these chairs 5 stars for style. I kept going back and forth about ordering them, and they were sold out for a little while, so as soon as they came back in stock I took a chance and ordered them. All the reviews for these chairs are pretty accurate. If you want a certain style for a great price, these chairs are for you. They are so cute and are pretty much exactly as pictured. I will say, they are a little smaller than I was expecting. They would work great for people of normal height and weight, but for someone that is very overweight, they may have a hard time fitting in this chair because of the arms. Basically if you wouldn't fit in an airplane seat, you wouldn't fit in this chair. I ordered 8 chairs, and the packaging was great, all 8 chairs came undamaged from the shipping. However, there appeared to be a manufacturing defect on two of the chair seats that had caused the powdercoating to crack. I called customer service and they are sending me two new chairs and all it took was 5 minutes on the phone. Overstock's customer service is GREAT. Overall I am pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I purchased these as part of a mini-makeover for my kitchen. They arrived quickly and were packed well, although they did have a few rusted scratches, but are too difficult to send back. Pay attention to the measurements-- The kids & I fit in them just fine, but they were not made for my 6' 3\", 220 lb. husband! They are quite small scale. Overall, a good value-- stylish and functional.", 
    "Needed small chairs that were kid friendly (and aesthetically pleasing to adults) for a small dining area. They don't take up much space, fit all of us fine (was concerned reading reviews)...we are all average size. I have never had metal chairs before and was concerned it would feel TOO industrial, but they don't. They have a really solid feel and are actually pretty comfortable.", 
    "These chairs arrived in fantastic condition. They come well packed and wrapped so that the paint is not scratched etc. They are stronger and better than I expected. They are light weight enough to stack easily and I found them a very good value for the money spent. I bought eight of them to go with our wooden farmstyle table and couldn't be happier. Easy to clean and the paint is good quality. The white is a soft white.", 
    "Great cheap chairs that look very stylish paired with my reclaimed wood table. Only complaint is that they are dirty when they come out of the package. All chairs were streaked with a brown substance which I could only get off with Clorox spray. I guess it may have been oil? Anyway they cleaned up fine and I am glad to have them at my table finally!", 
    "These chairs are darling and were exactly as described. They are a very nice quality and can't beat the price. A standard seat cushion fits perfectly if you want to add one. They are great for indoor & outdoor use. Love them", 
    "These chair are so awesome. I got them to go with my mid-century dining table, and the look amazing. I get compliments on them all the time! They aren't over uncomfortable, and just a great addition to our home. They clean up really easily and after a month of having them, still look brand new.", 
    "these chairs are perfect! they were shipped well and fast and ****. No damage to the chairs. I also used a coupon code to recieve even more off the price of the chairs. I love their modern look. I wanted a new dining set but settled for getting new chairs and keeping my table. wow, i am so glad I did. I also have 3 little girls. first day i got them, my little one drew on it with a crayon and the other with a marker. it wipes right off!!!! i think these chairs are timeless and we will use them for years and years. i also love that they stack right up. im so happy with my purchase!", 
    "I had been looking for chairs to go with my Knoll style pedestal table for quite some time. It has a white base and rosewood top. I had been looking at mid-century knock-offs but was hesitant about the quality of plastic chairs and the longevity/diversity of the style (especially for the price). I came across these and am SO happy with them. They don't carry any of my concerns about the other chairs. They are super sturdy metal chairs, the design is simple, classic, and stylish, and the price, wow, the price is awesome! I needed 5-6 chairs for my table so I went ahead and bought 2 sets so I have a few extras (8 chairs total). Since they stack it was a no-brainier to have a few extras. I was worried about the arm rests hitting the edge of the table, but they are low enough that they slide right under the table and tuck in nicely. I love the metal ones too! I would have got them if they had gone better with the rest of the kitchen.", 
    "Love these chairs. Couldn't find a better deal! They are bright white, sturdy, look amazing with my farm table, and are surprisingly comfortable. I was worried they would look or feel cheap because of the price but they were far better than I imagined.", 
    "Packed perfectly. Work perfectly for our family of 3 kids under six. Super easy to wipe clean, easy for the kids to move to the counter to help cook. Love these chairs!", 
    "These were a great purchase. I bought them for my restaurant and they are very comfortable and look great!", 
    "Had no problems with these. Bought them for indoor and outdoor use, as we like to entertain and sometimes run out of seats. These fit neatly in a corner when we don't need them, but fit in well with our eclectic decor when they are out. No nicks or dings and came well packaged. Great deal for the price.", 
    "I bought these chairs in white. They are chic, simple, clean, solid, I love them! They would look great with a shabby, country or reclaimed wood table. I have mine with a black wood table and it gives the table and my kitchen a contemporary look with the black and white contrast and metal and wood materials. I have a small kitchen so I wasn't sure about the size but the chairs are compact, so they're good for a small kitchen. Could also be used for outdoors...they can have that look if paired with an outdoor table. Don't hesitate. These are great for any kitchen!", 
    "These chairs are fabulous. I could not be more pleased. I really like the arms, which come out just enough for you to comfortably rest your arms on, but because they are curved, nothing gets caught on them. GREAT chairs!", 
    "These are great chairs, especially for the value. For less than i could get some junk on craigslist (or buy one chair at some fancy store), i have a set of high-quality metal chairs. They are stacked in the corner of my house, and they stack well. Perfect for dinner parties or outdoor dining. I need small-space design, and the stacking feature of these chairs was the selling point (plus the classic design). For everyday use, I think they'd need a cushion, but for occasional meals they work fabulously. I'm really thrilled with the deal. These are heavy chairs, which won't blow over in the wind or bend under overweight guests. They arrived really quickly, and weren't completely over-packaged with trash to throw away. Paired with a rustic table, the style is impeccable.", 
    "Bisous to those industrious Chinese! As previous reviews say, these are an affordable option to the French tolix chair. Well packaged, shipped super fast. Very comfortable and sturdy. 190 pound husband did the \"stand on the chair\" to change a lightbulb test . . . approved! Might seem a tight fit for generously endowed derrieres - oh well. Looking forward to many years of use from these. Love it paired with my rustic mexican table. Magazine worthy!", 
    "i love the chairs. i love the chairs. i love the chairs. i love the chairs. i love the chairs. i love the chairs.", 
    "I read the other reviews extensively and all as to what everyone mentioned is true - they are small in scale and not trying to be an exact replica of the famous metal French cafe chairs but more of an 'inspired by' model. They arrived meticulously packed and the only thing I could find wrong was a very minute ding in the metal. Otherwise, they were just as expected and look great with our farmhouse 'white and wood' style dining room!! Love them as well as love the value - all four chairs cost about half of what just ONE chair would've cost in comparison to the 'designer' french brand. Thank you overstock!", 
    "The chairs arrived in just a few days, and I really like them; they go with my beach cottage theme - would work well in a retro style too - because they are metal they can be cold to sit on so I found some thin cushions that look good and add just a touch of color - can't add a photo or I would. These are small chairs and would not be suited to really large people, but are strong enough to hold up to a good amount of wieght. One had some stains and a few scratches - the stains scrubbed off so I did not return - You won't find a better price - World Market has similar looking chairs for double the price - Overstock is a great place to shop and I appreciate the honest reviews - has saved me from getting stuff that looked good in a picture...you never know.", 
    "Made in China, arrived with slight chips to the paint on 3 of the chairs, spots where the spray-paint job looks sloppy and 4 months later (strictly indoor moisture free use) show slight signs of rust starting. Having said that- they would be great for a covered patio (where mine will be moved to soon) or a hip college/dorm-like apartment. These were a temp. alternative to the beautiful but expensive originals. I paired them with a large farm-table and rustic vintage modern industrial decor and it's ok looking. The arms definitely make the chairs stick out abnormally. They are obvious awkward knock-offs to anyone in the know or with a background in design or interior styling but the price-tag may be worth this sacrifice. Also they are a nice modern shade of true white- somewhat hard to find in chairs.", 
    "I purchased the white chairs. Kind of industrial, modern and vintage all at once. These are really nice chairs, although you need a cushion if you will sit in them for any length of time. Also, because of the arms, you cannot push them fully under the table edge so these may not be the best for a very small space. Excellent quality for the price. One of the four had a minor dent that doesn't really show, given the contours of the chair. I put felt pads on the bottom of each foot, as I have found that the black plastic can discolor my floor. I have similar counter stools and they left brownish stains that I can't get off, so I recommend being safe and adding pads, too. My floors are light finished wood.", 
    "These are nice chairs and came very well packaged. No missing enamel - very sturdy and attractive. No fear even with my wild toddler. Plus, they wipe up super easily. With felt stick ons they glide across the hardwood floor too. The only thing ( which is my fault) is that they are rather short...my husband just put in chair rail and these are well below it..inducing a \"So I put up chair rail and you bought these low rider chairs.\" but he loves them too. Great item great price!", 
    "Love these chairs - they look perfect in our apartment. Actually quite comfortable as well, which we were slightly worried about because of the metal. They are very sleek and love that they stack - in a small NYC apartment it's great to have a way to free up space if we ever need it. Am in love with the designer chairs these are made to look similar to, and wow what a great price! The color and design add a great \"pop\" to our apartment. We had some issues with delivery (two of the chairs had bent legs but we think it was the issue of the delivery service rather than Overstock). When we called to let them know they immediately sent out two more for us. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Got these for our dining room and I'm in love with them. So inexpensive, so stylish, so fresh! Arrived in perfect condition, too. One thing: they're not for heavy people because the seat is a tad narrow. I'd avoid them if you carry a lot in the caboose...", 
    "I researched for literally years before buying these chairs, I loved the Tolix chairs but at this point am tired of the design because it's everywhere. These chairs are more interesting, totally solid, very well made and just beautiful. I am rennovating a 60 year old cape cod and pairing these with a handmade farmhouse table, they have the look of old enamelware, I just love them and you can't beat the price and the versatility. They are not 100% perfect, you can see the metalwork underneath the enamel, but I think that makes them better. Totally thrilled with this purchase, couldn't be happier. Shipping was very quick and no damage.", 
    "These white Tabouret chairs are the perfect compliment to my dining room and white dining table!", 
    "Fast delivery and very comfortable!", 
    "These chairs are exactly what I wanted. They came very well packed and completely undamaged. The size is perfect & the white is definitely a true white. The seats are roomy, I bought throw pillows to act as a back cushion (and for decoration) and with them on the chairs, they're comfy! All in all very pleased.", 
    "My favorite thing about these chairs is that they came assembled! We used 2 sets of these for an outdoor dining table and they've held up very well. We did spray them with a clear, weather-proofing coat before putting them outside but very impressed. They look much more expensive than they were!", 
    "They seem pretty sturdy and look nice, although in person they look a little more outdoor-furniture-ish than they do in the photo.", 
    "I have only owned these chairs for 2 months. Two of them came with paint chipping off. I am still waiting for the manufacturer to replace those ones. Now the paint is peeling off the other chairs and it's past the date that I can return them. Paint peeling off is not covered under the warranty. I am very disappointed with the quality.", 
    "I love the look of these chairs and they seem super sturdy, however, 2 of the 4 we received had chipped paint on the legs. We've decided it's not worth the trouble to return them and wait for new ones. For the price, they are a good deal. I'd recommend the non-painted finishes if you don't want to risk this same issue.", 
    "Beautiful color, very sturdy and stylish. Exactly what I envisioned in my breakfast area.", 
    "Using outside for under our patio. Brings a great modern flair to our outside dining area. Can't wait to use at our next gathering!!", 
    "kinda retro, kinda contemporary but perfect in every way. Just love them!", 
    "Great for a work break room or home kitchen nook.", 
    "love the soft ivory cream white color. good quality and price. Love love", 
    "might as well be DWR;) They do start to rust if they are outside though.", 
    "I have had these chairs for about a year now. I ordered 8 of them. 6 for my dining room farm table and the other two are used as desk chairs. They look great and are easy to clean. They don't scratch the floors. I'm very happy with them.", 
    "We use them as extra seating when we have larger dinner parties. They work great.", 
    "The chairs are solid. Nice color. i am very satisfied.", 
    "They are perfect! Very comfortable and beautiful.", 
    "These chairs were exactly what I wanted! They arrived on time and completely assembled! Couldn't be happier!", 
    "I love the way they looked, but three of the four chairs already had chipped paint around the seating area. The chairs were not too small and I am a size 12....I guess if you had very wide hips, they might be too small. I kept them because they looked good and was too much of a hassle to return.", 
    "I've had this set for years (inside) and they look great", 
    "there was one chair out of the four that had a couple places where the enamel was chipped or scraped, but nothing too obvious. they are a study chair though.", 
    "The chairs are a great deal. I was hoping that the chairs would be more of a stark white, rather than the off white that they are- but overall very happy with the purchase.", 
    "These are great chairs at a great price! We received them very quickly, already assembled!", 
    "nice weight, paint is even and shiny, they do not chip, look much more expensive!", 
    "I absolutely love these chairs and they were a great price however two of the four came damaged and are on back order for 6+months for replacement.", 
    "Came exactly as pictured and great for the price. I thought they would be flimsy and thin, but they are definitely a sturdy set of chairs.", 
    "I had order these chairs in a set of 4 - when they arrived I had noticed that one of the backs was completely bent and there was a chip on the other. I called Overstock and their customer service representative was amazingly accommodating. Being that they could not send out just a single chair to replace the broken one they sent a whole new set of 4 and told me to pick the four that I'd like and to send the remaining 4 back in a pre-paid box. I am absolutely loving my chairs and am so impressed with Overstock's customer service.", 
    "Purchased with matching white table, great breakfast area setup ... and the kids can sit right down for lunch in their damp swimsuits!", 
    "These chairs! So I'll start by saying this review is strictly about the horrible way that these chairs come packaged. Or maybe I'm just an idiot. It's possible. Chairs came in, I was super excited. I open up the top of the box, start trying to take them out one at a time, and then BAM...God decides to test my patience. They are packaged on top of each other (obviously, they are supposed to be stackable). DO NOT TRY TO SIMPLY LIFT ONE OFF THE TOP. You have to somehow open up the huge box from the front side and pull the top chair towards you and then out of the box. I tried doing this without tearing up the whole box and it was impossible. I actually ended up scraping the arm of the chair below :( so yeah. Also the box says not to cut it open with a sharp object...how the heck are you supposed to open it??? I used scissors and was careful. These things are packaged like they don't want you to ever take them out and use them. Now that I've calmed down and vented, I can say that these chairs look exactly as pictured and feel great. They are pretty light weight. Perfect for the modern look I was going for in my new place. I wanted a sleek, STURDY chair, and that's what I got. But yeah...***** this packaging.", 
    "Love the look, but need a pad to ensure long drawn out dinners without back and butt aches. I purchased them for outside and thanks to a patio set cover they seem to be holding up great to the elements.", 
    "Such a great design, well-constructed, great size. We use these for outdoor dining (though they're intended for indoor use) and they look great.", 
    "I purchased these to use as dining chairs. The workmanship is great however I am very dissapointed by the width and depth of the seat - its so small it feels like you are going to fall out of the chair. I'm not a large person (5'6\" 110lbs) so I'm baffled how it works out for so many people. I really love the way they look, just not the way they feel when you sit on them.", 
    "Perfect dining room chairs!", 
    "Love this set. They came fully assembled and ready to go. Easy to clean and comfortable to use!", 
    "These chairs are vintage looking, clean and very cool! But for my husband who's 6'5\" and me whos 5'8\" they did seem a bit tiny for us! We had to return them regretfully and hope we find some similar that are bigger!", 
    "Chairs are great quality, very sturdy and easy to clean. I just wish they were a little whiter, in reality they are a cream color.", 
    "Well priced but very heavy and not very comfortable.", 
    "I have these in red and now got some in white. Couldn't be more pleased. They look great and are surprisingly comfortable.", 
    "clean easy, stack, look clean sleek. great price", 
    "Received four of these and like them a lot solid sturdy chair a bit cold you need a cushion", 
    "we use these on our patio with our wooden dining table - it looks so amazing!", 
    "These chairs came extremely well packaged and they are so fun and cute! I love them!", 
    "I ordered these to go with the wood with white tile dining table in our sunroom. My bulldog had chewed the rungs and half the seats off the previous set of chairs, and I really wanted something chew proof and funky to replace them. These more than fit the bill. Previous posts had issues with the proportions, stating that they wouldn't accommodate larger builds. Our family ranges from 5' 2\" 100 Lbs - 6' 2\" 200 Lbs and neither end of that spectrum had any discomfort. Oh and they arrived the day after I ordered them. Just another successful buy from Overstock.", 
    "Look nice, using on patio so will have too see how they hold up but they are well made and great price", 
    "Very good quality - made it through hurricane sandy.", 
    "We use these in the patio - larger people will find the arms tight, but otherwise they're perfect.", 
    "I wanted to give this less than five stars but realistically there is nothing wrong with the way the chair is manufactured or how it arrived. I like the way they look and they are very sturdy so that is great. However, I live in a cold climate and the metal is not very comfortable, so this really is my fault for not realizing that before I ordered. But in case anyone else does you definitely can benefit from some chair cushions!", 
    "For the price, these are amazing! Sturdy and well made, stackable is a bonus for apartment living.", 
    "We mixed and matched these chairs around our old farm table. I love the crisp clean look of the white chairs mixed with the old farm table and chairs. I also purchased the Tabouret white counter stools to complete the look in our dinning, kitchen area of our beach condo. I've been told that it all looks amazing. The chairs and stools are very sturdy and do not require any assembly.", 
    "These chairs are so cool! I have a loft that has a very eclectic feel to it - lots of mixing of materials and interesting pieces. I purchased these chairs, and I was a little worried they would look like cheap outdoor plastic folding chairs. I was relieved that they were very unique and expensive looking. They really complete the dining area of my place. Also, they arrived within a week and were packaged very carefully. They were all in perfect condition.", 
    "I love these. When the set came, one was damaged and Overstock sent a new one right away. I love Overstock's customer service.", 
    "Love these chairs. And love that there was NO assembly required!!", 
    "I ordered these chairs in the set of 4. They literally arrived 2 days later!! I could NOT believe how fast the shipping was! They arrived without any sort of damage or defects. They were already put together and we were able to put them to use right away. The white chairs with our 100 year old wood kitchen table, makes such a cool modern touch to our dining room. We have 3 boys and these chairs are going to be perfect as they grow too.. they wipe up super easy and are sturdy.. the quality is just perfect for families. I would totally recommend these chairs!! Rad!!", 
    "I love these chairs -- they're sturdy and really nice looking. And WAY less expensive than others just like them -- they're a GREAT DEAL!", 
    "Was hesitant to order these chairs after reading reviews saying they were small and hard to fit into. That is definitely not the case. I imagine if you are a very large person this might be the case, but it is more than enough room for an average size person. Chairs are comfortable enough for everyday use, the value is great, and they arrived undamaged and on time. Husband said they were easy to put together.", 
    "The only way I could be happier is if they were free. Great style. Well made. Received faster than expected. Liked them so much I bought another pack of 4 in place of bench. Lots of compliments. Looks great in modern space with distressed table.", 
    "Great with our farm table in the back patio and pretty comfortable", 
    "Love these chairs. They are stylish, fun, perfectly sized, durable, and sturdy.", 
    "Great copies of the original. IF you have not seen the original, note that these are on the smaller size... as is the original design.Love the look. On my outdoor courtyard. Have my coffee sitting in most mornings. Comfy for 1/2 hour... NOT for a larger sized person. My husband is 6'4\" and slender. Fine to share a cup of coffee but am sure he wouldn't be happy if they were all he had to choose from for everyday.", 
    "I originally bought the white Tabouret Bistro chairs and liked them, but when I went to order more they were out of stock. So I ordered these Tabouret chairs and LOVE them! I actually love them much more than the other chairs! They are very sturdy, very comfortable and sleek. 2 of my chairs came dented, just small dents, so I called customer service and they sent out 2 new chairs straight away! I wasn't sure if I would like them because they don't push all of the way under my dining table because of the arms, but it's not s problem at all, and they look and feel amazing! I actually ordered 4 more so now I have extras!", 
    "Great value. We are using these in our kitchen, and while they are not super comfortable for extended periods of time, they are fine for mealtimes (and clean up very easily, which is key with a toddler). The design is very sturdy-- our almost three year old has never tipped one over. An added plus is that she can get in and out from the side holes, but the back prevents her from falling out. So she rarely needs help getting pushed in our pulled out.", 
    "Chairs look great with my wood table. I find them pretty comfortable. I wouldn't want to lounge in them but they are great for meal time and wonderful for kids because they are a breeze to clean. My husband and I are average sized people and have had no problem with the seat size or arm rest.", 
    "Like the last reviewer, I read ALL of the reviews. I was prepared to open the box and have some major nicks and scratches. When the 61 pound box arrived I immediately noticed it was torn. However, the Overstock crew packed my chairs so well that there wasn't a mark on them. They arrived perfect and I couldn't be happier. They're really sturdy and just the right size. My 6'2\" boyfriend sits in them with no problem. The only thing to note is that the box is 61 pounds and you have to take the whole thing apart to get them out. But it's worth it since they're packed so well. Don't miss this deal! Enjoy!", 
    "I get more than enough compliments on these chairs. They were originally purchased to go with my vintage white enamel topped dining table. I have since replaced said table with an antique reclaimed wood table and they work beautifully with that, too.", 
    "I bought these to use at our kitchen table after getting tired of the constant stains the kids made on my fabric seated chairs I previously had there. These chairs have been perfect, and are surprisingly comfortable. They are wide and the back support is great.", 
    "really fast shipping. not a scratch. love the clean look of the chairs. my kids love them. my husband who is 6'3\" likes this chair. our baby seat attachment straps into this chair really well. of course the first thing my daughter does is draw with red crayon all over the seat. but with a little elbow grease, the markings were gone. just used an antibacterial wipe. it does get a bit cold in the mornings, we we have the kids use cushions, but other than that, it's fine. really great buy and very happy with overstock.", 
    "Great price for 4 chairs. Would be good to have as extra chairs, not so cute for kitchen table. Looks a little like high end lawn furniture. Not the look we were going for in our rustic kitchen.", 
    "These chairs came package extremely well! You get the high end look without the cost! Paired mine with farm table, looks fantastic, happy I choose white!", 
    "Great chairs. Look fantastic. If your table has a lip they may not push in too far, so be sure you have the room. They are comfortable, but after a while it is a metal seat. I added cushions for added comfort. Can't leave outside. Need to be kept inside. Stack very nicely. Helps to stack with cushions on, they don't get scratched or stuck.", 
    "Great price for the chairs minus the damage. They are cute and though on the smaller size my husband and I can both sit comfortably in the chairs (we are both 6'). They arrived stacked together and we had the hardest time getting them unstacked. My husband noticed that one of the chairs had a backrest that was completely bent at an angle. The paint was cracked as well and there were several areas of rust. The other chairs were in good shape with just minor blemishes (I expected this based on other reviews). Starting the return process for the single damaged chair. They said 2-5 days for the new chair to arrive. Wish they were all in great shape but really based on the other reviews and the cost of the product I was expecting some issues.", 
    "I purchased these chairs in both limeade and white and they are exactly what I was hoping for. Shipment was quick and the chairs were extremely well-packed. They arrived pre-assembled, without dings or imperfections, and are true to the color shown. I've had some not-so-great experiences with furniture elsewhere, but no issues with Overstock at all. I'm very happy with this purchase! Highly recommend.", 
    "We love these chairs! They are the exact color, quality and style that was promised on the website. They fit so well on our outdoor patio that we're going to order another set.", 
    "The chairs are beautiful. But it came with orange residue, I ordered 2 sets but I think I'm going to return/exchange one of the sets because that residue won't come off. Also 2 Chiairs were scratched :( they would have been perfect if I didn't have all these issues", 
    "Chairs look great. They are for a smaller person, they are very comfortable considering they are all metal. For the price you can't ask for more, Im using them with a county style table im my eating kitchen and it looks like a designer put it togther. Two of the chairs arrived with scratches but in less than a week i receive replacement. Best customer service.", 
    "I purchased a set of these for our dining room and after having them for several weeks, am pleased to report that I'm thrilled with them. With three toddlers active toddlers, these suit our needs perfectly. I love that little dings, bumps, and scratches will only improve these chairs' aesthetics!", 
    "I love the tabouret chairs. They are exactly the right size and compliment my patio furniture. Wish I had room for more.", 
    "chairs were great, I was dissapointed one had a VERY obvious orange mark on the seat that should have been noticed in packaging. The time of trying to exchange it isnt work it, it will go in the corner. Besides that they were exactly what I wanted.", 
    "I bought these chairs for extra seating on the deck. I like the way I can stack them indoors when not in use. They are so comfortable, they fit the contour of your back & the arms are just right. I got white because of the neutral color. Was very tempted to go for one of the amazing colors available. The packaging was damaged, I called because one chair was damaged. They company sent me a replacement within the week.", 
    "These chairs are great - they are easy to clean and very comfortable. Accurate product description and come already assembled. I would definitely order again.", 
    "I bought 8 of these. Heavy and very well made...not flimsy or cheap looking. The finish is awesome and glossy. I added seat cushions but you could easily sit in them without. Wanted to add a modern vibe to my antique farm table. Perfect!", 
    "Very happy. Exactly what I was looking for. The price was very fair and the shipping was very fast. I would definitely buy from Overstock.com again.", 
    "Pleasant surprise on the quality of the product and the superhuman job of packing them for shipment. They blend well with the other modern balcony furniture.", 
    "Purchased these in the glossy white as additional chairs. Solid, good quality with a nice paint job - no scratches or scuffs. One caveat: these are not for people who require, shall we say, a broad seat. The seat size is fine, but the arms can be constricting for someone who fills out the chair. Overall, cool, sturdy chairs at a great price.", 
    "These chairs are stylish, comfortable and very reasonably priced. I would recommend to anyone.", 
    "My husband and I couldn't decide on a color, so we went with white. Always a good choice! These chairs are ADORABLE (if you are into modern design, which I am... husband is coming around). They look good, seem sturdy and go with everything. The only criticism I have is the size of the seat. They are a bit narrow and the arms curve in and take up more of the seat than I would like. Big bums beware, not comfortable for lengthy meals or conversation. The kids love them!", 
    "I saw these chairs on the website and immediately fell in love. I decided to go ahead and purchase them based on the positive reviews and I was not disappointed. They arrived well packed and ready to put out immediately. I actually purchased them about a year ago and I'm still pleased with their appearance. These are great chairs!", 
    "After looking at multiple Tolix knock offs, the price on these were worth the chance. I am far from disappointed. In fairness, I have not seen nor sat in the real thing to know what I'm missing. These chairs are great. They look rather squat in the picture, but here in my home they look amazing! They are sturdy yet lightweight, which is a must for a dining chair...in my opinion. I highly recommend putting felt pads on the bottom if you have wood, tile, or laminate flooring. They slide so much easier. Above all, the price is what makes these chairs five star worthy. We have 5 kids and are in no way willing to pay over $100 for one dining chair. If you want your house to look cool, have a mess of kids, and aren't a designer snob, then these are the chairs for you. Come on people...4 chairs for what you'd pay for one.", 
    "i couldn't be happier with these chairs, nice coating, fairly heavy duty and were packed extremely well.", 
    "Love these! the price is fantastic. super comfy, NICE", 
    "Nice, economical kitchen chairs. They will suit my needs perfectly. The color and shine are nice with my modern decor. I weigh 130 lbs and would not recemmend them for anyone over 200 lbs. The seats are thinner sheets of metal than I expected.", 
    "I ordered these chairs to have on hand for Thanksgiving crowd, as I had been looking at them for some time. They arrived AFTER Thanksgiving though. Because they are a great deal, and the reviews were good, I wll keep them. They're stacked quite nicely in my garage until they can be used...I'm not sorry I ordered them.", 
    "These chairs rock. My wife and I were looking to brighten up our dining room and pursue a more modern aesthetic, and these chairs fit the bill. I know some folks use them outside, but they look great around our dining room table. They're surprisingly comfortable, and we've received a lot of compliments. I was hesitant at first to buy them, but I'm glad we did.", 
    "These chairs were packaged very well, so obviously the one bent chair was intentionally packed that way. Too big and irritating to repackage (all 4 were in 1 box) to return. Another Overstock fail.", 
    "We purchased these chairs to replace our old and broken dining room chairs. These are trendy and perfect for our family. Easy to clean and strong enough to seat anyone.", 
    "These chairs are fabulous! They arrived promptly and looked just like they do in the picture. They are stark white and beautiful - also surprisingly comfortable! I highly recommend.", 
    "I love the chairs. They will be perfect in our basement. Would recommend for anyone that wants fun, multi-use chairs.", 
    "Chairs sit comfortably. Look nice. Only had one problem, when they shipped the chairs, one of the chairs arrived with a bent leg, which you could then not sit properly in it. Kind of a shame. But nonetheless I brought out a big wrench and bent it back to normal. Just scraped a little paint off.", 
    "The chairs came extremely fast (ordered on Saturday, 11/2 and were at my front door by Wednesday, 11/7) . They were packaged very carefully.", 
    "These are wonderful chairs, and especially for the money I paid for them. They are exactly what I was wanting for my kitchen table.", 
    "We are very pleased with these chairs! We have a small house and they fit perfectly and stack nicely! My 3 yr. old loves them and it is easy to wipe down when dirty. I would definitely get these chairs, they are worth the money.", 
    "I love these chairs! They came quickly and very well packed! They looked exactly like the picture! I ordered the matching bar stools. The only thing I don't love is that the arms of the chairs keep them from pushing all the way under the table, but it's not a huge deal breaker for me. Would recommend them to anyone!", 
    "I order these chairs for my shop, and I was amaze at the quality, they were perfect. Comfortable, strong, and nice looking. I am getting ready to by 8 more.", 
    "I really like the chairs. When I unpackaged them, I thought the white was bright. As I put them next to our white legged table, I was a bit disappointed in the white of the chairs. They are definitely white, but just not a brilliant bright white. Good buy, though.", 
    "I purchased these chairs about a month ago and am very happy with them. They arrived quickly and very well packaged. I'm very happy with my purchase.", 
    "I am a college student and needed something beautiful that would be inexpensive but also last a long time. These chairs are beautiful to look at and really add style to the room, but also will be multi-functional and able to work in a variety of rooms when I move again. For some reason I wasn't anticipating how huge the package would be, and it was very difficult to get the chairs out. They were \"well packed\" in that they wouldn't have moved around or scratched each other while shipping, but it also added a lot of stress in opening a box and trying to force chairs out for over an hour.", 
    "Made this purchase based on the tons of other great reviews and wasn't disappointed. These are nice sturdy chairs that are great for our small kitchen nook. Friends have commented on how cool they look.", 
    "Just received the chairs. They were wrapped maticulously and it took a little work just to unwrap them. They are smooth to the touch and are not too heavy. We have a farmhouse style table and these go very well with it. We bought these to replace some red Pier 1 chairs that have a cottage feel to them. I love the new chairs so much better and they really seem to brighten the space. The other chairs were heavy and hard for our kids to move around. These new chairs are not heavy and smaller to move around. We are very excited to have them in our home. The ONLY negative thing I have to say is that there were a few very small flaws in the paint. It's not enough for me to return them, but they were not in 100% perfect condition.", 
    "very pleased with this purchase! chairs came fairly fast and in excellent condition. love the look! the only negative thing for our table is that the arms keep them from pushing under the table, but that doesn't make me love them any less.", 
    "These chairs are exactly as described on the website, I couldn't be happier. They are actually very comfortable to sit in as well. They are made for indoor use, but I am using them outdoors, and suprisingly, they are holding up really well.", 
    "we bought these for dining chairs - we have a todder in the house and our fabric parson chairs were going downhill fast! these are study, cool, and easy to clean. very happy with this purchase.", 
    "they are great- I bought two sets for a cottage look dining area and they work really well. They are about as comfortable as metal chairs can be. They work aesthetically for adults and they are practical for kids- just wipe it down. We have them inside most of the time but for a big bbq where we needed all the seating we could find I put them out on the grass and no complaints- they didn't sink in and they looked awesome. They spent the night outside and didnt seem to suffer at all. Overall I am very pleased and 8 chairs for $$$ who can complain? Not me thats for sure.", 
    "I have nothing different to add than everyone else's input: These chairs arrived quickly, in perfect condition and are well worth the price (especially considering the cost of other similar metal chairs on other retail sites!). We are very happy with them and have them indoors around our kitchen table. They are also much more comfortable than the wooden kitchen chairs we had. Great buy!", 
    "They look beautiful and high end. They come fully assembled. They look great with my old farmhouse table in my dining room.", 
    "The chairs were delivered in perfect condition. Very happy with the chairs, they are tough and as sturdy as it looks. No assembly needed, it came in neatly stacked and well protected.", 
    "I had picked out a chair at a competitor that I wanted and it was pricey. For the price of one chair, I bought 4. This purchase is too good to be true. The Chairs are great.", 
    "Beautifully designed, comfortable. Love that they stack.", 
    "These chairs are of GREAT quality. I'd definitely get them again.", 
    "You can pay a lot more for these chairs from other vendors. They are high quality, sturdy and stylish. They go very well with my contemporary mirror-top acrylic table. I found simple square chair pads (in royal blue) at another store that add a touch of comfort and a lot of pizzazz.", 
    "I'm very happy with these chairs. They are comfortable, sturdy and exactly as described. They arrived within days and safely packed. The quality is excellent, especially at the very affordable price.", 
    "compared to original product 75% of the price, very happy with look and overall product", 
    "Love my chairs! They look fabulous and they are comfortable. Clean easily and look very similar to the real thing.", 
    "I love these chairs and they are nice and heavy quality. My only problem is one of them is chipping its paint off. Too big of a hassle to send back...", 
    "chairs are great! Heavy, not light and cheap. They are wonderful.", 
    "these are a great set of chairs for such a good price. a good modern and industrial mix. the shipping was quick and my chairs came packaged very securely with no scratches or dents. perfect!", 
    "I love my chairs. Perfect as dining chairs for a modern industrial look. Came in perfect condition...careful packaging.", 
    "I was a bit tentative because the chairs are being used in an office. But no need to be hesitant. They are per and more than sturdy enough to survive my children.", 
    "I am so pleased with these chairs. Can't beat the price and they look great. It looks to me on the site like one of the chairs has different leg positioning than the other. This is not the case. All four chairs are identical. I have them around a farm table and the effect is just what I wanted. So happy!", 
    "the chairs were wrapped extremely carefully. none of the white metal powder coating was scratched. shipped quickly. i am beyond thrilled with my first purchase from overstock!!", 
    "For the price these are a great subsitute for the spendier French version. Chairs were delivered in a very rigid box with each chair stacked upon one another. There was protective sheeting between each chair and foam caps on the feet to protect them from scratches and dents in transit. My chairs came without any flaws - their white powder coating was unscratched and very shiny. The white color is very crisp and clean looking. I've paired the chairs with a provincial farmhouse table that goes well with the mix of chabby chic and new pieces in my suburban condo. The chairs are comfortable with the arms angling slightly so when you're eating it's not akward to lift your arms. I'm pleased with the solid manufacturing and cool design of these tabouret chairs.", 
    "These chairs are an incredible value. Heavy weight metal , and so much better than folding chairs, for those occasional needs for extra seating.", 
    "I love these chairs...love! They were such a fantastic deal for the price I paid and the quality is far better than I expected. There are a few tiny paint drips in the spraying but nothing that is noticeable unless you get extremely close up. They are sturdy, comfortable and stable. I am completely happy with these chairs and the look that they give my eat-in kitchen.", 
    "These are great chairs. They come fully assembled, stacked & were b very well packed. They were a snap to unstack & unwrap. They look great and sit good.", 
    "I really like these chairs. They came scratched but when I wrote to Overstock, they replaced the scratched chairs. Because the feet have rubber on them, they were rather noisy against the hardwood floors but I put felt circles on them and they are prefect! I got tons of compliment on the chairs from friends so am really happy with the purchase.", 
    "I am thrilled with these chairs!! I ordered them to go around a round table in my kids' craft/activity room, and they are the perfect size. I can sit in them comfortably, but they are also a great size for my kids (ages 2-8). I wanted something sturdy that would be hard to tip over, and these fit the bill perfectly. I can't imagine how one of my kids could even tip them. They look modern and clean and bright -- everyone who has been to my new house asks about them. I looked at similar chairs from many other vendors and this set is by far the best value. In short, go buy these! You'll find something to do with them. And did I mention that they stack?!", 
    "My high hopes were dashed as I opened up the box and found spots of rust peeking here and there. I said ok perhaps I can fix those afterall they were cheap. Then I found dents and scrapes. Total letdown!", 
    "I knew when ordering these I was taking a gamble due to the reviews and lack of additional pictures etc, however, I can say I was disappointed when I got the box open. It isn't any specific other than they kind of look like cheap patio chairs...which they are cheap chairs, but I thought it would add to the industrial vibe of my loft...rather they detract. I think I may just put them out on my patio instead and order the real deal... You get what you pay for folks.", 
    "Love these chairs. They look great at a kitchen table (or anywhere) and stack easily if you want to move or store them.", 
    "Packaged very well and delivered very promptly, these chairs are a great addition to my eating nook. I like that they don't take up a lot of space and are durable yet stylish.", 
    "These chairs are wonderful. They are a little on the petite side, however they have graceful and modern character. Plus you cant lose with the price. Many people say their chairs came damaged, but mine actually came in perfect condition. Take a risk, they are very worth it!", 
    "They are very sturdy. I was very happy with the quality. Also, the paint has yet to chip anywhere, which was a concern of mine. They are very stylish and you can't beat the price!", 
    "These are great chairs. Exactly as billed. Yes, they are small scale. That is what I was searching for... They are sturdy, stack well, & the paint is enameled and uniform. Sure beats the *** prices! 4 for the price of 1 less than 1! Buy them today!", 
    "The chairs are great--sturdy without being heavy. Might be a little tight for some \"hippier\" people but work for me and my family. Order what you need well in advance. Of the four chairs I ordered, one was damaged in transit. It was replaced free of charge after I notified Overstock of the issue. The replacement arrived damaged as well so a second replacement had to be sent. Obviously, all the shipping takes a little while which is why you should build in some time if you need them by a specific date.", 
    "I love these chairs and love the price even more. You pay more than this for one (1) chair of the original Tolix! Very happy with my purchase!", 
    "Wow!!! 4 chairs for the price of one. At first I thought this was a mistake, but its true! These go for much much more at other retailers. Chairs are very sturdy, the finish is smooth, and they came well protected. I was expecting less, but Im pleasantly surprised!", 
    "I ordered these chairs for our dining room table. Having a young family I was looking for something durable but still very stylish. They arrived in about a weeks time and I was very happy with them. The top chair in the box did have some dings and dents so I called customer service and described the problem. They were very polite and helpful and a new chair was sent out with out any additional trouble or charges. That chair arrived in perfect condition. I do agree that they're probably not for larger guests, they say they have a weight limit of 250. The structure of the chair seems well built and is exactly what we were looking for. So all in all if you have time and patience you'll get a great set of chair for a deal you just can't beat."
