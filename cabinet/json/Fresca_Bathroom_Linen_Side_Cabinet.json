  "reviews": [
    "I had purchased the double vanity earlier and was impressed with the quality of the Fresca line so I ordered this side cabinet. It's a little small, you can't get too many towels in there but it's very well made and it looks exactly as it looks in the picture on line.", 
    "The cabinet is finished on all sides, no partical board backing here. I unpacked the cabinet and had in the bedroom, next to bathroom sitting on the floor for over a week. The cabinet looked so nice with a finished top that I almost thought of using it as a nightstand.", 
    "Great customer service; the first one arrives damaged and a replacement was sent out immediately!", 
    "I was expecting a wood cabinet, as described in the \"description\", not particle board with a plastic veneer. It's a nice $$$.$$ cabinet...certainly not worth $$$.$$!!!!", 
    "The cabinets met my expectations. Seem durable and easy to hang.", 
    "We bought two of them and they are beautiful! They match our sink cabinet perfectly! What quality! I would recommend anyone to buy them, they are worth every penny!", 
    "Was sent the wrong item and then of course it was sold out, so all hope shot. Had to drag it to UPS where the young man wanted to charge me $2 dollars to send it despite the prepaid label. Then brought it to a different UPS store where he took it with a smile. Oh the humanity...."
