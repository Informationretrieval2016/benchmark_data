    "This love seat is very kid-resilient. The material is sturdy and if there are spills and you clean it up quickly, there are no stains. Our previous furniture was nice but not resistant to stains, kids or pets. This love seat has soft back cushions but very firm seat cushions, it takes a while to get used to. It's perfect for smaller spaces, I bought the love seat and matching sofa. Easy to assemble but needs at least two able bodies to put them together. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "I was a bit disappointed in this love seat. It looks great and fills the space I had for it but when you sit down it. Is very hard, no give .The cushions on the back are comfy but I find I can't sit long on this seat. It serves the purpose I had for it but disappointed in the hard seat. Not a good product for everyday use.", 
    "Good shaped couch. I would not recommend anyone to buy this for everyday living. It is not very comfy for relaxing. I bought it to use in the guest bedroom, which is fine because no one uses it for long. Shape is great and it looks very nice, but again, not for everyday lounging.", 
    "Ordered two love seats for my back porch. They are the perfect size. Seat cushions are very firm. Two can sit very comfortable. Nice purchase.", 
    "Amazing, beautiful and so easy to assemble, the best of the best.Color style and quality 5 stars.Again and again I love it, if for somehow I can download the picture I will be happy to attached it.", 
    "This is a lovely sofa, the fabric looks more expensive then it was and the style is timeless. Now, when I read the reviews they all said it was on the firm side. Obviously I wasn't paying attention. It is very firm. This is not a couch to watch a movie on....even with an ottoman it doesn't encourage long term sitting. So it was a good purchase and looks great. However if you want visitors to stay and watch a three movie set then this isn't the best loveseat for you.", 
    "I love the look of this loveseat. It is on the smaller side but perfect for what we needed. Also, this is a little firmer than what we're used to but I'm sure it will break in over time. We did have an issue with the cushion (button in center came off) before we even used the couch but Overstock got us a new one within a week.", 
    "As other have stated, firm seating however the older a person gets the firmer the chair the better. You don't sink into them that's for sure but comfortable enough. I actually like the firmness and am sure they will soften up over time. I have this in a room we don't sit in often. I wouldn't recommend for a high use room. Arrived in 3 days - WOW. Easy to assemble. I am overall very pleased with my purchase and would order from Overstock again.", 
    "As with others, I would also suggest the cushions are very very firm. I am hoping they soften up. I am not too worried though because they are still ok. The loveseat was high quality and really simple to put together. It feels very solid and well made. The color is definitely a light brown which I like a lot. I am glad I read all the reviews cuz they really helped me make a great choice.", 
    "Don't expect this loveseat to be something you can just fall into at the end of a hard day. You'll probably bounce right back off of it. Or in the worst case, bruise your tailbone. It does, however, look exactly like the picture, even if it's not as squishy and inviting as in the picture.", 
    "The loveseat arrived quickly & was easy to put together. The size & color (blue) were true to the description. It is very firm (like reviews stated), which is what I wanted. I am extremely pleased with this purchase.", 
    "This is a very nice loveseat. Well made, and I was able to assemble by myself. My only criticism is that the seat cushions are not reversible. You are SOL if you stain them. I treated them with scotch guard. The seats are very firm but loosening up as described by the mfr on the website. The color is more white than beige, although there is a beige thread to the weave that I have pulled out with throw pillows. Without the throw pillows, it is not a warm white. It is also a nice size.", 
    "We bought this loveseat and matching sofa - no, we didn't spend a fortune and they are attractive in that respect; I do not however believe they will hold up to everyday use for a family of 4 long term. Material may be a little thin but overall I am happy with our purchase.", 
    "Got this for the end of our king size bed in lieu of a bench. It is better than my expectations. Fabric is synthetic but very durable - even with liquids as my 2 and 5 year olds camp out on it watching TV. Very firm cushions but not uncomfortable. Came in 2 boxes but super easy to put together (the base literally snaps into the back). Would buy this again in a heartbeat!!", 
    "This love seat is on the smallish side. The cushions are hard so it's not a cozy comfy seating. I've had it for a couple of months and feel like it's sinking in the middle. We use it daily so I'm not sure about the long term durability. I would probably not recommend.", 
    "as soon we assembled love seat, one of the leg was broken. we needed to replace it . it took almost a month to get a new love seat and replace a broken leg.", 
    "Easy to assemble and good firm sitting. I bought the blue linen and I think the color is lovely.", 
    "I bought this along with the sofa and fit perfectly for where I had in mind. It is quite firm, but this was what I wanted. I bought in the light brown, which is quite neutral but some colorful throw pillows help. Like the lines -- looks modern. Need two people to put together, but not hard.", 
    "I get so many compliments on this loveseat, color and all! at first it was a little stiff when I sat down but it loosened up and I love it! Especially with my back....the support and not too cushy seat is perfect!", 
    "I purchased this love seat in blue for our game room. I wanted something small with a low pack and this fit the bill. The seat cushions were quite stiff, however they have loosened up with use. The back cushions seemed a bit soft for me, however my kids seem to like them.", 
    "Looks great in my living room. Easy to assemble - 4 pieces that snap in place, no tools required, took me 10 minutes including unpacking. Armrests are a little uncomfortable but I fixed the problem with throw pillows.", 
    "I have never seen a sofa come in a back ever in my life. The design is good and it is a little hard to sit on, but very comfortable. I wish it came with instructions because as i look at it, something looks wrong with the base. I think it is on incorrectly, but i tried it the other way and it doesn't fit. Great sofa regardless", 
    "Just as described. I am very happy with this loveseat. It's perfect for us.", 
    "This furniture was sooo easy to put together! Comfy and durable as well!", 
    "Easy to put together but is is not just putting the legs on. Takes two people. Once it is put together it is beautiful. Only problem is that it is very stiff to sit on.", 
    "This love seat is easy to put together, well-made, and fits perfectly in a small space. Very happy with this purchase!", 
    "My daughter was totally ecstatic about this purchase. It's classic and modern. Has a perfect firmness and fits in an alcove in her apartment like a glove! Very, very satisfied with this loveseat!", 
    "Just what I wanted went together in less than 5 minutes", 
    "Great color, nice fabric. Back cushions are nice and comfortable, but seat cushions are pretty solid. It is not our main sofa, so we don't care too much about the comfy factor. If you want a nice sofa at a good price, this is a great option. If you are looking for a comfy sofa for movie night, this might not be the one.", 
    "Firm loveseat, like the sofa but the colors are nice, easy to assemble and looks elegant in my great room.", 
    "This love seat came in 2 boxes which was such a breeze to put together. It took my 12 year old son and I about 15 minutes. No tools required!! Just slide and lock into place. The size is perfect for our little sitting area in our master bedroom. The cushions are a bit on the firm side, which I don't mind. They will soften up in time. I fell asleep a took a little nap the first day!! The back cushions are soft and comfy:) Another great buy from Overstock!!!", 
    "Even though we wanted a loveseat that the dog could get up on, this is even slumming for the dog. The parts did not fit together nicely so there are gaps.", 
    "This item looked even better in person! Nice quality fabric, great design, easy to assemble by yourself. The seat is a bit firm, I'm Hoping it breaks in a little bit. It fits two with plenty of space. Could fit three, if you wanted to. The color is really nice.", 
    "The white linen has a slight green cast but the clean lines style work for me. Great sized loveseat. We have it only for occasional use in a bedroom seating area, so comfort wasn't a primary concern. Although that doesn't bother me. Got a good price..easy shipping!", 
    "this loveseat fits great in our den, the family loves it. Very easy to put together. Thanks overstock!", 
    "It arrived in two boxes and was SUPER easy to put together. It only took 5 minutes! It's perfect for our small apartment. The seat cushions are a little firm but I think they'll be perfect after we break them in a bit. I chose this one so our cats could sleep on the back, it might be a little too narrow for that though.", 
    "Beautiful white loveseat! perfect for a small space. High quality", 
    "Very hard and slopes back", 
    "The sofa is wonderful for a small space. The quality is amazing. Very easy to put together.", 
    "we purchased love seat to go with a couch we purchased two years ago. it matches up nice. the other couch held up nicely thus far with a dog who is on it all the time so we are hoping the loveseat is equal in quality. fabrics are same and happy with that.", 
    "Love the style, great material. Wish it was a little softer and wish the cushions were reversible. Good petite sofa for the price!", 
    "excellent size and construction.", 
    "As others have mentioned, this is not to be some showpiece, main seating item in your house. A tad expensive for the application I used it for, it is quite attractive and its ability to break down makes it awesome for garret/attic type rooms or for pre war apartments with narrow staircases. I use this under my daughter's loft bed as her \"chill\" area or for when her friends want to sleep over.", 
    "Nice loveseat but was too firm and too small for my area.", 
    "I was hesitant to order this loveseat thinking it would be sized for a toddler, but was pleasantly surprised. For the price, it is made well, easy to put together, nice cream/ivory color and comfortable.", 
    "I am very happy with my purchase. I wanted a small loveseat to fit our living room space and also desired loose back pillows. The Elston loveseat fits the bill in its size, style, price, and my husband put it together in 20 minutes by himself. Very sturdy. I was hesitant to order such a large item online, but it came in two boxes, so returning it if needed would not have been out of the question. The seat cushions are very firm - but we don't find them uncomfortable. The linen type fabric is beautiful, too. We have only had the piece for a few weeks, so we will see how it all holds up.", 
    "They look amazing in my living room, they came well packed. I got them all. I am very happy with my purchaseThank you O.", 
    "I ordered this in the dark gray and it's perfect for our loft area. It was easy to assemble although it's easier with two people. It seems to be well-made and from the previous reviews we hope kid-friendly! For the money I think this is a great buy!", 
    "Was easy to put together, is solidly built and a very nice color. It is firm and we like the straight lines", 
    "This was purchased for our dog to sleep on at the foot of our bed so we could have our bed to ourselves! It size is on the smaller scale, which I wanted as it sits perfectly at the end of our king-size footboard and is now a STEP to the bed for our dog! So easy to put together-ingenious actually and a sturdy piece. Seat cushions very firm, linen fabric nice enough, color matches online pics. Happy w/purchase for its intended use/location. Not a piece for a living/family room comfort wise & small scale...unless you are the Flintstones!", 
    "This item is extremely uncomfortable. Like sitting on a rock...", 
    "great piece of furniture that complements our living room. It is not the most comfortable piece that we have but it is stylish.", 
    "Don't expect a cushy feel, but this is a great little loveseat. It assembles extremely easily. Love it!", 
    "So easy to put together. 5 pcs slide together easy. Took 15 minutes. Great style true to picture. Firm seating sits up nicely. Only draw back is that the material under the seat buckled on the front panel when the 1st person sat on it. I was able to straighten it back up but it appears to just be spray glued onto the front. Because of that issue I don't believe this is going to last very long and remain nice and crisp looking.", 
    "Ordered the loveseat and sofa. We love them both. The quality is good. They were easy to put together. The seating is very firm, but does soften over time with use. I would recommend this product.", 
    "Only took 15 minutes or so to put together. Looks great in my living room", 
    "Nice firm loveseat. Love the way it looks.", 
    "I purchased this loveseat and matching sofa for my parents in the 'brown' color and they absolutely love the set. Color is as pictured. It arrived exactly as scheduled and my father was able to put it together very quickly. He loved the solid frame and great quality. What both my parents loved the most was the firmness (ironically this is pretty much the only complaint reviewers had). My parents are in their 60s so they very much appreciate firm furniture. The style and color are amazing and the overall look is different from what is available at most retail furniture stores. Very pleased with my purchase.", 
    "We are still in the process of renovations, so have not been able to use our Loveseat yet. I did of course open the box and had a look. Everything looks just as we expected. We love the pillows at the back with the buttons. Can't wait to use it in my \"office\" at home.", 
    "A very nice piece, took minutes to put together with no tools required at all, I also like the linen material, its a nice break from micro fiber.", 
    "Gorgeous piece of furniture that fits perfectly in my breakfast nook. Very well made. Visitors have admired it and purchased one for themselves. Comfy and amazingly easy to assemble.", 
    "Beautiful love seat, easy to assemble. Looks much more expensive than it is. Seats are firm but I like them that way.", 
    "I love this little couch. It went together easily and once assembled looks like it cost much more than it did. Durable attractive fabric that's easily accessorized. Other reviews have criticized the firmness of the cushions but I prefer the less-squishy nature of it."
