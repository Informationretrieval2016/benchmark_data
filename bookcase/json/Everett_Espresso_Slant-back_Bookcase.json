    "good product for the price - easy to put together - fits lots of books or other things - nice color", 
    "Went together well and looks good. They don't label the boards so it took a few extra minutes to identify each before putting together.", 
    "This bookcase is great- I like it so much, actually, that I am planning on buying another one. It's quite tall (I am bad, it seems, about double checking size descriptions online) and looks very high-quality once assembled. Assembly is pretty easy- the only issue I had with it was that a board got in the way of fitting 2 cams in. Minor detail, and it is still sturdy despite that.", 
    "Well packed, better than I have seen on comparable items that get shipped from China and go through multiple shipper's hands before they reach me. I ordered 7 and had only a few pieces that showed any damage. Not the highest quality, but good for what they cost. The color of \"Espresso\" had more brown and less red than items from other manufacturers that call items the same color. Overall, it was easy to assemble and looks good. Better design with the slant-back than others I found. Overall I am happy with the purchase.", 
    "I received the shelf unit 2/10/2016. As my husband was assembling the unit he noticed that we were short several 24mm green twister dowels in order to connect the upper section to the base. He notified the manufacturing co. who mailed us the missing dowels. However, as he was trying to finish the project, the side upper panel \"B9\" broke, making it impossible to complete assembly. Therefor we have to ask for a refund. I am going submit this to Pay Pal. The other problem is we no longer have to special box it came in as we had to tear it up in order remove to panel pieces, (packing was so tight). Please take care of this matter and e-mail me the status. I have ordered other merchandise from your company in the past and had been very happy with them. I am very surprised with the quality and incompleteness of this product. Sincerely Heidi ****", 
    "I put this in my office and it tall to fill the space but not overwhelming. It looks like it is made well and held up well over the past year after being moved around a few times. I would recommend.", 
    "good bookcase, like the details on the shelves. good value", 
    "The instructions were drawings only with no step by step or showing front/back/ raw or finished edges.The equipment used to attach the top to the base was not lined up so the support/locking pieces could not be inserted. I was using Elmers wood glue along with the tools to secure that it would hold for the time needed and without it the whole middle section would not be secured. I put together pieces of furniture for my new place over two weeks and this was the worst one of them all.It showcases and fits my space and if someone does not look too closely, it looks great. But I would not have purchased it, if i had known the difficulty in assembling and the final result.", 
    "This isn't fine furniture but an excellent piece for the price. It fits perfectly into the corner and looks great. Very functional.", 
    "I really like the finished product. It was simple to assemble once I was able to figure out the pieces. The pieces are not labeled and the directions are not really clear. It took me about an hour to get it together.", 
    "Nice shelf. Easy assembly. Different look about it.", 
    "The unit looks good, I purchased 3 of these bookcases, one with the open bottom shelf and two with doors. I placed them next to each other to get the \"library\" look on a budget. The product arrived undamaged thru UPS ground. The boxes are quite heavy, 70lb each. The assembly instructions are horrible, none of the parts are marked with an item name corresponding to the instruction booklet and they all look very similar, shelves, shelves and shelves. The first unit took me a little while to put together, the other two went faster. This item is made out of engineered wood so it's very soft, be very careful when you handle it during assembly as it will get scratched or chipped very easily. I actually chipped a corner, but since these will be side to side, it won't be visible.", 
    "Fairly easy to assemble. Unique shape lends itself to an attractive addition to most any room. I would have like the model with doors at the bottom, but unfortunately, that option wasn't offered. (Included in the paperwork was a picture of the second option.) Since our 2nd home doesn't offer as much storage as our custom built primary home, we were looking for something that would offer us more space.This seems to be something that will work well for our needs.", 
    "Only draw back was incorrect parts and missing parts in box. I am still waiting for the replacement of two parts that were missing from box and the replacements that were sent did not work.", 
    "The bookcase looks great so far.We cannot finish it because an incorrect piece was sent.If it still looks great completely finished, I will recommend it and rate it highly.", 
    "Like I said before, it only 15% MDF. The majority of it is particle wood. It is far too much money to be this chincy. They use the same pieces as the model with the doors. So you can see all of holes in section below (real classy). Then you can see the hardware in the above section. I would recommend buying 1 x 12's from you local lumber yard and creating shelves using bricks. At least you will be able to move it again after it is put together.", 
    "I love this bookcase for several reasons; the style - it's slant design is unique, sophisticated & beautiful, the quality - it's good quality for a ready to assemble piece (better than any other r.t.a furniture I've experienced), it's very heavy - with it being so tall (another feature I love) I was worried about the possibility of it fallling over (latches are included to attach it to the wall to prevent that from happening) but it is rock solid heavy and not going anywhere! There is a lot of shelf space & this bookcase holds a lot - even though it doesn't seem like it will when just looking at it (because it's narrow) - but I still have empty shelves after shelving two boxes of books - and I used 1 shelf purely for decorative items. This bookcase is not just functional, but it really does add a very nice decorative element to our home. The only reason I didn't rate excellent is because of the cardboard backing that has to be tacked on...I wish there were some kind of guide or something because I missed the back of the case on two nails & cracked the inside surface. A touchup pen is included and covered the cracks so they are in no way visible - but it just seems that there has to be some better way to get that backing on. Otherwise I am very pleased with this purchase and would buy it again and again."
