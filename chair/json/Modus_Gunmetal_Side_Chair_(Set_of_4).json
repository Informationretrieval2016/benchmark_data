    "I am very unhappy with these chairs. When they arrived the seat on one of them was broken. We were sent a replacement seat. We only use two of these chairs all of the time. Yesterday the seat on a chair we don't use often cracked and broke. No one was sitting in the chair and no one had ben sitting in the chair. I would never recommend this chair set to anyone.", 
    "These chairs would be perfect if they were actually made for adults. They are so small it seems as though they're made for children. The back is too low for a regular dining table and they're pretty but also very uncomfortable.", 
    "love them looked for weeks to find the right size and look .these are perfect!", 
    "These were a bit smaller than I had envisioned, but work fine for our family. No one is overweight but my husband is 6' 3\" and says they are fine. We have a cramped dining room so they work out well. Glad we got the ones with the wood seat vs. metal. They look a little more polished.", 
    "A bit pricey but the attention to detail is great. I definitely would recommend these chairs to my friends.", 
    "exactly what I was looking for...sweeeet!", 
    "These are great chairs! Good quality, price and comfort all in one! A good buy!!!", 
    "Quality is nice but they are way too small .", 
    "Exactly as described. We've been using them about a month now and they're holding up great. Decent price for nice, industrial style chairs.", 
    "These chairs were the perfect buy! They look modern and look exactly like the picture. I was very happy with this purchase. They also came already assembled."
