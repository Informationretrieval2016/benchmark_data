    "I love this bench at my front doorway - I needed a place to put the endless pairs of shoes from my family of 3. This is great to sit on for putting on/taking off shoes and you just throw them in the hinged cover to hide them - which stays up by itself if pushed open all the way- no falling on kids fingers! Is exactly what I needed! I put a plastic boot tray in the bottom in case of wet and dirty shoes going in from the 5 year old. Very large - will hold a lot of stuff!!! (Shoes!!)", 
    "Love this storage bench, it is a great size, holds a lot inside, is well upholstered, and seems to be well made overall. It is maybe a tad darker gray than pictured. The fabric is sort of a microsuede, but has a sort of leather texture to it if that makes sense. It isn't smooth. It arrived all assembled we just had to put the feet on. I'd recommend this to a friend.", 
    "This bench is perfect for a bedroom or other area with limited space as it is not too wide. The material looks and feels great. The price is unbeatable. It's comparable to benches that typically cost upwards of $600.", 
    "We put this in the study near the coat closet - a perfect easy place to stash their book bags as well as a comfy see for taking off and putting on shoes. It feels really solid, even for larger adults. Can't beat the price and the color is great - neutral darker grey. I would recommend it.", 
    "It is slightly darker than the picture, but I read that in other reviews. It was incredibly easy to put together, the legs just twist on. It is spacious and looks like it cost much more. I looked at a lot of different storage bench options and at this price, you won't get a better qualtiy. A great find.", 
    "I love storage benches - this one I am using at the foot of my queen size bed and it's a perfect fit and color is nice - brown suede kinda look to it - I love the fact it has the hinge so you can have open as you store your items - I use it for my blankets/sheets for our bed. Just had to twist on the legs and done - arrived quick and in perfect condition - well pacakged.", 
    "Love the bench! No assembly, other than screwing in the legs. Looks expensive and very sturdy; comfortable to sit on.", 
    "Easy to put together; sturdy and astheticaly pleasing", 
    "This is a very roomy and attractive storage bench. It is a dark slate gray. It is very easy to put together - all you have to do is screw on the feet. I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a good quality storage bench. I have had this bench for a couple years now (I know, I should have reviewed it before now!) it is holding up very well. The fabric is very durable. I would call it a textured micro fiber. I would consider the color closest to a slate gray than a dove gray -if that helps anyone decide! It holds a lot of \"stuff\" trust me on this. By itself it is very solid & heavy. With our \"stuff\" in it took 2 strong men to move it!", 
    "Color is not brown nor grey kind of a greige. Microfiber material catches dog hair easily. Bench is heavy. Feet are weirdly shaped-not straight up and down kind of angled. Lots of room for blankets and pillows though so it works for us.", 
    "Great storage, no slide on wood floors, and comfortable. Adds extra seating and storage to my living room, which is exactly what I was looking for!", 
    "I bought this based on the reviews and the picture. Overstock said they changed the picture to reflect the actual piece. But the bench we received is a lot darker with much more gray than brown. It doesn't even come close to the picture. But there is a lot of storage space for our blankets and it's still a neutral so it works for us. The piece is well constructed and I love that it will be easy to keep clean. I certainly would have thought twice about buying if the picture would have shown the actual color though.", 
    "I love this bench. It is a great price for a good size and quality storage bench. However it is not slate grey as stated. It even says it on the box but it is more of a chocolate brown. I had read other reviews so expected this. Either color was ok with me but if you are looking for grey, this isn't the bench for you.", 
    "I bought this bench to put at the end of my daughter's queen sized bed. I needed it to be not as wide as the bed so that she could turn from the end of the bed and not run into it. Also this is her last room make-over, so a mature not childish look was necessary. It arrived with the hinge on. I only had to screw the legs on. The seat is very firm and able to hold her large teen friends. The material is a soft, imitation suede that feels luxurious. The storage is very deep. A toddler (or two) could easily hide in there. The seat doesn't sag or leave butt dimples. It's nice and firm, yet very comfortable. Finally, the price is unbeatable!! I love it.", 
    "This product is exactly what I was looking for as far as size, color and it arrived quickly. However, when I received it, it arrived slightly damaged. The lid was not aligned and so it is not flush with the main storage compartment. It looks like it might have been dropped on its corner. I don't have the time to return to exchange. But at least the hinge wasn't bent to far to still open and close. Oh well.", 
    "Perfect color and size storage bench/coffee table for my small apartment. I needed extra storage and a coffee table.so this was perfect! The color was a little darker than the photo like some other reviewers stated, which is what I needed! The wooden feet are sturdy and it took 5 minutes to put together. My only problem was during shipping something pierced the cardboard and damaged my bench. It was small and I didn't want to return it, so Overstock gave me a credit at my request. The customer service \"Chat help\" was fantastic & quick!", 
    "This bench looks even better in person. I am using it in my walk-in closet to store boots. I think I fit 15 pairs! I am very pleased with the quality and you can't beat the price.", 
    "I absolutely LOVE this bench. Not only did it arrive practically overnight, it was exactly what was advertised. The color is beautiful and the storage space holds much more than I expected. The low price makes this item a steal!", 
    "The quality of work is excellent. Also has lot of stroage space. I love it.", 
    "Excellent piece with plenty of storage. The color is dark charcoal. The bench lid needed realignment as it closed crooked. Once that was done, I love it.", 
    "Well made piece. Priced really well. All you need to do is screw on the legs. I bought two. My apartment is a size where I am always looking for more storage and this fit the bill.", 
    "Love it. Delivered fast and without damage. Quality item.", 
    "These seem well made, but are way darker than the photos, and the fabric has a suede like finish, almost with an eel skin look to it. Not at all what I was expecting, but still nice.The feet are packed inside the ottoman and are easy to screw in, but one of the feet did not screw in and was defective, so we're going to use gorilla glue to attach it. The hinges aren't that sturdy, but they do hold the top open (Hands Free) which is a nice design.I got two for additional seating in the Lliving Room. Hope they last.", 
    "Everything ok except no support on the side edges sink in when sitting. arrived in good shape and legs went on easily", 
    "What a wonderful bench! Very nice quality and it blends perfectly with the rest of my decor. I purchased this to go at the foot of my sleigh bed and I couldn't be happier. The photo doesn't do this beautiful bench justice. This was my first Overstock purchase and I've purchased 5 additional items since. Thanks Overstock!!!", 
    "I was extremely pleased with the quality of this item. It fits so well at the bottom of my bed. It is very deep and roomy. The legs are sturdy so it makes a great seat for relaxing. Very comfy. My kids love it when they come in to read or watch TV. It was well worth the price. My daughter bought one for her new apartment also.", 
    "Perfect just what I was looking for.", 
    "This was so easy to put together. All you have to do is attach the 4 legs. The fabric is almost a light suede. It's a great addition to our bedroom.", 
    "I love the beach it fits right in the room giving me seating and storage. The only problem is the legs. I had to send the first one back because the leg would not screw in properly. I also had a little problem we the tred on the second one I received but finally got the leg in.", 
    "This storage bench is a good purchase. It has a nice cover on it and is very sturdy. Overstock has a good product and the shipping is very good. I would buy it again, a nice unit", 
    "Great buy for the money. Sturdy and works well for extra storage", 
    "Just what I was looking for. Holds a lot.", 
    "Very well made piece. I bought it to store away all my handbags. Color is a litte darker than noted in the picture. Very attractive piece", 
    "The only complaint we have with this bench is the color. It shows a light tan and is a dark chocolate color. Other than that we are satisfied.", 
    "I bought this to store sheets and blankets and it worked out well. I do wish it was a little longer though so that I could store a little more.", 
    "Love it! Needed extra storage in my office as well as additional seating. It worked and looks great also!", 
    "This ottoman holds a lot of items. It is larger than I had expected. Nice color.", 
    "At first the material was not what I had expected but it grew on me. I can see where it would look grey and also dark taupe or brown. I ordered another because the (grey) looks great with red and black and the (dark taupe) looks great with taupe on taupe bedspread and med. blue walls. Just depends on where you put them. Both are exactly the same color. They are really sturdy and have a lot of storage space. Love it!!!!!!", 
    "Looks nice, great way to hide stuff away. Very happy. Buttons started coming off the top after a LOT of wear, but that wasn't likely the fault of the product", 
    "Very sturdy piece of furniture.", 
    "Very nice quality especially for the price. Very pleased.", 
    "I love love love this item. Great size, great secret storage and best of all i did not need to assemble anything. My 14 year old put the feet on it. What a great buy and i used my CLUB O dollars. #FREEISAWESOME", 
    "I purchased this to put at the end of my bed, it looks awesome in my room, sturdy, durable and a very nice storage unit.", 
    "The bench is quality made its darker in color then pictured though it's more brown. The storage is ample it was a great buy looks stylish in my guest room.", 
    "This bench arrived with the box torn in several places, so I was a little worried when I opened it. It is very heavy, so If you're a single gal like myself, you're going to need help lifting it into the house.Easy to put together; just screw the legs on and done.The color is a little darker than the picture, but it still goes with everything I have. The top DOES NOT snap shut when you open it which I love. It is spring loaded and shuts with the touch of a finger. I was concerned about the top either not staying up when opened, or just slamming shut on my fingers. It's a very good deal for the money for sure. Nice and roomy for storage. I keep my exercise stuff in it as well as as a couple throws. Very satisfied with this bench.", 
    "Very happy with this storage bench. The color is exact, storage good. Arrived in perfect condition", 
    "Very nice, good quality, can't beat the price.", 
    "Great storage bench - pretty solid. Color is darker in person.", 
    "wanted a cute little storage chest for blankets and comforters, this fits the bill, it`s decorative and sturdy. the nice feature is it is already put together so all you have to add is the legs, making it easy to do because my husband had an operation on his hand so i was able to do it myself", 
    "We are really happy with the quality of this piece. It is perfect for our living room.", 
    "Like others say the color is much darker. The bench holds a great amount and is comfy to sit on. Very easy to assemble.", 
    "This is so nice, all assembled, and great quality for the money.", 
    "It's great for the price definitely not high end furniture but works well for us and as far as color I saw some reviews calling it brown I think it is definitely grey", 
    "Great storage and adds an extra sitting place in the bedroom Sturdy and expensve looking", 
    "It's a little darker in person. Very good quality!", 
    "Lots of storage. Well made!", 
    "Great purchase. The bench is more of like a chocolate brown, its much darker in person. But it didn't bother me and still goes great in my foyer. Also has a lot of space inside for storage.", 
    "Looks nice, wears well, great storage. Its perfect in front of our window for our little dog to sit and watch his world. Stands up to his use just fine, while providing extra storage for stuff.", 
    "This bench arrived on time and only required the legs to be screwed on. Took seconds. The fabric is decent quality and the color is a slate gray. Very pretty and seems nicely constructed. Overall very please with this purchase!", 
    "Nice bench, somewhat like a saddle or soft leather. Perfect fit in my bedroom", 
    "I relied on these reviews in order to purchase this bench, so I figure I should return the favor. This bench is darker than the photo and more of a brown than a grey, but the look and feel are very nice. The cushion is very firm and doesn't feel super high quality, but for the price it is an excellent product. I highly recommend it!", 
    "I ordered this storage bench from Overstock a couple of few weeks ago and just love it. It arrived in less then a week after ordering. The only thing that I had to do was screw the legs on and it was ready to use. I just love the feel of the material, as it isn't that bonded leather, which I don't like. The added storage is a plus. The hinge allows the top to stay up when putting things into it. It appears to be sturdy, but time will tell. The only thing that I would have, liked would have been a choice of colors, but this grey is still very pretty.", 
    "This storage bench is a rich dark grey in color and matches my basement living room perfectly. We have lighter grey furniture and wanted something that we could slide over for extra seating when we have friends over for the game. The top is plush and seems like it will hold up well. Assembly as a breeze, we just had to screw on the legs by hand. Easy peasy and looks great in our space!", 
    "This ottoman fit our needs. It provides a comfortable foot rest and ample storage for blankets and games.", 
    "I had read all the reviews of this bench .I was not disappointed . It is sturdy very easy to put together .great size I am able to store all of the decorative pillows and extra blanket inside easily. Very pleased it is very well made .pleased with purchase.", 
    "The bench is very nice and looks to be well made. BUT the picture on the website is not even close to the color of this bench. Slate grey in my opinion does not describe it either. This is a Dark grey bench. They really need to take a different picture. I don't think the lighting can make that much difference. That picture is of a tan or brownish bench. This bench is dark grey as I said. Other than that, I really like it. Probably would have given it an excellent rating if the color picture and description had been more accurate.", 
    "Nice bench with lots of room for storage as compared to other benches I have seen. Decent quality for the price and looks great. Simple assembly, just screw in the feet and its ready to go. Very pleased.", 
    "Even nicer than I thought it would be. Good storage room. I really am tickled with it. The color is perfect.", 
    "This bench was purchased for our bedroom. After looking in several stores, I decided to take my search online. Overstock had the best price and I spent a great deal of time reading the reviews for various benches. Overall this bench is amazing! Color is perfect in our bedroom and the quality is great! My husband and I can both sit on the bench without fearing it will collapse. It arrived sooner than I had expected and putting the feet on the bench was a breeze. I highly recommend this bench!!", 
    "I needed a comfortable bench for extra seating in a window alcove next to a fireplace, so I looked for a long time for something that met all the requirements. It had to be solid enough for adults to sit on (easily fits two people); it had to be a gray or cool neutral color to work with the stonework on the fireplace; it had to fit the dimensions of the space and not be higher than the window ledge. I also preferred a storage bench and one that had comfortable upholstery. This bench met all of the criteria. The microsuede fabric is of good quality and the suede texture gives it a contemporary look. The storage space is very large. None of the materials give off an objectionable chemical odor, and I am very sensitive to such things. So far, (I've only had it about a month), the upholstery foam is holding up and springs back after it has been compressed. All in all, a good product.", 
    "bought this to store my daughters toy in our living room and additional seating --- great produce large storage, allows our living room to be more functional.", 
    "awesome bench....room for my son's extra clothing and still looks great. Comfortable to sit on too!", 
    "Overall, REALLY like this bench and especially please with the fabric and seating comfort. However, one of the hinges is not quite right and makes the top look \"off side\" when looking at it from the sides. Hubby is going to see if he can fix it or get a different hinge, but hasn't so far. For the money, I feel it was a good purchase and happy with the product. Just wish we didn't have the hinge problem as it was exactly what I was looking for. I haven't contacted Overstock.com as I'm not sure I would want to hassle with trying to return it.", 
    "The bench came in 3 days. It was exactly as described, were using it as a bench at the end of our bed and to hold dirty laundry. It's big enough for one week of laundry which is perfect. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "the bench looks way richer in person than on the site. i was concerned it would look really micro-fiber like and cheap, but it's not. the fabric looks like it has a mix of leather in it, so there's texture to it. visually i think it could it could almost fit in any decor. seems flexible enough. overall, nice item.", 
    "We love this bench in our mudroom! It hides all of our shoes and bags and it great for putting on shoes. It is very sturdy and I am so happy we didn't just go to the big box store and get the one we would have had to put together. This came as one piece. I just had to screw on the feet. Also love that it doesn't slam shut, you have to push it most of the way. This will be great once our little one can put his own shoes away.", 
    "This is perfect right at my back door in kitchen,makes a nice seat to put your shoes on & a great storage for kids to store back packs & shoes when they come in @ back door :) No more 5 pairs of shoes & back packs at the door against wall,no more clutter mess!!!", 
    "I'm very glad I got this, I replaced a chest of drawers as the drawers were in a guest bedroom and didn't get used that much. This is much more functional. The storage area is deep and I've already loaded it up, my overnight guest like it for putting their bags and sitting on it. Very happy with this buy....except for the color, but oh well.", 
    "I bought this item to give my daughter some extra drawer space for her small bedroom. The color and texture look amazing with her modern furniture. It's also a wonderful seating addition to the room. The item is sturdy and very well made. All I had to do was attach the legs and it was ready to use. If you are looking for a bench with lots of storage space this is a great choice.", 
    "This storage bench was exactly what I have been looking for. It has great storage capacity and is excellent quality", 
    "I ordered this bench on Monday and it arrived on Wednesday. The color is more of a charcoal grey and the texture is more of a soft pebbled leather. I bought this bench for my dining table and the height is perfect with the legs on. The interior is neatly lined and spacious. The cushion isn't bouncy but sinks more like memory foam. Great storage bench considering the price!", 
    "It is pretty much what you get from the picture, it is a little darker and less shiny in person. The bottom stands need to be attached, which is the only assembly required.", 
    "It's pretty big--quite tall, more bench height than ottoman height. I wanted to add casters to the legs but it would be too tall, so now I want to look for casters that can replace the legs. It's quite heavy, and I loaded it with bedding for a sleeper sofa, and it's not easy to move; that's why I want to add casters so it can be moved easily to make up the bed for the sleeper sofa. I use this in a guest room/office, and needed the storage space. It holds a mattress pad/cover, two full pillows, a set of sheets, and a matalasse coverlet with no room to spare--couldn't fit the blanket in too. The lid is quite deep, but sealed off so your storage space stops where the hinge is. I bought gray to go with a gray sofa, but the colors don't work that well together--wish I had bought it in brown.", 
    "This is a great storage bench. Roomy inside, perfect for bedroom or living room. Color is a bluish gray, same as is pictured. True to the measurements on the website, and one of the bigger inside storage compartments for similar benches this size. I don't know why, but this seemed shorter than what I expected, legs are kind of short and I was hoping for a hollow lid to get a little more space out of the storage compartment, but all in all, still satisfied with this purchase.", 
    "The hinge on the right side of the bench broke the first time I tried to open and close it--it bent or something and the screws tore right out of the side. The hinge on the other side worked fine. The microfiber material is smooth and comfortable to touch and sit on. It's a pretty good bench for the money, but don't expect it to hold up to really hard use. The way the lid is constructed (it's solid) means that the inside storage space is reduced from what it might be if the lid were hollow, but I am able to fit two thick folded blankets inside. I really got this as a step for my dog to get up on and off of the bed, and it's great for that and actually cost less than many dog steps I looked at. It's really nice to have a seat in the bedroom, too.", 
    "I needed a storage unit for overnight houseguests. This will go in the living room and double as extra seating. It has the most storage area of anything I found with the same footprint at a moderate price, so I'm pleased. Hope it holds up over time. It does have a slightly moldy smell, probably from sitting in a warehouse, and I assume that will dissapate. I may just put it in the sun for 3-4 hours, that should do the trick.", 
    "I've only have this item for a few weeks, but its great. Much darker in person though, almost black. But it does hold a lot of stuff.", 
    "I love the bench, easy to put together and not tremendously heavy. Color on site is very close to actual. Works very well with my dark gray bedroom furniture. Love the price!", 
    "This bench arrived quickly, wasn't too heavy and is really a nice piece of furniture! Love Overstock!!", 
    "I was looking for a bench at least 19\" high. this one is only about 18\" and goes even lower if you sit on it. Rather than going to the trouble of sending it back, I think I'll need to put something under the feet raise it a bit", 
    "First of all, I am very impressed by the sturdy quality of the bench and the attractive appearance, which exceeded my expectations. I hadn't thought microsuede fabric could give the appearance of leather, but it does on this bench; and I actually prefer the microsuede, because it feels softer, warmer and cozier. Most of all, though, I am impressed with the storage capacity, which is twice that of some of the more expensive benches I looked at on-line."
