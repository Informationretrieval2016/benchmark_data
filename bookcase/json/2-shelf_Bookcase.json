    "I insensibly purchased several of these units for my craft room. Now I'm stuck. The shelves cannot support a full load of much of anything -- bowing in the middle. The brackets supporting them are small plastic plugs with only a small surface area in contact with the shelf. I expect to hear a loud crash, one day, when one of those shelves collapses. In the meantime, I'm trying to sort out a way of rigging additional support -- not the kind of chore I was expecting to have to undertake given the cost of these units.", 
    "I was extremely surprised to see the poor quality of this product. No wood in the construction, only press board and it was chipped and scratched when I received it. I cannot recommend this for use in anyones home. Very poor quality.", 
    "The bookcase is a nice size to fit under a window. It is a slightly more orangey color than I would have liked and the veneer on the chipboard is very thin so there were some dings and chips but none serious enough to worry about, especially as I got it for a 4-year old's room. However, once assembled it feels sturdy and you can get a lot in it.", 
    "This is the second time that I purchased the Sonoma bookshelves. I love them. They are easy to put together.Sturdy.Nice looking.", 
    "I really like this bookcase for it's size and versitility.", 
    "Worked perfect in the space I purchased it for. Seems a little unsteady, even with all screws tightened properly. Easy to put together.", 
    "It was the perfect size, easy to put together and looks good.", 
    "The Sonoma bookshelf was what I expected, functional but not particularly great. The top was damaged one corner and there was a 3 1/2\" scratch on the surface, which looked to be caused by a knife or box-cutter, that was annoying. Overall, I am keeping the piece because it is functional, but rather than seeming like a new piece due to the wear & tear of shipping, it looks like I've had it a while.", 
    "It showed up with no installation instructions!", 
    "Had trouble finding a small two shelf bookcase, and this was perfect. Easy to assemble and good value. It's not solid wood of course, the finish is very rich and attractive.", 
    "This was easy to put together and really is an attractive bookshelf. It is still partially \"pressed board\" but I have had several heavy books on the middle shelf with no sagging like some others I have had in the past. It looks great in my living room. I'm happy I purchased it. Shipping was fast and packing was great.", 
    "This is exactly what we expected. Assembly was a breeze!", 
    "The bookcase I received from Overstock was an exceptional value. The quality was actually quite good, and the price was less that half of comparable \"unfinished\" products. It was relatively easy to assemble as well. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested in a 2 shelf bookcase.", 
    "The bookcase arrived on time, in very good condition. It looks good . It was easy to put together. I miss real wood, but then I would have had to pay twice or three times as much.", 
    "For the price, I thought I was getting a nice, heavy bookshelf made of wood. Instead it is made similar to a shelf I bought years ago at local chain store for $$. It came with the top damaged and the customer service was outstanding.", 
    "it is broken already after about 1 year of use.", 
    "I liked the first one so much that I bought a second one. I've had the first for a year. They're a great deal for the price. In fact, they'd even be great for a higher price. I did a lot of shopping around, and I'm very pleased to have found these.", 
    "this bookshelf shipped quickly, was easy to assemble, and looks terrific in our room; a perfect match to much more expensive furniture we already had :-)", 
    "Needed a bookcase to match in my sons room. The color is a nice medium oak stain so it matched the other furniture nicely. The quality isn't the greatest but will work fine for holding children's books.", 
    "I purchased two of these bookcases for my new rental home. Because I am furnishing the space for a limited time, I did not want to put extensive funds into furniture that I may not need once I downsize. These bookcases are sturdy and uniform in color. The construction was easy, and I needed the enclosed instructions. They look beautiful in my bedroom!", 
    "This book case is sturdy and of good quality. It was purchased for music storage and is well-suited for that purpose.", 
    "This is a very nice bookcase. I would like to have another one like it in another finish - golden oak. I am a 65 year 0ld woman & it was very easy to assemble.", 
    "This is a very sturdy and nice bookcase, currently use it as a TV stand. Very easy assembly and I highly recommend it.", 
    "Easy to assemble and looks good when done. Pretty sturdy.", 
    "I bought four of these in a maple color for my library. The bookshelves were easy to assemble and looks great. Very stylish.. They are sturdy and hold a lot of books. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and am looking to purchase another.", 
    "Beautiful 2 shelf bookcase!!! Very easy to assemble!!! Love the rich color!!! Love the smell!!!!", 
    "nicer than one would expect given the price. Fast shipping and great shipping price (always at Overstock.com!).", 
    "This item is as advertised. Attractive appearance and easy to assemble. Can be used for a variety of purposes.", 
    "I love my book cases and plan on buying more in the future. They were super easy to assemble and I had them put together in no time.", 
    "I am thrilled with this bookcase. Assembly was quick and painless. It looks beautiful under my window, next to my sofa.", 
    "We purchased two bookcases and they look really nice. They sturdy and and are holding up well.", 
    "I use this bookcase for my photo albums. It is perfect for the big albums they fit upright on the shelf.", 
    "This shelf unit went together easily with easy instructions. It is heavier and stronger than I expected and looks beautiful. I was very pleased.", 
    "Great for a child's playroom. Definitely worth the price. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Bookcase arrived in good condition. I had a friend put it together for me. It's sturdy enough & fairly heavy.", 
    "I liked the bookcase. The price is excellent. The only problem is that the top shelf will not hold the binders we intended for it because of the horizontal cross member at the top. The bottom shelf accepts the binders just fine. There is no cross piece restricting that space. We will have to put something other than 12\" tall binders on the top shelf, however. We could have avoided our disappointment had you disclosed the actual vertical and horizontal openings of each shelf.", 
    "The bookcase was what I expected and looks pretty decent. I think it's a bit pricey, given its construction from MDF and the flimsy back (that others have mentioned). It went together easily in about 20 minutes, and the only thing needing any sort of skill was nailing on the back.", 
    "I received my order in three days even though I used regular shipping. I was please at the ease of assembly. I would order this product again.", 
    "The shelf is absolutely beautiful. We bought it for our daughters room for storing books. It is much nicer and sturdier than I thought it would be at that price. It really does look like a nice piece of furniture (we bought the maple one). Great value especially compared to others that we looked at.", 
    "Went together fairly easily. I wouldn't put it in the living room, but it's fine for my needs in a secondary bedroom. The back piece is REALLY cheap--cardboard with wood-grain contact paper, but mostly it doesn't show so it's OK. It's actually sturdy enough to hold books!", 
    "We purchased this model because it fits the space and decor of our small office perfectly. Upon opening the package, we found the entire top piece to be split completely through. Disappointed, we called the contact number on the outside of the shipping box. Very nice representative took the information and in less than a week sent us a perfect replacement piece. Put the thing together 1,2,3 no fuss, no bother. No extra shipping charges. No aggravation. I'd buy it again !", 
    "I was extremely pleased with this product. The quality of workmanship was very professional. The finish was beautiful. It was very easy to put together and I am considering purchasing another in order to have a set of two..", 
    "I had previously purchased the larger bookcase unit & wanted to add the smaller unit to my son's bedroom. Perfect match & just as easy to assemble as the other unit. All hardware perfectly labelled & some extra pieces, too.", 
    "I've bought several book shelves and had to assemble all of them. This one was ok in that area, but the workmanship was a little flimsy--but for the price it's just ok.", 
    "I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOKCASE. ASSEMBLED OF CHEAP PRESSED BOARD WITH THIN OVERLAY. IT WAS SIMPLE TO ASSEMBLE--THAT IS THE ONLY PLUS. THE BOTTOM SHELF CRACKED AS I WAS MOVING IT INTO PLACE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WILL USE THIS PIECE -MAYBE IN A CLOSET .", 
    "Very easy to assemble but amazingly very sturdy It looks great tooit was just the right size for our small study station", 
    "I bought a few of the matching pieces from this collection and they look great for the price. It took about 15 minutes to put together and it seems quite sturdy. Highly recommended.", 
    "great little cabinet...used it for a small fish tank stand...", 
    "I needed this exact size bookcase and am so very glad that Overstock offered this one. I am 73 years young and a little infirm, but had absolutely NO trouble putting this together. All directions were so easy to follow I couldn't believe it. I also put together a glass coffee table that is just beautiful !! Being able to shop online like this is wonderful--who can get to the stores and then pay extra to have something delivered !!! I really like this Overstock store !!!", 
    "This was a gift. My friend says he like the bookcase. His only problem with it was the following: he said it took a while to assemble because of the not-so-easy directions. Otherwise, he is now enjoying the case.", 
    "When it arrived we noticed a ding in the top. I just didn't feel like paying to send it back. It was easy to assemble and it serves my needs.", 
    "I looked everywhere for a 2 shelf unit that would fit under the window in the nursery. This was the only one I could find. The assembly was easy once you decipher the pictoral directions. It's not the most durable piece of furniture you will have in your house, but it's serving it's purpose and it looks good.", 
    "I love my new bookcase! I have it in the oak finish and it matches my other furniture very well. I assembled the bookcase myself and it went together very easily. I would definitely recommend this to anyone because I am so pleased with it myself!", 
    "i was disappointed to find some key pieces of the bookshelves were damaged either in packing or in shipping. Nothing a little elmer's glue couldn't fix but frustrating given what i paid for the bookshelves.", 
    "very nice for a kids room or playroom. Easy to put together. Not the best quality, but certainly worth the purchase", 
    "nice item for the pirce,not a show peice, but good basic easy to put together bookcase which allows for smaller spaces...this is the second one I have purchsed..read a lot and holds good sized books.", 
    "I was very pleased with the Sonoma bookshelf. It was perfect for my little boy's room. It holds all his books and puzzles. It was well worth the price!", 
    "This is a sturdy, beautiful bookcase. I am very pleased with this purchase.", 
    "Beautful bookcase, well packaged, nicely constructed. Came with a slight corner chip which we touched up ourselves. Would buy again.", 
    "I was very pleased with the quality and appearance of the book shelf. I gave it as a gift and wished that I had ordered one for myself as well. Assembly was quick and easy as well.", 
    "I think the product is excellent. The directions to put it together were very clear and direct. However, there were some parts missing, and I cannot finish putting it together. I need the back and some black plastic connectors. There were not enough packed. Thank you...", 
    "Very nice bookcase. However,I wanted it to put my phonograph records in, and the inside height of the shelves weren't high enough. Since it was such a nice bookcase, I kept it, and am using it for other media storage.", 
    "The book case was damaged when I opened the packing, the left top corner was broken off for about 3 inches, as well the right corner was dented in.I determined it was not worth the hassel of returning it and opted to repair the top as best as possible. The top looks ok unless you get close.I don't think the price was worth the over all quality of this book case.", 
    "The book shelf looked very good. Was easy to assemble but the inspection of the product before shipping was bad. An entire piece of the top pressed wood was damaged! If it wouldn't have luckily been on the side you don't see, under most of the overpart I would have returned it right away!", 
    "Beautful bookcase, well packaged, nicely constructed. Came with a slight corner chip which we touched up ourselves. Would buy again.", 
    "I was very pleased with the quality and appearance of the book shelf. I gave it as a gift and wished that I had ordered one for myself as well. Assembly was quick and easy as well.", 
    "It is great. Took no time to assemble. I love it. Thanks for a great product"
