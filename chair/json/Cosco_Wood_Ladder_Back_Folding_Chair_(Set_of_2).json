    "I ordered two sets of the Cosco Wood Ladder Back Folding Chairs. I had researched numerous sites looking for these and trying to get the best value for my money. Overstock had a great price and the service they rendered was great. I have a very small apartment and needed a small table. I had been looking for over a month when I saw that Cosco made a nice wood folding table and chairs. The size fit perfectly into my small apartment yet they are so nice that they keep the place dressed up. The chairs have a nicely padded vinyl cushion and they fold up neatly when not in use. When you have them unfolded, they have a small catch that keeps them in the out position so you don't have to worry about them accidently collapsing on you. They are very sturdy and nicely made. I am extremely happy with my purchase.", 
    "We needed folding chairs to add extra space to dining room table when we have more than 6 guests. Did not want cheap looking chairs but did not have space to store several more chairs. These folding chairs are perfect. Easy to store, yet do not have that \"padded folding chair\" look that inexpensive folding chairs have. Bought two to try them out and will buy two more.", 
    "These chairs are amazing! Strong, comfy and look much more expensive then they were. Great seller and fast shipping too!", 
    "Bought a set of these to use for guests at our dining table. Turns out we use them for lots of things. Currently we are using one as a desk chair. The fold easily and don't take up a lot of room in the closet. They are also sturdy. Great for appartment living.", 
    "Nice quality, sturdy, and looks so very nice.", 
    "great for storing away. but very useful and nice quality. great if you don't have a lot of space.", 
    "I bought this set of folding chairs,as,exta,seating. The chairs are attractive and well made. I found them to be an excellent value for the price paid. The chairs are comfortable,to,sit in,mama feature not often found in folding chairs", 
    "These chairs are great, especially for the price", 
    "Good quality! Looks nice in our small dinning room!", 
    "Lovely chairs, sturdy, comfortable, good hardware, but a little tricky to fold up. I purchased four of them to go with the Cosco folding expresso wood table. This set looked so nice with our other furniture. Our old card table just didn't look so nice anymore and it wasn't stable enough for children to sit at. This one was just right.", 
    "These chairs are a great addition for extra seating. They look good -- as a matter of fact, they look better than the chairs that go with the dining table - and they are easily folded and stored when not in use. They could also stand alone as side chairs. Nicely padded seat, too.", 
    "I was very satisfied with the quality of these chairs and they also look very nice too. They seem to be very sturdy.", 
    "These chairs were a big hit. The fact that you can fold them and put them away makes them great gifts for small areas.", 
    "Easy to open, and to put away and store. Look nice. Strong and sturdy.", 
    "I ordered these folding chairs for a newly acquired table for entertaining purposes. When not in use, they store neatly in a closet. These chairs are sturdy, attractive, comfortable and very reasonably priced.", 
    "Chairs are very sturdy and attractive. Might be a little narrow for a very large person. Great for when you need extra seating. I ordered two sets and one arrived damaged by the shipper. Overstock made the replacement very easy. Now waiting one new replacement set to arrive and UPS to pick up the damaged chair.", 
    "These are amazing in appearance, sturdiness & price. And the best part? No assembly. I even contemplated ordering more and making them my everyday dining chairs. Highly recommend for backup chairs.", 
    "Excellent value, worked great for the holidays.", 
    "Super sturdy, great looking, easy to operate. Only downside is that they do not fold super flat so they take extra room in a closet. I would definitely buy again.", 
    "Nice value, sturdy, but lock is hard to operate, no directions it opened hard and bruised hand", 
    "I bought these chairs as temporary replacements for my dining room chairs. I chose these chairs because after we get our permanent dining room chairs they can serve as good extra chairs when we entertain.", 
    "These are really nice for folding chairs. Look very nice and are comfortable", 
    "I now have 10 of these chairs, originally purchased as a test to replace those awful cold metal folding chairs. These are great quality for the money. I love: they are much more comfortable, they sit higher than the metal chairs so you are on par with the other chairs at the table AND they blend in at the table. The finish will scratch so keep them neatly stacked when not in use.", 
    "Very good folding chairs, sturdy and attractive. I ordered six and am going to order two more. I suppose that says it all.", 
    "These chairs were perfect to use as extra seating at our dining room table. Comfortable and sturdy plus easy to store when not in use.", 
    "STURDY,ATTRACTIVE&EASY TO STORE", 
    "I love these chairs! They are comfortable and waaay under priced!", 
    "very good quality for a great price", 
    "Needed a couple extra chairs for a small gathering quickly, so I bought these. You can find chairs of this quality, for less money. I've seen them. These are nice, but I could have spent less money for basically the same thing if I had time to shop around.", 
    "It is very hard to find the folding chairs that still look good with your indoor furniture. These chairs are the case!", 
    "These are nice-looking and fold up. Since I am retiring in a couple of years, I'm prone to buying things that are compact, so I love the folding feature of these. They are sturdy and the wood looks great.", 
    "The chairs are ok they service there purpose but are not the best quality I expected.", 
    "These chairs are small but nicely made. I wouldn't trust them with someone weighing over 150. I purchased them to use when we have all the family over for extra seating at dining table. I have my grandchildren sit in them.", 
    "I haven't used yet, just checked them when they came in for damage. There wasn't. For the price they look like they will do the job.", 
    "Pop them out, open them up and they do the job in a pretty way. They work with my actual dining chairs, but they go away when when the party is over.", 
    "I have a small house, so \"foldability\" is important to me. These chairs store beautifully and look great when in use. When they are unfolded you would never know they were folding chairs!", 
    "I love these chairs. They don't look or sit like folding chairs. I would recommend them to my friends.",

    "Look really nice and not like folding chairs....saweet.", 
    "Perfect choice for my bridge games. Much betters than the old school card table and chairs.",
