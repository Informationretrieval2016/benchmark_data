    "This desk is very substantial and quite heavy. I love the look and the shelves. It is really a good size. The instructions were very easy to follow and the assembly went smoothly. I put it together myself, and I am a 53 year old woman. I did use a drill for some of the screws. I love overstock.com. This desk would work with many different decorating styles.", 
    "Nice solid desk .Good price.", 
    "Bought this desk for my husband's office/man room. Plenty big enough without being too big. Well made and sturdy. Love the industrial look. I don't know how hard it was to put together since I hired someone to do it. He did not take long to do it.", 
    "Considering how heavy and badly welded the parts for the shelf were I was worried the desk would also be badly constructed. Not so. Easy to assemble and solid. I love it.", 
    "This is a very good unassuming desk for the home office. There is ample off the desk top storage for manuals, a printer and other less used peripherals. This is a well built, well designed desk. Assembly is required, but was quite straightforward.", 
    "Had a like help assembling but they did it quickly and the desk is really cool", 
    "The product arrived in good condition and exactly as advertised. The color is dark brown. Some people on here say it's red or cherry but it's not - definitely dark brown. Very sturdy. It took us less than 15 minutes to put it together. That said, assembly does require two people. It's quite sturdy and looks nice.", 
    "Easy to put together, came w/some minor scuffs but was able to polish them out. Top is not real wood.", 
    "Very nice easy to put together with a drill", 
    "The colour of the desk is more red than coffee and we were really disappointed. It also looked like the box had been previously opened as the screws were scattered inside the box with some missing. I don't know if I would order a desk again from Overstock or Renate. I kept it because it would have been too much of a hassle to pack it up and return it since I live in Canada.", 
    "good, high quality product. solid and attractive", 
    "This desk was the perfect look, size, color and design I was searching for. I really took my time, checked out other sites but I kept getting drawn to this desk for the look I needed. I must admit, it was an impeccable choice! Looks gorgeous, feels sturdy, fits perfectly in my space. Not too small and not too big, but just right! Buy it and enjoy it! it's worth it.", 
    "Nice quality, great styleSolid piece of furniture", 
    "Beautiful dark finished desk. Looks much more expensive than it is. Easy to assemble. However came with a shelf and the main desk slab already chipped. Wasn't worth the effort to repackage and send back.", 
    "Very easy to assemble and looks great. Looks exactly as shown in the picture.", 
    "I bought this to use as my desk in my craft room. I can easily load a printer, a copier and instructional books....everything I need for easy access without drawers. I do wish it had come with an option slide-out to put my keyboard on for my computer. But I will add that later. Wood is thick, heavy and solid. Does not wobble. Took minutes for my husband and I to put together. I truly love this piece.", 
    "Perfect for a small office. Holds my Mac and printer with 4 extra shelves. Great color. Well made.", 
    "Nothing I found wrong with it", 
    "Nice looking desk. A lot cheaper than ***** ******!", 
    "Desk is sturdy and well made. I had no problem putting it together. I wanted a desk that didn't require a lot of maintenance like dusting. This is the one for me.", 
    "Very easy to put together. The wood is very dark-almost has a red/orange look to it.", 
    "Very poor quality. I was very disappointed when I received this desk. The hardware was terrible, the metal was bent and I was not able to screw anything together. Not worth the money at all.", 
    "I read the reviews on the product and decided to purchase it. The price was perfect. Once we put it together we were so satisfied with the quality of the desk. It was exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "Nice looking simple piece. I wasn't sure if this desk would seem flimsy, but I was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy and solid it is. I'm very happy with this purchase.", 
    "The desk was what I expected. Loved it! Great quality and made well.", 
    "This desk has a solid design and build. Warm color and smooth lines make it a pleasure to work from home."
