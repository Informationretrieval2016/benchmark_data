    "I am extremely happy with my cookware. They are durable and clean up easily.", 
    "Nice basic set. The vented glass lids are quite nice. Only flaw I found was a bit of a wobble in the plating on the frying pan bottom edge but the pan cooks just fine. Not serious enough to return and does not impact the pans cooking ability. This would be a good set for a college student or young bride.", 
    "cooks evenly, the only con is that food sticks but thats what you get with stainless steel. its a very nice looking set as well.", 
    "quality is great but they will stick if you dont know how to cook in non stick pots, it looks verrrry nice on top of my stove.", 
    "I purchased this set for my daughter-in-law at Christmas. She hasn't stopped thanking me since.", 
    "Pros: The Set contains many pots for the price. The rubberized handles allows for you to hold them without pot holders. The heat from my ceramic top stove distributes evenly and quickly. The highest I have cook on is 8 (of 10) or else things burn.Cons: Everything sticks to them. Rice, pasta, mashed potatoes all leave marks that can only be removed by scrubbing with a mild abrasive. Also, the bonus set of cooking utensils were not included in my set.", 
    "I have not used any of the pieces yet. I do want to say that while one pot turned out to be warped, Overstock sent another entire set free of charge for me to select pieces and then return. It is ready to go and I have received the return label. Overstock makes things very easy.", 
    "i am very pleased with the set, it stores well. the style, and weight are great. i use it with induction cooking.made some super veg soup", 
    "This set is soooo much smaller than it actually appears. I bought it for a gift for my mom because she loves and desires stainless steel cookware over all others. Being that she and my father had their original set since they first married over 40 years ago I wanted to surprise them with a more modern style set but it was very very disappointing. My mom is an awesome cook but was unable to make use of these simple pots because they burned after the first use and after she hand washed them she noticed that around the handle was beginning to peel. So consumers, please continue searching for a set that's more reliable.", 
    "I purchased for a wedding gift. It was the perfect choice for my budget. Compared to other stores I spent 50% of same quality sets.", 
    "I have cooked with stainless steel for 30 years and this is a wonderful quality cookware set, and the price is unbelievable.", 
    "I received this set last week and I could not wait to use them. I made my first dinner in them on that evening and perfectly easy to clean up. This cookware is excellent for the price\u0097lovely to look at, and wonderful to use. I was not sure about ordering this set due to price and the negative review the internet, so I wanted to make sure I left a review for future buyers. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.", 
    "great cookware set. I have to say, the set is very durable. the handle feels comfortable and the pots are heavy enough to hold the foods and not overweight to make the cooking like an exercise. that's genius. I used to have some pots. but they are either too light or too heavy. with this set, I cook more at home and enjoy the time cooking every much. thanks to the set, I have a healthier life style. you should really consider this set. it's a sincere helper at home.", 
    "My daughter needed a set of pots and pans so this was perfect. The price was excellent for the set I received. I am so thankful I bough them for her for Christmas. She is now finally really learning how to cook.....yipee!", 
    "Ordered this set, but got two of the same covers for one pan, so I have to exchange a cover yet, otherwise satisfied with the looks of this cookware.", 
    "These pans are a little lighter weight than some but seem to spread the heat and brown well.", 
    "This is a really nice set, I would highly recomend ordering it. The price is great!", 
    "Great product for the price, I was pleasantly surprised with how easy they are to clean!", 
    "This was a gift for my sister who is a great cook. She loves the entire set.", 
    "My new cookware is far beyond what I expected for the money. NOT TO BE PRINTED: The set does not come in either red or black. It is a beautiful chrome finish", 
    "This is an excellent set of cookware.... very sturdy, an excellent variety of cookware sizes, and each cookware item includes a lid. Highly recommended, especially for such an incredibly reasonable price.", 
    "this set is a great value because its not that expensive and it comes with the cooking utensils, i used it last night to make chicken stew and it cook great. i love this set, i may get one for my sister for christmas if it goes on sale", 
    "I got this cookware as a gift from my mother in law for our anniversary and I love them, they are really nice. not too expensive but very good quality. I use lower heat and they cook uniformly, clean up isnt that bad. I use brillo.", 
    "Very beautiful, came on time. Can't wait to use them!", 
    "Not the Stainless Steel I am use to! Takes for every to heat grease or boil water! It's usable!", 
    "All the pots essentials in a stocked kitchen, Nicely made.", 
    "Very nice design however when you cooking something FORGET grabbing the handle as it gets really hot!", 
    "The kind of frying pan which has a handle that bends the actual metal of the pan after a while. Not very stiff or resistant. Will last me a couple of months before I need to replace it.", 
    "it serves the purpose, not to hard to clean, but leaves water stains after cleaning it.", 
    "they are alright could have bought a set at ********* and had the same results", 
    "A Christmas gift for my mom. She absolutely loves them. She still raves about the quality and even cooking surface", 
    "I LOVE THESE .....i have used them several times since i purchased great quality and great price for the set", 
    "Good weight, do a great job for a good price.", 
    "My only complaint is the handles that can get warm and burn my hand while holding the pots. I also wish it was non stick which would be my preference next time I get a set.", 
    "I have been looking for these for sometime now and for this price had to get them immediately very good price and quality", 
    "Thanks for carrying this item.", 
    "easy to look at clean, to cook in and really easy to have in my home", 
    "I love this set. Use it every day, easy to clean.", 
    "nice cookware , had one bent pot in order. works ok lid will still fit", 
    "The handles get muy caliente", 
    "the pots are good quality and a great buy", 
    "I haven't used them yet. Can't cook but I hope to learn. They look great", 
    "I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package, the bottom is m uch thicker than I had expected, give even heating. A bit heavy, overall, great product for the price.", 
    "Rubber on the handles came off after a few months", 
    "I wanted this set because dollar to dollar well worth the price.This set is sturdy and not cheap, and the pot and pans are not to thickas those others that require more time to heat up, and in my case more fuel propane. Over all an awesome deal and the tool set makes this a deal to buy.thanks Gary", 
    "Still looks great after a year! Worth every penny! Washes easy in dishwasher ! Very durable !!", 
    "I am extremely impressed with these pans. They were better than I expected and very affordable. The only thing I've had to adjust to is using a non-stick spray or oil before each use. Some foods will burn or stick to the pan without it. I'd prefer that over a non-stick coating on my pans.", 
    "Pots are nice and the glass tops help not burn food", 
    "This is the first stainless steel set that we purchased. I gotta tell you that it takes some getting used to as it doesn't require as much heat as the nonstick ones. Generally we bring up the heat to high for a min or two to heat up the pan then switch to Med or low (when no liquids involved). I know that all cooktops are different so you will need to figure out what works for you. Other than that we have been using them for the past 5-6 months and we love them.", 
    "I have used these and I must say they cleanup great, and the water boils faster in these I love them.", 
    "pots and pans are great non stick pans so much to offer", 
    "cute set. got red! needed the silicone handles, great idea", 
    "They work just fine, but I can see they will need to be replaced here shortly and I have had them less than a month.", 
    "I was a little nervous to purchase this set but I couldn't beat the price. I was in need of a new cookware set and this seemed to be perfect. My food doesn't stick to the pots or pan and the handles are perfect. I can lift the pots without using oven guards. Buy it!", 
    "Good quality.", 
    "It was nice i will recommend it", 
    "Moving into a new home and needed new pans. What a deal and a sharp looking addition to my new kitchen.", 
    "I purchased this set for my daughter who just moved into her first apartment. She needed cookware among many other things. She was pleasantly surprised at the solid weight of the set. She also tells me that they cook evenly and clean up well. Good starter set for the money.", 
    "Horrible set, I just got this set recently and it's already rusting! How??", 
    "This cookware set was nicely packaged and does the job. I was a little disappointed that the heat resistant handles are NOT heat resistant, so watch it when you pick the pans up when hot. Overall good value for the price.", 
    "Looks nice, but before I was able to use them, the rubber grips fell of the handle on two of the piece of the cookware. I am sure this will happen to the other pieces.", 
    "I am quite upset with these pots and pans. One of the utensils broke a week after having it, and I never even used it, it was still in the box. I also made sausage and the grease from the food is stuck on the pan and will not come off after 2 days of scrubbing.", 
    "There is not one negative thing I can say about this set. The price was insane, and I am 100% pleased.", 
    "Love the products, !!! Will order again in the future", 
    "These are a nice set for the money.A good weight and they clean up nicely.You have to know how to adjust the heat to avoid too much sticking.A wonderful starter set.", 
    "Very good value set of pans,look good and a great variety of sizes.Arrived very quickly", 
    "This was a gift for my daughter and she loves them! They are a good quality and nice looking, too! Great value! They also arrived in plenty of time and undamaged!", 
    "Perfect for my daughter in law who loves to cook! When young they have different pieces that do not match. Now she has a beautiful set to be proud of when she has company!", 
    "very nice cookware, i used it several times and food came out wonderfully.", 
    "You did it again Overstock ! ! ! This 15 piece set is exquisite can not wait to cook.", 
    "Cooks evenly and is easy to clean. I would recommend.", 
    "I had to buy all new pots and pans...because I bought a flat top stove. These pans are good....but the pans that I had were heavier and seemed like a better quality. Don't get me wrong...these are good pans for the person like me that cooks maybe 3 times a week.", 
    "We love cooking with these pots. They cook evenly are easy to clean. We love being able to see what we are cooking through the clear glass lids.", 
    "I love the pots just start cooking with them and they seem to hold up nicely. They are light weight and lids can bin easy.", 
    "the red set is so gorgeous and elegant. love these pots. heated evenly when I am cooking and they are nonstick, take no effort in cleaning them, I can even leave them in my washing machine.", 
    "I bought the set for my mom. She loves it very much!. easy to clean and heated evenly. Strong and elegant!", 
    "This set was quite impressive. Great quality and a great price.", 
    "Thiale pots have a lot of manufacture defects in the material. I guess you get what you pay for.", 
    "Nice looking but the quality is one the low end. Pots & pans handles get much to hot for touch.", 
    "I am very pleased with the set. The items included in the set are excellent when you consider the price that was charged for them.", 
    "I would not order this set again. While it arrived in good shape, the pots are lightweight and do not do a good job of conducting heat. Cheap quality at a cheap price.", 
    "I wasn't pleased with the quality, and sent it back. It certainly could be used, but not any real value.", 
    "I have not actually used the product yet bc I just received it today, a month after ordering. I work, a lot. This item was shipped UPS. After the first time a note was left at my door for delivery attempt, I went to UPS.com to reschedule a delivery. Well the delivery missed me 2 more times (by not coming at requested time) and my package was returned. At that time I called UPS to complain and they reshipped the item, at no additional cost. I asked if my package could just be left at my door (as many are) and they required a signature. So after missing the first delivery attempt (the second time), I went online and opted to pick the package up to avoid the previous fiasco. Well the only place I could pick the package up was in a very VERY skechy area of town that was also some distance away from my place. So, I think it arrived in Vegas (for the 2nd time) a week ago but bc of my work schedule I could not make it to pick up today. Talk about the most inconvenient online purchase. ever. They better work well!",
