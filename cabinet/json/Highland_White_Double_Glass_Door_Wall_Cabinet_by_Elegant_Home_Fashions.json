    "We were very satisfied with the wall cabinet. It assembled very easily and looks great. It was also very easy to mount on the wall and feels very sturdy. The template was very helpful in locating it and marking the mounting holes. We noticed some scratches on one of the doors so I called Customer Service and they were very responsive. A new door was delivered very quickly. I would recommend this cabinet to anyone needing one in the bathroom. It looks great and Overstock was very helpful.", 
    "Well built. Easy to assemble. Holds a lot.", 
    "This is a lower priced item, that is pretty good for what you pay for it. I bought two of them, and mounted them one over another in my bathroom over the toilet. Works well for my needs and looks nicer than what I paid for it.", 
    "The cabinet was easy to put together; it only took about an hour. The only thing that I didn't like was it wasn't deep enough to put folded towels in, which is why I brought it. That's why I only gave it 3 stars.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Looks clean and updated, but definitely not a higher end look. Serves its purpose and good price.", 
    "Nicely made and sturdy. Arrived damage free.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Great cabinet for the money.", 
    "have not received product yet, will let you know", 
    "The glass on this cabinet has texture and adds a great look to my small bathroom and gives me the extra storage for cosmetics and medicine. It is well made; however, it took my contractor an hour to put it together. It is not something you just open the box and hang it. Not for the novice. But, it was worth paying someone to put it together.", 
    "shipped quick, arrived perfectly packaged. I put it together in about 30 minutes with a toddler crawling on me. I didn't use the enclosed anchors. I bought heavy duty ones to use because I'm paranoid and like I mentioned, have a crazy toddler that I just KNOW would find a way to pull it down. My husband actually double anchored it so it definitely won't be coming down. It looks great. I recently remodeled my bathroom and this shows off all my gorgeous new towels.", 
    "A simple cabinet, good quality and easy to install. Roomy shelves, a good buy!!!", 
    "We love the cabinet. Easy to put together and looks great. Used different screws to ensure everything will hold for the long term, we had tile on the wall.", 
    "The description of this product is misleading. It is not 8 inches in depth. The inside/interior of this cabinet is 6 1/8 deep. The top shelf is 8 inches."
