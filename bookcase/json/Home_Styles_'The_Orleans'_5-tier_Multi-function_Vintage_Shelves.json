    "I read the reviews and the tips from others who assembled these shelves. One I did not read will be a big help to putting these together quickly and easily. We assembled the side pieces to the top shelf, per instructions, adding each additional shelf in order. the closer we got to the bottom, the more difficult it became to fir in the shelves. Our suggestion is to assemble the bottom shelf after the top one, thereby relieving the tension, and spreading out the side pieces properly. Then assemble the rest of the shelves from the top down, and tighten all screws after assembly is complete. You will still find that the overhang varies on the shelves, but they're too beautiful to notice.My wood shelves came with some damage, so examine the shelves carefully before assembly, so nicks can be hidden. It was too much trouble to wait for replacements. There are levelers on the shelf units, and the first unit was perfectly level upon assembly, but we were never able to properly level the second. A felt pad on one leg helped. The shelving units are stunning against my teal study walls.", 
    "I have seen this book shelf for sale at other \"discount\" online retailers for hundreds more than I purchased it at Overstock. I put it together myself and it took about an hour. WIth two people it would have gone faster. It was not hard to assemble. I put the unit in my kitchen and use it for cook books and displaying enamel wear and baskets. The grey is antiqued and the wooden shelves are Vermont Maple if matched to Minwax online color chart http://www.allreclaimedwoodfurniture.com/wood-stain-color-minwax-water-based/ This shelf would fit in with industrial,country or classic decor. It feels sturdy and I think it looks expensive. My husband loves it and everyone who has seen it compliments it's looks.", 
    "I was quite disappointed with this bookshelf. I read so many reviews and was looking roward to this shelving unit. First, two of the shelves came damaged so I have to awkwardly place books over the scratches. I was also disappointed with the color of the shelves themselves. The color hints more towards golden that true rich brown. I compared the pictures to a separate piece of furniture I purchased on O.co and they looked almost identical in color, but in person they are least three shades off. I was also not happy with the color of the frame. It's silver, but the black overlay is very streaky and you can see the lines from the horrible paint job and doesn't look worn or antiqued. Overall I think this looks nice online and from a distance, but not from up close. It is sturdy and can hold many things and is a decent buy for the price.", 
    "These shelves are great. I received them within two days of ordering and they were easy to put together. They are sturdy, stylish, and of good quality. I highly recommend.", 
    "I love how these shelves look but after putting them together they are just overpriced junk from ........... Only 2 shelves lined up enough to have all 4 screws in and not all of the shelves had the screw inserts. There are no holes for the wood screws. As I was putting the shelves together I had to push against the frame to line up the screws to get them in. And after 3 days they still smell funny.", 
    "As the title says I'm On The Fence. Have ordered LOTS from O and have loved every purchase. Orleans shleving delivered tonight(early as usual which is great) but don't have time to assemble. But reviews were mixed about coloring so I opened smaller box to see color of metal cause I was worried about that most. Nice! But the color of shelving compared to website is way off! More of a cherry/red which was very disappointing and not like the darker wood tone displayed. Again' I've ordered lots and colors have always matched. Have never returned anything to O so Iand I'm nervous about opening rest. Great value and style is right so I'm considering redoing the shelves to get the right color. Stay tuned.", 
    "This shelf has a few quality control issues as in the shelves do not match well. But they do have metal supports underneath which is better than most. There are a few visible gaps in the welds and the screws for the top shelf are way to visible. But for price and function I recommend it.", 
    "Overall a good purchase. The shelves are study and attractive. The distance between each shelf is greater than I'd prefer (~17\"). The assembly wasn't too bad, better than most pre-fab sort of things.", 
    "Purchased this whole office on line,,not having time to shop for this type of furniture( caring for an invalid dad with dementia). Today i received it..my plan to take 1 piece at a time to assemble starting with the shelves. Upon opening the packages many parts were missing. I called the company that made it for service and no one answers that number I assume it's a bogus number having called many times with same results. I cannot take all of these big boxes inside my home..I called to return all of it as now i do not trust this company and the total inconvenience to my life that it has caused! Overstock will send ups to pick it all up...because I refused to open the rest of the boxes because the first 2 were missing so many parts. They are working to resolve this issue as they stand behind what they sell. Giant headache for me today.", 
    "This shelf unit was easy to assemble and is quite sturdy! I am glad I read the reviews re putting the stabilizer bars on before the shelves though. I can see how that could be a total problem once you have those shelves screwed in place.", 
    "My husband and I ordered two sets of shelves. Both were well packed and the order was complete. We put both shelves together in about 2 and a half hours. We found them rather easy to assemble. Some screws and holes didn't exactly match up, but with a little effort, each could be manipulated to get the job done. Just remember not to tighten everything until the whole shelf is put together. Once complete the shelves are better than we expected. The wooden shelves are a medium oak and the posts are a metal painted a grey color. Very sturdy and good looking for our purpose.", 
    "Overall it is a nice bookshelf, but the color of the metal and the wood is totally not what I was expecting. The metal is a brushed nickel/silver and the wood is definitely lighter/cherry-like. We'll make it work but I was a little disappointed.", 
    "We ordered four shelving units. One shelf out of 16 was not set correctly and we had to improvise. The holes for the screws did not line up to the soldered braces to the frame. Luckily we had wood screws and washers and were able to improvise. The shelves are heavy, sturdy, and look fantastic in our family room. We attached the shelves to the wall for extra stability. It took about 45 min to put one shelving unit together.", 
    "This bookshelf is a great deal. I, a middle-aged woman, easily assembled it myself and it is very sturdy, even now that it's fully loaded with books. I did need the loan of a drill to start the pilot holes when screwing in the shelves, but that was manageable. The style is elegant and fits perfectly with my Hemingway in Africa decor (well, okay, that's just what I'm aiming at). Much more attractive than the usual solid wood bookcases, without losing the \"solid\" feature.", 
    "I received the bookcase earlier than I was initially expecting which is always a nice bonus. It was packed well and arrived with no damage. The construction took about an hour and a half because not all of the holes lined up for the screws. Once it was together, I moved it to it's spot and began filling it. It's a very handsome piece and looks great. It adds a nice touch of a finished semi industrial look while being a solid attention getter as well. I've received many compliments on it. It's a good buy!", 
    "I bought this 5 shelf piece for my office. I needed a storage piece that would blend in with an eclectic mix of transitional, industrial, mid-century pieces. I am very happy with the look and quality of the shelves.", 
    "I bought two of these to use for displaying items in my husband's office. They were easy to assemble, though a couple of holes didn't line up perfectly, so I had to use my drill. The other pieces of furniture are of much higher quality, and I was concerned the shelves might not work, but they look very nice! Very happy with them.", 
    "i bought three of these shelves and my husband helped me put them together. all in all went really well, good quality and handsome to look at. each one of the the shelves had a hole drilled in the wrong spot so we could not put the screw in...but overall this did not detract from the stability or the looks...so i/m happy.", 
    "love these bookcases -- bought two and they transformed a wall beautifully", 
    "sturdy, assembaly was easy, but leveling was bit pain in the neck.", 
    "The shelves look perfect in my room, pretty easy to put together....however, I was hoping for a more vintage look with the wood. Still happy with the purchase!", 
    "Solidly built with a touch of old and modern. Highly recommend!", 
    "I was so disappointed with this bookcase. It is orange, not that \"caramel birch\" color in the description. I thought I had done my due diligence by identifying that the color in the picture was not the color of the actual item but I definitely could not have predicted orange. I am so glad overstock makes returns such a breeze. I have never returned anything through overstock, and when I started reading about the oversized item re-stocking fee I upset. I contacted a \"chat\" customer service rep and was so pleased. I will be getting a full refund. Love overstock!", 
    "Solid wood and very sturdy. Very happy with this purchase and recently bought the matching desk, hutch and drawers.", 
    "Easy to put together. Quite heavy, which is a good. They look great in our family room.", 
    "These are great shelves. There good looking and strong once put together. I'm using for a sports display in media room and we love them. They were easy to put together..,I did two in just under an hour.", 
    "Great steradian stylish design. Had to reorder two wood shelves because of wood grain was touched up and looked blotchy and not original to factory finish.", 
    "This is very durable, shelves are REAL wood (and come with supports if you are going to be putting heavy stuff to prevent eventual sagging). The description is accurate, I ordered 2 both came in in perfect condition and were not a problem to assemble (keep it mind it is LARGE and HEAVY). I use them for displaying retails in my high end spa. I get MANY compliments and would definitely recommend!", 
    "Easy to put together. We are using this for storage baskets in my daughters room and it works perfectly. Nice and sturdy!!", 
    "I'm giving it a 5 because it looks nice and it's sturdy. It wasn't too difficult to put together. The only con is I wish it had something on the sides like an \"x\" so it could hold the books in better.", 
    "Love my book case. Very easy to assemble and the depth and clearance on each shelf allow room for larger items.", 
    "I was looking for something affordable that had the industrial look. This shelving certainly fit the bill. It is heavy and sturdy and looks amazing with my decor.", 
    "These shelves look very good in my living room. The shelves are only about 3/4 inch thick and I was afraid they would not hold my mountain of books I have lying around. Well, they do. On the underside they have a reinforcement bar that you can attach to keep the shelves from bowing under the weight. My only problem is that they attach with screws and I found I needed to drill small guide holes to make screwing the screws in easier. On each shelf I have put three stacks of books, evenly distributed and weighing about 56 pounds total. I don't notice any bowing of the shelves. They can probably go up to 60 pounds. That's one question that I saw that Overstock was not able to answer.", 
    "Great quality.. Easily assembled", 
    "I put this together myself in about 40 minutes. Key to getting holes and screws to line up is to NOT tighten until the unit is assembled. I recommend a power drill to attach the supports to the shelves. This piece is so beautiful and really pulls together the two styles we have in our living room.", 
    "It took my husband about 45 minutes to put the shelf together. I had read tips from other reviewers, but making all the screws lined up still took a lot of effort; by the time my husband was done he was quite sweaty. The bottom of the feet can be adjusted so it doesn't wobble at all on our tile floor. Looks good! Will look to order other furniture from Overstock!", 
    "Easy to put together and looks much more expensive than it is! Using in kitchen for cookbooks and barware. Perfect with my SS appliances! Very sturdy. Highly recommend.", 
    "Very sturdy and durable. Looks great and as expected.", 
    "Bought this to add display area without bulk and this is beautiful! High quality finishes look more expensive then they were. Highly recommend!", 
    "It looks terrific and I put it together myself.", 
    "These shelves are really sturdy and better quality than expected. They are NOT easy to put together, but your hard work and muscle (you're going to need a lot of muscle!) will pay off. I ordered two because I believed I had finally found something with shelves large enough to display authentic football helmets in their display cases without having something custom built into my house. I'm very pleased to report that they fit! I can put two helmet cases (full regulation size) on each shelf, or a football and a helmet. It looks incredibly tasteful, and I'm quite particular about what I'll put in my home. I did originally receive a damaged part (the top shelf had a chunk of wood out of it), but reported it to Overstock customer service, and they were fantastic! Another very pleasant surprise. I highly recommend Overstock due to their outstanding customer service, and I recommend the product because it's heavy, sturdy, and tasteful, and I expect it to last a lifetime.", 
    "These have to be seen to be appreciated. and not hard to put together. great purchase and they look expensive", 
    "Pretty good quality. Required a bit of ingenuity and brute force to get the holes aligned for screws however not too many pieces and bolts and screws to install. Good quality materials...definitely doesn't look or feel cheap. Nice industrial chic aesthetic. Overall I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend it.", 
    "Beautiful piece of furniture! Arrived quickly, and was really simple to put together. I actually decided to distress the wood shelves myself, because the look as they arrived, was a little too \"new looking\", so I sanded the shelves and stained them in a walnut color, which turned out amazing! I love it!", 
    "We bought two of these for our living room. They are sturdy and heavy. They look perfect. However, if you use them as bookshelves you will need book ends as these have no sides for the books to lean on.", 
    "The shelves look good, but I was looking for a shelf of a specific width. The write up on this shelf said it was 16\" wide, which is what I wanted. What it doesn't say is that the shelf is only about 14\" wide with the poles making up the difference. My things hang off, which is annoying. Otherwise, the shelves are nice and of nice quality.", 
    "and can also be used in a decorative use in a modern room", 
    "These shelves are exactly as they appear in the pictures provided by the mfr. They are sturdy, nice looking and very versatile in their use. I bought 4 shelves and intend to use them in pairs in the living room and in the office. Vintage leather suitcases look great on them! They arrived quickly and were easy to assemble. Having help made it faster or course; it took about 20 minutes per shelf. I will say that they wobble a little bit and need the felt footies under one foot or another to keep them stable. Despite that simple fix, I highly recommend them.", 
    "Sturdy, well built. Easy to assemble. Neutral style goes with most decors.", 
    "These shelves are sturdy and look great. Assembly took a little work, but was worth it in the end. I think the shelves look expensive and high quality given the price. The product arrived in 2 boxes on 2 different days. For some reason they didn't arrive together.", 
    "After searching several websites and purchasing other units, finally a substantial unit with style, function and fair price. Would go with most decor. Love the look!", 
    "I love seeing this bookcase as soon as I walk into my kitchen\u0097it looks so great and it makes me feel like I've scored a stylish hit. The tones of the metal and wood are perfect. I have a mix of regular (but nice) dishes as well as vintage pottery. It looks modern but not too modern and it doesn't look cheap, even through the price is great.", 
    "Sturdy and attractive... Worked we'll for our office", 
    "Took longer than expected to put together by two people. Seemed to be poorly cut so that it was hard to line up the pieces for installation. But once complete, the piece looks just as I expected and fits in well with our decor. Very sturdy piece, hopefully lasts a long time.", 
    "We selected these shelves for a client, and after seeing them in person - I love them even more. They look very high end, and are great quality at a fantastic value.", 
    "I love these shelves. They are tall and heavy. Solid attractive shelves.", 
    "Hard to put together. Holes to attach supports under shelves not drilled. Other than that beautiful when finished. Great value and looks expensive.", 
    "This is a great value and quality exceeded my expectations. Easy to assemble but you do need a helper to assemble.", 
    "We love the shelving units! They are exactly what we were looking for>",
