    "These are really well made considering you have to put them together yourself. The only negative are the little covers that are supposed to go over the screws don't fit.", 
    "The color is what is advertised. It was pretty difficult to assemble, I had to get a second person to help. All of the shelves are now bowing down after only a few months. It is also leaning backwards towards the wall now. For the price I would say it is worth it.", 
    "I had ordered two shelves. One package was intact and they were easy to put together even by myself. However, the other package arrived with sides gouged out on the shelving, and not a shipment problem. Either these were damaged in packaging or someone returned them, but they are obviously not great quality being pressboard.", 
    "Quality is great! The Royal Cherry Bookcase looks elegant for a very reasonable piece of furniture.", 
    "Well made. Sturdy. Nice color.", 
    "The price was great, however I should have taken that into consideration when I ordered. You get what you pay for, and subpar quality is exactly what I got for a great price....", 
    "right size and its a solid piece. color is what I expected as well. All is well. The only thing I am not a big fan of is that fake cardboard wood backing. It looks fine as long as you don't scrutinize it too much, but overall i am quite happy with the piece.", 
    "The wood tones are great and the size is perfect. Looks great.", 
    "Bought 3 shelf bundle great deal good product for what I needed", 
    "I am impressed by this shelf. It's really sturdy and feels/looks like a high quality item. I can tell it will last a long time.", 
    "We bought the set of three varying sizes. They were easy to assemble if the direction are followed. Quality is OK for press board material.", 
    "Very cheap looking and poor quality.", 
    "This is a nice looking bookcase and it is easy to assemble, although the instructions are rather cryptic. It feels sturdy, too. I purchased three of them and am relatively happy with them. Free shipping is a plus. The \"but\" is because I found similar ones on ******* for $$ less each bookcase and also free shipping.", 
    "For the price this is a very nice bookcase. I've ordered another one as they fit perfectly in the area I have."
