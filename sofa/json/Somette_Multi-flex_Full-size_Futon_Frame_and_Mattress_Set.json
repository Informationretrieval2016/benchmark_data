    "Love this product! It was packaged well, the instructions were easy to follow, and I was able to set it up myself in less than 2 hours. It looks great, is comfortable and is easy to switch from a couch to a bed. The price was great and compared to others that I researched, it is a great value for the money. It exceeded my expectations! I would recommend this to everyone.", 
    "The product assembled fairly easily. The instructions and color codes were first rate! The mattress is a little firm but I think will adjust over time. It wants to slip out of the frame when upright. The futon opens and closes very easily, much more easily than other futons I've had. The wooden frame is very sturdy. I highly recommend this product!", 
    "My husband put it together in under an hour. It looks great and is very comfortable for sitting and sleeping.", 
    "the frame and futon came in three boxes and the directions were easy to follow. I put the frame together in about an hour. Looks great, and is very comfortable. I am very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend it.", 
    "Had been looking for the perfect futon and found it! Assembly took a few hours for my husband and I but it went together perfectly. No need to redrill holes as happened in past with different items. Wood frame is beautiful. Looks like expensive piece of furniture. Our first guest that used it commented that is was more comfortable than her bed at home!", 
    "My wife was able to do most of the assembly herself. I helped with some of the final heavier lifting. Our guests said the new futon was very comfortable to sleep on. It had a strong chemical odor at first, but that soon dissipated. We were glad the cushions were well packed in plastic, because UPS left it out in the rain instead of putting it under our front porch roof. The futon looks real nice in our newly finished office/guestroom.", 
    "Purchased for extra sleeping area and has been used several times already. Feedback is it is very comfortable. It also is easy enough to put together and easy to open and close. Very happy with quality and comfort.", 
    "Very happy with this purchase! Easy to put together, sturdy and the mattress is comfortable. Would purchase again!", 
    "The product is fine. Very fine. Receiving wrong sized hardware was not. Company responsive but situation wasted a lot of my time.Frame is a beautiful wood and futon with a topper is the best sleeping i have ever had! However i have to ask a neighbor in to make it a sofa! Very stiff and heavy.", 
    "Very comfortable mattress . The frame is a bit unwieldy, though, in opening and closing with the mattress on it. The mattress is heavy for the frame.", 
    "This is the most comfortable futon I have ever slept on and my guests consistently say the same. The mattress is sturdy and functions well in the seated upright position as well as a sleep surface. You won't run into that slouchy saggy effect you often encounter with futons being used as couches. Neutral color options make it great for all kinds of spaces and the wooden frame gives it a rich, sturdy look. The only drawbacks are complicated assembly and weight makes it less thanideal if you move a lot, or even rearrange furniture in your house often.", 
    "Usually I avoid futons. I am middle-aged and they are for kids - low to the ground and not very comfortable. I bought a trailer to live in and the door opening was very small so had to find a sofa that could be put together inside. I did a lot of research and chose this one. Very good futon. Super comfortable and well made with high quality wood. I highly recommend.", 
    "It took my husband and I approximately 2 hours to put this futon frame together. You definitely need two people to put it together. There are two sets of instructions; one for the legs and the other for the mattress frame. It can be a little tricky, I suggest you read through the instructions before you start. The futon slides down to create the bed and back up to create the couch. The conversion glides easily. The mattress is very comfortable. We purchased this for my son and he loves it.", 
    "This futon is beautiful, comfortable and well-made.", 
    "The is a great Futon, The mattress is very plush and comfortable for both sitting and sleeping. The frame is sturdy hardwood and the assembly isn't too difficult. Good quality for the price.", 
    "Love it. It is really comfortable and affordable.", 
    "Very Pleased!! Nice Futon and well made!! Recommend this one!!", 
    "The futon is attractive , sturdy and easy to use as couch/bed.It was a little daunting to assemble, but once assembled, terrific!", 
    "Love the wooden details. Took us a bit longer to put together and we are having trouble with going from flat to a seated position. Can be done with two people. Keeping it anyway.", 
    "The idea of getting a couch delivered in 3 boxes by UPS was a bit daunting but I took the plunge and am very happy with my purchase. It wasn't hard to assemble. As a couch I couldn't ask for more. Its not one of those silly couches where you have have three pillow behind you in order for your knees to reach the edge. It comfortable and good looking. Used it as a bed for the first time and I think its actually more comfortable than my real bed. Overstock's price was very good, the shipping was fast and I'm really happy with the quality and design.", 
    "Bought this for my daughter's apartment. She had to get a friend to help her assemble, but it is very sturdy, looks great and is comfortable to sit and sleep on. Great purchase.", 
    "This futon is doing really well in our rental units. The mattress is comfy and thick. Excellent units and fairly easy to put together. I recommend ditching the little allyn wrench and buy a driil attachment. Customer service has been very quick to respond to a couple of minor issue.", 
    "Great piece of furniture! Even better quality than I expected and the free shipping made it gold. Love and trust Overstock.com!", 
    "I've assembled plenty of furniture. But this futon...it was a beast. Took 3.5 hours to assemble and my husband nearly broke his foot when we tried to put the part the holds the cushion (the \"front and back decks\") into the frame with the arms. For some reason there were 2 sets of instructions for that step (one that came in the long box, one that came in the short box). One set said to \"Insert assembled seat & back deck into arms.\" We tried that first, thus the nearly broken foot. The OTHER set of instructions said to put the back deck in first, then the seat deck, then attach the two. DO THIS. So much easier and safer. I have no idea why they'd ever suggest the other way.As for the fully assembled futon...eh. It's not as nice looking as in the photo. The olive cushion is much lighter and looks a little washed out. Also, the cushion is kind of frumpy looking, not as sleek as it looks online. The only good thing (and the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1) Is that the cushion is springy and firm inside and feels like it would be comfortable for guests to sleep on, unlike some futons.If I had it to do again, I would NOT buy this product.", 
    "The futon was easy to assemble. I had my 10 yr old daughter help. Everything went together with little need to disassemble and reassemble even though the directions left a lot to be desired. The futon is comfortable but you will want to get some gripper pads to put between the frame and mattress. If not you will constantly be repositioning your mattress. If I could change two things I would have make the legs out of sturdier 3x3 lumber and the mattress would have a colored cover rather than a colored upholstered mattress.", 
    "Makes a nice looking fairly comfortable couch, and makes an even nicer bed. So comfortable to sleep on. Everyone loves it.", 
    "Arrived well packaged, with good instructions. Assembly required minimal tools and was done in an hour by Grandpa.This is very sturdy and well made. A wonderful addition to this playroom as the grandchildren can't wait to spend the night on their new \"magic bed\".", 
    "The only reason I didn't give this Futon 5 stars is because a couple of pieces were miss labeled and they shipped 20 wooden dowels with it and only used four in the assembly leaving me to second guess myself as to what they were for. Also, the mattress package shows a clear black line with instructions to \"open here\" but when you do, the mattress ends up upside down anyway and has to be turned over. The instructions though were pretty clear and easy to follow and the quality of this product is really good. It unfolds out and back up very easily due to the special hinge mattress it came with. It's very comfortable to both sit and lay on.", 
    "This futon is made of quality materials and very heavy. I ordered the olive color mattress and the color is true. The fabric feels like moleskin. My only complaint has nothing to do with the futon itself so it deserves 5 stars. It is that the assembly instructions are so bad that my husband, who can put together anything, spent several hours putting it together with many exclamations of frustration! My son laid down on the mattress and pronounced it comfortable, so I'm very pleased and would recommend this futon.", 
    "First but not last item prefer with overstock. Amazing quality and great price", 
    "Outstanding futon made of the finest quality materials.", 
    "Easy to put together. Comfortable mattress. Sturdy frame. A good value.", 
    "ordered this for the sitting room off of our bedroom, when our grandsons sleep over they like to sleep in there because they get scared (lol) it was very easy to assemble and the quality is excellent...would definitely recommend.", 
    "Very pleased with the futon. Assembly was not complicated. Bought it for my college age son. He loved it. Comfortable and well made.", 
    "The futon was great until the bottom part of the frame cracked in half after a couple of years. The bottom piece of the frame cracks right in half because its constructed in two pieces that are bound inappropriately together with weak construction. If it was made with one solid piece this wouldn't happen. I'm a 115 pound single women and I have two adult (thin framed) sons who come to visit. One of my sons was laying on the futon watching television when the back half of the bottom piece split in half where its fused together.", 
    "Solid and comfortable piece of furniture for the price--it's been used as a guestroom bed a number of times. Only drawback is you really need two people to bring it up and down, but not really a big issue. Feels very solid and not cheap in construction.", 
    "I rated this item 4 stars only because the directions were so poor. If you are handy at this kind of project, you can get enough of a general idea to get it together, I only had to redo a few sections twice. I spent about 2 hrs. putting it together. The futon however, is great. It looks good, is solid when put together correctly, and is extremely comfortable. Well worth the price, and is a nice piece of furniture.", 
    "The frame is very sturdy, and the mattress is fantastic. I did have one problem that I'm not sure how to go about fixing yet, but I'll think of something.The mattress is thick and dense. It's vacuum sealed for delivery, so I left it on the floor in another room to decompress while I assembled the frame. The problem I ran in to was after putting the mattress on the frame. It's very difficult to move the frame from the sleeper position to the upright position due to the density and firmness of the mattress, and there doesn't seem to be a mechanism to lock the frame in place once it is upright. So, when I let it go, the mattress pushed the frame back in to the sleeper position.It shouldn't be too hard for me to fabricate a locking mechanism for it. I left off a star for only this reason. Aside from that, it's an excellent quality piece of furniture.", 
    "This futon is very well made, seems quite heavy duty. Mattress is quite thick and comfortable and the cover is a nice fabric. Assembly wasn't too bad, took my husband and I about an hour. The wood color is a little lighter than the picture but still nice overall.", 
    "This product is definitely made to last and is not light-weight. The one thing that kept me from giving 5 starts is installation. I'm pretty good with installation and thinking through things...took me over an hour, as it's just not well documented. Heavy product, made to last", 
    "We had our son sleep on this for several days over Christmas. He loved it. Very nice addition to our office/guest room", 
    "very comfortable to sleep on", 
    "No instruction manual very difficult to put together and must have 2 people.", 
    "Futons are always less comfortable than regular sofas/couches, but for a guesthouse this works fine. Assembly was as expected, need two people to put together. The fabric on the cushion is nice. Just hope it wears well. The cushion doesn't line up well, but maybe I just need to make some adjustments.", 
    "Delivery was quick and easy. Set up by my daughter at school with no problems. Took about 1 hour to set up. She reports it looks and feels great.", 
    "very comfortable and sturdy", 
    "I am happy I bought this. I put it together myself in about two hours and it sits well, unfolds into a bed well and is comfortable (I'm told.) I like it as a couch and love having the extra bed for guests. Great price for a good product.", 
    "Love this Futon and so do our guest. The mattress is probably more comfortable than a regular bed mattess.", 
    "When you think futon you think college type apartment but this one goes well in my house. The wood finish and tan mattress look great. Not too difficult to assemble", 
    "looks like I paid more for it than I did. And comfortable to sleep on too.", 
    "Relatively easy to assemble, the mattress is kind of hard, it's ok for the money. Nothing fancy about it.", 
    "Junk. Stay away from this!", 
    "Perfect for what we were looking for ... Comfy not too bad to put together", 
    "Good quality. Built in about 1.5 hours.", 
    "I'm not sure why other reviews said that there were 2 sets of instructions. We only received 1 set of instructions. It took 1 1/2 hours to put together. Really very easy. The mattress is so comfortable for both a sofa and bed. We've had it for a month now and I love it. Would definitely buy again.", 
    "very comfortable and easy to assemble. Instructions 95% complete on the how-to side.", 
    "It took well over two hours to put this futon together. It is huge and cumbersome. Not comfortable at all. I hate it, but after spending all that time assembling it and cutting open the boxes and throwing them away... well, returning it would be impossible. If you want a futon, go to the furniture store. Don't buy online.", 
    "Delivered on time UPS carried it in the house About a Hour to put together sleep on it for 3 nights very cozy more then I expected saved around $$$ bucks who would not be happy and the brand is the same as local at $$$ bucks", 
    "I bought this futon for my guest room. It is quite comfortable as a full size mattress and the wood is a very nice sturdy product. My only warning is A: do not attempt to assemble if you are tired, some of the directions were more confusing than necessary. B: once in the bed position, I have been unable to put it back into couch position without assistance. Overall great product at fair price, very happy indeed.", 
    "bought this to go into my studio and we had a hard time getting it to stay up as a couch it kept wanting to slide open to the bed. But the longer we have it propped up the better it is staying up. Very comfortable to sit on and sleep on.", 
    "Would be excellent if one person could fold it open. Comfortable, good looking, and extra seating/sleeping in my sewing room. I love the look and feel. Easily assembled and a good bargain for the quality.", 
    "This item works very well. It was tedious to assemble, as the illustrations were not as clear as they should have been for the sequence of the parts assembly. Not that a big a deal, but I did have to take it back apart halfway to correct it. After that, all went well.My wife really likes the way it sleeps. I can be a pretty noisy snorer at times, and with this futon she just grabs her comforter and heads into the other room for a restful night's sleep. It's usually kept flat for sleeping use, but the couple times we've used it as a sofa it's been very comfortable.Overall, we are very pleased with this. If someone was considering purchasing one, I would recommend doing so. And the darker wood color is very nice also.", 
    "very attractive and comfortable futon. The only drawback was it was a bit of a challenge to assemble. Defiantly a two person job.", 
    "It was a little difficult for my husband and me to put it together because parts were mismarked and we are not mechanically inclined. It had a fairly deep scratch on the arm. It also had 2 sets of directions with differing instructions. I think either would have worked. That being said it is nice-looking, very comfortable, and was just what we wanted to an extra bed and television couch", 
    "This piece is really well made and sturdy and the mattress is a nice thickness and VERY comfortable. It sits nicely when folded for the sofa position and fills in perfectly when opened into a bed. I would highly recommend. Definitely needs two people to assemble - especially after a point.", 
    "It's an excellent product . It got look and style especially the wood gives immense look to the area. Great comfort. My kids love it. We are so happy with the product.I definetly recommend it for others. If you are looking to buy a futon in wood just go for it. Am sure you will love it .", 
    "I placed this very sturdy futon under windows and a skylight. The cushion is just the right firmness and very comfortable. The color is a dull green that is a great neutral that blens well with the warm earth tones of this room. Happy and surprised at the quality. worth every penny", 
    "Perfect for the room we wanted it in and very functional. Is exactly the way we expected it to be. Love it.", 
    "I was very pleased of teh quality of this product ,the arrival time and teh help your support team had given me Thank you all would recomment this fine product to family and friends.", 
    "The futon had very clear instructions and was relatively simple to put together. It's comfortable and looks great.", 
    "I would go to WAL MART get the same thing for $***for real same thing.thanks me!"
