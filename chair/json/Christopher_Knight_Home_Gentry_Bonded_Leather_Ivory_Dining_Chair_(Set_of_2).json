    "I learned a lot about seat height with this purchase. I had to send the chairs back and O.com was very nice about waiving return shipping when I told them the reason. I had assumed that table heights and chair seat heights were standard. Well, they sort of are, but not completely. Standard table heights go from 28 to 30\" while standard chair seat heights go from 18-20\". So you would want an 18\" chair seat height with a 28\" table height and a 20\" chair seat height with a 30\" table height. Well these beautiful reasonable chairs were just what I wanted, but you guessed it, my table is 30\" high and the chair seat was 18\" high -- way too low. I found this out by googling on the internet -- not having known this before. I would definitely have kept the chairs if they had had a higher chair seat. height.", 
    "These chairs came today and they are gorgeous,soft as butter leather,very high quality.I have to send them back though .BEWARE they are not white..they are off white/cream!! If you are looking for off white. They are really really nice and a great buy. I did sit in one before it went back into the box...very comfortable.", 
    "The chairs are perfect for my use. I read the reviews that said the chairs were kiddie-sized. I'm not sure what they are used to, but I measured my existing Parsons chairs (obtained from Pottery Barn) before I ordered these, and they were similar in seat height and 2-3 inches shorter in back height, which was fine. My husband is 6'2\" and I am 5' 8\" so we are not short people, and these are fine for size. However, we are average weight and if people were very heavy, these might not be the chairs for them, width-wise. I think the chairs are beautiful and go perfectly with our glass dining table. The legs are darker than I expected--they look black and I thought expresso would be a dark brown. Just be aware. This is the 4th item I have purchased from Overstock and have never been disappointed in what I have ordered--reading the reviews really is helpful.", 
    "We needed new chairs for our mid-century/eclectic dining room and these chairs are the perfect addition. The chairs were carefully packed and fully assembled upon delivery. The color, size, and quality are consistent with the Overstock description and many of the customer reviews. We took a big chance by ordering all six chairs at once, but are so pleased that we did.", 
    "These chairs are a great addition to my condo's dining room. They have a nice clean look and the tufted back is subtle enough to read \"hip and glam\" not \"eye-talian resturant\". The are comfortable and seem solidly constructed, plus they arrived very securly packed against any damage. Unlike some others, I don't find them to be small as they are the right scale for a modern or mid-century look. If you have large furniture pieces, they may get overwhelmed.. Seriously considering adding two more and it's been about five minutes.", 
    "I had high hopes because of all the great reviews I read, and I was not disappointed! They were packaged very well, easy to unpack and fully assembled. That was a huge plus! The color is great and goes well with our very dark table, in fact the legs of the chairs seem to match. We have a table from Ikea that is meant to seat 10-12, and comfortably fit 10 of these chairs at the table. Overall a great purchase and can't beat the price!", 
    "I had 6 of these chairs for about 3 years, temporary place holders until I could upgrade to better quality chairs. They arrived quickly, were packed well. They did their job as daily dining chairs. They were fine, comfort wise, but they felt cheap. They cleaned up easily, as long as you caught things like spills and indigo dye from jeans quickly. But they did start to get a little dingy around the 2 1/2 year mark. They are a little shorter and the backs are a little narrower than a standard size parsons chair, so store-bought parson chair covers are too big for them without alteration. The chairs are very lightweight (not bad if you have hardwoods that scratch) and they started to get little creaks after a few months. Some of the legs were a little off from each other and needed felt pads to stabilize them. Inside the seat cushions is just foam, which held up for the 3 years we had them, but then no one in our family is over 175lbs. When heavier visitors sat in them, I noticed they sank down a further than usual, so I don't think they'd hold up as long as a daily chair in a family with heavier people. We definitely got our money's worth, but I wouldn't buy them again if I could afford better. They'd make great staging furniture for a mid-range home sale.", 
    "I purchased 2 sets (4 total). I was worried about the quality & \"cheapness factor\" based on other reviews but happy to say the other reviews were wrong. These chairs appear extremely high end. They are made very well- solid! Color is defitely a pearly cream, not exactly bright white. As others stated, they were slightly lower to the ground and a bit more narrow than expected but they are perfect for the sides of a long table. I love them so much i will be cutting down my table legs a few inches to accommodate the chairs! They shipped quickly and were packaged with plenty of padding, bubble wrap & encased in individual covers. Even the dog who terrorizes anything delivered from a box truck didn't managed to leave a scratch! If you are considering a pair (or more), do not hesitate! They are worth every penny. Extremely happy with my purchase.", 
    "These chairs were exactly what I was looking for to go with our antique oak dining room table. I wanted an eclectic look for my room, and something more comfortable to encourage guests to sit and linger with coffee after dinner . These arrived fully assembled and so carefully wrapped and packaged, I thought maybe I had ordered from a much pricier store! In perfect condition, the perfect size (not sure why other reviewers think they are small) and so comfortable! I bought 6 and wish that I had purchased 2 more.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful and exactly as pictures. They are ivory and have a slight pearlescent finish. The chair legs are very dark and look almost black. All in all, they feel very sturdy and being fully assembled is a big plus. Good job Overstock and Christopher Knight!", 
    "I ordered these chairs (2 sets) after looking around town for something light in color that would look classy and not cost an arm and a leg. I am so glad I did. These chairs are light, soft and just perfect for a small space. They are very comfortable, and even have some lower back support. They are creamy, not yellowish at all, and look even better than the picture. They arrived fully assembled. I just had to wipe them down with a damp cloth and they were just perfect. Thank you, Overstock. You never let me down when it comes to furniture!", 
    "these chairs seem too small next to our table the sit low and narrow and the back of the seat it low as welll.", 
    "These chairs are good quality chairs for my dining roomNot as sturdy as I would like. One arrived with the leg broken. Overstock was great and sent a replacement right away. Overall they look quite good and are comfortable.", 
    "I just got this chairs and set them up in my kitchen area. They look beautiful but when you sit on them, you can touch the floor. The sits are so low in height that it will not go with regular size dinning table. My husband is keep saying that this chairs are for kids. I will not return them though because how pretty they look and I don't care if he can't sit on them like regular chair. Anyway my advise is that, don't get them for your formal dinning room, they only go in a small table in the kitchen area.", 
    "These chairs are surprisingly very good quality and sturdy. The only downfall is they are short/small. They kind of look miniature. I definitely wouldn't pair it with a grand table. But other than the size they are great.", 
    "I had read another review that mentioned the height, so I knew when I ordered that the chairs would sit lower than the ones I replaced, but the color and style are what I was looking for. Height takes some getting used to, but is ok. Someone's comment said the color was more of a cream which I was also hoping for, but they are actually an off white. They could use a bit more stuffing in the seat area, but overall, I am satisfied.", 
    "They looked like chairs for children, they are not of the highest quality, and before you purchase make sure you know if you have a 28\" high table or 30\" high table as these chairs will not work for a 30\" table at all!!! I am 5'2 and husband 6' and it did not work for either one of us on any level plus poor quality!!! Don't understand all the good reviews. The only good thing about the chairs was no assembly required.", 
    "I ordered 2 of these chairs over 2 years ago, and wanted to get 2 more. When I saw they had been discounted, I ordered two more. They are study, comfortable and look great with my pedestal, glass top table. I gave 4 stars because they are on the small side - just they were a little larger. They are, however, a great buy.", 
    "I purchased 4 of these chairs for my breakfast nook based on the great reviews. Unfortunately, they did not meet up to the hype. I should have listened to the comments about the size of these chairs, but I overlooked them because I really liked the color scheme. Well they were absolutely right! The chairs are way too small!! Somehow the chairs look out of proportion - as if someone cut good 4-5 inches off of the legs. They really look like kids' furniture. In fact, one fit my 10 year old's desk perfectly. They may look nice, but be warned, the chairs are very, very, small.", 
    "Beautiful off white chairs. The construction is very good and the come assembled already. Exactly what I was looking for my dining room.", 
    "I had read that these chairs were on the small side but I thought they would work because our dining room is small. Unfortunately,they didn't match the scale of our table so I had to send them back (luckily, I only ordered one set to see how they would look). FYI, if you have to send them back it will cost you around $**. Other than the size, these are very attractive chairs and look to be made well. These chairs would be great with a small table or in a breakfast nook.", 
    "nice addition to my living dining room. these chairs are plain and rich looking. the color will go with any table setting. they aren't real big chairs so will easily work with a smaller table.", 
    "Love these chairs. They are a little smaller scale then you might think. We have a very large oblong wood table and we have 3 chairs on one side. At first I wasn't sure because they do look a little smaller than I thought, but when you sit down you feel very comfortable and are at the perfect height. It brings a beautiful elegance to our dining room. We have a wood bench on one side and the 3 chairs on the other. We have the extra chair in the room if we decide to put it at the head of the table. We love how made everything elegant, but easy to wipe down after our 4 year old eats on it.", 
    "The chairs are perfect for a dinnette set. I wouldn't recommend them for a dining room table. They would be too small in scale. The leather and design are a good quality. I purchased 4 and they fit perfectly around my 42' round dinette table.", 
    "These are really nice chairs that work great around a small table. The only complaint we had was with delivery. The boxes they came in looked like they had been hit by a train. We ordered 4. One had a broken leg and and another had scratches all over the wood legs. We called Overstock and they sent us 2 new chairs and said to expect a UPS guy to come pick up the defected chairs. We packaged them back up and kept them in our foyer waiting for the UPS guy to come get them. We called Overstock and they said if they didnt come by x date then we could dispose of the items. They never came so we threw away the broken chair and kept the other (even though it has scratched legs) in case we have more ppl. So the process was really annoying but the chairs are nice.", 
    "The chairs were delivered promptly and were as expected.", 
    "I got them six months ago. i love them very comfy and sturdy", 
    "I needed gorgeous classy seating for a huge dining room table. These chairs would have fit the bill, except that the dessicant packets broke open and the little balls left round indents in the chairs. I did not have enough time (holidays!) to have them replaced by Overstock, so had to choose a local option. Kudos to Overstock's outstanding customer service for a quick return of the defective chairs. If I had a longer turn around time, these would have been really great for the $$$. The earlier review about chair sizing was excellent information... I was buying chairs for a vintage table, so the measurements were perfect.", 
    "Looked great but sat too low for the dining room table.", 
    "I purchased a total of 6 chairs. One of them broke in the first month. The leg just completely broke from a simple slide forward while someone was sitting on it. The other chairs have held up over the last year but I always worry that they are weak. We don't use the chairs everyday - (they are in our formal dining room) When company comes I get nervous that a chair will brake on them...", 
    "These chairs are very nice, easy to care for. Putting them together was very easy. I love them and would recommend them.", 
    "Very comfortable. Shipping & packaging was excellent! They went perfect in my dining room.", 
    "I had high hopes for the set but ended up returning it. There is a sheen to the finish that it doesn't look high quality at all. The price is really affordable to think about it, though. I just thought it would be a great bargain really all those glowing reviews.", 
    "We have 2 little boys and a dog; a very active and sometimes messy household. We bought one set of these chairs back in 2011, as we have a colonial table set and the other chairs are a bit big for our small living space. We liked them so much that we ordered 2 more sets to replace the bulky colonial chairs we had. I was relieved they were still available on Overstock! They are comfortable and sturdy.", 
    "I've had them for about 2 years and there are as sturdy as when I First bought them. My husband is 6'9\", and 220 pounds so they need to be strong. I wanted leather at the dinning table for spiels, so it wouldn't get stained like cloth, no stains, no scratches, even with animals and kids. There Classy enough when you have a dinner party they dont look out of place, but also simple that they look fine for every day use.", 
    "too short - sent them back", 
    "petite chairs, light weight.", 
    "Look very nice but these are lower than standard height and too low to use as dining chairs. They are also uncomfortable, you can feel the frame when you sit on the chair. I didn't send them back but I use them as chairs in my store for decoration or short term seating.", 
    "Great set of chairs, wonderful price, well made", 
    "Cushion too thin, very disappointed!", 
    "I absolutely love these chairs! I get compliments on them every time someone comes into my home. Look very expensive. Also, no installation required!", 
    "Quick delivery, no damages and color as promised. Very nice value for the price. They are shorter than I'd hoped for - check your height dimension preferences before ordering. Also, some chairs sink in more than others. We'll see over time what that is like.", 
    "Good looking, modern chairs. Quality is OK and I think will last as long as they're not used often. Good deal for the look. Not too thrilled with the quality..", 
    "I own 6 of these chairs (4 bought in 2013 and 2 bought in August 2015). The look and construction of the chairs are great, and I would buy them again, as they pop wonderfully against my gray walls and support our everyday needs. They arrived fully assembled, too, which is convenient. That being said, I'm taking a star away because the product's label confirms it contains flame retardants, and that's just not necessary any more (see California's TB-117-2013). Also, one chair bought in August had a thread pulled/coming out upon opening the box, but I didn't want to deal with a return/exchange.For the kid test - I love how easy these chairs are to wipe down, however, we've kept a booster seat strapped into one for 2 years and it has left probably permanent indentations in the leather. Also, they are not immune to toddlers trying to bite the leather. These issues are not a slight on the chairs, just an FYI for those with kids.", 
    "I returned the chairs as they were too small for my dining room table.", 
    "These chairs are great for dining.", 
    "We're not really happy with our purchased of these chairs. Apparently the height of the seat is lower than any regular dining chair, therefore it's weird when you sitting on it and you'll feel you're small? as the dining table seems higher, and that's awkward.", 
    "The inside of my great room; dining room and living room, is this much more look luxurious looking because of these tufted, faux leather chairs!! The material looks realistic enough to be leather, despite being a vinyl. It wipes all stains very easily, is very resistant to food and wine and dirt, and has upheld itself in quality for over a year now. I have removed dirt simply with soap and warm water, and had several parties where nail Polish remover mixed with water has helped remove more permanent pen stains or clothes/shoe stains from the faux leather. It is childproof! This purchase was well worth the money, and easily made my pine table look more expensive. I get several compliments monthly. They are good for sitting and eating, perfect height for a standard table, dark legs, good material, free shipping--so I ordered two more to put at a side pedestal table in my living room! After a while of sitting, my bum hurts, but that's expected with most chairs. Simple classy elegance for a good price and durable quality. I highly recommend.", 
    "I really like the chairs, color is as shown ivory white. Love that it came assembled.The only reason i am giving it 4 stars is coz its a little short (back rest).", 
    "Good chairs. Perfect size. Not meant for really tall people due to smaller design. Creme colour not white. Good finishings. Good customer service since one came broken and they replaced it really fast without inconvenience. I recommend these chairs.", 
    "will see if it lasts its bonded and I hope I am not sorry I ordered this product. looks good but i'm skeptical", 
    "I have purchased several of these. I keep them covered with chair covers to protect the white leather since I have a small child at home. But they are definitely a good quality chair for the price.", 
    "The seat height on these chairs is only 17 inches.", 
    "We have a round white table used for playing cards and doing puzzles. We wanted comfortable chairs that did not take up too much space. These were a perfect complement to the table and space.", 
    "Son muy bonita , elegante.son un poco peque\u00f1a.", 
    "They are just as they look in the photo. I like them a lot even though they are a little on the small side. Several arrived damaged so I had to return and have new one sent. Overstock handled the situation quite well! Happy customer. Thanks!", 
    "Bad quality. The legs broke after a week, while my husband was sitting in it. It look really cheap. I didn't want to risk anyone else getting hurt, so I threw them away.", 
    "The size of the chairs was not acceptable. It was more fitting for a child than an adult. Quality was good, but should be advertised as children's furniture.", 
    "I canceled this order before it arrived.", 
    "These chairs came in beautiful, already put together and ready to go. They were shipped properly and we absolutely loved them. I had a baby shower and someone split some soda on it and it wiped right off. Great Buy.", 
    "These chair look great and are very sturdy. We are very happy with the purchase", 
    "I should have measured my table better, as I just assumed that I could \"tuck in\" 6 chairs around my 72\" long table. As it turns out, the table legs are not at the corners, and these chairs, which are a little bit narrow, fir perfectly. Construction seems sound so far, they came packed well and needing no assembly. I like the color too, ALMOST white.", 
    "They look very nice in my cottage. They are a bit low for a higher table as it said in past reviews, but they will work.", 
    "And beautiful, and just the right size!", 
    "These chairs are more off white than pure white, but they look great. I've paired them with an IKEA dining table in black/brown and these chairs are the perfect height and the legs match the table. They really elevate the look of the cheaper table and are still comfy after being used every day for over a year.", 
    "These chairs are tiny and not very sturdy.", 
    "I had read the reviews and was first afraid to order after reading some of the negative comments. I am so glad I went with my gut feeling and ordered a pair. They are beautiful and not at all cheap looking or puckered or any of the other bad comments. The chairs are beautiful, classy and comfortable and just the right size for my table! I am extremely happy with my purchase and going to order another pair today. I would recommend these chairs", 
    "exactly as shown. Love the chairs so much!!!", 
    "I was skeptical about the size and quality of these chairs after reading some of the reviews. However, after ordering and receiving them earlier this month, I must say I am extremely impressed by their quality, comfort and overall appearance. They are ivory rather than white, like the Christopher Knight ivory leather bar stools I also ordered (which match perfectly). While the seat height on seems closer to 17 inches (a little low) these chairs add an elegance and simplicity to our modern dining room that I love. The chairs are well made and sturdy. If you have priced similar dining room chairs online or in stores, these chairs are truly a bargain for the level of quality you obtain. I would highly recommend these chairs and have already received numerous compliments from guests! Thanks Overstock!", 
    "Got these chairs today. Packaged wonderful. Professional delivery. They are good quality. Bright color and very posh looking. I purchased 6 and will by 2 additional dining chairs w a higher back for a little variation. It looks a maxing w my multi colored butcher block table. I love overstock.", 
    "Nice quality very happy with my purchase", 
    "We ordered 60 and they're great... a little low, but still great...", 
    "This is a good looking and reasonably comfortable chair. As always, shipping speed was quick, and packaging excellent.", 
    "I bought these 2 chairs to add to my dining room set. Very pretty, nice style, comfortable, decent quality and small enough to fit without a bulky look.", 
    "Great bargain & quality. Looks like chairs from stores for half the price", 
    "These chairs are great! Very stylish. They are a bit narrow but sit comfortably! I love them!! Color is true ivory. I bought another set!", 
    "I like them, but they do look a little cheaper than how they look online. I would still purchase them again b/c they're nice chairs and go grat with our new furnishings.", 
    "Great product for the price. Stylish design. Arrived quickly, well packed and no assemble was required.", 
    "The quality of the product was not what I hoped for. They were much cheaper looking in person and the color was way darker. If you are hoping for a creamy color chair do not buy these. They are more of a DARK ivory with green undertones. The seams look like they would eventually fall apart. I choose this chair because it was bonded leather instead of vinyl but it looks like I should have gone with my gut and ordered a different chair. I am returning these. They don't even match any of our current furniture that is off white/ ivory. They are at least 3-4 shades darker.", 
    "Ordered 4 of these to go under 42\" wide, 30\" tall, black pedestal table in smaller dining room. They came fully assembled and nicely packaged, quick delivery. Beautiful off-white color, black legs. The chairs feel sturdy and comfortable. They are a bit on the petite side, but i am 5'7\" and fit nicely. A taller chair would give less \"thigh\" room under the table anyway. Excellent quality and design for this price point. Very pleased!", 
    "I was a little scared to order online but the product and easy has changed my mind. Ordering was simple and the product was delivered when you said it would. I am quite satisfied.", 
    "LOVE these chairs. Clean. Modern yet traditional styling. Leather is good. Chairs may break down easily if you use them all the time.", 
    "We've had these chairs for about a year and a half now, and I love them! I have four small kids, and so these see a lot of use.. I love that you can just wipe them with a damp cloth. Even my kids can do it. They are a very well-proportioned chair- not too big or too small, and very clean lined. I think my favorite thing about them is how comfortable they are. My one complaint- Some of the stitching at the seams where the seat meets the backs have come loose (maybe someone stood up on them, putting too much pressure at that point?), but I think for general use, they hold up great.", 
    "These chairs are idea for a small scaled dining room. We find them very comfortable, and appreciated the fact that they came well packaged and assembled. May buy 4 more for our vacation home!", 
    "I really lover the feel of the leather on these chairs. Their well made and comfortable to sit in. I'm very impressed with the quality of the chairs at such a resonal price.", 
    "They look good with my small condo breakfast table. My round glass top is 29.5 inches high. Works ok. Agree with the previous reviews. Small, but elegant. One of the chairs had plastic circles on the legs worn out. must have been somebody's return. They scratched my new laminate floors. After that I hammered felt pads on them. Should have done that right away.", 
    "Very disappointed with the appearance, and size of these chairs. Placed under table next to existing and they look like minature chairs that disappear with the others", 
    "These chairs are gorgeous. The color is ivory, not whitey white, which is what I love. The only down side is the chair is about 1 inch too short. I wish the legs had one more inch. But I'm keeping them and maybe adding casters or cutting down my table a little.", 
    "The chairs are very stylish and comfortable. I am very happy with the great price!", 
    "very nice chairs. Using in a rental and they are sturdy. very pretty as well.", 
    "The color was a little more ivory than the picture shoes. But it was okay. And they were a tad bit shorter than I expected, but again it was okay. Overall I am super happy with these chairs. They look very elegant and complete the look of my dining room.", 
    "These are awesome chairs, and they were reasonably priced. only issue I have is they are not so comfortable for sitting on for more then an hour.... but I guess you are not suppose to sit on them for long... :)", 
    "Love them the color is the same as the bar stools off white or cream is the actual color, over all they are a great buy!", 
    "Listen to reviews so you know what to expect! Chairs are NOT white--they are cream. They are definitely smaller than most dining chairs--shorter and the seat is tinier. I wouldn't have ordered based on the product description in the listing but I'm very glad I read the reviews because the chairs ended up being exactly what I wanted. Good overall quality and fast shipping in one large but lightweight box. LOVE that I didn't have to assemble the chairs. Always feel like I'm getting a better quality product when items come already assembled.", 
    "These were exactly what we wanted, a little off white not bright white, comfortable. There was a small scratch on one of the chairs and they replaced it no problem, very happy", 
    "These chairs look great, pretty sturdy, and a great price", 
    "I got these chairs on the mail today and I'm very happy with my purchase. They are not white, which I already knew from the reviews but since I needed an off white/ cream they are perfect for me. I read a lot of reviews complaining about the height so I decided to measure and they are 17.5 and when you seat it sinks maybe to 17.2 as opposed to the 18 inches they say, but for me it doesn't' matter. The chairs are not very heavy, maybe 10lbs each but not cheap light. they seem sturdy. The color of the legs is a black brown color. I was amazed how fast they delivered!", 
    "OK first of all... fast delivery. Second... I did not have to put legs on or anything, they came completed. Third WOW I did not expect to love them. They are supple and pretty and neat looking and comfortable. The price (I compared for months) is unbeatable especially for the quality. I am impressed. My lil kitchen area looks so modern and welcoming. I added a new small glass top table to complete the look and I love having my friends over for coffee in the a.m.. and they love my chairs too. I was weary about the color (ivory) but boy does it look sharp. If you order them too... you will know what I mean.", 
    "I am 100% satisfied and extremely happy with these chairs, which arrived just two days after I placed the order. They are very pretty and elegant in my opinion. Although some reviews imply that they are sized for a kindergarten, I think they are just fine for my small dining room space (7' x 10'), and any average sized people should do just fine. I am also extremely pleased with Overstock customer service. Before I bought the chairs, I spoke to someone who answered all of my questions, and even explained in detail what bonded leather is. One of the chairs came with a blue ink mark, like from a pen. They gave me three options to rectify the situation, all which would have been more than satisfactory. They couldn't have been more polite, friendly, resourceful, and helpful. I elected to keep the chair since the spot is so small, and they gave me a generous refund of more than half the cost of the chair. Also, I like that I have not had to wait more than a few seconds to talk to somebody. They should go into business teaching customer service.", 
    "Love, Love, Love these chairs!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Definitely will purchase again!", 
    "Very happy with our purchase. We love the look, color and style of these chairs though they were a bit smaller than what I was expecting. We bought 2 of them for use at our dining room table but may end up relocating them due to their petite sizing. They look really nice and are very comfortable to sit in. They came incredibly fast and completely constructed. They look great with the counter stools we also bought with Overstock. This was our first experience buying through Overstock and would not hesitating ordering again.", 
    "Nice chairs, but not for the price. They are very small so I wasnt able to use them as dining chairs like I originally planned. In my opinion, they cost too much for what they are.", 
    "I ordered these for my kitchen/dinning room. They are very attractive, very light and about 1 or 2 inches shorter then my other chairs. They seat at the same height as my folding chairs. I was not comfortable keeping them, felt I needed to sit on a phone book (you older crew will understand). They were also extremely light, not sure how they would hold up. \"Overstock\" made the return very easy. I am waiting for UPS to pick them up today. First time I have returned anything from here. I love overstock!", 
    "I've read other reviews before buying this regarding the size being too short for the avg height dining table then was miss lead by other reviewers stating they were tall people and had no issues with these chairs. Ok after going through the trouble of ordering these chairs I will agree that they are one, too short for my 30\" high dining table. No way can someone be comfortable sitting on a chair this short and eating on the dining table. Number two, a reviewer said these were like child seats. That was bang on, putting four of these chairs with my glass dining table made me laugh. It was that bad. My dining table is 42\"x72\". I returned these, great customer service from overstock, and ordered the Christopher Knight Taylor ivory leather dining chair. Same great quality and same color in a bigger package. Regarding these chairs I'm reviewing, although small and short the quality of the chair is great for the price. I was very pleased with the color as well. I was trying my hardest to love the chair and even considered somehow extending the leg of there chair. But at the end I'm happy to have returned them for the new set.", 
    "The ivory color was exactly what I needed and as shown, However, these chairs look extremely small , even in our small breakfast room. had to send them back. Overstock was great to work with.", 
    "We ordered our 4 chairs late on Dec 2nd, in order to use the 15% discount. I had read all the reviews on these chairs prior to ordering, and, I can only add my agreement to other reviewers. They are all I expected and more. They arrived on Dec 4th!!!! 2 days after I ordered them~~~incredible! They were exceptionally well packaged and beautiful. They are exactly what we wanted. They are a creamy white,(not a brilliant white), and are soft and very well made. I examined them in detail and found no flaws at all. I would recommend them to anyone who wants a high quality leather stitched chair.", 
    "Love these chairs! The color was spot on for what I imagined for \"ivory.\" They have a very clean and contemporary look and are very comfortable to sit in. My husband is 6'2\" and weighs 240 lbs and the chairs hold him without issue. They appear to be very well made and there is no wobbling. I'm very happy with my purchase", 
    "I love these chairs they are a soft ivory with beautiful tufted back so, so soft. I originally only ordered two and liked them so much I ordered two more. They are great for my apartment eating area and look great with my glass top table. I wouldn't buy these for a dining room they are a little small and short.", 
    "We were looking for modern dining chairs to match our dark expresso dining table and these chairs caught my eyes. As I read through the reviews, I think the biggest concern that some people have is the size of the chairs. I looked at the measurements and I did not think that that should be a problem to us, I think that if you are over 6'2\", there may be a problem. The delivery was prompt and they are really comfortable and we love them! The color is a bit off white and definitely not as white as the photograph. For the price we paid, these are very nice...actually even cheaper than some ikea chairs that are similar in style and not as good looking!", 
    "I am so glad that I bought these chairs! I love the style and color. I already have some upholstered dining chairs that I like, but I love these. They are light weight, yet sturdy. They come pre assembled. Not like the other chairs that holes did not match up...never again. Right out of the box you are sitting on these chairs. They are perfect for a smaller space dining room. Great purchase, price and delivery! I am going to order 2 more.", 
    "These chairs look like a million bucks, (slight exaggeration). Look far more costly that the price would indicate.. Color is true: ivory as stated. Not white. Only problem is they do sit LOWER than other kitchen chairs, so we had to trim the wooden legs off our table! It was no problem for us... my husband is very handy, but might not be possible for a different style of table. They are beautiful and look like something out of a designer magazine.", 
    "excellent chairs, the finish and color are absolutely awesome, came in within few days, just in time for our gathering, and shipping was free..", 
    "These chairs are perfect!!! Great look and quality!! They go perfect in my rustic modern dining room!!", 
    "I absolute love the chair, the color is perfect for our dinning room set!!!", 
    "We knew from reading the reviews that they might be on the smaller side. The size actually doesn't bother us at all. They are sturdy and comfortable. We bought six and then bought two more after six months because we have been happy.", 
    "These chairs look very nice -- but they are light weight and seem smaller and sit lower than the measurements imply. The leather covering is very nice and the finish on the legs is good, but they are definitely not \"fine furniture\". They are very serviceable chairs for the money.", 
    "These chairs are so pretty and complement our small apartment beautifully. Problem is, they are too low...so sadly we will return these.", 
    "Although some of the reviews mentioned that the chairs were really small, I decided to take a chance on them because they looked really nice in the photo. The chairs arrived very quickly and perfectly packaged. They were completed assembled as mentioned in other reviews. Unfortunately, they are very tiny chairs and they sit really low so I had to return them. I purchased them to go with a round glass table and banquette. Had it not been for the size of the chairs, they would have been perfect. The price for two chairs is a great deal and they are very good looking chairs. This is my second attempt at finding a pair of suitable chairs for my banquette and my search continues. Hope my review is helpful to someone else. Good luck.", 
    "Chairs add an elegant touch to my dining room. Very sturdy, well crafted, with smart leather finish. Only thing to keep in mind is that chairs are a little lower than average, so not great for someone who is on the short side.", 
    "I ordered eight chairs and they arrived in just six days. These chairs were packed two to a carton. The legs were bubble wrapped and the entire chair was encased in a cloth sleeve. Absolutely no assembly was required. All of the chairs were in perfect condition. Many reviews state that these chairs are not white but I disagree. There are numerous shades of white and these chairs are a soft white, not a stark white. The legs are very dark and could be considered black. The chair is not large, however, it is a suitable size. No one is going to walk into your home and say \"Oh my gosh, look at those little chairs.\" One review indicated that they would be suitable for toddlers which is incorrect. Again, these chairs are not large but certainly adequate for adults. The chairs are comfortable to sit it and sturdy. The leather is soft and the workmanship is excellent.", 
    "We are very pleased. Hope they wear as well as they look.", 
    "I just received these chairs and they are lovely. Super soft leather, great style. They are a slightly smaller chair but that is perfect for my condo where I don't have a lot of extra space. Very clean, modern look and seem to be a nice quality chair especially at this price. I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend. We saw something nearly identical to these at Pier 1 and they were $150 for each chair.", 
    "I am so in love with these chairs! They are very elegant.", 
    "These chairs are exactly as they are described. They are good quality, sturdy, and comfortable. You don't sink into the seat overly much, but there is a little give. They are not totally firm though, which to me is a good thing for a dining room chair. I find them comfortable and look very nice. Legs are sturdy and overall construction of the chairs is solid. Happy customer!", 
    "Good quality chairs, match up well with the color scheme of my decor, look very expensive, I get good complements on it all the time.", 
    "Great looking chairs. Very comfortable as well. They look very expensive to be honest. The arch to the back of the chair makes it very comfortable. The seat itself is deeply padded too providing even more comfort. They arrived in great condition and came in thin sleeves that could be used as great covers in case you need to store them or keep them dust free for those longer trips out of town.", 
    "very nice leather, fine classic design, and durable quality. highly recommend this chair.", 
    "very pleased. I am using them in a kid's playroom. I especially like their somewhat smaller size as they will be used at a Thanksgiving table for 16.", 
    "it some very fast....I order Sat and come Wednesday...already assumble....I am super happy with these four new chair", 
    "These are lightweight chairs that go perfect in our rustic/contemporary blend of styles in our dining room. We have a bunch of teens, and we like to use the dining room, so these chairs are perfect. Not too spendy, look great, can withstand teens, and at this price, we can replace when they kids have flown the coop.", 
    "These chairs were one of the best values ever! The leather is gorgeous, they're soft and comfortable to sit in and they're a perfect size for my small dining room. Can't say enough about them...if you're looking for chairs for a smaller space, you can't go wrong with these.", 
    "So glad I bought these chairs. They are exactly what I was looking for. I was pleasantly surprised when they came assembled.", 
    "I absolutely love these chairs they are perfect for my small eat in kitchen. I already had my table and it was a tad bit too big for the space. When I read all of the other reviews stating that the chairs were on the small side, I decided to purchase them. They are perfect! These were the fourth set of chairs that I had purchased for the table. If you are looking to purchase a smaller sized dining chair you won't be dis appointed with these chairs.", 
    "These chairs are the perfect size for a breakfast area. Look great!", 
    "Great price for 2 CHAIRS!! Packaged well, protected well. Comes assembled...which was wonderful! Wide enough, sturdy enough, back is tall enough. Very pretty and I think depending on the look you're going for could go in a very elegant room or a casual room as well. Very versatile. My husband is 6'3\" and is comfortable in the chair. Like most of the other posts, I feel/they seem just a tad short. But when I put them with my farmhouse table, they looked fine. I do wish they were a bit taller but they don't look awkward or out of place.Never considered sending them back. I do wonder if they are a standard height for an average table???", 
    "Quite decent looking chairs, reasonably comfortable. A high point is that no assembly was required. The low seat height was discouraging for \"not-tall\" users.", 
    "Seat Cushions are not as plush as it should be and legs are bit shorter than the standard height, I'm in the mist of looking for something to boost the height....overall it's fair for the price....", 
    "Great product, was delivered on time and excellent condition.", 
    "These chairs are a great value for the money and very comfortable. I have a large rectangular glass and chrome modern table. These chairs seem small compared to the weight of the glass table. They are also short. I may send them back.", 
    "I like the chair. I was assembled and it comfortable", 
    "I am pleased with my purchase of these chairs AND the fact that I stayed in my price range but they are still of great quality AND the fact that they arrived much much sooner than I expected them too. Overall, great find and great buy!", 
    "I love these chairs... great quality and price. Very Elegant Casual look to them..", 
    "I love these chairs! They are the perfect ivory colour - not too white and not too cream and they come assembled which is a bonus! The diamond tufting on the seat backs takes then from average to excellent value for the price. I highly recommend these chairs!", 
    "Overall very pleased with the product and excellent service, would buy from Overstock again!", 
    "I bought my first one set 2 yrs ago. And our family loved them so much. I placed an order 1 yr ago for another set. Now we have 4. Apprently we have enough number of dining chair since we are 4 ppl in the family. but I'm planning to buy another set as soon as I can because we use this chair not just for dining. Every members are carrying this chair to our study room, living room and playing room for they want to sit comfortably. I'm not a type of person who buy expensive item. But this chair is worthy every dollar I spent.", 
    "I was very pleased with the chairs, they are a perfect addition to my dining room.", 
    "Love my new chairs! Perfect off white/cream color to go with my dark brown Ikea table. The legs match my table perfectly! I was a little worried when I saw the reviews saying the chairs were small - the seat height is the same as the chairs I replaced but the back is shorter which would make them seem small. Not an issue for me! Looks great, very comfortable. I almost bought cloth chairs for the same price from Pier One. So glad I waited until I checked Overstock.com first!!! Best purchase in a long time! Shipped fast. Fully assembled and packed extremely well!", 
    "I am in love with these chairs. I went ahead and bought 2 more after my initial purchase. These are so great! I was afraid they would sell out. The chairs are upholstered with very soft material. Sitting on it reminds me of floating on a cloud. As other reviewers have stated, you will probably want these chairs only if you are of smaller or medium size build. The chairs are smaller than normal size. The height is a little on the lower side, so if you have a tall dining table you probably will need another chair type. However, if you have a regular dining table, you should be fine. The price on Overstock is really competitive. I went to a LOT of furniture stores. All the upholstered sets (even at discount outlets) were around $100 per chair elsewhere.", 
    "I bought 3 sets of these chairs for a total of 6 chairs. They look good, are very comfortable, and no assembly is required.", 
    "Great chairs! Came assembled and quickly! Very comfortable and exactly what I wanted!! Needed black legs to match my table and color is very dark so Can go either way!", 
    "I'm really happy with these chairs. They came fully assembled, well packaged and are super comfortable. I like the size- I can easily fit three along my 78\" table. Also, they easily fit our booster seats on top. Very easy to wipe clean, and they came with smooth gliding caps on the feet so they don't scratch up the wood floors. Overall, a perfect fit for our growing family- and you can't beat this price for leather!", 
    "the chairs are very sturdy and the wood is dark. The leather is beautiful and this is the best price I have seen for genuine leather chairs. Each chair comes wrapped and packed in 2 in a box. Fully put together and very comfortable. Perfect size.", 
    "The chairs feel great & look nice. They are on the smaller side but are perfectly comfortable & proportionate to the dining table. I bought 4 and have decided to purchase two more. Soft to the touch, sturdy & light.", 
    "I really like those chairs. They are stable and look good and comfortable. Good price, too.", 
    "First the chair were all assembled. True to description. I was very pleased with the color of chairs and promised date of delivery. The leather material appeared very shiny but in time will be just fine. Glad I found these chair all leater upper. This the best price compared to stores.", 
    "The chairs are wonderful cant complain at all but the legs are very short. I dont have a high table but when you sit it feel very low.", 
    "Very happy with this product. Delivery was fast and there was no need for assembly. The chairs are a little narrow which in my opinion is a plus since I can fit more of them around my dining room table. Very easy to clean.", 
    "At first I was hesitant to buy white dining chairs, but they have stood up well and clean easily, when there are spills. No complaints. Comfortable to sit on. However if you have a high dining table these chairs may be too low at 18\". They are just right for the table I have.", 
    "I ordered these chairs on a Friday morning & received them Monday morning. I'm very happy with my purchase & glad to see that they came already assembled. I'm a crate & barrel shopper, I was happy to see that the quality of these chairs were much similar at a cheaper price & they are much more comfy! I looked around crate & barrel, cost plus, and pier one & sat in many chairs only to find that these were the most comfortable. Looks like I will be ordering the Christopher knight barstools now as I am satisfied with his style & quality. Thank you overstock!", 
    "Came assembled and...a plus. These are smaller than I expected but work great at the dining table. Just be aware that they are smaller than other Parsons chairs that look similar. Measure and compare if you are trying to match other chairs.", 
    "I am truly amazed by the wonderful quality of the chairs, especially considering how affordable they are! They arrived extremely well packaged and whole; no assembly necessary. Each chair was carefully wrapped in its own light cloth bag and the legs were wrapped in individual sleeves. There were no surface damages and the contents arrived pristine. The color was just as my screen displayed, an off white leather seat with nearly black legs. What I didn't expect was a slightly pearly sheen to it, which was even better than I anticipated and gives the chairs a more expensive feel. The tufting is well done; even and no errant threads peeking out. It is just the right balance between my inclination towards decorative, showy pieces and my husband's more spartan, modern clean line tastes. I am 5'6\" and my husband is 5'9\" and the chairs are just the right size for our not very large apartment. The back is standard dining chair height and are not too tall and not too short, coming to just below my shoulder top. The seat is cushiony but firm and quite comfortable as far as dining chairs go. The back is also cushiony and gives good support. I haven't had any problems with surface distortion or puckering. My cat has jumped up on it a few times and while I can hear her claws scrape against the leather, it thankfully leaves no trace. It is very soft to the touch and wipes down easily. Overall a truly handsome set of chairs that I would recommend without hesitation! If you're thinking about purchasing these, believe the reviews... You won't be disappointed!", 
    "These are amazing chairs. First off, they come assembled. My boyfriend was shocked - he was expecting to have to screw different parts together, but they came very carefully wrapped and fully & securely assembled. I would also mention they are very comfortable, the leather has a fair give to it without compromising the attractiveness. I noticed some reviewers said they are small; I wouldn't agree. It's the size of a normal dining chair, but perhaps if you're preparing yourself for more of a lounge dining chair, you're going to feel that they are small. I absolutely love the tufted back.", 
    "These dining room chairs were exactly what I was looking for! They were not only elegant and contemporary but also reflected quality leather with soft cushion seating. We purchased 2 sets and are planning on getting 2 more sets. I couldn't have found a better price for such quality furniture!", 
    "Bought these to go with our dining table. They fit well with the table, which is about 76\" long and 30\" high. The scale is perfect for smaller spaces, so it doesn't over power the room but can still make a statement. The chairs are light weight. Packaging was good and the chairs were fully assembled, which is a plus.", 
    "I already have 6 of these chairs for a dining room set that I already own and I am currently in the process to buy 2 more to make a whole set of 8 for my formal dining room. These chairs look incredibly expensive and are incredibly comfortable. Modern but chic at the same time.", 
    "We ate happy with these chairs. They are very comfortable and attractive. We purchased four and had two replaced because there was a small tear in the leather of one. The replacement chairs are very nice.", 
    "These are very nice looking leather dining chairs. They are on the smaller side for this type of chair which worked well for my table. They are extremely comfortable as well.", 
    "I was looking for chairs with a small footprint to go with a modern glass round inning table. I purchased two sets (4 chairs total). They arrived quickly and, best of all, no assembly was required. The chairs are more compact than I expected and would not do for heavyset people. They are perfect for me, though, because my dining area is small.", 
    "We are very happy with our chairs. Yes, they are smaller like some previous reviewers pointed it out; however, this is the style nowdays: small, sleek and elegant. I am happy I can now fit 8 guest at my dining table instead of 6 before due to my bulky chairs.", 
    "a nice addition to our dining room. very stylish cute", 
    "These chairs are perfect for me (I'm 4'11\" tall) and they are also comfortable for my taller friends. High quality and beautiful.", 
    "I ordered these chairs thinking I could save some money, however I had to return them becuase the were too small and too short and the legs were too dark. I was looking for something more elegant for my dinning room. I ended up returning these (very easy to return) and reordering my first choice (Metro Leather Cream Side Chairs). I would recommend these chairs but they were not what I was I was looking for.", 
    "I love these chairs. We purchased 6 to replace the chairs that came with our dining room set. I wanted something that was easy to clean, looked nice, and that I didn't feel the need to recover ever year. These are perfect.", 
    "Love these chairs. So excited to add them to my dining room. I couldn't be happier with the quality and look of them. Look very expensive.", 
    "The chairs are good quality and have held up well with over 6 months of use. I have read other reviews for contemporary leather chairs that cost much more than these stating that they have ripped and frayed after use. You do not need to worry about that with these chairs. They fit well with my contemporary kitchen and clean up very easily even after use by kids. They are very comfortable but at first use they do feel a bit low if you are used to a more traditional chair. Having used them for awhile we no longer notice the difference.", 
    "Great chairs for the price. They look elegant and more expensive than they were. They are also very comfortable!", 
    "I read other reviews on these chairs, so I knew they were on the smaller side. I purchased them for our motorhome and wanted chairs for the dining area that wouldn't take up too much space. They are gorgous, comefortable and the craftsmanship is perfect.. They came fully assembled, very well packed, and they even came in dust covers that I can use again. Great value for the money.", 
    "Chairs were described accurately.....They are small but just right for us coz we're petite:).....", 
    "We ordered four of these chairs for our breakfast room. We have a very unique seafoam colored glass etched table and they fit beautifully with it. We are very pleased with the quality and the quiet elegance of these chairs. The color, the feel of the leather, the tufting on the backs, everything is just perfect to meet our needs. I would recommend these chairs to friends and am proud of have them in my house.", 
    "Chairs are a good replacement for the ivory material ones. Wish the backs of the chairs were about 2+ inches higher but am used to the \"shorter\" look", 
    "I got compliments on these the first time I had someone over. They add a nice bright, elegant and classy feel to the room. Love them! Very comfortable too which is important because the kitchen is the gathering and hang out place! Great buy!", 
    "I love my new chair. They look very elegant. That is one of my best purchases that I have done this year.", 
    "I like those chairs. The quality of the leather is good, the color is matching the one on the photo. They are a bit small, though, smaller than your usual dining chairs. And they look really cute.", 
    "These chairs are so beautiful they look great with my expresso/copper/glass top table. They look very expensive and elegant. I am glad I made the purchase.", 
    "Dimensions are accurate - and I think they are stylin' for the price. The legs are a very dark ebony. The chair itself is a creamy warm white. Very comfortable to sit in for an extended dinner party :) One issue is that you can see slight pulling in the stitches in the tufted areas - this is the nature of the pleather being pulled taught. It's not a major issue, but on initial - close inspection, my eye went right to it. Husband never noticed it. Easy to wipe clean as their is no tufting on the seat. NO ASSEMBLY :) Joy! Two come packaged in one large box. And as always overstock delivered quickly :) I bought 2 to check them out.... Overstock sent a coupon that next week and I ordered 4 more. We are very pleased as they \"dress-up\" our kitchen/dining area.", 
    "We ordered these dining chairs based on the reviews on the site. They were packaged exactly as described on Overstock. No assembly required and each chair was protected by a cover. The quality of the chairs is very good. They are comfortable and they look wonderful around our new dining room table. We are very pleased with this purchase and they are an excellent value. We highly recommend these chairs to anyone that wants a contemporary chair.", 
    "I love these chairs! The styling lends a bit of sophistication and lots of comfort. I am so pleased with these chairs.................actually a neighbor was just over and complimented me on them!", 
    "The chairs are very lite as in weight and they are kind of small, but they are perfect size for apartment furniture. They go really well with my sofa which is similar in color and the tufted style. I love the chairs!!! I have recieved so many compliments on the chairs. Very stylish and modern!!!", 
    "We ordered many sets of these and they all came very quickly and in perfect condition--we couldn't be happier! They are really comfortable, rich looking and we appreciate how many you can fit around a dining room table, since they are narrow. I actually like that they are not too tall so when you have a large number of chairs around the table they do not overpower a room.", 
    "This was my first purchase from Overstock--I was so pleased with the care given to packaging, delivery time, accuracy and quality of the product, and ease of ordering, I have since made 2 more purchases. It was the reviews that convinced me to risk ordering online without seeing the product Thanks to those who took the time to write in--the good and the not so good.", 
    "Excellent white leather chairs. Look beautiful on my indoor patio. I put these white chairs around a glass table top with black metal base. What a stunning setting. They look so nice my family doesn't want to sit on them. I do recommend measuring these chairs prior to your purchase for height. They are a little short and could not be used for extra chairs in my formal dining room. The patio table is a little shorter, they are perfect.", 
    "Everyone who sees these chairs when they visit me loves them. The chairs compliment my glass - top dinning table. My Family and I enjoy sitting to have our meals on these \" comfy\" chairs.", 
    "These are beautiful chairs, with nice quality cream leather. I have a kitchen island with cream leather barstools, and these dining room chairs are the perfect match.", 
    "These are very attractive, elegant chairs. I was concerned about purchasing them but read so many great reviews that I felt comfortable. They would go well in almost any setting... transitional, contemporary, traditional. I like that their measurements are somewhat more compact than other chairs given my smaller, high traffic space. Very versatile and look to be much more expensive than they were. Another great purchase from Overstock, thanks!", 
    "Two very nice, lightweight, lovely dining chairs....as I desired.", 
    "LOVE these chairs. Use it as a desk chair and sit in it for hours at a time. So comfortable and stylish. I get many compliments on it!", 
    "The chairs are as expected, good quality for the price.", 
    "Once again I was not disappointed by Overstock! Our chairs arrived on time, packaged well and we loved that they were put together! We are using the chairs in a breakfast area so they are the perfect size!....... If you are looking for a true dining room chair, they are on a smaller scale but description was very accurate . We love our new chairs! Very clean stylish look. I will purchase a pair for my daughter!", 
    "These chairs came fully assembled and well packaged. They arrived within three days of ordering. I will order more.", 
    "I ordered two of Gentry chairs and Overstock service was excellent. The chairs are well made and the color was exactly like the picture. However, the size of the chair was extra small like a chair for a child's playhouse. It would be great for a very small space but not suitable for a regular house. I returned these chairs with no problem. Thanks again for Overstock excellent service.", 
    "I initially bought only 1 set of these chairs for my new espresso dining table, since I had never ordered furniture online before. The chairs arrived pretty fast, and were packaged well, so no damage. The chairs add classic yet contemporary touch to the dining table. They are very comfortable to sit on, and are very light weight, but sturdy. The only thing is the chairs are not super wide. So in case you are looking for a big over-sized chairs, these are not it.", 
    "I recently sold our old kitchen harvest table and chairs to do a little upgrade since the kids are grown. We moved an all glass table to the kitchen but had to search for new chairs. The Gentry chairs were the perfect solution meeting all our criteria: 1.) beautiful; 2.) comfortable; 3.) classic; 4.) doesn't cost a lot, and 5.) clean up nicely. We could not be happier. They will never go out of style and the leather is a good quality. They came assembled in 2 large boxes (we ordered 2 sets) so they were in place and being used within minutes of arriving. Overall a great choice, but measure your space to these specs...they are a medium size and height.", 
    "Love the color, matches exactly to the picture and the description on the site. Chair is comfortable. One thing I don't like is that the back is not tall enough, kinda short. Thought the back of the chair would be taller.", 
    "These chairs arrived when overstock said they would. They were packed really well. There was no damage. When I opened the boxes I was thrilled. These chairs are beautiful and comfortable. They go with my existing table well. The quality is great. I love them!", 
    "The chairs came in a very timely manner. They were packaged very well. It was great that they did not need to be assembled. My only issue is that they are not very tall. I took the measurements for the seat and the seat height to be sure they would be ok with my other dining room chairs. I forgot to measure the overall height and they are about 4\" short. They will work ok because I will not put them around the table until they are in use. I looked at many chairs and for the price these are great.", 
    "These chairs are very nice, and they are exactly what I wanted. They are well made and comfortable. I ordered them because I have a small desk that needed a more formal looking chair than a typical office chair. They are small, however. So be sure that you look at the measurements carefully and calculate whether they will be sufficient for your needs. I am 5'4\" with a small frame, and the chair fits me perfectly. My husband is 6' , and the chair looks a little small for him (even though he likes it and is comfortable in it). I would not use these for dining chairs, because I prefer taller backs at the dining table. But in my small office, it fits perfectly with the small desk (48\"wide). I have the other one in my bedroom. They would also look good in a corner nook with a small end table.", 
    "What a great buy! I love love love my new chairs. They are stylish and have a great perceived value. This was my first purchase on Overstock.com and I am very impressed with the speediness of delivery and quality of product for the price. I will definitely recommend them.", 
    "Was happy with the fast delivery, fed ex just dropped off the boxes without getting a signature though. The chairs were wrapped very carefully in their individual box and cover. Liked the fact they were assembled, I just opened the boxes and took them out no hassle of screws. The only dissapointment was that they were shorter than expected, I was hoping they had the long back rest, should of measured first, my fault. The chairs are off white but it compliments my formal dinning as they stand out. The chairs add a modern yet sophisticated look. I wanted them to be steardy and durable, I guess time will tell. I sat in one chair and seemed strong enough, very easy to clean too. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase from overstock.", 
    "Perfect set of chairs to complete our dining room space in a small space. Not too small, but just RIGHT! Love them,", 
    "very elegant looking chair, love the dimple styling on the back support. perfect for the breakfast nook or as guess chairs for the formal dining table. the leather is soft and smooth. the chairs came pre-assembled which is perfect. plenty of cushion on the seat.", 
    "These chairs arrived promptly as usual...Love them! I mean, they are perfect for my dining room. They are soft, white leather, chairs are sturdy and come ALREADY PUT TOGETHER. This was the best selling point for me....as a single woman, I detest putting things together. I pulled these out of the box...and presto...they were ready to use. Very comfortable chairs, well made, no complaints here at all. I have never had any problems with anything I ever ordered on Overstock! Very happy camper here. Thank you!! Gail in Ohio", 
    "I wish I had more to order more. Love these chairs!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
    "I LOVE how these look. I have ordered from Overstock.com before and have always been satisfied with their quality, delivery, and prices. This was long awaited (I have been looking at chairs for an antique drop leaf table for a LONG time) purchase and I am delighted that I found these. I ordered 2 to make sure they fit and looked good, and I just ordered 8 more chairs to complete the set. Perfect!!!", 
    "I received two sets of two chairs delivered to my door. The pale cream color matches the photos on the site. The chairs have a classy, modern look. I am very petite (5') and the chairs are actually quite comfy for my height/size but I think they will work fine for taller builds.", 
    "They look great with my espresso dining table, great quaility and the leather is a very nice bright off white.", 
    "It was a joy to remove the 2 chairs from the box, in perfect condition, with no assembly. I ordered 2 more. Thank You Overstock.", 
    "We wanted to complete our dining room by adding two white chairs. In reading other reviews we saw that these were not stark white so we thought we would try them. They are perfect, could not ask for better. They compliment our other pieces very well and arrived quickly, packed better than I would have imagined and have told everyone about them and where we found them! Comfort and style in addition to great craftsmanship.", 
    "When we received these chairs, we were impressed by the look and the construction, so we ordered more. We now have a set of 6. They fit perfectly at our formal dining room table and just look beautiful. The price was great. They look wonderful, and they are very, very comfortable. All and all, these chairs were an excellent choice for us.", 
    "The product was great. It just did not fit my table.", 
    "I am going to order a couple more the look fantastic in the dining room!", 
    "I loved the chairs so much that I ordered 2 more and I have them around my glass dining room table and they look wonderful, They class up the room and are really true to quality. They arrived promptly in perfect condition. I am thrilled with all 4 of them....What a good job you guys at Overstock diid!!!", 
    "I read reviews of these chairs before ordering - many reviewers mentioned that the chairs were not white, but off-white/cream. Which is exactly why I ordered them. They are a lovely cream color, and look amazing against a dark wood dining room table. They are very comfortable and come fully assembled. By far the best purchase I've ever made on Overstock and one of the favorite things I've bought for my new home, period. Amazing value for the price. Fantastic buy.", 
    "My old large, high-back chairs were OK when I had a formal dining room, but overwhelmed the dinette in my present condo. The new chairs are perfect and make everything else look superb!", 
    "love these comfortable chairs! they are nice quality, and small scale. they actually fit quite nicely at my small table for two, but might sit too low for some people.", 
    "These are more ivory or cream colored than white. We got them to match our white (actual) leather couch and they don't. Nevertheless they are good quality, so hopefully the distance between the living and dining room will trick the eye", 
    "Great chairs! They are on the small side. I purchased the Shaker Table from Overstock as well and they pair very well together. Over all they look great in my condo. I would suggest them for someone with limited space and great style.", 
    "I love these chairs. I looked all over for chairs like these, but overstock is the only place I could find them at a reasonable price. These chairs add a touch of style to any dining room table. They are actually very comfortable as well. Hopefully they remain sturdy after use, but only time will tell.", 
    "First let me say that these chairs are beautiful and well made. The design and fabric are very elegant. Only problem is that the overall size of the chair is SMALL. When you put them up to a regular size dining table they look like miniature chairs. They are not to normal scale. I have a large, dark brown farm house style dining table and you can barely see the chairs over the table height, which is standard table height. now I have to figure out if it's going to cost me an arm and a leg to return all 6 of them or if I am stuck with them. It's a shame because the color, design are exactly what I was looking for at a great price. So be warned....they may be better for your kiddie table.", 
    "We are very pleased with our new dining room chairs! Great price for us as a young family. Looked in person and other onlines store-Overstock had the most to offer in our price range. Tufted-back adds a little bit of detail. Seat is a little smaller than others in same catergory, but we were okay with that because we can find 3 on each side of our harvest table comfortably. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "Chairs arrived at my house soaking wet, as we had a lot of rain. Not sure why the chairs would be wet. I am from Canada and paid a lot of money for shipping. Chairs are ivory in colour, which is what I was looking for. Chairs are very small, not a substantial chair, and extremely light in weight. They are made in China, which I was not too happy about.", 
    "These chairs are tiny, not standard size, unable to tell the quality, not flashy, do not draw attention. Sent them immediately back!"
