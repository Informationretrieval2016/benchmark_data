    "I would recommend if you don't want to spend alot of $. Directions were not good. Half way through had to take it apart and start all over again. If your not handy get someone who is to help, Once put together it does look good in the livingroom next to a wall unit. Have a small house with limited space so it small enough to tuck in a corner and it goes with rest of the furniture. Now will be the test of time to see if it holds up.", 
    "If you do not have a lot of paperwork to file away & want just a good looking cabinet sitting in your office or wherever, this one would do. It would have been nice if they mentioned the ball-bearing glider, then I would not have purchased this cabinet. The backing was not cut properly. I had to cut off a little off the top so the cabinet would not show gaps on the side. Good think I was handy at putting things together; the instructions were not that helpful. To top it all off, they decided to email me an online coupon (which I could have used for the cabinet) after I have made my purchase. Now I see that they are also offering an additional 10%. I should have just bought a black steel cabinet for that price & be worry free about whether or not it will fall apart on me one day.", 
    "I bought the 2 drawer version of this a while ago and love it. Am expanding my home business and was so happy they offered the 4 drawer version. It is a very solid piece of furniture and is perfect for my home office. I had a little help assembling but the instructions were clear and I was able to transfer files in a matter of a couple of hours. The finish is true to the picture and the handles dress up the piece nicely.", 
    "I wanted to get a wood filing cabinet instead of metal because I think it's more attractive in my office. This looks great and is exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "I love the filling cabinet. It makes my office a lot more organized. It is generous size, easy to assemble and sturdy. It looks good in my office. Definitely will recommend to my friend.", 
    "Good filing cabinet for the money. Slightly inferior to **** in quality of materials and clarity of instructions. Problem with assembly - poor instructions. Problem getting drawers to align properly. Sticking drawer front came off due to incorrectly secured posts. Drawers come all the way out, allowing full access to all of the files.", 
    "This cabinet is exactly what I wanted and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was everything and more than I expected. The color is perfect, the finish is flawless, the hardware is of great quality, and the drawer size is precisely what I need and expected. The assembly directions were clear and although it was time consuming, the price I paid for the cabinet made up for the time commitment. The drawers glide effortlessly and its very sturdy. The people that complained about the drawers \"rubbing against each other\" did not have the drawers installed correctly. One of my drawers did do that, but I took the time to really look at what was going on and realized that one side of the glide had not been properly engaged to the matching glide. Once properly engaged it worked perfectly.", 
    "i had trouble putting it together, other than that its fine.", 
    "After first reading instructions carefully (as I always do), it went together fine. Except the top & bottom I had to redo (switch) as the instructions didn't include needed detail that would have prevented that mistake. But, the frustrating part of this piece is the alignment of several drawers. I had to redrill/move holes up or down to have them fit properly. Otherwise, it looks very nice. Would I buy it again? Probably, for the price and the look. Just be forewarned that you may be spending extra time making adjustments to make it right.", 
    "This is an absolutely great piece for the price! Definitely not solid wood but I'm in love with it! Is so much prettier than a regular file cabinet! And the cabinets are actually very smooth when opening it closing.", 
    "The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because of overstocks customer service. They were great. The file cabinet came missing a couple pieces. They were quick to send them to me and there was no hassle. The file cabinet looks great, however, the drawers are hard to open and close as well as they do not align properly. I followed all the directions putting it together but it still is not lining up correctly. I honestly should have spent an extra hundred dollars to purchase one from a furniture store already assembled.", 
    "Easy to put together and attractive. So glad we got this one.", 
    "Okay quality for this price", 
    "This cabinet literally came in a million pieces and it's painful to put together. Straight forward but painful. Also, until you get the finished product, the cabinet did not seem level at all so I spent a good hour trying to figure out what's wrong only to find out at the end, you basically have to push the sides together to fit the drawers. Once all the drawers are secured, the cabinet looks fabulous but not sure if it's worth the time!!!I should add....to the manufacturer credit, all the pieces are well labeled and documented...including all the screws.", 
    "It arrived on time its a beautiful piece. But the instructions needs to be written much more careful and if I did not realize that I need a Philip screw driver and a flat head. It would have taken me longer time to complete.But over all it is doing the job. But I will not purchase any thing from overstock that I have to put together. I prefer it comes assembled like the chest of drawers I bought prior. Love Overstock", 
    "So many pieces took a long time to assemble and drawers don't fit right.", 
    "Great look , cabinet was smashed on arrival other than that nice piece of office equipment for home", 
    "instructions to assemble are a little too vague if you are not familiar with assembling furniture. The finished product looks nice and the glides are easy to open and close. Two of the drawer fronts were chipped on the edges with no damage to the packaging so it is obvious they were packed with the chips. Too far along to return so decided to keep and just paint the chips. If you decide to purchase this- it is time consuming to put together."
