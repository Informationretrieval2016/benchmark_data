    "I hesitated ordering a 140# table. I wasn't looking forward to having to deal with it, if I didn't like it. The grain of the wood is even more beautiful than I had hoped for. I couldn't take my eyes off of it for a long time after I got it. I use it as a desk (like partners' desk) with a chair at either end. I am totally happy with it.", 
    "The table arrived without a single flaw so my experience is different than that of the one other reviewer. It is really heavy. I know nothing about this type of wood but it is about as heavy as oak. It also seems about as hard as oak too and therefore should prove quite scratch resistant. Time will tell. The site pictures do not do it justice; it is a really beautiful looking table as well.", 
    "I've never ordered such a large and prominent piece of furniture online without being able to see a floor sample or get a wood swatch. I was very worried I won't like it and have to send it back. I worried for nothing. The table is stunning. It's made of solid wood and the wood grain is beautiful. I got this in the natural finish. It's just stunning. The table is sturdy and looks very expensive (at least to me). I get comments on it all the time. The natural variation in the wood grain makes it easy to find wood chairs to coordinate with this table. lt was pretty easy to put the legs on. I love this table!!!", 
    "It took my husband all of 7 minutes to attach the 4 legs to the table top. The 2 of us could hardly lift it to carry it in the house it was so heavy! Once it was assembled, we unfortunately noticed that there are approximately 60 small very visible white imperfections randomly dispersed all over the table top --- scratches/chips or flecks of dust in the varnish. It is difficult to tell what it is, I have never seen anything quite like this before and it is damaged. While I certainly I do not expect anything to come in PERFECT condition, this seems like poor quality control or a manufacturing issue. I am very disappointed. Because these imperfections are so noticable, and it is unclear whether they will actually affect the integrity and durability of the surface of the table top over the years I hope to keep this table, I will be contacting Overstock to see what my options are for replacing. We had also purchased 4 Alicia Chairs which look wonderful with the table. 2 of the chairs were damaged during delivery, and it was a breeze to deal with Overstock Customer Service get them replaced. Interestingly, none of the chairs have the white imperfections. We also ordered the Alicia Buffet and have yet to unwrap it, and I am now worried about what it will look like..."
