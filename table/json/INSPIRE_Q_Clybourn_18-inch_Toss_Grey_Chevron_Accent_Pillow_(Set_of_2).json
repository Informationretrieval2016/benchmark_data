  "reviews": [
    "The pillows were expensive to start with but they are small and one has a tear already. Not quality", 
    "I love the style of these pillows. But they are too small. Advertised 18 inches, it is really 15 when stretched out. In reality is more 13x13. Very disappointed and am returning.", 
    "I bought these to match the storage ottoman, the fabric is very nice but they look cheap because the filler pillow is skinny and lumpy. I will eventually replace it with down feather pillows, but for the price I expected a lot more.", 
    "These are amazing! Would buy several more!", 
    "Really nice pillows, the quality of the fabric is great. It could be a bit more stuffed considering the price was over $60 but overall nice and is exactly like the picture", 
    "super stylish but lacked a lot in fluff....already looked like they are years old right out of the bag. Design is great though", 
    "The fabric on these pillows was very stiff and was not a good choice for where I wanted to use them. That being said, they are really cute.", 
    "They could use more fillings!", 
    "The colors and quality are very great.", 
    "Fast easy transaction. Items were exactly like the picture and thecolor was perfect.", 
    "I got these to match the ottoman and they are a perfect match. Comfortable and high quality fabric!", 
    "Visually pleasing, good quality, fits lovely in my living room decor.", 
    "Too cute love the color you can use tan or gray the color goes with both", 
    "The pillows are a very nice size. Very good soft material. Craftsmanship is good as well. The picture is very accurate view of what you're getting. Looks nice on my new grey couch.", 
    "Really great looking accent pillows. Good quality filling and nice material. A bit on the expensive side for 2 pillows but still great.", 
    "Love these well stuffed throw pillows.", 
    "Nice addition to tie in w the Chevron ottoman", 
    "I bought these pillows to match the Sauganash Grey Chevron Lift Top Storage Bench. The pillows nestle on the bed and add a unifying touch.", 
    "I had to steam one of the pillows as it was crammed so hard into the box it was a wrinkled mess. After that quick fix, they look great.", 
    "Love these couches however I have them in a sitting room that rarely gets used. I would not order these for a family room. Too small and not made well enough for that. Beautiful light grey color, which I love. I did pops of yellow, cream, and light tourquoise accent colors, which look great. Impressed one month in with this set.", 
    "Beautiful and soft pillows! I'm so happy with them. I'm ordering more! Love that the cover can zip off to wash!", 
    "Very cheap looking and VERY faded or worn material. Will use for time and then make covers myself for them as they already look OLD but they are comfortable and I will keep them.", 
    "looks exactly like the picture. The pillows are very soft and decorative. lovin it!", 
    "I have light minty colored couches and the gray chevron adds a nice touch to the over all look. So far they seem to be very durable and keep their shape. Happy!", 
    "these pillows have velvet looking silver chevron pattern like the picture! i feel they cover doesn't fit the pillow insert well. the color in the picture seems a bit off.. the pillow is grey and light grey/taupe."
