    "Having a large entryway and a \"no-shoe\" rule in the house, I needed a shoe organizer for me and my kids various pairs of shoes. This cabinet is perfect. it has many shelves that fits our shoes, covered doors for that finished look and best of all makes the entryway look classy and neat. I am glad I shopped around until I found this cabinet. it is very nice and just what we needed.", 
    "It is perfect piece of furniture that doesn't look like a Shoe Cabinet! I added some handles, and it looks great!", 
    "It's very sturdy & heavy. It's not solid wood, but good quality of MDF. I saw a lot of reviews saying it's more like espresso color, dark brown close to black. But the one I got is close enough the same as the picture if it's under a direct light. Without much light on it, it looks darker, like Ikea brown black color. It took me over half hr to level the doors, this is the most difficult part on the assemble, other than that, it's easy. I love it. it keeps all my shoes out of my infant. He can't open the doors and play the shoes. Yeah! :)", 
    "This compact shoe cabinet is the perfect size for an urban apartment and is great piece if you're looking for something stylish yet unique. Although it's technically a shoe cabinet, it can be used for many things. Love it.", 
    "it come to the house so fast, took abowt three day. my son hep me wid the shoe cabinet and told me it wus easy por him. cabinet very strong, i put so many shoe there and it dont brake at all, so strong. i recommen this to my family and friend and evrybody. oh and vry cheep, not a lot of money out my pocket.", 
    "I searched online for a long time before finally ordering this product. It is just what I need for my bedroom and storing shoes since I hate having them in a pile on the closet floor. As most reviews state, this item isn't easy to assemble because the directions are poorly written. My handy husband figured it out but it took a couple of hours to assemble. A very sturdy product and does not look cheap. Heavy, so be sure to have it close to where you use it unless you have someone else to assist with moving it.", 
    "I really like the look of this shoe cabinet. It's very sturdy and looks more expensive than it is! It was easy to put together (although the instructions weren't that great). It's very versatile in where you put the inside pieces so that you can make more room if you want to fit boots in one of the benches. It can easily be used to fit other stuff. I'd highly recommend it.", 
    "I absolutely LOVE this cabinet! It was extremely well packaged and surprisingly light. I was able to put together the whole thing on my own (5'2 100 lbs). The color is a rich dark brown, nearly black but when the light hits it you can tell it's espresso. Great to keep by the front door for shoes but could be used for anything.", 
    "The shelf looks just like the picture. The cabinet was delivered in a very well packaged box, one of the best I have ever seen out of my experience in buying furniture online (about 5 now) Box in a box. No crack, no chip, no damage at all, very impressed and happy with the product.", 
    "A nice piece for my entry, there are very few options out there for presentable shoe cabinets. Quick delivery easy assembly - if you must follow the directions. It may not be the highest quality but it's appearance is good. My other furniture is of good quality (Ethan Allen) and this does not look out of place. Very very satisfied.", 
    "My husband assembled the piece and it took a few hours. I was surprised to see particle boards, but all in all, it looks nice. The quality is mediocre but the price was right. It does look great in my living room and it is a good place to hide our shoes. I am used to buying high quality items and good wood and this is not that. But it does look like it is.", 
    "Someone said this was brown....it it a mahogany..a little red cocoa true to color if in the light....it fits perfectly for where I need it...love it!!!!!! This is where everyone now puts their shoes when they walk in the door...perfect!!!!! Love it...love the color", 
    "The cabinets are rather on the heavy side; therefore, two individuals are needed to put the cabinets together. Kudos for the instructions, very clear and detailed. Despite their weight, there was no damage to the cabinets.....we ordered three:-) The color is pretty good and easy to match.", 
    "great product, sturdy shipping. assembly is easy and takes about 45 minutes.", 
    "With small children in our house, we try to keep our floor clean by taking off shoes before entering and walking around in the house. The shoes tend to spread all over the house as a result, in particularly children's shoes, we were able to nicely tuck this in the cabinet now. My husband has size 12 shoes and we had no problem fitting his shoe in the cabinet, there is a top drawer that we use to store keys and sunglasses etc. I absolutely loved it. Even though the product was described as wood, it is made of laminate, I hope someone would eventually be able to make a real wood product for this.", 
    "I love my shoe cabinet, it was easy to put together, the drawer has a slanted bottom edge for easier opening (so keep that in mind when putting it together), i did get a drawer knob at the store to add a little personal touch to the drawer and make it even easier to open!", 
    "I've been seeking for a brown-black color shoes cabinet to replace my temporary Ikea Billing bookshelf/ shoe cabinet. This piece is great in quality. Looks expensive and feels expensive. Attention to detail design. Even the hinge has got a cover to cover the screws.", 
    "I have an entryway that is cluttered with all of shoes and have been looking for something that would fit in the entryway and match my decor. This cabinet is a perfect for my apartment. It was not that difficult to put together; and I put it together by myself. It took me a few hours over two evenings. The hardest part was moving it from one room to another because it is so heavy. The doors don't match up exactly and are actually slightly uneven, I'm not sure if that's because the pre-drilled holes were uneven or I didn't put it together correctly but it doesn't look bad. The cabinet holds at least 15 pairs of shoes but I have somehow managed to squeeze in 20 pairs. The top drawer is an added plus and is a great place for me to put my keys/ipod/mail/etc.... Really happy with my purchase.", 
    "Great idea to create a nice looking cabinet for shoe storage. I'm able to keep all my shoes in my room and this cabinet helps me do that. Plus the top it also useful for putting my things on it and you cna't even tell this is a shoe cabinet becaue the style is so nice. I love it, good quality and sturdy and good for 20-30 pairs of shoes.", 
    "My \"Shoe Pod\" as I like to call it worked out very well and it does what it is intended to do while looking great. It's not too tall, and not too short. I placed at the entryway from the garage (where we usually walk into), and I put my shoes right in. I strategically place dryer sheets to keep the shoes fresh! No more stray shoes!!!", 
    "Have had a mess of shoes at the bottom of our stairwell for 3 years (Asian household) that was in dire need of organizing/hiding. Some of the reviews made assembly seem daunting, but I had an absolute blast putting this together (pretty much by myself) as all the pieces and hardware clicked together beautifully during my assembly. The pieces came securely packaged, without a single piece with chip or dent. Really looks beautiful, high end for the actual cost, and love what it's done for our sanity regarding messy/smelly shoes!", 
    "Love this shoe cabinet. Allows me to keep shoes by the door without the unsightly mess. The drawer is the main reason I purchased this cabinet- so handy for keeping keys, sunglasses, phone and anything else I may need to grab on my way out. Ample shelves allow storage of multiple pairs of shoes, though my husband has not yet kept any of his in there. It is tall, so it partially covers a light switch plate, but overall, we love it.", 
    "Before I buy the product I look at these reviews. They are always helpful and accurate. I love this piece of furniture. It looks great and is very functional and versatile and the price was great. I am very pleased. I have bought other items I am very happy with. They are delivered on time and well packed. The instructions are great but does take two people to put it together.", 
    "This product was exactly as advertised, but much heavier and better built than I expect out of flat pack furniture. I'd highly recommend this product.", 
    "I love this cabinet.. All the shoes that were cluttering my dining room are now tucked away in this nice looking cabinet. Fits perfectly into the room.", 
    "I like that this cabinet has doors, it looks nicer when the shoes are not showing", 
    "I was hoping for better quality. The laminate bubbles in spots and there are some dings, but not enough that I am going through the hassel of replacing. The back is a different color so if this is not flush to your wall, the particle board can be seen. I really needed this solution for my small space entry way. It is still a little too tall for my liking but the shorter option was too wide. It is doing what I need it to do, but I am not jumping up and down.", 
    "The item was packaged wonderfully with a full cardboard box overwrap. The foam inserts protecting the pieces were substantial and because of this, there was no damage upon arrival. The unit was fairly easy to put together as my 6 year old and I took about an hour to put it together. It is a little front heavy when both doors are open. Make sure to attach it to a wall just in case. It definitely was exactly what we needed for the location. I would buy another one if I needed it in the future. As one reviewer noted, the doors have an ever so slight bow in them. But, you really can't tell it's there.", 
    "Good buy for the money: very sturdy, strong shelves on each row of the cabinet inside which holds a good 10-12 shoes, good color finish,wood is very solid, easy to assemble w/ picture assembly illustration to follow, and best of all i received it in just less that 3 days and the price beats all the rest when it comes to shoes cabinets, I know cuz I looked around for weeks.", 
    "The package came well wrapped with bubble wrap on the outside of the box. We couldn't not find the assembly instruction sheet anywhere. My wife and I had to figure out how to assemble this ourselves that took us over 3 hrs. It would have been shorter if we had instruction sheet. The laminate film on the edge band of the top panel is bulging at a few places. Because of this, It looks really cheap when light strikes at certain angle. The European door hinges were nice looking and sturdy; they even came with the cap to cover screw heads. All three ventilation grills were impossible to attach to the pre-drilled holes on the back panel.", 
    "It's been very useful and helpful, ever since I got it I never have to look for my shoes anymore and it keeps all my shoes in a nice neat place. I also received great shipping, it arrived in just a few days and i like how it didn't take me long to assemble it. A great shoe cabinet for great affordable price.", 
    "I love my shoe cabinet! lots of room for what I need and very sturdy, and easy to set up. Plus the price is very affordable and the quality is great.", 
    "the shoe cabinet looks true to the picture. more like *** quality. it is very difficult to assemble but probably because I am not handy at all.. haha.. made a few mistakes along the way unfortunately but it is all my fault >_<", 
    "I was so satisfied that I ordered another cabinet. They both came well packaged. My two sons put the first one together and I did the second one when it came in. I would reccoment two people to help along with some of the parts. I have already received many compliments and would reccomend this cabinet to anyone.", 
    "We are very happy with this shoe cabinet.My husband wears an 11.5 shoe,Mine are size 9. We can fit three pairs across a shelf. For a total of 15 pairs of shoes. The color is a very very dark brown almost black.But I would consider this a deep dark brown.No red cocoa at all, nor is it an expresso shadeOverall it is a good product and it serves our purpose well,", 
    "Need two people to put together.. went into a little panicewhen the items list had screw for the hingles but none enclosed..Discovered they were in the package with the hinges not separate like the other things. Otherwise it tood about an hour each. Love them!", 
    "It was shipped by UPS in less than a week, about less but no more than an hour assembly, and the quality for such a low price is great! I'm able to have a nice, sturdy, and good quality shoe cabinet for my lovely shoes. Im happy!", 
    "This cabinet is nice looking, that is after you and a friend spend at least 2 hours putting it together, and it being made in China some of the screw holes had to be re-drilled. Otherwise it looks very good and feels solid if you managet the construction correctly(must Follow Included Instructions Or Else!!!)", 
    "The cabinet is great, and it matches the funiture. It is unlike any other shoe storage. I like how you can't see the shoes, they are hidden away inside of a nice piece of funiture.", 
    "Though all the dimensions are listed accurately, I was surprised to find how tall this cabinet is. It holds at least 15 pairs of shoes. I like the fact that there are vents at the back of the cabinet to keep the inside fresh. Finally our doorway is not messy anymore. Would recommend it to anyone. Thanks overstock.com!", 
    "This is a great shoe cabinet. The way our home is set up we have a door that opens right into the dining/living-room area so I hated always having shoes sitting on one of those carousel shoe racks for all to see. This has totally fixed the problem and made our living area feel elegant. I love this product!!", 
    "i like it verymuch, is a nice cabinet for all my shoes. My husband arrange everything and he said that it's a good cabinet, and easy to arrange. We also like how it fast it came to us, we needed this fast and it come to us in just 2 days,very impress with the delivery. We really enjoy the cabinet, we might buy another one for out daughter, we thinks that she would like it to.", 
    "it 's pretty sturdy and modern looking. But the cabinet is pretty tall( I didnt realize how tall it is until it arrived.", 
    "First off, I have almost zero experience assembling furniture. And I was done in less than 2 hours - no rush or anything. Second, I was very impressed by the way all the pieces, down to the smallest pin/screw were wrapped individually, so there was no way to mix them up or make a mistake. Third, the instructions were SOOO detailed (no text, but very, very good visuals), that even my 6-year old knew what to do - she was helping me put it together. Bottom line - this is not an exquisite piece of furniture, so don't expect that it would look beautiful or add to your decor. It is a cabinet after all. And it is tall, period. But it helps remove the clutter, my tiny entryway is shoe and clutter-free. I have a place where I can keep/quickly shove my mail if someone's coming so that my room looks clean and nice. It's useful. It does the job and I am happy with what I got. I will be looking for something half its size though, that looks nice to replace it as soon as I can find a suitable piece of furniture because the first thing my husband said when he came back from his business trip was \"wow, it's chunky, black and our room looks smaller because of it\".", 
    "Kinda of flimsy, looks good, I got some other pieces of furniture from Overstock and they were better quality, but, you get what you pay for with this one.", 
    "Love it love it love it! In 2-3 days it came, setting it up only took no more that 30 mins. and right away so excited to store all my shoes, and I did. Ever since I got it, no more shoes all over my room, and I can also use the top portion as my TV stand in my room and I love it. A very sturdy cabinet, and it holds up majority of my shoes, in which I love. Plus the color matches my bed frame, so it looks like it the whole set in my room. Anyways it's a good purchase on my end so I'm so glad.", 
    "Arrived in just a couple of days, I don't if there was a special on the delivery but I got mine fast with no extra charge. Assembled it in in half an hour and now all my shoes in a nice and secure place. It's in my room and you can't even tell that is a shoe cabinet. I love it, it's one of the best, and great quality from a website. I would really recommend it.", 
    "I love these shoes cabinets. I bought one for my son and one for my daughter. What a great way to keep them organized. And they dont look like shoe cabinets. Definitley brings a nice style to their rooms. Happy.........", 
    "Great shoe cabinet to have, very good quality, lots of room, and the price was even better and within my budget. Easy to assemble, and I can put it anywhere in my home because it doesn't look like a typical shoe cabinet, it's very stylish and no one would notice that is a shoe cabinet. Anyways, it's great and I love it! I would recommend this shoe cabinet to my friends, and my family.", 
    "I am very pleased with the cabinets I ordered. They are very sturdy and are more like furniture than a shoe cabinet.", 
    "Very nice and useful for all the expensive shoes that I have. Very nice color and the stye is great, it doesn't even look like those typical shoe cabinet. This is great. There was no problems in setting it up and it provides a good amount of room for the special shoes that I have. It's also very sturdy and I'm planning to order another soon so I can keep the rest of the shoes organized, and I know it will arrive fast like the first one that I purchased. i received mine in less than 4 days.", 
    "It is sturdy and good quality and takes care of the mess of shows that pile up outside. I have had it for 4 years still looks good as new.", 
    "A little hard to assemble, but attractive and very roomy. a couple dozen pairs of shoes fit comfortably. We have it by the hall closet as we ask guests to remove their shoes. Keeps the hall clear of clutter. Nice.", 
    "This was one of the few shoe cabinets that would fit my 11.5 sized shoes. It does that wonderfully and looks nice in my closet. It's not solid wood I don't think, but that's not to be expected for the priced. My only issue, and maybe it was just me, but this was very difficult to assemble. The biggest problem I think was I did it alone, having a second person would have helped a lot.", 
    "Love the shoe cabinet. Functional. Look exactly as pictured. I ordered another one.", 
    "Very functional and a good looking piece of furniture.", 
    "I finished putting this cabinet together last night and I noticed how tall this closet it. It is very room and easy to put together. It only took me about one hour to put the cabinet together.", 
    "just like the picture shows,good!", 
    "This cabinet is exactly what we needed. So easy to put together - we may order another!", 
    "I bought this cabinet for my entry area/foyer about 6 months ago, and I remain impressed with the quality and storage. It's a great piece because you can also drop keys, mail, etc. on it, and the drawer also provides extra functionality. It took a while to arrive (I think it was out of stock and was being shipped either from California or Canada), but it was worth it.", 
    "It is perfect to hide shoes that otherwise would be thrown everywhere. The item was shipped a bit chipped and two pieces missing. However, furniture pens worked wonders. Besides that, it is perfect because it fits perfectly by a doorway and is non-imposing.", 
    "we like this cabinet and it is easy to install. It is good purchase.", 
    "Well It started out as a shoe cabinet and lots of shoes do fit in it, but then I thought it was too good to use for shoes so I moved it to the office. Very fine cabinet to hold papers and other supplies.", 
    "Get lots of compliments. Unfortunately my unit came with a defective drawer missing parts (the track it slides in). Overstock was kind to send new pieces, but frankly it's too much of a bother now that it's put together. Just means I can't use the drawer. I have it propped up indide with a shoebox to keep the drawer in. The cabinet is perfect size - holds lots of soes at our entryway.", 
    "This is a nice piece of furniture. It went together easily, the instructions were clear, and it looks nice in my room. The color is a dark brown, I don't see much of a red tone. It's pretty though. It was also well wrapped, and there was no damage to the individual pieces of wood.", 
    "This is a very good looking cabinet, great for the price. Once mistake I made was in my assumption that it would be smaller. It is a substantial piece of furniture so you want to make sure it fits into your space. I decided to move it into the basement and get something smaller for the entry space because this cabinet looked too overpowering there. However, the product itself is very well-made and beautiful.", 
    "This shoe cabinet is exactly what we want. It has the right size we need and can hold lots of shoes. Our hallway looks much better. (Before we use open shelf)I give it four stars instead of 5 because of this:After we put all the pieces together, one door looks slightly higher than another. It's not a big deal but still not perfect.", 
    "The cabinet arrived quickly and was packed securely. It took two of us less than an hour to put it together. The directions were easy to follow and all parts were clearly marked. I love that I can open the doors and see all my shoes at once, and the top drawer is the perfect height for belt and accessory storage. Something I didn't consider when ordering it, but a happy accident, it's a perfect height and width for our flat screen tv to sit on for viewing from bed.", 
    "This is a great higher quality cabinet. Much nicer than those put together ones at, say Target or Walmart. Went together in about 2 hours, and I'm a 5' tall 110 lb women. Easy to follow instructions, and the tip to put together close to where the cabinet will sit was a good one. Really cleaned up my bedroom and although at first I thought it was rather drab looking, it turns out that that makes it look very clean and unobtrusive. Really like this cabinet a lot!", 
    "The shoe cabinet has been a good addition to our decor. We always had unsightly piles of shoes at the foot of the stairs. Now everyone is good at putting his shoes in the cabinet instead of messily piled on the floor. The cabinet was hard to assemble. This not something a solitary person can assemble. The directions do specify at least two persons to assemble. The directions were not clear and we had to experiment with the assembly until we got it \"right\". The backing looks like it's constructed of reinforced cardboard, so this cabinet cannot be freestanding without incurring damage. The shallow drawer at the top has been a bonus for keeping small items, like keys, handy but out of sight. The cabinet has been great for reducing clutter.", 
    "Love this product. I wish it had come assembled but, with some help from my husband and dad, it was not too bad of a process. It would definitely help to have 1 other person helping you to put this together.The quality is great. It's not too heavy of a piece.", 
    "It's composite wood but look High Quality, Easy to assemble, matched the price tag.", 
    "I was 100% satisfied especially how fast the shipping was.", 
    "Very poor instructions but I have put together many pieces of furniture like this so was not too difficult. Do not attempt if you have not done this type of thing before. I am disappointed about the gap between the two doors. No matter how much adjusting I did with them I could not make the gap go away. But, overall, it suits my purpose.", 
    "The wood was fairly solid however some of the pieces were marred. One of the door panels also had a hole at the top where you would grab to open the door. We assembled everything except putting in the shelves and realized that the doors did not align well. One was slightly higher than the other and it was crooked so that the slight gap between each door panel grew as you looked from top to bottom. Although this could have been adjusted by drilling and moving the screws of one panel, we didn't think it was worth it. Given the blemished pieces and the misalignment, we didn't put in the shelves. Instead, we took it all apart and returned it. It's unfortunate since it is the nice simple style that I like.", 
    "This item arrived damaged, so beware. The panel on the left side has several dent marks, and the front drawer panel has a 1/4 scratch. The item was packaged wonderfully, so I am not sure how it was damaged. I would assume damage occured prior to packaging. In any case, I will not display this in my home, not even in my back entry mud room. It has gone straight into our garage for outdoor toy storage.", 
    "We needed a good looking shoe cabinet, and this one looked nice enough. It came a big box (assembly required), and very well protected. It took me about 90 minutes to get it assembled. It looks very nice, but the quality is good at best (pressed wood). But at this price point what can you expect. All in all, I would by it again. But if you are looking for a high end solution, this isn't it.", 
    "Very nice and funtional product for the money. The way they packaged the product for shipping was very impressive. Very easy to put together.", 
    "I love it.. looks awesome! good material.. I just love it!", 
    "I assembled this within an hour, but i'm used to doing this, so it went very smooth, just pay attention that the face of the drawer has an angle that should face down for easy opening and the doors have an angle that should be at the top to grab and open, other than that it was great,looks good in the room and that little drawer on top is an extra storage that i olso love.", 
    "If you need stylish shoe storage, this is a nice option. I have it in my bedroom and it fits in nicely with my furniture. Definitely a recommendation if you have the room.", 
    "Nice. But bigger than advertised: almost 14\" deep, 31.5\" wide, and 49\" tall. So doesn't fit as well in the space I'd alloted as hoped. But seems sturdy and lots of space.", 
    "Love this product . Just as described. Perfect for my families needs", 
    "Love the new shoe cabinet. Looks great and works great. The item arrived and it was put together in no time. Happy with the purchase", 
    "This would look good if the doors were not warped. Since the last thing you put on is the doors you don't know it until you are done. Not worth returing so I lived with it and hid the cabinet behind a door. Would not purchase again or recommend it to a frient.", 
    "The piece is well packaged for shipping. One door was slightly warped so when both doors are closed, the don't quite line up correctly, but it is hard to tell if placed in a darker space. The actual dimensions are 14 inches deep x 31.5 inches wide x 49 inches high. If you have baseboards / molding it will not sit flush with the wall. Will probably hold more shoes than advertised. Drawer is useful for keys, wallets, etc.", 
    "We needed a way to corral the shoes that inevitably get piled up by the entryway. This has been a great solution, it is roomy, the design is nice, the color is nice. We've had it for a couple of months and it's holding up nicely. On assembly the holes didn't line up 100% but anybody with any experience of putting together furniture could piece it together without a problem.", 
    "Handsome looking shoe cabinet that looks very classy in our foyer. Surprisingly this item looks very good next to other furniture we already had (they are real-wood high end furniture so I was worried whether this cabinet will look fine close to other furniture). The quality is overall very good and no problem about opening/closing doors, and a drawer. It is a stable cabinet that stands on the floor without feeling wobbly or anything like that. I think I read some review commenting that it did not stand well on the floor so I was concerned about it but fortunately it was not the case with this piece. One thing is that this product takes some time to assemble and it is better if there are two people to built this. With two people it is not so much of a pain but I do not know how much time it will take if you try to assemble on your own! Also the backboard is made of some paper-like material so if the back of this cabinet ever gets wet with excess water (I double that will ever happen but just in case...), then the backboard may be easily damaged. That is why I rated \"Good\" instead of \"Excellent\" but I am very satisfied with this cabinet overall.", 
    "This cabinet is good value for the money. It looks good and it serves the purpose well. Assembly of the product is not too difficult, with decent instructions included.", 
    "I bought 2 of these cabinets, one for my shoes, one for my husbands and they are terrific! We are living in a small townhouse with no storage - these cabinets are a wonderful solution to store shoes - and you can see them all! An added bonus - there is a drawer as well - so we use it for our keys.", 
    "Very good product with low budget. I don't want to spend too much money with shoe cabinet and this is the one that worth every penny.", 
    "I have overall more high quality furniture, but agre with other reviewers that for the price this is much nicer than I expected. Directions are terrible. Classic Chinese made incomplete images, and I did have to flip me drawer facade, so do that piece last of all. Otherwise about 1 1/2 hours of rea Latively fun work.", 
    "I was really excited to get this cabinet. Assembly was easy with screwdriver. However, in the process of handling the piece, the edges chipped off in a few places. Also, the hardware that was preinstalled for the drawer does not align properly so the drawer hangs at an angle. I would recommend investigating in a different piece.", 
    "This Shoe Cabinet looks good but it's unstable even though it has supporting strip at back. It may be good for hardwood floor but not that great for carpeted floors.", 
    "I expected a much smaller product. This cabinet was HUGE. Please be cognizant of the area where this will be used. I had to readjust because this was not what I envisioned", 
    "Can anyone purchased this before tell me--- the back of the cabinet looks good or not? Because I am planning to use it as a room divider. Thanks in advance.", 
    "Its hard to secure the shelf from the back if you follow the direction , the hinges in the door does not fit when you install it its off measured.", 
    "This cabinet arrived with broken panels which cover the back. Also there was a hole on the right outside panel about the size of a dime. Since both of these areas are against the wall I choose to live with it. It was difficult to assemble. Looks great now, works great but will probably be in the trash in a few years.", 
    "The product was well packaged. The instruction was horrible. It had picture but no written description on how to put the cabinet together. I spent 2 hours on it and almost gave up. My husband spent another 2 hours on it. The screws won't tighten and the holes too big. It also had 2 right-side doors, the top should be angled and the bottom flat. There was also no instructions on where to get missing parts. Very disappointed. Worst put together furniture ever. If you want furniture that needs assembly, go to IKEA.", 
    "It took time to put it together and will need some knobs. I like hiding the shoes that were by our door. The only criticism is that if it is in a dark place (ours is) it is hard to see which shoes to grab. Putting white shelf paper on each shelf will be my next project.", 
    "There are too many nails, bolts and attachments. The directions were not that great, so it got very overwhelming. By step 3, I had 2 pre-drilled holes that were too large for the nails and one hole that had a splinter/skinny nail going right through the middle so the actual nail that was supposed to go in got stuck mid way. Very frustrating. I had ordered a table before which had the same issue but which I kept anyway. But this one I am definitely returning- despite the hassle. I have to take this huge box back to UPS. I had the option for a UPS home pick up within 3-5 business days, but I was told I would not get any prior notice and they could come anytime anyday. Not a good experience.", 
    "This piece is made with such low quality it can't stand on its own - it has to be bolted to the wall. Don't waste your money.", 
    "I was so excited when the shoe shelf came and just knew it would be perfect...WRONG!Note: this is the first time ever I have written a review good bad or indifferent (so what does that tell you) The assembly sucks...too many pieces, the illustrations are not easy to follow and you need at least two people to put it together. I would not recommended this for the simple fact it was too difficult to assemble. VERY DISSAPPOINTEDSincerely, Back to the drawing board search", 
    "No instructions to put together a shoe cabinet.. when contacted a service person i was told they've handle this situation before.. Meaning not the first time this is happened to someone. I now have 25 to 30 pcs of wood and hardware all over my room. The best they could do was have someone contact me by phone in 1- 2 days!!!! Really bad!!!!!!!",
