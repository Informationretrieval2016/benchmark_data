    "Great looking chair and pretty comfy. There were no assembly instructions, but straight forward enough that you could figure it out. However, some of the screw holes don't line up so great...made for a back ache after assembly. On a happy note, I did put them together solo.", 
    "Great chairs for a great price. I love the modern look and the color is very nice, just like in the picture.", 
    "Very happy with the look and how well they've held up with two toddlers and a dog in the house.", 
    "I love the chairs, but I had an issue with one arriving damaged (why I gave 4/5). However, Overstock quickly replaced the damaged chair with a new one. It was just a bit of an inconvenience. I would definitely recommend these. I bought the taupe grey color and love how it blends with my granite!", 
    "I think for the type of chair and price point they are good quality. I have only had them less than a week. I will say one negative thing is the legs on some chairs were already damaged. Also the color of the taupe chair is really a grey color. The box even states that it is grey.", 
    "I'm not sure why others have had an issue with these chairs, unless quality control has been raised since they wrote their reviews. These are great chairs for the money. The style is classic mid-century and they're \"fairly\" easy to assemble. The only issue I had was aligning some of the holes, but the metal on the legs is flexible enough that you can do so with a little effort. It's no worse than any other piece of furniture you have to assemble.The quality is quite solid for the price. But, you have to remember that you're paying less than $150 for replicas \u0097 the real deal would set you back hundreds more. So, context is important. If you're on a budget, these are great, stylish chairs.As for the chairs being small \u0097 they are. But...if you can measure, then you'd know that when you purchase, as the dimensions are clearly listed on the page. Get out your tape measure and you won't be surprised. If you need a smaller chair for whatever reason, these will work great.", 
    "I took a leap of faith when I ordered these chairs knowing that the only review was a poor one. At the time it seems only fair given that the price point is considered average/low for a replica. The chairs arrived quickly (On a side note I love the customer service and efficiency of Overstock). At first look it was definitely what I ordered. Plastic tops didn't smell like plastic which was a really good sign. The bottom part looked less like wood compared to what was on the website but that was fine as well. Putting together the pieces was one level up from Ikea and totally doable until this one hole on this one chair. It was way too small for the nail so we had to drill it bigger ourselves with less than appropriate tools. So yes, overall the chairs were good for their price, color was pretty good, but definitely little things here and there that was more DIY than necessary.", 
    "The chairs are low quality and they feel very small next to my relatively small kitchen table. I attempted to return the item through Overstock but had nothing but problems with their customer service so I am stuck with them chairs now."
