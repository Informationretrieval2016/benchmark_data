    "Love these new chairs bought them in pairs! More compliments on them so comfortable!! Highly recommend", 
    "Great size chair and so easy to put together!", 
    "A couple issues: Two of the chair legs arrived split down the middle. We also discovered that one of the screw holes wasn't threaded properly. Frankincense was also loose in areas. Bit of a disappointment... We bought this chair on the strength of its reviews. Overstock will be sending a replacement.", 
    "Fabric color as shown. Very solid chair for my office guests.", 
    "Very comfortable, easy setup, and the picture is pretty close to the exact color. It might be a little more green, but otherwise it looks the same. Great chair, glad I bought it!", 
    "We paired the Silver-Multi color chairs with the Beatnik Sofa. Great combo for that mid century look. Color pictured was very accurate. Only concern at this point, is that the fabric looks like it stretches a bit after being sat on. Not sure if it will eventually get very saggy later on."
