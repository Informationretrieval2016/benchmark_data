    "These chairs are nice. They were easy to put together. I bought them as replacement chairs for my foyer and they are smaller than I expected so will be putting them in a bedroom to sit at the end of a bed. They are a bit hard but, won't be used a lot so that's ok. They are more decorative accent pieces in my home. I wouldn't recommend them for everyday sitting.", 
    "Very comfortable. It's sits lower than the average chair but that was what I was looking for. Nice linen-like fabric.", 
    "cute. A good size for a small area. Looks durable.", 
    "This chair is a nice addition in my sitting area. I love it! I have had it about a month and so far, it's great! I love the tweed-like navy blue material and turned front legs.", 
    "We love this navy chair. Perfect for the entryway for sitting and tying shoes.", 
    "The chair is nice but it is very small and looks more like children furniture than something for an adult", 
    "My husband and I were looking for a chair for our small formal living space. The chair color is beautiful and the fabric seems durable. But there was one major problem: This chair is quite low to the ground. If it was maybe 4 inches taller, the chair would be the perfect size for a full-grown adult. I'm 5'8'' and my husband is 6'0'' and we both look awkward in this chair. We'll be returning for something bigger.", 
    "Solid chairs and great color. Also can't beat the price!", 
    "We needed a navy chair and we got one. The material is very nice. A tweed sort of blend.", 
    "Adorable chairs with beautiful fabric. I am very particular about size so they did not appear small when they arrived...however after I put them together, I finally realized some time later the back legs are positioned differently (like the holes of one pair of legs were drilled on the wrong side by mistake turning them differently than the other chair). Overstock is taking care of it by sending me another pair of legs to match one of the sets I already have. I suppose my word of advise to those ordering two matching chairs, check the back legs right away to make sure they face the same direction! Other than that, cute purchase for my front room!!", 
    "It's okay. I should of paid more attention to the measurements as the back of the chair is pretty small. I bought this for a reading chair in our bedroom but honestly it's now more for \"looks\" since it's too small for an adult to sit in. The color is true to the picture.", 
    "Really liked this chair! For the price, it is fantastic, sturdy, and very pretty.", 
    "they fit perfectly in our lobby area the material looks nice they are shorter than i thought but still comfortabel", 
    "My first order from Overstock was a gamble as this chair had no prior reviews. I was pleased and surprised at what I received for the price. It's well packaged (no messy Styrofoam pellets) good instructions for attaching the legs (that was the only assembly required) and actually looked better than in the photos. The material was a lovely tweedy indigo blue and the legs are also very nice. This is not a high end chair and if you inspect all the insides it's probably economically made. However, it's sturdy (you can sit on it!) the material is good quality, and there were no obvious flaws or issues, including with attaching the legs. I would buy this piece again!", 
    "love love love the fabric. but this chair is short. really short.", 
    "Very nice, easy to assemble", 
    "I was extremely please with this chair. The back was a bit shorter than expected but still a good buy, very stylish, and good value.", 
    "Bought these for a sitting area in my library/basement. They are very nice and get complements on them all the time. The fabric is sturdy and the color a nice deep navy.", 
    "The chairs are so much better than I was expecting given the price. The color is so beautiful! I absolutely love them. One was damaged in shipping but I HAD to have the seating for multiple Christmas parties so we fixed it ourselves with screws and wood glue. These chairs are amazing, dont miss arms at all."
